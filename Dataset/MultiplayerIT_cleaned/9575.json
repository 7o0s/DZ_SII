However, the number of fans conquered by the universe of George Lucas is so vast that any work that is part of this world, be it an animated short film, a comic or indeed a video game of dubious quality, can easily aspire to reach important numbers (even though the recent cancellation of The Force Unleashed III, perhaps due to the lack of originality between the first two episodes, seems to have slowed down this trend). The point of view in Star Wars: Imperial Academy (hereafter simply Imperial Academy) is this time that of the Stormtroopers, the white armored troops of the Empire famous for the certainly not brilliant end they usually met in fights against the Jedi heroes ; a certainly neglected department that can finally have its just revenge. Without The Force it's not the same Thanks to today's increasingly widespread access to the web, Imperial Academy presents itself as a first-person shooter entirely dedicated to online multiplayer, a courageous choice for a title intended for a mobile device, but which falls within the logic if we consider how , on an iPhone, connecting to the internet is more a necessity than a habit. With no single player campaign in the classic sense of the term (and therefore without a real plot to complete), the title immediately launches the player into the center of the action; the character creation phase is in fact very fast (in reality the soldiers are actually all the same) and is limited to the choice of weapons to use, which can be unlocked as usual in the continuation of the game. By starting the Battle, the only available fight option, it is possible to choose the Academy mode, in which to face 3 other players in the online arenas automatically thanks to the quick matchmaking, or create a personalized game by selecting the Squad mode; a sort of tutorial is represented by the fight with the Clones, off line, useful for getting used to the controls but which does not provide any experience points or bonuses for multiplayer battles. Academy, as mentioned, contains the beating heart of the game: by participating in the guerrilla warfare in the arenas, all very large and diversified, you gain experience points, necessary for upgrading your weapons and armour. In particular, it is possible to increase the values of Defense, Attack and Speed of movements, as well as making available many of the best weapons in the Star Wars universe (all obviously firearms, given the absence of the historic lightsabers for this kind of soldier). Continuing through the levels then, you will get new armor models. However, Imperial Academy is a free title: this means, for those who have a minimum of experience with this type of video game on the App Store, that they will inevitably have to deal with advertising or microtransactions. In this case, unfortunately, there are both ~alternative~ earning systems, with annoying banners that appear on the home screen and during loading, as well as the possibility of buying upgrades and weapons by spending ~vile~ money in spite of each sportsmanship. In detail, many of the weapons present have the cost indicated in two different types of currencies: the credits, obtainable for free by playing online, and the ~Key Cards~, which can instead be purchased with hard cash in packages of at least 30 key cards starting from 3 .99 euros (up to the 800 one at a cost of a good 39.90 euros); it is clear that those who are willing to spend will easily have access to the most powerful weapons right away, despite the level constraints. All weapons are in fact linked to the degree of experience acquired, so the purchase of an Arc rifle (Tier-2) for example is linked to the achievement of level 8 of experience. Each soldier has a super upgrade (called Elite Bonus Active) which increases the accumulation of experience and credits to spend by 300%, usable only once (and which is recharged approximately every 90 minutes); however, those who are willing to spend Key Cards will be able to take advantage of more bonuses, reaching the desired level first. Despite the solidity of the netcode (both in wifi and in 3G after several games we have not seen any significant episode of lag) and above average graphics thanks to the inspired level design and support for the Retina Display, Imperial Academy heavily displays the side in the woody and unintuitive control system. The left virtual stick, assigned to the movement, has in fact a too short stroke and is not very reactive; far worse, however, is the situation with regard to the management of theand weapons, which do not have a dedicated fire button. To shoot, you will therefore have to choose whether to tap your right thumb during the frenetic movements of a game or whether to rely completely on the automatic fire, the intensity of which can be set from the options menu. The solutions both appear to be very restrictive of the freedom of action and, given the certainly fascinating context, they are undoubtedly the main flaw of the game. The entire online interface, from the multiplayer to the objectives, is managed by the high-performance Plus+ platform, truly impeccable in functioning in every situation. Finally, little to say about the sound, limited to a few effects and easily ignored, thanks also to the frenzy of the action (and the attention necessary to control one's soldier).
