{"name": "Caesar 4 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/caesar-4-recensione.html", "text": "From province to empire The game modes of Caesar 4 include first of all a kind of ~career~, where you start from the small province obtaining the favor of Rome in such a way as to gradually assume greater importance within the Empire and, consequently, become the new one boss. In addition to this, we find the possibility of choosing scenarios in which to immerse yourself, taken from the previous mode or created using the appropriate editor included in the game. As mentioned above, Caesar 4 takes some elements from Sons of the Nile, especially as regards social life within the city, where we can find a real subdivision into social classes: plebeians, equites and patricians. The former obviously constitute the poorest caste, on which the most strenuous jobs such as agriculture and livestock are burdened, while the equites deal above all with the level of city culture, going to cover roles such as actors, poets and teachers. The patricians, on the other hand, are mainly involved in attending the shows, without carrying out real jobs but still covering a fundamental role for the economy: in fact, most of the taxes acquired by the governor, i.e. the one who plays Caesar 4, come from them. that these 3 classes exist without cooperating with each other is impossible, in fact Tilted Mill has concentrated many of its efforts precisely to make the economic system of the game the most advanced that has ever been seen inside a city builder: for example, everyone will need plebeians to get food, as it is only this class that is responsible for supplying the raw materials, while without equitable the whole city will become a place without culture and, above all, it will not be able to count on an efficient health system . The system just described was created in a big way, as there are over 30 kinds of raw and non-raw materials, 10 types of industries and 4 different types of markets where you can sell goods of various kinds to your citizens, without forgetting the possibility of undertaking commercial agreements with other cities: in particular moments of need for a given resource we can in fact choose to reach agreements with other governors, offering them a good that for us is in excess but which the other city needs. Tilted Mill has focused many of its efforts on making the economic system of the game the most advanced that has ever been seen within a city builder Sims or Citizens? The social system of Caesar 4 does not stop at what is described in the previous paragraph: Tilted Mill has in fact had the brilliant idea of adding to the game the possibility of manually selecting the citizens we see walking down the street, simply following their activity or paying attention to how much they will tell us, as often their sentences are composed of advice, heated criticism or, when deserved, compliments. In the same way we have the possibility to see the state of satisfaction of the inhabitants of each of the houses built, in such a way as to find out if this building can evolve, and therefore contain even a greater number of people, or is stopped due to lack of goods or resources, necessary for its inhabitants. The division of citizenship into classes also makes itself felt from this point of view: while the plebeians will in fact be satisfied with having a well nearby from which to get water and a market for goods strictly necessary for survival, equites and patricians will ask to have fountains and tanks nearby, as well as other markets where to find luxury goods or exotic goods, thus closing the industrial circle of our city, providing buyers to the industries that work the raw materials. Order and discipline Even in ancient Rome today's emergencies were the order of the day: episodes of fires and collapses are in fact around the corner for the naive player, who does not cover the entire city territory with public offices such as prefects and engineers, dedicated precisely to avoid such misfortunes. Our city will also need a tax office, through which to fleece the ~poor~ patricians. A novelty of the fourth chapter of Caesar consists in the introduction of the possibility of commanding one's own troops in the field, in addition to the presence of the army in the city's economic system described above. Precisely with regard to the latter, in order to have swords and armor to give to one's warriors (as well as the gladiators of the colosseum) it is in fact necessary to extract raw materials such as iron, which are then processed to obtain the weapons: this process can however be replaced agreements with neighboring cities as in the case of other properties. The long-awaited strategywithin the battles it unfortunately turns out to be lacking from all points of view: although surely no one expected to have anything to do with the depth of Rome: Total War, given that we are still talking about a city builder, it would have been nice to see a little more than what is present in the game, which can be summarized simply in the ability to move troops without any tactics, since the winner is practically always the army that can count on a greater number of elements, while adopting strategic devices that maybe in reality they would have led the faction in the minority to victory anyway. Given that the career mode will soon be divided into two parts, one more linked to the economy and the other to the army, the advice is to focus on the part dedicated to the social system of the city, only later dedicating yourself to wars so as not to run the risk of missing out on the most interesting part of the game. Order and discipline a failed masterpiece: this is how we feel about defining Caesar 4 3D: joys and sorrows The transition to three-dimensional graphics was certainly a must for a game with such a blazon and ambitions. Seeing the city ~live~ from above from a bird's eye view is simply spectacular, with the various citizens busy with their activities as well as the buildings, animated in an excellent way and always hardworking. However, reducing the zoom has negative notes: people walking down the street have serious gaps in terms of animations and textures, just as the activities of humans and buildings remain unrelated to each other. Another criticism concerns the game interface, which has the gift of being presented in an intuitive way, with an excellent amount of on-screen indicators, but which very often ends up invading the city area, opening one or even two submenus that often end up preventing the correct placement of buildings or whatever. In these phases the game also seems to lose the player's clicks, forcing him to an unknown number of presses of the mouse button in order to correctly complete an action: we can assure you that when these things take place they are decidedly frustrating. As far as the sound is concerned, Caesar 4 can count on a good soundtrack and a speech system that stands at decidedly good levels, both as regards the off-screen voice and the sentences that our citizens pronounce on the street at the moment. where we go to select them. Hardware requirements The game was tested on a system equipped with Intel Centrino Duo T2300, 1 GB of RAM and ATI X1600 video card. Although the details have not been set to the maximum from the beginning, the game has proved to be quite demanding in terms of resource requests, especially in the construction and panoramic view phases of the city. A system that is at least equivalent is therefore recommended for a satisfying gaming experience, also given the often short-term loading between one scenario and another. Final comment A missed masterpiece: this is how we feel like defining Caesar 4. While on the one hand we have very interesting innovations, such as the management of the entire city and military economic system and spectacular graphics (in the overall view), the other side ends up affect the final evaluation. The interface turns out to be very uncomfortable from the first moments of the game, just as the battles end up boring the player soon enough; it is also a pity to note the serious shortcomings in terms of animations when zooming on the streets of the city. However, the presence of such a complex and elegantly constructed economic system makes the game one of a kind, guaranteeing that breath of freshness that these days often ends up missing in video games, especially those that can already enjoy a good coat of arms : The efforts of the development team are therefore to be appreciated. In conclusion, we can recommend Caesar 4 to all those who think they can appreciate a city builder where the elements of construction merge with those of managing the real social system, as well as obviously the fans of the series. However, those who approached this game hearing about armies and battles had better look elsewhere. Pros Charming society management Large number of buildings Great feedback from citizens and councilors Cons Awkward interface Missing animations Lack of strategy in battles Evolution of the species Resuming a lucky brand like Caesar, 8 years after the release of the last chapter, is certainly not an easy undertaking: in such cases, the need to modernize the structures always falls on the shoulders of the programmersture of the game, without however going to irreparably distort the characteristics that have made this title one of the most successful videogame series, finding itself having to deal with a group of nostalgic enthusiasts, who make up the most extremist and intolerant fringe of the market. Fortunately, as we were already able to discover during the hands-on session, Tilted Mill are not naive, given that many of them were part of the old Impressions, but above all over the years they have been able to give us a game like Sons of the Nilo, which at the time was quite successful. Precisely from the game set in ancient Egypt, Caesar 4 takes the greatest cues of gameplay innovation, combined with 3D graphics that are now a must for any game that wants to be respected, whatever its genre.", "date": "2006-10-18", "grade": null}
