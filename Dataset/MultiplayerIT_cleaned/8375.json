Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if not a penny has to be paid. The cruel Abaddon is about to free himself from his exile, and once he returns he will only sow death and destruction in the kingdom! Only one hero can oppose such a nefarious scenario: the blond knight protagonist of Pocket Army. In his shoes we will face a very long story mode made up of increasingly complex missions, which we will have to complete first without any help, then starting to compose an army made up of simple soldiers, swordsmen, archers, wizards and so on, all controlled by the AI, who will accompany us into battle and will not fail to sacrifice their lives to defend that of their leader. The gameplay of the new freemium title developed by Pine Entertainment is very simple: you start from a map on which the various accessible missions are indicated, then you select one and go on the attack in a 2D context similar to that of many tower defenses available on the App Store, proceeding from left to right to repel the attack of enemy troops. However, the controls are action-style: you have to press on the right and left ends of the touch screen to move the knight, who will begin to slash as soon as he has an opponent within range. In the lower part of the screen there are also up to six special powers, each with a different cooldown interval, which allow us to inflict extra damage, temporarily protect our units, regenerate their energy, etc. Portable army The first fights of Pocket Army turn out to be very simple and trivial, as they play an introductory role with respect to the game mechanics. However, the opponents will gradually become stronger, more resistant and numerous, forcing us at a certain point to punctually sacrifice some units in order to prevail. If the strength of the enemy grows, it is clear that ours will have to do it too, and that is why between one mission and another it is possible to manage the protagonist and his army, spending the gold coins and rubies earned on the field to buy new swords, armor, shields and magic rings for the knight, create new units to be placed on three ~zones~ of the line and upgrade them to do more damage and withstand more blows before dying. Having reached the tenth level of experience, typical RPG elements will begin to emerge such as grinding, or the need to repeat missions to earn money, experience points and the necessary upgrades to overcome a challenge that we were not able to complete at first. What's really cool is that you can literally play for hours without ever really feeling the need to dip into your wallet and buy packs of rubies or coins. Of course, continuing for free makes it very difficult to be able to complete the deployment of the army (the second ~zone~ costs 500,000 coins, the vanguard one million coins, and usually 10,000 are earned in a mission), but with a little patience you can get everything and really enjoy it for a long time. Such a well-made gameplay and structure could only be accompanied by an up-to-date technical sector, characterized by colorful and cartoony graphics, and by a simple but effective sound accompaniment.", "date": "2012-08-11", "grade": "8.5"}
