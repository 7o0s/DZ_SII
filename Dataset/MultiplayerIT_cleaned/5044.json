With a twist, however, Nexon M has pulled this Evil Factory out of the hat, a pixel art action game decidedly far from its standards and which also proves to be very interesting for this reason. Evil Factory offers well-crafted 8-bit action, just a pity for some avoidable slip-ups (Don't) release the Kraken! First of all, credit must be given to Nexon M for having been able to create a curious setting, a rather rare commodity when it comes to mobile gaming: the protagonist of the adventure is Leo, sent to Antarctica by the International Alliance to find out what is hidden inside a Kraken bunker , an evil organization that believed itself defeated years earlier. The aim of the game is therefore to go deeper and deeper room after room, destroying all the war machines that we find in front of us and preventing the ever-present mad scientist from bringing Kraken's plans for world domination back into vogue. More than the plot itself, what is striking about Evil Factory is its innate ability to take itself very little seriously, peppering the narrative with hilarious (albeit a little invasive) dialogues that even indulge in more than a few tasty meta-referential jokes. Fortunately, the Nexon M title does not just take care of the outline, and indeed offers a respectable main course, with old-school gameplay that simultaneously gives a nod to classics such as Bomberman and Commando. As mentioned above, the game is divided into rooms, each containing one or more enemies that must be eliminated in order to access the next area: to do this, Leo has bombs available as his main weapon that must be placed on the ground and which explode after a few seconds, while the secondary tool is represented by a medium-range device capable of generating huge damage but which can only be used once during a single round. On these simple premises, the developers have been able to weave a truly remarkable canvas, thanks to a whole series of tricks that make the action on the screen always intriguing: power-ups and new weapons to unlock, enemies that are always different and with attack patterns well-defined, the mission objectives that reward those who manage to satisfy them all in one sitting and above all a very intelligent dodging system, which slows down time when the user lifts his finger from the virtual stick thus allowing him to avoid enemy shots in the best possible way . Between standard levels, bonus stages, weekly challenges and various extras, then, the contents are absolutely first-rate and guarantee a respectable longevity. In such a positive global picture, however, it is sad to note that Evil Factory lacks that level of care that separates milestones from excellent games, and which mainly manifests itself in a control system that is too little reactive to meet the needs of a gameplay that - especially in the more advanced stages - it would require far more precision. Furthermore, confirming a sad tradition that unites too many free to play games, the work of Nexon M is not exempt from sins regarding in-app purchases which from a certain point onwards become binding in order to proceed without resorting to a sustained grind: go however, it has been said that, although the application can count on all (but absolutely all) the typical gimmicks of the category, it is far from being among the worst money-eating machines currently in circulation on the various multimedia stores. Nonetheless, it would be a pity to avoid downloading Evil Factory just for these two flaws, also because the game is a little jewel both from a technical and an artistic point of view: the pixel art graphics are very pleasant and above all incredibly varied as regards the look and animations of the opponents, and even the sound makes a great impression thanks to spot-on effects and a really powerful soundtrack created ad hoc by the Finnish artist Kuabee.", "date": "2017-02-16", "grade": "8.0"}
