If not, you'll have to ~buy~ them with the points you've earned by accumulating victories on the field. And if you really don't want to get caught up in team spirit or want immediate satisfaction (a typical need that develops during salaried work), you just have to take advantage of a brand new feature dedicated to those who want to undertake PvP alone. It is an available quick battle, where you and another player will face each other, each with three Heroes at their side, in a fight based on points played on the control of a strategic area and on the repeated killing of characters from the opposing faction. The solitary art of PvP Everything that revolves around the supporting skeleton of Guild Wars is a rich and vibrant world, both in terms of the lush landscapes, made fascinating by the sandy setting and the claustrophobic gorges, and in terms of the splendor of the buildings. Nonetheless, the visual impact is affected by the inexorable passing years, but still manages to keep up with the most demanding eye thanks to the design of the new classes and the many crazy enemies created for Nightfall. Of all the chapters, it is perhaps the one that offers most of all an infinite amount of perfectly playable content even by those who love to embark on solo adventures, although the sense of immersion necessary for the story to be seriously undertaken with its characters is still missing. The night brings counsel... Once the volumes of the encyclopedias were collected, while today, the marvel of progress, the packaged Guild Wars can be gathered on the library. After all, even in the case of the Korean mmorpg we are offered the possibility of increasing our geographical and anthropological knowledge of a world in struggle, keeping the format dear to the publisher unchanged. In any case, nothing forces you to abstain from sectoral knowledge, so that even if you missed the previous episodes, you can make your debut directly thanks to Nightfall, which indeed represents the best opportunity for all newcomers interested in exploring the Guild Wars universe. If Factions represented a journey to the ancient Orient, among underwhelmed workers, ahem.. I meant among magnificent jade statues and explosive waterfalls, the third stand-alone installation by NcSoft is a rumination on the esotericism of ancient Egypt, a territory plundered in every where from the imagination of man but always fertile with new stimuli for the indomitable adventurer who hides in that organism in a state of apparent wakefulness which is the mmorpg player. The night brings counsel... Compared to the past it seems that the developers have returned to favoring more attractive content for an audience of players only, but the truth is that the extremely flexible game system and extremely rich in possibilities that Guild Wars has always opened up is well suited to needs of users that are also very different from each other. To tell the truth, veterans could also begin to feel the weight of time, having to measure themselves for the umpteenth time with a growth mechanism in relation to the unfolding of events that has been practically unchanged since the first episode: once again, in fact, it will be given to you the ability to immediately create a character ready to fight in the fierce world of PvP, although as always, embarking on the narrative-adventure represents the only way to obtain all the useful objects and runes to be able to effectively adapt the gameplay to your style of play . The night brings counsel... So let's not linger too much on the purchase screen and see what the world of Elona has in store for us, increasingly crowded with players compared to the beginning of the series. If you want advice, whether you're aiming to one day get involved in the heart of the game in PvP, i.e. the clash between guilds, or you simply want to explore all the narrative content of GW, the best thing to do is find a Guild the as soon as possible. There are many and of all types, and they will always provide you with valid players with whom to attempt the most demanding missions of the game; the alternative is to find yourself yelling in a chat in the main square every time you want to set foot outside in the deserted lands. ...money brings heroes Temporarily away from the clamor of the shields raised to protect the guilds from opposing factions, we just have to face the enemies errantnts for the lands of Elona. Also in this case we are always grappling with the backbone of GW, which is based on the selection of only eight skills among the countless available, especially now that the series boasts three chapters full of skills for any eventuality, even in the event of rain. To tell the truth, the immediacy that characterized this increasingly popular MMORPG is being somewhat lost, and even casual players will have to put a little tenacity into the construction of the builds, which often force them to retrace their steps until the nearest inhabited center, which represents the only area within which to freely modify one's character. As we will soon see, the Heroes feature, the new spearhead introduced by Nightfall, does not improve the global management of the interface, which is less and less practical in terms of inventory, but it compensates for some shortcomings that afflicted above all the more misanthropic players, those who like to wander alone in search of fortune. ...money brings heroes Speaking of skills and coordination between groups of players, we can only immediately introduce the new classes trained in the shadow of the pyramids, the Paragons and the Darvishes. Although the former may appear redundant, since they basically fight at a distance with sharp archaeological museum artifacts, they actually hide all their potential in enchantments, mostly buffs for the benefit of other group members. Although one can easily be seduced by the idea that some of these, called ~echoes~ reverberate in the true sense of the word, self-resetting on the target, it is good to consider this class as a next step compared to other simpler roles to play, speaking for inexperienced players, it understands. In fact, it seems that the enemies, among other things often splendid and curious in their features, have found a copy of the book ~The Art of War~, thus equipping themselves with that additional reasoning which allows them to choose whether to take a few timid steps to break the head to the usual healer who casts disguised as a shrub miles away. Instead, the Darvisci are far more direct in their approach, very effective front-line fighters in case of multiple enemies and well endowed with enchantments from which they in particular benefit most. Unfortunately, the good old Assassins and Ritualists cannot be combined with the new professions introduced by Nightfall, but the amount of combinations available is so high that you certainly won't miss some new hybrid. of all the chapters it is perhaps the one that offers most of all an infinite amount of content that is perfectly playable even by those who love to embark on solo adventures ...money brings heroes Having made the introductions, let's get to know the fellow-ventures better, who in the past were represented by petty mercenaries ready to follow you everywhere, while now they can mix with much more noble Heroes. Put simply, in addition to the classic NPCs with standard characteristics, you can now always have up to three Heroes in your wake, who you will unlock during the first phase of the game, by completing certain key missions closely related to the Nightfall plot. These are the well-known adventures that act as a trigger to develop the script underlying the indiscriminate massacre that you carry out in the Role Play mode. In addition to providing valuable support that is always available, Heroes lend themselves to the exact same level of customization as your character. Are you not happy? Now not only will you have to rack your brains looking for the most suitable build to win the infamous Giant Cactus (No? Was it in another game? Ok Pierpaolo I understand, you don't need to break your finger), but you will also have to take care of the slots related to the Hero on duty, putting the right weapon in his hand, decorating him with runes and increasing his statistics as desired. In short, GW has become a sort of mass online ~Gira la Moda~, where everyone gets lost in the cities selling as if we were in Marrackes. Conclusions Nightfall will also be able to re-propose gameplay substantially unchanged from the past, but it is no less fun, captivating and engaging like its predecessors. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of Guild Wars this is the best opportunity, also because the contents have reached such proportions that you will find in your hands one of the games that boasts the greatest flexibility in terms of customization. It should also be noted that no fee is required to enter the world of Elona and even players less accustomed or interested in cooperating with guilds can enjoy a large portion of the game that can be enjoyed in single player mode, including a free mode.factory bait dedicated to those who want to experience PvP without human players by their side. However, veterans will have an excellent opportunity to try their hand at challenging classes and even more varied and specific builds. Probably the series will not exceed the peak reached with Nightfall without changing its nature, also because the structure begins to creak under the dust of time; one more reason to check it out as soon as possible. Pros Huge amount of missions and extra content New intriguing and challenging classes Maintains the mix that made its gameplay famous Cons Loses part of the simplicity that made the approach immediate Long-time players risk too many dj vu The solitary art of PvP It's a bit difficult at this point to talk about the strengths of Guild Wars, because what was said in the review for the previous chapters is valid. Once again you will probably find yourself reaching the maximum possible level far from having thoroughly explored the contents dedicated to the single / cooperative mode: in particular, the idea of having to accumulate certain extra points to continue with the main storyline, pushing you to undertake the secondary missions, it may seem like a good incentive in principle, but instead it ends up exhausting even earlier the gap that separates you from the maximum reachable ceiling, beyond which you will be allowed to make the big leap into the PvP universe, always that this is what you want.", "date": "2006-11-14", "grade": null}
