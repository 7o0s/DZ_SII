The world of arcade racing games is vast and varied, ranging from games that are primarily focused on racing but adopt destructive weapons as additional gameplay elements to those that put destruction first, and Crash Club pertains to this last definition. This is the third major game by the Australian team Prettygreat, which has gained international fame above all thanks to the good Land Sliders that we reviewed a couple of years ago now, with which this title shares some characteristics, although the structure is completely different. The point here is to drive a car around a destructible environment, trying to eliminate opponents and at the same time survive as long as possible in an online multiplayer context. There are no particular rules in this regard: each single destroyed element delivers a quantity of points and in some cases tokens and other rewards necessary to access the garages and evolve your vehicle with additional customizations and weapons, as well as various upgrades. However, the biggest bonuses derive from the direct destruction of the opponents, therefore the game is mainly about this, with the collateral demolition of the scenario to increase the chaos and provide diversions between one fight and another, in an elimination game that obviously rewards, above all , the player who remains active last after the online match ends. Driving and assorted destruction are the pillars of Crash Club, a sort of automotive Fight Club Destruction first The mechanics of the clashes tend to absolutely not reward driving or firing skills, and this is perhaps the biggest flaw of Crash Club, which limits itself to offering comfortable ranged clashes through homing weapons. This means that it is not necessary to aim precisely, nor to engage in agile evasive maneuvers because in most cases the bullet reaches the target, as long as it is nearby, leaving the possibility of using the turbo at the right moment as the only strategic countermeasure to try to put as much distance as possible between us and the enemy. Although this perhaps represents a necessary solution to keep the pace of the game high and allow for possible management of the online extended to dozens of players on a single map, the simplification appears a bit excessive. On the other hand, that chaos is considered a basic element is also evident from the fact of being able to reverse the situation at any time by taking refuge inside the various garages scattered around the map: as soon as things go badly, it is possible to head inside of a ~Stop and Go~ center where, for the cost of a token, we find safe shelter with the possibility of eliminating the damage suffered and upgrading the car, to then return to the track again completely regenerated and perhaps even boosted. All this translates into even very prolonged clashes, where the loopholes are too close at hand for everyone (the garages are numerous and well located for the maps, without a capacity limit). The main element of tactical management then becomes the numbered number of rounds available for each weapon, even if the Stop and Go trick can also alleviate this difficulty. Despite these dubious elements, and perhaps partly thanks to these, Crash Club is a title that can be played in an amused and peaceful way, thanks to the colorful and pleasant representation typical of Prettygreat productions and a really well done control system.", "date": "2017-05-18", "grade": "6.5"}
