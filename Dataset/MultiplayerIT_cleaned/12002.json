{"name": "Might and Magic II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/might-and-magic-ii.html", "text": "An obvious sequel to a successful product released in 2004, Might and Magic II puts the user in the role of the heroic warrior Louis, determined to save the kingdom of Erathia from a dark threat. Having abandoned the isometric view, the game is configured as an action-RPG, therefore more similar to a Zelda rather than a Final Fantasy: our hero moves freely on the screen, attacking enemies with the 5 key and casting spells and using objects using respectively of keys 1 and 3. While suffering a bit from the limitations of mobile phones in terms of the control system, Might and Magic II plays quite well, but it is in its content offering that the Gameloft production reveals its best qualities. The adventure is in fact made up of 19 extensive levels, full of quests, sub-quests, NPCs to interact with, treasures to discover, settings to visit and shops to restock. Not only that: the attacks (both physical and magical) of the brave Louis are enhanced with level-ups, enriching the offensive capabilities of our hero with combos, charged shots, fireballs and so on and so forth. A truly impressive amount for a mobile game, which however does not weigh on the ~light~ pace of the game and does not even affect the ease of use of the product. Merit of a simple but complete play structure (moreover well illustrated by the appropriate tutorials) and also of a very spot on menu and HUD design, not at all heavy and at the same time equipped with all the necessary information and statistics. Might and Magic II is therefore a decidedly engaging action-RPG, and it certainly doesn't hurt that the story is compelling, well narrated and supported by an impressive number of lines of dialogue, all elements often overlooked by similar titles. Absolutely convincing from a gameplay point of view, Might and Magic II is also convincing from a graphic point of view: the game boasts a very accurate and detailed two-dimensional cosmetics, with a perfect use of colors, animations up to par and a good variety and complexity of the scenarios. On the other hand, the sound - rather limited - and the duration of the uploads, notable even on more advanced devices, are less exciting. PRO An action-RPG with all the trappings Excellent graphic design Engaging and immediate at the same time AGAINST Long annoying music Not suitable for short gaming sessions", "date": "2007-09-16", "grade": "S.V."}
