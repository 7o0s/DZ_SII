{"name": "L'uomo delle stelle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182318-full-of-stars-luomo-delle-stelle.html", "text": "A space pilot usually dedicated to commercial routes is hired for a somewhat particular assignment: to recover some tourists on an interstellar station. The journey goes smoothly, but upon returning the crew has a bitter surprise: the planet where they were headed has been destroyed by a hostile alien fleet, the first act of a war destined to upset the entire galaxy. Determined to save our skins and as many lives as possible, we head to a nearby destination but the journey will get more and more complicated. The initial sequences of Full of Stars are stylistically reminiscent of the classic Flashback by Delphine Software, and it is precisely that kind of atmosphere that the ATGames title tries to create from the beginning, increasing the degree of involvement for a plot that gradually becomes more intricate and full of twists. Where will we choose to go? Who will we find waiting for us? Will we be ready to sacrifice crew members to survive in case of trouble? Will we opt for the more complicated routes or the apparently simpler ones? Questions that we will necessarily have to answer, in the context of a fairly long and very demanding campaign, given the endless nature of the gameplay and the concrete possibility of incurring game over with every small mistake. Full of Stars is a great title: immediate, challenging and very inspired from a narrative point of view Interstellar From a structural point of view Full of Stars is actually a rather simple game: the narrated phases, strictly textual, are held together by the actual in-game sequences, which draw liberally from the genre of vertical scrolling endless runners . We will therefore see our spacecraft in the center of the screen and we will have to act on the sides of the display to make it change trajectory, with a view to an inertial system that will always bring the vehicle back to the center and which will therefore force us to calculate times and speeds in order to avoid any collision. Ending up against a space rock, a moon or debris will cost us dearly: we will be able to continue the journey by engaging in watching an advertising film at the end of the race, or use part of the hard currency, but at a certain point we will have to give up and go back to the interlude. There conditions will be imposed and we will have to make heavy choices, which involve the sacrifice of a part of the crew or even here the use of hard currency, or even a ~roll of the dice~ which could have disastrous results. If we're lucky enough, we'll be able to start the journey exactly where we left off, using each new attempt one of the three cells that make up the traditional ~action energy~ and which recharge by one unit every nine minutes... .unless you decide to reach for your wallet. Fortunately, the points collected along the way allow you to unlock some power-ups that make life easier, such as an impulse that pulverizes the rocks when the impact seems inevitable or a faster recharge of the boost, which once activated allows you to cover a certain distance without worrying about dodging obstacles, since it is a real space leap. The system, despite all its limitations and the inevitable frustration linked to a game over always around the corner, holds up well and involves, also thanks to the excellent dynamic soundtrack, which changes rhythm depending on the situation, and to the aforementioned adventure component.", "date": "2017-04-20", "grade": "8.0"}
