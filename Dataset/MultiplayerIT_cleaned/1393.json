{"name": "London Racer World Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/london-racer-world-challenge.html", "text": "Choose a league! The game modes are the classics of any other arcade production: the Championship, where you have to face a series of races around the world; the Corsa Veloce in which you can immediately jump on the track; finally the Time Trial to race against time. In the first, which is the backbone of the game, you will have to compete in a series of leagues against other opponents, trying to earn a certain position at the end of the competitions. Victory provides for the unlocking of new cars (for a total of 23 models) and tracks that can then also be used in the Corsa Veloce. The races against the computer drivers turn out to be a bit tricky at the start, above all because of the unfortunate choice of views, one outside from behind the car and one inside at the height of the bumper (the latter being absolutely unplayable due to the poor visibility and the continuous shaking of the car). The first is much better, even if the position of the camera makes it difficult to see the road, especially in curves, thus increasing the possibility of accidents. The lack of on-screen information on the race is also a pity: no map or information on the opponents; the rear view mirror is then sketchy. If we add to this the physics of the cars, practically the same for all models (only the speed changes) and the lack of a handbrake (which would have increased the fun in tackling the curves) we immediately understand that the game doesn't shine for gimmicks originals. The only real innovation is the introduction of two bonuses in the race, the Nitro Turbo Boost and the Repairs. The first allows you to incredibly increase the speed of the car, however, making it difficult to control; the second system is the damage reported in the race (both indicated by two colored ladders) which, if they reach the limit, lead to the breakdown of the vehicle. As for the intelligence of the opponents, one cannot cry out for a miracle since they often make mistakes even if they prove combative. However, the continuous gain of Nitro, placed in more or less accessible positions, allows a huge gap from the competitors, with the result of running, most of the time, alone to the finish line. Anti-Aliasing Mon Amour The graphics of the game fluctuate, on the one hand we find fairly well made tracks, with merit to the sought-after resemblance to the reality of the various cities (there are 16, including London, New York, Miami, Paris) all in all quite diversified between They. On the other we have the bad realization of some cars, even inferior to those of past productions. Too bad because the variety of environments is good, with the possibility of competing in four times of the day including the night. Also interesting is the addition of obstacles of various types (tables, trees, work in progress) and small details, such as flocks of birds. Beep! Beep! The sound is equally plagued by ups and downs: the motors make a terrible noise, like a soundproof blender, and they all look alike. The accidents are also absurd, with a nice bang against objects but total silence if you hit other cars. A gem is brought by the soundtrack whose songs are heard during the races: in fact, a radio has been inserted for each city with a lot of deejays and various pieces, mainly techno-dance but still catchy. LAN, TCP/IP not available For multiplayer, the possibilities are reduced to a split-screen challenge with a friend, a mode that still manages to entertain even for the raiding of bonuses during the race. You will try to ram and stay ahead in order to earn Nitro and Repairs before your opponent! In addition, the little freedom of choosing the route, with some shortcuts and ramps helps to give enthusiasm to the challenge. Final comment Ultimately London Racer World Challenge is an enjoyable game as long as you don't expect who knows what graphics or simulation aspect. Although it is not free from major defects, the budget price and the fun multiplayer mode make it ideal for spending pleasant half hours both alone (you will try to win all the tracks and cars) and in company, offering an almost disarming simplicity of play. Pros: Budget price Immediate playability Variety of environments Cons: Poor visuals Low-poly cars Uncompetitive championship mode 12 As we know, the world of arcade car games does not include many titles on PCs and here is that Davilex, already creator of the Supercar game, offers us a new chapter in the London Racer series, which has enjoyed some success abroad. The package is offered at an attractive price (19.90), much lower than the productionstoday, but will it be enough to entice you to buy?", "date": "2004-02-12", "grade": null}
