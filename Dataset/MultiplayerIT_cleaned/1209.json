To all those who want a bit of fun without thinking too much, other than killing criminals and passers-by like flies (remember Carmageddon?). It's good to replace a coffee break and to kill time. It's fine for a few hours to have a laugh. However, perhaps he will not be your adventure companion for a long time, as there are several titles that can stand up to Torrente. But it is certain that, although it is certainly not an award-winning title, anyone would spend a few quarters of an hour punching holes in the back of a criminal, otherwise Max Payne would not even exist... Pros: 60 levels Lots of people to kill , if you are a serial killer maybe you like It's trash, some people like trash don't they? Cons: Underwhelming graphics. Outdated gameplay Old style or poor style? As far as the graphic apparatus and the realization are concerned, we cannot circumvent the precarious situation in which this product finds itself. Although it is always appropriate to judge a game not only by its appearance (read ~graphics~) but also by its contents (read ~gameplay~, ~originality~ and ~playability~), the situation regarding Torrente cannot go unnoticed. The quality of the reproductions of buildings and objects in the city, without forgetting that of the characters, is rather mediocre. And we are not just talking about the number of polygons, but about the invoice itself, both in terms of texture and proportions. Poor, gaunt and rigid, this is how the graphic sector of this title appears. However, the presentation is remarkable, in which Torrente is portrayed immersed up to his shoulders in the animated waters of an adult film Jacuzzi Old style or poor style? The sky is bare, the cars on the street extremely squared, the bodies of the characters (with the exception of Torrente) are reduced to the minimum wage to be defined as ~human in shape~ and for this reason they sometimes appear disproportionate, almost caricatured. Everything appears flat and without depth, almost all of the shadows are defined by the textures themselves and not by the number of protrusions (almost non-existent) of the 3D models. However, the presentation is remarkable, in which Torrente is portrayed immersed up to his shoulders in the animated waters of an adult film Jacuzzi, from which (at crotch height) a brunette emerges, all intent on who knows what underwater manoeuvres; a touch of class needless to say! Torrente's personality also often emerges during the shootings, when the dubious policeman indulges in vulgarity of all kinds (ranging from racism to simple insults). Finally, one thing to note is the choice made for the Italian localization. Torrente, who is a Spanish character, has been dubbed with a strong Neapolitan accent. Immediate, perhaps too much The extreme immediacy of the game, which without any pretension is shown in all its simplicity, does not abandon the player in all sixty levels, not even to give a hint of effervescence to the story or to give a greater degree of complexity by adding objectives for a moment more intense. The decidedly arcade imprint of the game is underlined by the numerous ~power ups~ arranged along the way Immediate, perhaps too much Instead the player is almost always faced with missions of the type, reach this point of the map and survive, which almost always means you survive at the expense of others, killing and destroying everything that moves (including the unaware and innocent old ladies who will cross the path of the policeman). The decidedly arcade imprint of the game is underlined by the numerous ~power ups~ arranged along the way, which guarantee increases in energy and a constant supply of ammunition (in fact Torrente can take advantage of different types of weapon, which can be collected during fire with the criminals and reused by the policeman himself). Shooting wildly Moral aside (because this title exudes very little moral), on with the classic question, that is, what does this game have to offer a potential buyer? Torrente has its roots in a vase infested with far too many weeds, namely that of third-person shooters, without however being able to stand out for its ability to enrich this genre. In fact, the character runs with the gun in his hand in an environment made up mostly of wide streets, buildings and cars that run at full speed, where the criminals mix equally with the innocent population (i.e. the people who should be protected from the wicked actions of the detective). At every street corner, on the sidewalks, and behind the curtains of apparently less threatening houses, hundreds of gangsters are hiding intent on puncturing the fat behinds of TorrentAnd. It goes without saying that the only reaction of our ~hero~ will be to react with the same violence to the blows of the enemies, blowing heads left and right. Realism is reduced to a minimum, as in any arcade: this can be easily understood by noting the completely unbalanced relationship between the shots needed to knock down an enemy, two or three at most, and the protagonist's titanic resistance to bullets. Fat is beautiful? You have not met Torrente. It's fat, which wouldn't even be a bad thing if it weren't also greasy, and coarse, and probably smelly too. In summary he is the most disgusting man you have ever met. Racist, womanizer, sexist, violent. Clue. He has a holster, and a pistol. Easy you say. He is the most repulsive criminal in the world. But no, he has a badge, and he's a cop. Certainly corrupt, but still a public safety official, one of those who should communicate peace and order just by seeing him. His name is Torrente, and he is the anti-hero protagonist of this Action Shooter, as well as of a well-known television series that is very popular in the Iberian peninsula. Through 60 levels set in a Madrid more fiery than ever, anyone who has enough courage to step into the role of the ramshackle guardian of the law will have to deal with a very large group of criminals and drug dealers intent on doing everything to hinder the plans of justice. torrent trash In conclusion, Torrente certainly cannot be defined as a high-class product, and it is really difficult to place it high in the preference rankings, in any category. However, it is clear that one would have to be Spanish, or at least a fan of the television series to grasp its gross nuances and perhaps fully enjoy its veracity. For example, if we had found a Tomas Milian instead of Torrente, I bet we'd be here talking about a national case. Because in fact, what is it that matters in these cases? The triumph of trash, which to be honest is already a contradiction in terms. If we want to put it in this sense, then Torrente saves himself for a corner. So long live trash, and why not push some Italian software house to give a (digital) body to some Italian antiheroes? I already see myself checking out a Rag. Fantozzi, all intent on dodging vases that fall from window sills and incautiously opened manhole covers, to escape from the clutches of the Mega Director to end up in the arms of his beloved, and never enjoyed, Miss Silvani.", "date": "2004-09-21", "grade": null}
