Two years later, here is a further interpretation of the series, even more refined and convincing, which will not fail to delight vertical scrolling shoot'em-up fans. The structure of Sky Force Reloaded remains unchanged compared to 2014, with a campaign consisting of eight missions that must be unlocked one by one through an achievement system that asks not only to complete the stages, but also to do so by rescuing all the people scattered around the map, eliminating 70% to 100% of enemies, and finally getting to the end of the course without taking any damage. A setting that produces a very high degree of replayability, so much so that once all the objectives of a mission have been achieved, it is even possible to face it again with a higher degree of difficulty and aim for another four stars useful for general progression. The system is supported by the same solid gameplay that we had appreciated in Sky Force 2014, and which offers a huge number of enemy vehicles, all with different characteristics and attack patterns, and spectacular bosses, together with a touch control system particularly precise and responsive, with two variants: one solution that follows our finger on the screen and another that does it in a ~relative~ way, thus allowing us to place our finger in a different area of the display so as not to cover the spacecraft. Sky Force Reloaded hits the mark again, proposing a formula that shows no signs of getting old Reloaded! Sky Force Reloaded is a freemium product and can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, but the limitations with respect to the use of the experience are very few: the roster of spacecrafts that can be used consecutively has ten units, while by viewing the advertising films you get extra stars or other bonuses, such as components to unlock new ships or disposable upgrades. The upgrades are essential to be able to continue in the campaign, given that as you progress through the levels the enemies become more tough and dangerous. You can upgrade the aircraft's energy, main cannon, twin cannon on the wings (really effective), homing missile, energy shield, smart bomb and super powerful central laser, although the last three require a ~ recharge~ which costs additional stars. You can play without spending money or decide to invest a sum, even a modest one, for the purchase of a package of stars that allows you to face the first missions more easily, obtaining equipment that is already of a moderate level which can then be further improved . Of course, there is no doubt that the achievement system can produce episodes of frustration when you miss an opponent by a whisker (playing the goal of 100% eliminated enemies) or suffer damage at the last moment, but the relative brevity of the levels tends to fade these sensations to immediately get back on track and give it another try. From a technical point of view, an excellent job has been done, thanks to elegant, clean and stylish graphics, characterized by excellent color choices and great fluidity, even in the most agitated situations. The sound accompaniment is adequate, with some fairly engaging songs.", "date": "2016-06-06", "grade": "8.5"}
