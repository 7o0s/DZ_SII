{"name": "Call of Duty: La Grande Offensiva", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-la-grande-offensiva.html", "text": "For life and for death The greatest historical event of the 20th century, once anesthetized and made into a simple epic epic, becomes excellent playful material. The imitation of an imitation in this case makes the Activision product superior to the original sources, allowing us to ~feel~ (figuratively, obviously) the battlefield. The gameplay of Call of Duty was so refined that in some cases it was possible to forget that you were in front of a video game to participate ~emotionally~ in the action. Could this be why many were waiting for La Grande Offensiva (the first official COD expansion) much more eagerly than other completely new and original titles (new and original titles do they still make them?)? The task for the developers must not have been easy, but the end result is one of the best expansions ever made for a video game, worthy of standing next to the original for the quantity and quality of stuff it contains. Obviously we will find ourselves again grappling with some of the most important battles of the Second World War. As in The Hour of Heroes we will not follow the exploits of a single solitary soldier throughout the game but we will have to face three different campaigns (one for the Russians, one for the British and one for the United States) divided in turn into various sub-missions . One of the first elements that catches the eye when playing the single player mode is the different conception of the levels compared to the past: most of these will be set during the battles, significantly reducing those set in a more traditional way. This choice is probably due to the feedback of the players who have always been enthusiastic about being able to take part in large mass battles (since the days of the first Medal of Honor for PC) rather than having to move in narrow corridors. For life and for death The result is at least adrenaline-pumping starting from the first campaign (Bastogne) in which the Nazis who are advancing menacingly and, above all, numerous, will have to be rejected. Jumping from one trench to another in a desperate attempt to stop yet another wave of German soldiers, being careful not to get hit by their bullets, can be an extremely engaging experience. Being faced with a tank holding only a machine gun is an equally exciting situation. In fact, in The Great Offensive it doesn't take much to advance and shoot wildly. This tactic, in most cases, leads to certain death. The intoxicating reflection of the greasepaint on the face Gray Matter Studios have tried in every way to offer the player the widest possible range of game situations. Thus we will face a sequence in which we will be on board an airplane and we will have to shoot down the Luftwaffe fighters with machine gun shots; another in which we will be aboard a jeep and we will have to shoot the various enemies that will come under; yet another in which we will drive a nice tank etc. Someone will notice that what has just been described are all situations already seen and that there is not much really new. Honestly, it is difficult to expect more from an expansion. The Great Offensive fully fulfills its main task: to expand the experience of the original Call of Duty without however making it regret and without extracting ~inappropriate~ elements from the cylinder that would risk ~distorting~ it. A precise reflection on the strengths of the military FPS genre has instead led to dilating the right elements by creating a product with a broad scope and indisputable value, even better than stand-alone FPS. Let's also add the multiplayer mode (made up of 11 new maps) in which two vehicles are introduced, which attempts, as already happened in the single player, to modify the original gameplay for the better by presenting decidedly vast maps compared to the standard we were used to, combined with elements that seem to come directly from the Battlefield series (some new game modes) and which give a remarkable variety to the whole. Temporis Unfortunately, La Grande Offensiva has some flaws. Firstly the single player mode is really short. Very intense, please, but short. It will only take a handful of hours to finish the three campaigns, also by virtue of a general difficulty that is not exactly very high (and a little unbalanced in certain levels). the lack of narrative unity makes the relationship with the characters a bit cold Temporis Secondly, the same defect that characterized the first episode (which for many may not be such but, rather, a virtue) must be mentioned: the lack of a narrative unity which makes the relationship with the characters a little cold. Finally it is not possible to ignore the graphics engineor which, however masterfully used, shows all its years, especially when compared with the latest sacred monsters released in recent months. For heaven's sake, it's not a castrating defect and for many it won't even be a defect. Consider it more of a fussy annotation. Final comment The Big Push is more than just an expansion. If you are a fan of the original Call of Duty, the time has come to dust it off and throw yourself screaming into the new battles. If you're not a fan, it's time you became one as you can't ignore the quality of this game. Keep in mind though that it requires the original Call of Duty to run. Pros: Addictive Call of Duty to the nth degree Hollywood shakes Cons: Short singleplayer campaign Fairly easy Snipers still rampant in multiplayer The rules of the game Commonly, those who have played Call of Duty: Hours of Heroes have commented in amazement on how the different battles have been reproduced during the game, enhancing their realism and absolutely plausible atmosphere and citing, above all, the moments of the game more spectacular. However, how does an average player get an idea, even a vague one, of the reality of those battles, we are not told. In fact, even if you arm yourself with substantial history books, you would not be able to intuit the ~emotions~ that you experience on the battlefield. Terror, excitement, dismay are all words that we misappropriate by trying to give them a meaning similar to what those who have lived would give them. The truth is that only a few over eighty years old can say: ~I was there~ and therefore can remember (perhaps in a very confused way) the unfolding of those events. Yet who could ever say that the amazement shown by gamers in front of the Activision title was fake? Some wise men have claimed that the realism of Call of Duty is not realism but only a connection with the imagination of the public formed in doses of Hollywood war films Perhaps never as in this case was the amazement ~sincere~ and certainly did not depend on the technique, already widely outclassed (we are talking about the Quake 3 graphics engine). Some wise men have claimed that the realism of Call of Duty is not realism but is only related to the imagination of the public formed in doses of Hollywood war films (Saving Private Ryan and The Enemy at the Gates above all). The developers, looking for a way to involve the public as much as possible, have worked obsessively on the scripts that move the ~scenographies~ of the battles, creating a series of exciting situations because they are recognizable. Everything around us seemed to explode, the war seemed to rage fierce and threatening making the survival of our character precarious. Opponents and companions seemed to move in a kind of concert where nothing was left to chance and served to deliver us into the hands of the playful illusion. We were only required to possess the above imagery (easy, we all feed, more or less, on the same mass culture) and to accept the fact that, reloading a save after dying, all the events would occurred in the same way.", "date": "2004-11-03", "grade": null}
