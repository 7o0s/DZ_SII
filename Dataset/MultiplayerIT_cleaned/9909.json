We are talking about those titles framed from a top view, in which two virtual sticks placed in the lower corners of the screen are used to move the character and direct the fire of the weapon: let's see, therefore, if this Pirate's Treasure performs its task well. Harrrr! The Polish developers have not particularly racked their brains as regards the presentation of their work: without even a hint of something that could resemble a plot, Pirate's Treasure simply puts the player in the role of a pirate dedicated to collecting of treasures in the scenery of an island lost in the middle of the sea. The user's task will therefore be to face a series of 50 levels divided between six settings, killing enemies and collecting gold coins, all obviously trying not to get killed. If the gameplay actually smacks of ~already seen~, it is in the execution of the whole that GameLab has proved to be more attentive than its other colleagues, providing the product with a structure that provides a minimum of incentives and variety in the progression. To begin with, each stage is subject to specific objectives to be met (eliminate a certain number of enemies, obtain a certain score, survive for a certain time limit or a combination of several factors), and at the end of the levels you are rewarded with indispensable keys to unlock the next challenges. Furthermore, the gold coins that randomly appear within the scenarios can be spent to improve four distinct characteristics of the protagonist: movement speed, rate of fire, luck - essential to allow some power ups to come to the rescue from time to time. much- and power of the special ability to transform into a kraken, in fact a sort of smart bomb that can be activated after having piled up a few corpses. This splash of RPG elements is undoubtedly interesting, a pity that the balance is not as interesting, given that more or less in the middle of the adventure it is likely that all one's statistics are already at their maximum, removing some interest from the progression in the game. In terms of actual gameplay, Pirate's Treasure doesn't add anything really new to the genre, but it behaves excellently, without lending itself to any particular flaw. The arenas in which the clashes take place are closed spaces, but precious on-screen indicators inform the user of the presence of enemies outside the field of vision, limiting the frustration of the phantom attacks from behind; moreover, there is a good variety regarding the opponents, who differ in shape, speed and resistance to blows. Like all twin-stick shooters released on the iPhone, however, Pirate's Treasure ends up becoming repetitive in the long run: the different objectives and a handful of boss fights are of little use, given that at the end of the day it's always about moving and shooting . An extra gear of the GameLab title, however, is represented by the technical realization, undoubtedly of a good level: although the bird's eye view sacrifices the spectacular a bit, the graphics boast convincing polygonal models with good animations, and a wise use of colors and visual effects. The sound is also of decent quality, although in the long run it too ends up a bit boring, given the recurrence of that handful of effects and music.
