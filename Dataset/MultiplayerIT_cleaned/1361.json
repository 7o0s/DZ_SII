{"name": "Deus Ex Invisible War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deus-ex-invisible-war-3.html", "text": "What awaits us is a bleak future With the Ion Storm game we will be catapulted into the future, but it will seem to be almost in another dimension, the cyberpunk atmosphere that permeates the game is so amazing. If this is what awaits us it will be really tough. Technology at the service of man has become a predominant part in the life of each of the inhabitants of our planet, mechanical drones carry out the most disparate jobs and ordinary people are increasingly unaware of how things go. We are about twenty years after the events narrated in the first episode, JC Denton is no longer the protagonist, but we anticipate that we will meet him again. A devastating attack in Chicago (unfortunately the future does not seem very different from the present) is the prologue to Deus ex Invisible War and immediately after the Tarsus Academy, which deals with the training of young special agents, including Alex D our character, is also attacked and we discover that ours was constantly spied on, as if we were in the Big Brother house, by a large team of scientists. Why was our virtual alter ego spied on? Are the scientists we trusted until now telling the truth? This is just the beginning of a particularly complex, but truly intriguing and rarely so well-crafted plot in a video game. The impact with the game is devastating, sometimes disorienting, but certainly engaging. We will find ourselves in a perfectly recreated world, totally different from how we know it and with the need to interact with the many characters surrounding Alex. This interaction, fortunately facilitated by the translation of the English dialogues into Italian, proves to be fundamental and capable of clearly directing our path; yes because in many dialogues we will be able to choose, among some sentences proposed by the game, the best way to respond to the interlocutor on duty. Our choices will profoundly affect our path and it will therefore be essential to act with caution, if only at the beginning of the story. The whole game will see us come into contact with many subjects, from the most shady to the most unexpected and it will be up to us to understand who we can trust and above all which side to take. With Tarsus and Leila Nassif? With The Order? With the Templars? With the WTO? As in reality, we have to look for the truth and only towards the end of the game will the plot unravel, however leaving some questions open. The freedom to act as we want and to do what we prefer is the real highlight of Deus Ex Invisible War, there is, in fact, no pre-established order to carry out the missions and we will be able to choose how to act at every moment of our adventure . This freedom is certainly a bit unsettling for the novice player, but it will be able to give great satisfaction and will fuel the desire to replay the title (also enticed by as many as four different endings), to make different choices, in the more experienced players. If each new goal can be reached in three or four different ways, thus giving a lot of satisfaction to the player's obstacle-jumping ideas, we sincerely expected more from the A.I. of non-player characters: in such a well-kept context and in which everything is left to our choices it would have been nice if even the NPCs had enjoyed greater freedom and autonomy, unfortunately this is not the case, so as to be little more than simple dummies. Alex D? isn't that D for Drastic? As mentioned, we will step into the shoes of Alex D (the meaning of the D will be revealed during the game) a young special agent, genetically modified and with various cybernetic implants that allow him to enhance his body beyond normal human capabilities. We will experience the Ion Storm title in first person and manage everything via a HUD (Head Up Display) interface which will give us all the necessary information from time to time and which will allow us to switch from Alex's inventory to his upgrades. This system is particularly effective, overlapping each screen, never annoying the player, allowing us to have full control of the protagonist, the map and the objectives. Of course, to work quickly it is necessary to master all the keys of the joypad, which is a bit challenging. In this continuation, yes we recall that it is a sequel but in reality it is very playable even by those who have not previously come into contact with the universe created by Warren Spector, the RPG elements have practically disappeared: Alex D is not customizable, the only choice given to us is to impersonate a man or a woman. The rest of the changes concern only the biomods, the upgrades in fact. We will have the opportunity to inincrease our skills by choosing between six skills that will contain three specialties for each group, for a total of 15. Each biomod can be upgraded for three levels and will allow us to obtain skills such as interfacing with electronic equipment, making ourselves invisible to people and surveillance drones, regenerating our fabrics, seeing in the dark, just to name a few. An interesting component has also been added such as the possibility of obtaining untested and unstable biomods on the black market which certainly offer us advantages, but also bring with them the risk of some malfunctions, which could create various problems for us according to the developers ( actually in our test they never occurred). The skills allow us to approach the game very directly and aimed at clashes or careful and measured, like real secret agents. Rumor has it that it is possible to finish the game without firing a shot, but we didn't succeed, and after a very stealth approach we threw ourselves headlong into the action. Biomods give us the opportunity to exploit many skills, but unfortunately many of them we will use very little, on the contrary the title of Ion Storm will give a lot of satisfaction to lovers of arsenals, given that there are many weapons in the game to use and upgrade. Sci-Fi Hi-Tech Ehhh?? The technical sector of Deus Ex Invisible War shines with its own light. Very detailed three-dimensional environments with which it is possible to interact frame a world carefully recreated in every aspect. Freedom of movement, the game's real strength, will allow us to explore all the environments making us astounded by the care taken by the developers. Too bad they have not managed to better optimize the game engine which falls into some uncertainties, producing some drop in frame rate which however does not affect the quality of the technical sector. Another sore point, which this time affects the enjoyment of the game, are the frequent uploads which, in each passage from one area to another, last about thirty seconds, tremendously breaking up the immersion in the game. The lighting effects in real time are a feast for the eyes and the most beautiful seen so far (but we are waiting for Pandora Tomorrow), the physics of the bodies is exceptional and is decidedly realistic. Slamming against a box and letting it fall or lifting a corpse and then letting it go to see it move in a very credible way is truly a satisfaction. Too bad that such a great interaction and use of realistic-physics of bodies has not been exploited properly, in the sense that among all the objects that we will be able to lift, move and throw very few, if not none, will prove to be useful. To conclude the technical analysis, it is also right to point out the goodness of the polygonal models which appear to be very well-finished like the rest of the settings, for which the only possible complaint, but it is really nitpicking, is the size: more that for the metropolis it will seem like going around villages given their small size. The sound sector is adequate as well as the acting in English and the adaptation of the texts in Italian. Fortunately, there was at least partial localization, otherwise the understanding of a complex plot like that of Deus Ex Invisible War would have failed for many users. Comment Deus Ex Invisible War, I think you get it, we liked it. Some small technical gaps and the not exactly immediate approach do not make it one of the absolute masterpieces, but it is fair to say that the developers' work has been more than good and the title in question is able to guarantee several hours of pure fun , creating in the player the desire to find out how Alex D's story will end. Perhaps a step back from the prequel, but certainly the line up of the Microsoft console is enriched with a new excellent adventure. We remind you of the Complete Walkthrough of Deus Ex: Invisible Wars. Pros: Very nice plot and atmosphere Freedom and more freedom Good game engine Cons: with too many gaps Very few Rpg elements A.I. of enemies careless March is confirmed as a month of adventures: in a few days we will be able to get our hands on the sequel to Splinter Cell and for a few weeks now every Xbox user can while away the wait, solving puzzles and foiling conspiracies, with the sequel to Deus Ex, renamed for the occasion : Invisible War. If the future doesn't scare you, William Gibson's books are your bread and butter and adore fmovies like Johnny Mnemonic, Matrix and Minority Report then you have found the right title for you.", "date": "2004-03-24", "grade": null}
