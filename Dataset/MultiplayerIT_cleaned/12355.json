{"name": "Death's Door", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deaths-door-recensione.html", "text": "Six years after the excellent debut with Titan Souls, which impressed us favorably in the review, the development studio Acid Nerve returns with Death's Door, a very inspired action RPG, set in what we could define a world suspended between that of the living and of the dead. Here, in the Hall of Doors, live and work ravens whose job, as the name suggests, is to recover the souls that are assigned to them. Beyond the symbolic choice, why is it up to them to carry out a task that would be up to Death? This is just one of the mysteries that punctuate our journey as a little crow, who is assigned the task of retrieving a soul unlike any other - a so-called Giant Soul. Starting from this premise, an adventure will open before us that does not take itself seriously, macabre, full of oxymorons, tragedies and really funny moments: it doesn't last long, less than ten hours, but they were all very enjoyable in their apparent simplicity. Let's find out about Death's Door in our review of the PC version. Soul Reaper At first glance, Death's Door looks like a modest title. After being accompanied by bus to the workplace, we are assigned the aforementioned task of recovering a slightly different soul than usual: one of those powerful enough to even guarantee us bonuses. It's not every day that we can recover such a precious one, so without wasting any more time, let's start looking for it. In reality we have no choice, our task is to bring back exactly the soul that has been entrusted to us, not just any, not even if it should be more powerful than expected. Everything is going very well until, when it's time to collect, we are stunned and our soul is stolen from us. We have no choice but to go after the thief, arriving in an unknown world where the game begins to explain itself better in its not excessive complexity. For reasons that we will not reveal to you, our goal will no longer be to obtain the lost soul but to recover those of three creatures who have lived far beyond expectations. Cheating death, however, also means transforming into the shadow of who you were when living was still a right: the three tyrants we will have to deal with all have a reason behind their actions but death comes for everyone. He has to. There is no compromise on this and the difficult task is up to us. Where Titan Souls sinned in presenting any plot whatsoever, Death's Door focuses a little more on this aspect by touching on themes such as the search for immortality, the inevitability of an already written destiny and the fear of dying, alternating between seriousness and black humor for a sometimes even touching story. It is not the point of excellence of the game but it is there and can be followed, building itself both through the linear narration of the adventure and thanks to the collectibles scattered here and there, whose descriptions offer more details on the context and on some characters. Raven style Death's Door, our young crow is more combative than ever Despite the presence of a story, it is once again the gameplay that dominates. Although defined as action RPG, the progression of Death's Door is reduced to the bone but this is not a bad thing, on the contrary: for what it does and how it is structured, we would not have wanted anything more. A few elements in the right place is always better than excess mechanics that would end up being forgotten: too much damages, as they say, and the game takes this lesson on its own by presenting itself dry enough. Each power has its own purpose and is put to work from when it is obtained until the end, the variety of weapons is limited and satisfies all palates a little, although the difference between them is not very perceptible; finally, the progression of the character does not go through the levels but from a constant increase of his basic statistics (attack, dexterity, speed and magic) by investing the necessary number of souls. That's all. As we said, simple yet functional. That's all you need to enjoy Death's Door. we are almost always entrusted to the sword). To accompany the melee, in which there is no parry but only dodging by rolling away from the enemy, there is magic: by default we have a bow that shoots enchanted arrows, as we progress in the game we will unlock three other skills for a total of four (one for each button on the d-pad), and all have utility both offensively and when it comes to exploring the game world. Whether it's to blow up a wall, or to score pointsinaccessible thanks to the hook, for every problem there is a solution: it may not be immediate, which implies backtracking, but the beauty of the game is also this, to retrace your steps and do it moved by the curiosity to know what potential secret we have left behind. The four spells can in fact be improved by facing special challenges, after which we will obtain a specific enhancement that will facilitate our efforts in the field: for example, by improving the bomb we will breathe a sigh of relief knowing that we will no longer receive damage from the explosion, going to only damage enemies. Death's Door, that moment when it seems to be in The Enchanted City Despite its simplicity, fighting in Death's Door takes some effort. If single clashes, or at most with three or four enemies of the same type, may seem simple, the situation becomes more complicated when the game begins to put different, more or less powerful and reinforced creatures on the field, as well as any environmental discomforts such as slippery floors or traps that activate just as we are fighting. Although it is very affordable for those accustomed to this kind of video game, it does not mean that it should be taken lightly: fortunately, dying has no particular consequences beyond having to start over from the last checkpoint, which, just like in Titan Souls, are quite distant between them. Being in a world regulated by the Gates, it is necessary to find and activate the entrance relating to the portion of the world we are exploring to be sure of restarting from there in case of departure - we may well be emissaries of death but it does not mean that we are immortal. Beyond of this, let's not worry about losing souls, or having to recover our possessions once we return to the game: in this sense, Death's Door does not rage and lets us return to action loaded as before. The need not to lose concentration during the clashes is also due to the fact that the possibilities for healing are very limited: no magic, that's all for the offensive, instead you have to look for seeds and plant them in specific pots to grow a flower capable of healing all our wounds. Once used, it will wither and only become available again by exiting and re-entering the area. Doing it, always through the doors that we will have to unlock, will restore all our health and from a certain point of view it could be used as a trick to restore us, but returning to the main hub means a respawn of the enemies in the area we were exploring. It must be said that fighting is not always mandatory, you can very well zigzag between enemies trying to get to the other side without a shot being fired. It's not the best of ideas but when you're in a hurry, or you've died too many times to want to do the same piece again and again, the game doesn't object. In some cases, however, it is mandatory to stop and face small survival tests to get what we are looking for - be it a key or a specific soul to rest. Death's Door, the fights can get surprisingly challenging Combat, Death's Door alternates exploration and puzzle solving to continue: from finding a key, to pulling a lever, to overcoming challenges of ingenuity and coordination, we must say that the game undertakes to vary what, in the general framework , is a somewhat redundant scheme. To access the boss area (mind you, not the boss itself), you need to unlock a door by finding and pacifying the souls needed to open it: reaching these souls requires you to explore and solve puzzles, while interacting with them requires you to first face a or more fights. The diversity of the settings and the excellent level design do not make you feel the weight of this repetitiveness, so much so that we made an almost single tirade until the end without getting bored, indeed taking the time to look for some secrets. Where Death's Door is lacking in the absence of a map: not so much for finding the main road, as for the backtracking necessary to fully upgrade our crow. Remembering exactly where we needed a specific spell is difficult and we often find ourselves going around in circles hoping to be on the right track. While not overly complex, the different areas are still full of steps and it's impossible to keep track of everything. Having an idea of where you are would have been very useful in order not to waste time unnecessarily. On the other hand, it is also true that upgrading lives, magic charges or the magic itself is not necessary to finish the game: we managed to finish it with only one upgrade to the spells and one to the slots, so the progression of the character in this sense is a whim - unliketo improving stats, which is vital for streamlining battles. Death's Door, nothing is given for nothing: all magic must be conquered Although the artistic style of Death's Door is not unique in its kind, nor is it particularly striking, the developers must recognize an incredible attention to detail: all areas are very refined, so much so that they breathe life of their own, and this goes to balance a not very refined aesthetic. On the other hand, we have a perfectly fitting soundtrack, capable of conveying the right atmosphere depending on the area in which we are moving, then increasing in intensity both during boss fights and in the case of slightly more demanding fights than normal. Finally, from a technical point of view, we did not encounter any problems: during the seven and a half hours needed to finish it (with a completion percentage of around 81%) there was no drop in frame rate, bug or freeze . The returned experience was great from start to finish.", "date": "2021-07-20", "grade": "8.0"}
