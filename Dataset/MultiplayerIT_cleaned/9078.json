Will God of Rock be able to merge Guitar Hero with the world of fighting games? The feat seems impossible, but after spending some time together we can confirm our first impressions after trying the demo: the potential is very high and the recipe works.Developed by Modus Studios, God of Rock is a fighting game in which , to hit the opponent and parry his blows, you have to play notes like in Guitar Hero. Each note played is a punch or kick that the character throws automatically and that the opponent automatically parries if he too has guessed the correct timing of the note. If both miss, no hits hit, but if only one misses the right button at the right time, then he takes damage. In addition, as in all self-respecting fighting games, there are a series of special moves, combos and ultimates that add notes or modify the opponent's track to make a mistake more likely and therefore land a hit. In this God of Rock review we will tell you how the developers have managed to combine two genres that seem to be poles apart in a really interesting way and how just a few more refinements and greater depth in the controls could transform this title even into an esport. 12 stories of frustration The protagonists of God of Rock have the appearance of music stars that we have come to know and real problems that afflict ordinary people What you'll either love or hate about God of Rock the most isn't its combat mechanics (which we think are hilarious), but its characters. If you cherish a particular music icon and it pains you to see them parodied or imitated, you probably won't love many of the heroes in this game. If you appreciate irony, however, the quotes made by the authors will make you laugh a lot. Playing in arcade mode, each character has a very short animated introduction that explains how, in fact, each protagonist of this game is a ~loser~ stuck in a job or in a frustrating life situation. Here comes the God of Rock who makes each of them an offer: participate in his flamboyant musical fighting tournament in exchange for what they want most. Everyone accepts and this is how the narrative context is born. The most recognizable of the 12 protagonists is undoubtedly King, visibly inspired by Elvis, whose story is that of a failed rock star who needs a little push to get back into the spotlight. Another very obvious reference is Johann, a big brawler with a German accent who is very reminiscent of the great composer Bach, but who in this universe is an aficionado of American custom motorcycles who wants to ride Route 66. Ziggy is a red-haired alien obsessed with kidnapping cows to be backing vocals in his band (he is wonderfully crazy) whose aesthetic is a mix between the punk of Iggy Pop and the camp style of David Bowie from whom Ziggy Stardust was named. A flower child could not be missing, Lyn, clearly inspired by Janis Joplin, whose special attacks are decidedly psychedelic. In addition to the legends of the past, there are also references to artists of the present such as Tophat, who is very reminiscent of John Legend, and Queen who, at least to us, seems inspired by Lizzo. Finally, there are characters invented or inspired by mythology such as Kosaku, who uses the spirits of Japanese forests to defeat the noise of the cities, or Hilde, a nun with robotic hands who hates her convent meals and would like to write the hymn most beautiful religious ever. There is no shortage of oddities and we assure you that they do not end here because we have not told you about the cartoonist porcelain doll or the handsome wrestler / actor in love with his image. Need more depth God of Rock's combat is well done and has a very forgiving learning curve, too bad it lacks depth at the beginning The first impact with God of Rock is amazing. The concept is so alien that in the first half hour of the game it's hard to believe that everything works and is even fun. If this were simply an unambitious arcade title, everything could stop at the four keys that are used for strictly musical gameplay but it is not like that. Fighting games are famous for their combos and each character's unique fighting style and this game has managed to find that uniqueness even in its strange format. We have tried it on PC but using a controller precisely because the inputs dedicated to combos are directional and inserting them with a joystick greatly simplifies the experience. Each character has a bar divided into three sections which, by playing the right notes, fill up with yellow. Once full, it is possible to use the ultimate, an ability that gives a clear advantage to the user because it floods the opponent with notes to play, always opening a window to strike. Then there's a special ability that consumes only one of the three sections and alters the music track in some way that doesn't always help the one who activated it. Then, each character has between 3 and 5 combos available for increasingly complex and increasingly effective attacks. You'll have to completely recalibrate your brain to be able to enter the right notes with one hand and use the other for the joystick movements necessary to bring home the combos but fear not, the many levels of difficulty will come to your aid. Playing against the computer only from hard level upwards your opponent will use combos so you can train with the strictly musical part at the beginning and then concentrate on combining the more strictly fighting game part. The skill list of Edith, one of the characters, which includes the three standard combos, the EX move (the one that consumes a third of the yellow bar) and the ultimate God of Rock, however, has a fundamental problem: while learning it, the characters (with two exceptions) all look the same. If in Street fighter the difference in the style of play between Chun-Li and Zangief is evident, in God of Rock for the first few hours of the game the selected hero doesn't matter, it only matters how well you can play. After mastering the rhythm part and learning a bit about each hero's specific command sequences their personalities begin to emerge. Special attacks that add notes to the opponent's track seem to vary very little in effect, only the ultimates are visibly different. Only having already unraveled the knot of coordination does it emerge that each character is actually unique. There are those who have a faster or more strategic style of play, based on often annoying, and those who want to build up a more powerful attack over time. The only obvious exceptions are Gosaku who has as his former ability the ability to change his form by unlocking a whole set of different moves (and for this he is twice as difficult to master and beat due to unpredictability) and the other is Lyn le whose moves go to cover the keys of the notes with flowers (both those of the opponents and one's own) and whose ultimate lengthens and shortens the rhythm of both tracks to put the opponent in difficulty. Not a bad repertoire Among the 50 original songs that can be challenged on in God of Rock there are many pieces inspired by the iconic styles of the protagonists The other Achilles' heel of God of Rock is that, for obvious budgetary reasons, the songs you'll compete on aren't hits from the history of rock and pop like in Guitar Hero, but are original songs. If from the point of view of attractiveness this choice seems a big point against, analyzing the gameplay it is clear that there were also design reasons behind it. Unlike games based on iconic tracks, God of Rock cannot impose a time limit on its matches dictated by the playing time of a certain song also because, if the players prove to be good and attentive, a match could get bogged down in a stalemate in which both hit all the right notes and no hits hit. To prevent this phenomenon, God of Rock has 50 original songs composed of different sections designed to repeat themselves in pre-established loops. This allowed the developers to set specific points in fights where the musical intensity would ramp up if nothing happened for too long. Each level of difficulty, in fact, corresponds to a certain number of notes per time interval, the more difficult the challenge becomes, the more the notes multiply within the same space. This measure is different from the intensity of the piece and allows, by keeping the same number of notes per time interval (the difficulty), to insert more complex combinations and transitions. This makes God of Rock a lot of fun both against the computer (against which you never win easily) and against friends, who are faced with a challenge that is never the same. The eight different stages, then, do a good job of differentiating the settings even if your gaze will be too busy following the notes and managing the combos to notice anything else. Finally, for the more dedicated, there is an editor to create customized tracks starting from the available songs and with infinite customization possibilities.", "date": "2023-05-17", "grade": "7.0"}
