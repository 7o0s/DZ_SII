We do it a few days after we dealt with the review of The End of Zoe, the last of the list of paid additional content made available by Capcom for the most recent chapter of its survival horror series. For those who may be short of news, we remind you that the story dedicated to Jack Baker's daughter has in fact gone alongside the two DLC Confidential Movies Vol.1 and Vol. 2 already published at the beginning of the year. The package we are talking about today is instead free, as promised for some time by the Japanese publisher: initially scheduled for last spring, No Hero was then postponed to the end of 2017, to ensure the same quality standards as the base game. After being imprisoned by Marguerite, having attended Jack's birthday and having finally punched the mycomorphs as Joe Baker, No Hero takes us in the company of a very old acquaintance of the series, met at the end of Resident Evil 7: it is useless to go around around, you know who it is! Where were we As well as The End of Zoe, No Hero begins after the events narrated in Resident Evil 7, picking up from the moment in which the protagonist Ethan Winters is rescued by a team of special forces led by Chris Redfield. Over the months there has been a lot of talk about the appearance of this character, also due to his completely revolutionized physical model compared to the beefy one we were used to by now: there were, for example, those who believed that Redfield was not Redfield but Hunk, agent secret already seen in the series. Another point of discussion was the appearance of a modified Umbrella logo on the rescue helicopter, which was colored blue instead of red. Is it possible that Chris Redfield started working for the company he fought against for so long? Without revealing too much about the plot of this DLC, we can tell you that No Hero first confirms the identity of the character, just as Capcom had already done months ago, explaining his new bond with Umbrella and the reason for that color change. These aspects are likely to lay the foundations for the future of the Resident Evil series, offering indications on which side we will be on for what will be the next chapter. For the rest, in this additional content Redfield's goal is to find Lucas Baker, the only survivor of the family infected by Eveline. Beyond the exposure to the mutamycete he has some secrets to hide, also giving probable indications on what we will see in Resident Evil 8. Playstation 4 trophies Lean times for Trophy hunters: No hero adds only two new achievements to the base game, one in silver and one in bronze. They can be obtained by completing the DLC on easy or normal difficulty, then repeating the exercise with the level that is unlocked after completing the adventure for the first time. Jokes in the mine If you have played Resident Evil 7 - and if you are reading this we hope you have - you know Lucas Baker: the insane horror that overwhelmed his family has transformed him into a kind of Jigsaw, who loves to subject his victims to crazy games before torturing them. Holed up in the mine already seen in Resident Evil 7, Lucas enjoys playing the game of cat and mouse with Chris Redfield, taking advantage of the capture of some of the agent's companions which took place shortly before. In running after Lucas to end his escape and save his team, Chris has to contend with the inevitable mycomorphs, present in large quantities in the mine even in different forms than we were used to. There are, for example, special creatures that cannot be destroyed even with bullets, as they are able to regenerate their tissues: this forces Chris to adopt different tactics at least in the initial stages, before finding the right ammunition to give even these ugly dudes what they deserve. Unlike The End of Zoe, we can count on a good armament consisting of a pistol, a rifle and some types of grenades, but above all on the special equipment of Chris and his team. To access some areas, in fact, it is necessary to recover the filter that allows the protagonist not to be contaminated by the infection, just as the darkest areas can only be addressed by finding the night vision device. Although still more devoted to action than Resident Evil 7, in terms of atmosphere No Hero comes closer to the latter than Zoe's End, thus distorting what were expectations. The blustering way in which Joe Baker punches the mycomorphs leaves room for a few moments of tension in going around the dark corners of the mine, also thanks to the claustrophobic environment of the latter. However, the pace is high, and the ammunition sufficient (although not very abundant) to guarantee an always high level of action in the frenetic search for Lucas. Overall, No Hero keeps us busy for about two hours, answering the most relevant questions that had remained suspended after completing Resident Evil 7. A time that passes quite quickly thanks to the undoubted quality of this DLC, from which we would have however expected a little something more in terms of longevity: it is true that you don't look a gift horse in the mouth, but in the end the regret is precisely that of not being able to spend a little more time with Chris Redfield. With No Hero, Capcom worthily concludes the events narrated in Resident Evil 7, perhaps postponing our real reunion with the protagonist of this package to the next chapter of the series. Considering that it's available at no cost, we highly recommend playing it if you loved the base game.", "date": "2017-12-20", "grade": null}
