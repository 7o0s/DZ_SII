{"name": "Zoo Tycoon 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zoo-tycoon-2-recensione.html", "text": "There is always a moral issue underlying the discussion of zoos and captive animals: disguised as an educational and scientific interest, the fascination of seeing animals in cages is not exactly the maximum expression of an environmental sensitivity. Even more, when we ourselves take the part of the ~jailer~, and try to manage a zoo, as happens in this game. The Tycoon series has existed on PC for years, and includes a large variety of different management games, focused on the strategic organization of the most disparate resources. In this case, of course, it is a question of building and managing a zoo in the best possible way: the first chapter had landed still decidedly immature on Nintendo DS, proposing a shredded and badly reworked adaptation compared to the original for PC and Macintosh, while this sequel seems to be been mainly studied to meet the potential offered by Nintendo DS, and above all to the tastes of the typical users of the Nintendo portable console. The result is a very simplified product compared to the original, which adapts well to a young audience, however excessively flattening the management dynamics, and thus introducing various contradictory signals, for a product that should present itself as halfway between an educational software and a real video game. All this without taking into consideration the technical aspect, which does not shine on its own. Owner of a zoo Zoo Tycoon 2 is a management system that follows the typical structure of the genre: as in Theme Park and the like, it will be a question of building your own zoo from the beginning and then managing it in the best possible way, taking into consideration both the more ~scientific~ problems related to care of animals, and those purely of ~marketing~, referring to customer satisfaction. Probably to meet the favor of the younger public, to which the product seems to be intended, this version for Nintendo DS seems like a ~light~ edition of the one present on PC, which on the one hand entails a pleasant streamlining of the structure, but on the other also an excessive lowering of the level of challenge, as well as a limitation on the freedom of action. The interface makes good use of the Nintendo DS touch screen, as we can now expect from this type of production on the two-screen portable: a series of icons represent the possible options, while on the upper screen we get all the useful information. As in Theme Park or Sim City, with a few touches of the stylus and various dragging it is possible to build fences, protections of various types, plant trees and insert ponds and so on, while outside the areas dedicated to animals we can organize the path of visitors with paths, roads, information points and various types of restaurant areas. There are two game modes in single player: the ~free~ mode, in which the game is presented in its original structure, in which we build the zoo and dedicate ourselves to its management so that everything goes smoothly, and the ~campaign~, in which instead we will have precise objectives to be completed, sometimes within a given time limit. The latter is the most properly structured mode, so as to offer a well-defined challenge and levels to complete, although it is not distinguished by an adequate level of difficulty. Heavy Petting Zoo Zoo Tycoon 2, as a good management system faithful to the line, obviously relies on the gamer's tendency to order and in a certain sense on the desire for omnipotence that springs for better or worse from being able to create what we want with a simple touch on the screen. However, the excessively guided setting tends to castrate the power of the demiurge with the nib, and it is here that the choice to simplify the structure clashes with some fundamental management principles. The game communicates practically at all times the best thing to do for each animal at any given moment, limiting the choices to the essential and right ones. Probably everything was designed to make Zoo Tycoon 2 on Nintendo DS more attractive to a young audience, which represents a large portion of users for the Nintendo portable and which is then the privileged subject of any production concerning zoos and animals to ~touch with hand~. Precisely for this reason, ample space has been left for interaction with animals and information about them, in some educational software ambitions that pervade the whole game. The basic principle on which the whole zoo machine revolves is the satisfaction of the animals, which can be achieved by keeping their basic parameters high (hunger, cleanliness, health, etc.). For this we have to interact with each of them through the typical touch screen mini-games, with which it is possible to feed, cuddle, clean andgenerally take care of our specimens, a bit in Nintendogs style. Again, these are fragments of gameplay that are extremely simple to implement, and consequently the coveted satisfaction of the animals can be obtained simply by interacting often with each of them. The strange thing is that Zoo Tycoon 2, relying exclusively on these ways of interacting with animals, does not take into account other fundamental aspects such as the size of the fences, or their overcrowding, or the fact of mixing incompatible species. More complex is the management of all the elements external to pure contact with the animals: the control of the progress of the zoo poses problems that significantly move away from edutainment to further affect the ~world of adults~, with financial management. It is possible to regulate the cost of the ticket, invest in advertising, build structures for the reception of the public and for refreshments. Even here, however, the simulation is not too thorough, representing only a sketch of the one present in other similar productions. There is also a multiplayer component (locally): through this it is possible to exchange zoos, or compete for the best construction and management of them. In the wild The graphics sector certainly does not represent one of the best results obtained on Nintendo DS. Indeed, the dual-screen laptop has accustomed us to something else, especially in recent times. It is also true that the genre does not in itself impose obsessive attention to detail, but the general aspect of the game is rather sad, both as regards the view from above, normally used for managing the zoo, and in the shots close up on animals. There is the possibility of rotating the shot and activating various zoom levels, but in any case the animals, from above, appear too small and rough, difficult to distinguish in their outlines. With the close-up shot, usable in mini-games, the polygonal models of the animals are decidedly more detailed, but they are also distinguished by the excessively squared contours and also by some inconsistencies in the proportions. In short, if the ~cute~ effect of Nintendogs was a goal sought by the developers, it cannot be said that it has been achieved. As for the audio, ethnic and tribal style music is recorded but nothing memorable, not even as regards the sound effects, which reproduce the calls of the various animals. Comment Caught between educational software ambitions and the rigorous structure of classic Tycoons, Zoo Tycoon 2 struggles to find its own identity. The Nintendo DS adaptation significantly simplifies the interface and makes managing the zoo more immediate, to the detriment of freedom of action and the level of challenge. Everything is limited to keeping up with the needs of the animals, making the forced choices proposed by the game in every situation. The effective validity of the zoological teachings is also undermined by the coarseness in the management of the specimens, which apparently are not affected by problems such as overcrowding, inconsistency with the surrounding environment and compatibility with other species. The technical aspect contributes to chaining this product to a scarce sufficiency: suitable for zoo enthusiasts or management maniacs, less so for everyone else. Pros Convenient interface via touch screen The charm of animals can attract younger people Cons Excessive simplification in the management of the zoo Monotonous in the long run Graphics not up to the recent DS productions", "date": "2008-06-11", "grade": null}
