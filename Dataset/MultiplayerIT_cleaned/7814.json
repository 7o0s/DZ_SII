An intermediate step in this evolution was GRID, true and bulwark of the proprietary graphic engine and which, out of nowhere, was able to give users one of the most adrenaline-pumping and satisfying driving experiences in recent years. Even difficult races, with spectacular cosmetics, enriched by damage and a choice to abandon the 60 frames per second in the bud to concentrate on 30, but seasoned with all kinds of graphic effects so as to give a unique aspect to this essential and very fast experience . After five years of silence, the Codies go back to work on this GRID 2, essentially picking up where it left off, adding some of the things that had been clamored for by the fans, but remaining fundamentally tied to the first, successful formula. Variations on the theme In GRID 2 it's almost exclusively about running at full speed. The pretext for doing so is that of a racing tycoon who decides to set up the WSR, a new league involving all the strongest street racing riders in the world. To do this, he chooses a bishop, who would then be the driver played by the player, who must travel the planet challenging the strongest teams to convince their top riders to join the new bandwagon and give life to a worldwide success. After a series of events in which to convince Patrick Callahan, this is the name of the mentor, of the choice made, our task is to cross the United States, Europe and Asia, in three different seasons, obtaining placements and top results and unlock away away the following season until the completion of Callahan's project, or his dream championship, held on the best circuits among all the three areas already crossed previously. The structure of GRID 2 owes much to the previous episode only that the approach is, if possible, even more essential: each podium obtained in an event leads to the achievement of a certain number of fans, whose accumulation unlocks access to subsequent series . The 70 cars available (there are no Ferraris, Porsches or indie cars) cannot be bought (nor sold), but are obtained at regular intervals in the career or by winning auto-challenges which ask you to complete laps of the track or sections of the track within a certain time limit. For each season and always to increase the fans, there are also promo events that can come to the rescue of those players who just fail to win or place decently in the regular events. Always to help the collection of fans, after having customized the livery of the cars with a system that allows you to choose color schemes for the different decals and a very large series of pre-set designs, you can select some sponsors who set goals for the player and for every season. They range from winning a self-challenge to finishing first in a certain number of races, up to placing themselves in front of a determined opponent (they all have a first and last name, like real stars) or setting record times. The flashback system is also back, i.e. the possibility of rewinding time to straighten a curve or a collision gone wrong and you can do it five times per event, this time also at the PRO difficulty level, which indicates greater general softness. However, GRID 2 is confirmed as a challenging game, especially in the final stages of the career (get ready for a tour of more than 20 hours of play) thanks above all to the artificial intelligence of the opponents which is one of the flagships. Our opponents almost never let go, keep realistic attitudes and try in every way to hinder us, as said in a slightly softer way than in the past, but which gives substance and continuity to any player. Running on the mixed GRID 2 is a hyperbolic journey between continents, city tracks, circuit racetracks and road races along the lines of a rally. The tracks are always excellently done with special mentions for Barcelona, Dubai, Japan, Paris and the French Riviera (there are 14 different settings, each with different tracks) and the sepia style of the first episode gives way to a softer and more truly pleasant to watch. This extreme variety is supported by the diversity of tests to be taken, almost all very fast and rather short. These range from races in which you beat an opponent head-to-head, to progressive elimination of the riders in the queue, passing by drifts and up to a new type of racing on street circuits, in which the track is determined randomly by changesgoing the crossroads that you have to take gradually (which is even more difficult because you no longer have the map to study the curves in advance). This whirlwind of events is held together by a series of videos that should convey the sensation of the progression of the new racing series towards popularity, but the common thread is too small and in the end GRID 2 fails to be anything but an adrenaline-pumping sequel of races, one after the other. Which is perhaps the best thing, but the feeling that everything is very little contextualized comes after a few hours. It all depends on what you are looking for in this game. One thing to note are uploads that always go (timed) 35 to 40 seconds. The documents accompanying the review code clearly outline how this will be fixed in the retail version, but it's fair to point this out as it impacts the gameplay experience. Playability, as already noted on the various occasions in which we were able to try the new GRID, has remained that rocky union between arcade driving and the heaviness of the machines that must be known and chosen wisely depending on the event. The new car fleet accumulation system, divided between four classes, is a bit confusing and the events alternate between races in which you only have one car to choose from and others in which you have around ten, which already happened with first episode. The basic concept is that if it is seen that an event is too difficult to overcome, there is probably the right car for us waiting to be won with the relative self-challenge. In short, the decisive will seems to be that of wanting to let the players spend as little time as possible in the menus and to just make them run, also given how much fun they have. Xbox 360 goals Completing the career leads to achieving a score between 300 and 400 goals. In short, GRID 2 from this point of view is struggling a bit, especially in relation to the many hours of racing necessary to finish it. Anyone who wants to reach 1000 will have to play online and complete a series of challenging challenges. That's its beauty, though Online my love Where GRID 2 greatly improves on its predecessor is the online, which was previously very narrow. It is a real separate mode in which the player must progress completely independently of the single player career (you can also play in two from the same console in split screen). Each event leads to the purchase of followers in order to level up and the most powerful machines are unlocked at more advanced levels. In addition to the followers, you earn money, as in the first GRID, which however is used to upgrade the machines, a feature that strangely was only foreseen for online gaming. For each car you can buy packages to improve Engine, Transmission and Handling, which affect top speed, acceleration, power and weight, bearing in mind that once a certain limit is exceeded, the car will automatically be promoted to a higher class. No tuning and settings, but still a pleasant surprise which in our opinion could also be included for the career, giving it more depth. In addition to individual races (for 12 players), which can also be run following playlists as in the best fps, money and followers can be won by obtaining medals in global challenges, i.e. events decided by Codemasters and changed on a regular basis, in which you can compete, even downloading the ghost of the best runner. In short, online gaming seems to have received the greatest amount of attention, also considering the connection with the profile on Racenet. This, as well as the ability to upload movies to Youtube, was not yet active at the time of writing, but both are additions that will give GRID 2 a pretty long life. In contrast, in a system clearly designed to recover the many fans of the original, there is the choice not to include the view from the cockpit among the four available. The decision seems to have been based on the difficulty in making it in the face of the small number of players who use it, but it is a lack that the most avid fans will probably regret. Apart from this, GRID 2 is beautiful to look at, always solid, fluid even when the damage system, which is confirmed as excellent by significantly affecting the driveability of the vehicles, fills the track with bodywork from all sides. From the amount of post-processing effects it seems at times to be in front of a new chapter of Killzone rather than a racing game and certain sunsets are breathtaking, thanks to the reflections on the car bodies that fill the camera and the television of the player with flashes. All this lust, though, yesi brings with it the absence of the dynamic atmospheric effects introduced with Formula 1 or the lack of the day-night cycle, but it is probable that true fans will not even notice it in a title that proposes Codemasters as one of the houses to follow with greater attention to the rise of the next generation of consoles, where all this scaffolding will hopefully finally travel at 60 frames per second. As for the audio, bearing in mind that the soundtrack is minimal, a good job has been done on the sound of the machines, which benefit from the experience accumulated by the team over the last five years of work. GRID 2 remains fun and fast-paced, but leaves behind a couple of elements loved by hardcore fans", "date": "2013-05-28", "grade": "8.4"}
