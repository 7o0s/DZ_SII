Sorry to say it but it's not like that FULL METAL JACKET If it is true that Half-Life 2 was the first to introduce realistic physics into a shooter, it is also obvious that it is not always fundamental for the purposes of a game, but by now the public expects that when shooting something there is a some reaction. Vietcong 2 makes interaction practically absent except on the classic explosive bins and vehicles that behave in a demented way to say the least in most cases! Machines that fly in the air above 3-storey buildings, bins that once exploded take flight and remain in the sky for about ten seconds. Not to mention the ragdoll, not too bad but also sometimes ridiculous (shotgun that instead of sending a Vietcong backwards makes him fall forward down the stairs!) and not always functional (very sad the escape by car with an enemy hit who instead of dying is pushed forward for meters continuing to shoot!). PLATOON Artificial intelligence sometimes seems to have taken a step backwards compared to the past, especially in team management: men who run around us like tops, characters who stop in narrow passages blocking our advance, soldiers who run at each other like in a pathetic attempt to hug. The same goes for the enemies: despite some unexpected reactions (but never a total change of action) at times, if hit from behind, they keep shooting forward and getting slaughtered with impunity. For the rest, the interface has been modified a bit along the lines of Brothers in Arms (but much simpler) and Medal of Honor, from which the compass indicating the direction to take is taken. It is possible to send the team to precise points and call up the doctor and engineer with the use of single keys that can be pressed several times depending on the command. VICTIMS OF WAR You have probably already seen the photos or already read the preview; gentlemen, Vietcong 2 in certain situations is scandalous! Absolutely not up to par for a late 2005 game. Unfortunately it seems clear that the Pterodons have only modified their old engine and the results are there for all to see. Crude polygonal models, occasional pop-ups of buildings and polygons, and a scaling system that defines approaching objects (see the photos, a picture is worth a thousand words). ...Neighbor... VICTIMS OF WAR Added to these defects are several bugs that afflict the game and undermine its fun: people stuck in doors, soldiers who lose their legs in the asphalt and no longer advance; problems that on more than one occasion forced the reload of the last save. An obvious example is the first mission when you have to rescue the survivors of the jeep; a soldier on the run was advancing in the concrete blocking himself on the sidewalk as if there were quicksand! (and the game therefore cannot continue). The general graphic aspect is very angular, especially on men and in urban environments. On the other hand, the construction of the weapons is good, reaching the absurd figure of 60(!) models. These differ in terms of accuracy and slow reloading (the shotgun is the slowest ever seen in an FPS!). As you progress in the game, open spaces become visible and clipping effects become rarer. The game makes use of shaders 2.0 (without which it cannot be installed!) which, however, are timidly noticed only on the soldier models, which are still lower than those of Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault. We conclude the sad roundup with the facial expressions of the characters, totally anonymous and devoid of emotional glances which, in the most dramatic phases, remain in the expressiveness of a plaster bust. Of course it's not all to throw away but you will turn up your nose on many occasions, above all for the fact that at certain moments the game starts on a mid-range PC (P4, 1 GB of RAM, GeForce 6600GT 128Mb AA 4x, FA8x), unjustifiably for what it offers. WE WERE SOLDIERS The titles of the paragraphs all refer to the films that have been able to portray the Vietnam war from different points of view, highlighting all the horrors that this conflict has brought, not only in terms of the clashes but above all on the human one, which he often sees his own values being trampled by the vortex of violence. Among the many titles, Platoon certainly stands out, a masterpiece by Oliver Stone, in which a young Charlie Sheen enters a world that appears to him totally different from what he believed. The film also stars the great William Dafoe as a soldier who despite what he's been through still retains his humanity. Touching. GOOD MORNING VIETNAM! The audio ofgame is absolutely fine. Noises, shots, explosions are in place and if you want you can use the new EAX 4 libraries (provided you have the latest Creative card which makes the sound more real than ever). Ubiquitous are the Vietnamese radios that launch their propaganda messages all the time; fortunately they are covered by the shots! Unfortunately the game has not been translated into Italian (unlike the first Vietcong) and for those who do not speak English, subtitles are a must. However, these do not translate everything that can be heard and in particular the nice dialogues of our companions. For the music, however, we find themes similar to the old title and some very short musical interludes; we would have liked a more present accompaniment in certain situations but on the other hand in war you don't hear pleasant sounds. HAMBURGER HILL Nothing to criticize for the multiplayer: the netcode has been improved and you can participate in games of up to a maximum of sixty-four players, for total carnage! Various maps are available with indicated size and recommended number of opponents. The game modes are the classics: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag and assault (one team attacks, the other defends), to which is added the online cooperative mode that allows a group to clash against bots. The scoring system based on our results is interesting: by achieving a certain number of points in online battles we would have access to a series of higher classes, in which we could decide what type of soldier to play (sniper, marine, commando, doctor, and others) versus the basic three. As a result, the armament and skills will be better. Another introduction is the possibility of piloting some vehicles but, frankly, you will do without it given the slowness and inconvenience of the control system (Halo has no rivals). Furthermore, the matches can be played in ~Vietnam~ mode, in which there are no Huds and various indicators and a shot is often fatal. For those who want realism! Finally, you can play on LAN, Internet and with direct IP and easily manage the servers, thanks to the interface that allows you to customize everything, including our digital alter ego with a fair number of variations. this title is the only one that manages to convey the true atmosphere of the ~dirty war~ Final comment It was very difficult to assign the vote to Vietcong 2 given the incredible ups and downs that permeate this production. If on the one hand the innovations can be counted on a crippled hand, this title is the only one that manages to convey the true atmosphere of the ~dirty war~, thanks to the faithful historical reconstruction and some truly galvanizing clashes (but penalized by the backward graphics and by a sometimes really idiotic AI). The management of the team is very simple and often necessary in certain situations and the excellent sound realization contributes greatly to identification. Lovers of classic shooters will not find it to their liking since collaboration and prudence are a must to continue. Recommended above all to fans of the first who, however, cannot help but feel disappointed by the various flaws that afflict the game, while all the others are advised to take a look at it anyway. A missed masterpiece. Pros Faithful historical reconstruction Functional and easily manageable interface Valid multiplayer and top sound Cons Scandalous graphics and hardware hungry AI sometimes ridiculous Many bugs APOCALYPSE NOW  REDUX Vietnam returns, with the sequel to the best dirty war title ever released. This time, in addition to the Americans, you will also be able to see the battle from the eyes of the ~yellow~ communists, a choice that some may not like but which you will not be forced to make (as the two campaigns are distinct). Vietcong 2 does not bring major changes, but as a natural evolution of the first, it should include those changes to adapt it to the latest shooters. Sorry to say it but it's not like that. In order not to run into repetitive missions, the Pterodon have opted this time for the urban setting, in which the marines will carry out most of the missions, in the period of truce that took place during the TET (the Vietnamese New Year) in 1968. The campaign of the The Vietcong, on the other hand, will be mainly in the jungle, showing the enemy's way of acting that no one had ever thought of using. All of this offers a complete historical picture full of food for thought. The story is told this time with the use of FMV cutscenes (mainly) and with dialogues in the in-game sequences. Movie buffs will have no trouble finding various quotes from the most famous war films: right from the initial sequence (which shamelessly recalls Platoon) you can asstick to situations more or less already seen, this without however falling into trivial copying. It must be ensured that in many situations the involvement is very high, but penalized by a whole series of problems listed below, first of all the difficulty factor, which already on average is frustrating in various points given that, realistically, it takes very little to get killed.", "date": "2005-11-09", "grade": null}
