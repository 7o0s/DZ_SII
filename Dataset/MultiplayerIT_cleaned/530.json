{"name": "Tomb Raider: Legend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-legend.html", "text": "Lots of smoke and lots of fire The first Tomb Raider was a huge success, as well as a real driving force that prompted millions of people to buy the ~new~ consoles; Lara was a figure clearly aimed at the male audience, but also appreciated by the female one, and supported by an undoubtedly valid and in some ways revolutionary game. The mechanics developed by Core Design was also stimulating and satisfying, overshadowing a wooden and impractical control system. But it was absolutely fine at the time. Obviously Tomb Raider could only be the first of a long series, with a second episode of good quality that refined the original formula and a third that was really too static and uninspired. Poor Lara's shaky success then met the coup de grace due to the multi-postponed and finally unfortunately bad debut on next-gen, with that Angel of Darkness for Ps2 and PC which also cost the Core Design programmers their place. Obviously a cleanup was needed, and Eidos therefore decided to entrust the onerous task of resurrecting Miss Croft to Crystal Dynamics, a team that came to light with the intriguing Legacy of Kain series. So far the premise. Now that Tomb Raider Legend is finally available for PC, Ps2, Xbox and Xbox 360, fans of the busty English archaeologist can finally breathe a sigh of relief: the operation was successful. fans of the busty English archaeologist can finally breathe a sigh of relief: the operation was successful Lots of smoke and lots of fire The plot that justifies this umpteenth raid is not, in reality, one to remember in the annals: in summary, it all begins with Lara's search for the reasons for her mother's mysterious death, which occurred several years earlier when the heroine she was still a child. Then everything takes extremely different paths, which we prefer not to anticipate so as not to spoil the surprise for those who intend to play this chapter. Instead, what we are more than happy to reveal is that, finally, the series has got rid of an absolutely anachronistic control system, in favor of another renewed and in step with the times. No more invisible grids or jumps to be calibrated to the millimeter, nor sudden deaths due to oversized reactivity; the work of US programmers in this sense is certainly valid, allowing the player to perform all the movements in an immediate and rather natural way once he has had a minimum of practice. The range of available actions has been significantly increased, without however weighing down the effort of those in charge of the protagonist; for example it is possible, by pressing a button, to increase the speed of overcoming the passages in which Lara is clinging to the edges of an object, thus making them less tedious. More generally, all the actions that can be performed appear more cohesive, natural and immediate, with an important reflection in the enjoyment of the game. Obviously the combat phases have also been heavily revised; in addition to the firearms present, rather conventional and in line with those that the series has always proposed, the melee has been particularly expanded. Not only with kicks and slides at the disposal of the athletic archaeologist, but also a shot of Matrixian memory with which Lara uses the enemy as a bank to leap in slow-motion, only to then fill the victim with lead. A pleasant addition lies in the presence of some interactive elements of the scenario, such as explosive boxes or tanks full of petrol, highlighted by the presence of an icon and obviously ready to be hit. On the other hand, the inclusion of grenades is marginal, not particularly effective or fun to use. Brand new Lara Aware of the will of the fans of the series to return to wild settings and in search of ancient artifacts, the programmers have adopted this type of location in much of the adventure. An interesting and never dispersive level design certainly represents one of the most successful aspects of Crystal Dynamics' effort, as well as the inclusion of puzzles that are not particularly complicated or ingenious, but fun and in some ways ~new~ within the context of what has hitherto proposed by the Tomb Raider series. There are also some of the ~Shen-Mue~ quick time events, or sections in which it is necessary to quickly press the keys indicated on the screen to allow the survival of the heroine. In general, those who have played the Legacy of Kain series will notice some similarities in the spirit of the game; a beneficial influence, which transported the important Eidos franchise away from the abyss into which it had more than seriously risked falling. In one painting then FrOn the positive side, however, the presence of interlude sections on board a motorcycle, a Ducati to be precise, should unfortunately be noted, truly improbable and supported by a totally forgettable arcade mechanic. Luckily they are only a couple, rather short, but which clash with the general care that emerges from the rest of the adventure. those who have played the Legacy of Kain series will only notice some similarities in the spirit of the game Brand new Lara From a graphic point of view, it is clear that Tomb Raider Legend is a game born and raised with the ~current-gen~ consoles in mind, i.e. Ps2 and Xbox; the architectures, the richness of detail and the number of polygons are in fact absolutely excellent for such hardware, while inevitably disappointing once framed on platforms with far greater potential such as PC and Xbox 360. These latest versions are obviously the best, with solid fluidity and a handful of more graphic effects, but certainly not the most satisfying. Nonetheless, Lara Croft's latest adventure is also a positive product from an aesthetic point of view, which finds its most interesting elements in the animations of the protagonist, truly exciting. On the other hand, the management of the camera needs to be reviewed, which too often requires corrections by the player blocking itself on unusable points of view. The sound is also competent, but without infamy or particular praise. It's a shame that Tomb Raider Legend is a particularly short, albeit intense game; experienced players and fans of the series will not take more than 7 or 8 hours to reach the end credits, with the only weak stimulus to replayability deriving from the possibility of unlocking clothes, films and extras of this type. Comment Tomb Raider Legend is exactly what Angel of Darkness should have been, and wasn't. A real step forward in the series, progress from every point of view that finally abandons most of the elements that had aged badly, if not very badly, over the years. Crystal Dynamics has treasured the experience of the Legacy of Kain series, proposing an interpretation of Tomb Raider in step with the times, but also faithful to the key aspects that have made the success of the archaeologist. A successful mix, which finds its weaknesses mainly in an unintelligent camera and in an excessive overall brevity. But Eidos can be satisfied, as well as fans of the series, because this is undoubtedly the right path to follow. Pros responsive control system good looks is the right way to go Cons dull camera far too short sound can be improved Cross-platform The situation is easily imaginable, with the 360 and PC versions better from an aesthetic point of view but only thanks to a more stable frame rate, higher quality textures and some extra effects. Nothing worth tearing your hair out of, and by choosing the Ps2 or Xbox editions you certainly won't regret the ~superior~ ones too much. Among the most interesting themes related to the last decade of the world of video games, there is undoubtedly the crisis of ~characters~, or those authentic icons capable of creating legions of fans and transcending the limited environment of the video game itself. From Playstation onwards, or from the standardization of the market, the ~old~ characters have struggled to find space; but it wasn't a question of a generational change, but of a creative flattening towards the protagonists in favor of a greater interest in the exploitation of the new three-dimensional environment. Obviously there were exceptions, and Lara Croft is certainly one of them. On the other hand, how else could one define a phenomenon that has invaded the covers of newspapers of all kinds, given rise to two cinematographic films, changed the dictates of fashion and prompted women to undergo plastic surgery?", "date": "2006-04-21", "grade": null}
