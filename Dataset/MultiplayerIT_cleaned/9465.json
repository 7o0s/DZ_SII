Software houses and publishers understood this instantly, and it should therefore come as no surprise that the App Store is teeming with more or less successful reissues of Monopoly, RisiKo and Carcassonne. But probably few people know about Neuroshima Hex!, a Polish strategic complex conceived by Michal Oracz and based on a hexagonal grid and a handful of tiles to be arranged turn by turn, which has recently expanded its audience thanks to an excellent porting for devices iOS. However, let's clarify one thing: when it landed on the App Store last September, the iPhone version of Neuroshima Hex was much less clean, with an excessively steep difficulty curve and absolutely no tutorials to guide the player through the intricate rules. All too obvious defects, but which the developers have tried to correct with the various updates, up to this version 1.20 subject of our review. From table to tablet Neuroshima Hex is certainly not the Game of the Goose, and the full-bodied manual that can be browsed from the options is clear proof of this. Strengthened by the criticisms received in the weeks that followed the launch, and inspired by the excellent work done by TheCodingMonkeys with Carcassonne, the guys at Big Daddy's Creations have however added a full-bodied video that explains step by step those few basic rules useful for starting to play . Furthermore, from any moment of a game it is possible to access the pages of the manual or read all the information on each tile in the field. However, to discover all the details and information useful for applying more complex strategies, it is still necessary to waste some time reading the manual, precisely because of the quantity and complexity of the rules. Here we limit ourselves to describing the game as a strategy game in which two to four players compete on a hexagonal grid divided into 19 spaces. After placing their headquarters, each has 35 tiles to draw at the beginning of their turn and place on the game table, while the aim is to bring the opponent's energy to zero. The tiles include combat units, which stay in play and carry out their attacks, or instant actions, which are resolved on the spot and have specific functions: for example, you cannot attack an opponent until someone draws and play the Battle tile. Obviously each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses, where what gives strategic depth is the fact that each hexagonal tile only affects certain sides, forcing the player to think carefully before placing them on the grid. There are also some persistent modifiers, which modify the adjacent tiles positively or negatively. In short, Neuroshima Hex is characterized by a remarkable design, which on the one hand is able to exalt fans of the most hardcore strategic games, and on the other manages to be more accessible and immediate thanks to the fact that the player no longer has to Loaded with solving battles and calculating damage: since the more static and monotonous phases are now automated, the game feels decidedly fluid, dynamic and fast. The latest updates have then introduced serious improvements to the interface, adding all those little precautions that make a board game enjoyable on a small touchscreen interface. Also very interesting is the way in which Big Daddy's Creations has tried to make navigation more familiar to the average iPhone user: for example, to discard a card from your hand you have to hold it down for a few moments, until it starts to shake, allowing you to remove it just like the iOS dashboard icons. Furthermore, unlike other board games on the App Store, Neuroshima Hex also looks very good on an aesthetic level, with a detailed and flashy grid, fantastic artwork, excellent transitions and impeccable menus. Considering that support for Retina Display has recently been integrated, and that music and sound effects accompany each game perfectly, it can be safely said that Neuroshima Hex has become one of the best transpositions of a board game on the iPhone and iPad. The only gigantic flaw concerns the limitation of the multiplayer mode: if in single it is possible to face both a quick game and a personalized one, allowing you to choose a specific faction or to set the skill level of the enemy AI, the compoonline institution is limited only to leaderboards and achievements unlockable through Game Center; it is not even possible to challenge a friend via WiFi or Bluetooth, and the only alternative is to play locally, exchanging the device at each turn.
