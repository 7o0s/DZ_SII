The film of the same name has recently arrived in Italian cinemas, and the dutiful videogame adaptation was certainly not long in coming, appearing on the usual plethora of different systems: PC, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, 2 PSP and Nintendo DS, practically a invasion, as is always the case with tie-ins from children's films. Sega must have rubbed their hands, at the time of acquiring such an impactful license, imagining large monetary returns. What is certain is that the work done on The Golden Compass does everything to live up to the syllogism that wants the tie in as a mediocre videogame product, or worse. The story sees Lyra Belacqua, an orphan who lives in a parallel world inhabited by talking animals and spirits of various kinds, engaged in an adventure in the ice together with a fighting polar bear, Lorek, and his daimon, or an alter ego animal-shaped mutant. The film itself has already been criticized from various quarters for having oversimplified the reference story, flattening what is a rather adult fairy tale into a classic children's blockbuster full of special effects and with little depth. The video game does even worse, in turn simplifying and watering down what was good in the film, moreover confusing the player who does not know the story through an absurd construction of the plot which, messing up the chronological order, starts in medias res and then return to the beginning, also causing repercussions to the general pace of the game. Three characters looking for a game The game allows you to alternate between the three main characters of the story: the protagonist Lyra, her personal dmon called Pantalaimon, and the armored polar bear Lorek. Each of these has special characteristics and abilities, and the use of one or the other determines significant variations in the interaction with the scenario and in the possibilities of action. In essence, the game is an action-platform with various side elements, in which, moving from one character to another, we will find ourselves fighting against enemies and solving simple puzzles until the end of each level. Essentially, each character is delegated a certain role, and a certain way of acting: Lyra has no attack moves, so her function is mostly walking, running, jumping over bottomless crevasses, climbing platforms, moving objects and operate switches. The protagonist therefore has the main role, but frequently we will be forced to call on the help of the supporting characters. With the simple pressure of a button, Pantalaimon, the animal alter ego, comes into action, capable of changing shape and therefore adapting to different situations: in the form of a rodent he can dig to eliminate obstacles, transforming into a bird he can fly and reach places inaccessible to others, or in the form of a cat can attack any threats with claws. On the other hand, Lorek, the armored polar bear, is left with the most appropriate role: to fight. With the mere possibility of running and pawing, the bear's help is required in the phases in which the enemy is particularly threatening, and at that point the game transforms into a sort of scrolling fighting game of the animal genre. The variety of action would therefore seem guaranteed, with three different game sections composing the gameplay. The problem is that each phase is sketchy and not very fun: the platform sections are not very satisfying due to a level design without thickness and some obvious problems in responding to commands, the combat phases take place by simply pressing a single key repeatedly. The interaction between Lyra and Pan is saved, with the various mixed phases of exploration and solution of simple puzzles which, if nothing else, requiring the alternate (or simultaneous) use of the two characters, offers slightly more interesting solutions to the game action, but we are still far from the real fun. As for the integration of the touch screen, we are at historic lows: the stylus is used practically only to select some options, completely detached from the actual structure of the game. Swinging realization Even the technical sector, unfortunately, characterized by graphics entirely in 3D, certainly does not shine in terms of manufacturing quality: this A2M product is indeed distinguished by certain rather crude style falls. To tell the truth, the results are fluctuating: some levels are pleasant, made up of locations that are also well done, or generally decent, as happens in the first levels set among the polar ice of the land of bears. Further on, the phasesinside Jordan College or in the city they are instead characterized by a truly remarkable flatness. Even in the creation of the characters, which probably represent the most accurate part of the game, La Compasso d'Oro reveals the lack of depth that must have marked the entire programming phase. The basic animations for the main movements are in fact quite convincing, but it is clear that not the slightest effort has been made to try to make everything as harmonized as possible. Pantalaimon's transformations are not displayed, in the sense that the character passes from one form to another without the slightest morphing effect or intermediate animation frame. Lyra's running animation is simply the movement used for walking, but sped up, with a result that frankly verges on the ridiculous. The game also adopts a double screen display of dubious utility (both screens show practically the same elements, from the same angle), which moreover obviously weighs down the game engine, causing all the action to slow down when more elements enter the scene together. Finally, despite having to do with an important film license, all the extra-game elements, although of great importance in these cases, are decidedly reduced to the bone: the narration is delegated to low-level 2D reproductions of the faces of the characters who, in the foreground, make it clear who is saying the sentence written in the dialogues, a decidedly uninteresting way to bring the player into the plot (already penalized by the strange chronological construction mentioned above). Therefore, no cut scenes or videos to discover by continuing in the game, an incentive that could instead be important, given the general flatness of the gameplay. Comment After a film adaptation that did not fully meet the expectations of book lovers, The Golden Compass also wins a rather poor video game adaptation. In this case, the Sega brand did not mean a high profile in terms of quality, and the game proved to be unconvincing in all the various versions in which it entered the market. This one for Nintendo DS is characterized by a mediocre technical realization, but above all by a structure and a level design that absolutely fail to do what a good video game is called upon to do above all: entertain. If to this we also add the lack of concentration on the non-playful narrative elements (presentation, cutscenes and video), which in a film license should be the master, we have a complete picture of the insufficiency of the game. Pros: Sympathetic the use of the transformable Daimon Some locations are interesting Cons: Poor quality technical realization Game structure that fails to entertain Poor enhancement of the plot and dialogues", "date": "2008-01-07", "grade": null}
