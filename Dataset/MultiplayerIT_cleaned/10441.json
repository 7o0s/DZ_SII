{"name": "Nelle terre selvagge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71526-borderlands-nelle-terre-selvagge.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 Despite coming out in a period full of releases, with the risk of being engulfed by hearing the famous/infamous market analyst Pachter from famous titles such as Modern Warfare 2 and Dragon Age, Borderlands has all the credentials to emerge on the strength of its peculiarities and its unique style. It could easily be defined as a sleeper hit, a minor production not particularly trumpeted by the specialized press, but the pedigree of the Gearbox developers (Brothers in Arms among many) immediately warns us about what awaits us, or a triple A title with all the trappings of chance, which plays equally with both modern warfare and the age of dragons. The art of looting Superficially Borderlands is in all respects a game that follows the ~kill-loot-equip~ scheme or rather a sort of Diablo with guns. Therefore, the specter of a heavy comparison with Fallout immediately leaves. In confirmation of this thesis there is also the importance and weight that the plot plays in the total mixture of the title, which is roughly equal to zero. In the role of one of the four available characters we find ourselves on the planet Pandora in search of an imaginary treasure of alien origin hidden in a crypt to be found who knows where. That's all, the difference between main missions and secondary missions is very subtle, the former are numerically inferior but guarantee us access to new areas, more money and often more valuable loot, the latter instead reward us with money, weapons and upgrades in variable quantities. Lovers of an articulated, well-written and full of twists story could turn up their noses, but thanks to the setting of the title, this problem runs smoothly without too many worries. During our raids through Pandora, a desolate and dusty planet that immediately reminds us of the post-atomic atmospheres of a Mad Max, we will visit villages and meet different people. In these places it will be possible to acquire missions (especially secondary ones) just like in MMORPGs through panels, while speaking with a few selected inhabitants, in most cases the main mission will be carried out. Everything is functional to increase experience and to equip new weapons, new shields and new grenades. It's not important to know who the Eridian aliens are, what matters to us is to be powerful enough to be able to use their technology, their weapons. The missions accumulate and are carried out regardless of the hours that pass in the grip of a sort of ~compulsive looting syndrome~, the accumulation is not an end in itself and fortunately Gearbox was smart in not forcing us to use only weapons most powerful ever. In fact, the various classes of enemies, which certainly do not shine for artificial intelligence, can be killed by paying particular attention to their weak points. For example, those without a shield suffer particularly from fire, explosive and acid damage, on the contrary if protected by a shield it is better to hit them initially with electric weapons, while the beasts of the desert Skag and psycho-dwarfs prove particularly intolerant of shotguns. The combinations are many and in the excited firefights we will often find ourselves changing weapons, shocked by the fact that what appears to be a ridiculous little pistol is much more lethal than a robust and noisy assault rifle. Lethal choices Kill, kill and kill some more. This is the Borderlands leitmotiv, however, declined in four different styles, depending on who you chose at the beginning. The classes present represent the typical stereotypes of the RPG genre. We have the soldier, good at medium and long distances, the tank, lethal up close thanks to his resistance and his iron fists, the siren, a fast and lethal group rogue and the hunter who prefers fighting from afar thanks to his his passion for sniper rifles. To these basic differences is also added the different special ability for each type: the soldier deploys an automated machine gun turret, the tank goes berserk, hitting harder and regenerating energy, the siren becomes invisible also adding area damage, while the hunter calls a sort of falcon to the rescue to help him slaughter his enemies. In addition to increasing experience (in addition to the greater skill with the most used weapon) it is possible to spend the points acquired in various passive skills, such as more damage, less recoil or more capacious magazines for weapons, more energy and more shields, more power and duration for your class signature attack. Customizing your arsenal is therefore the heart of the game. The barrage of possibilities continueda with shields, more or less powerful or more or less slow in recharging, suitable for one type of damage rather than another, the various types of grenades, ~sticky~, ricochet, fragmentation or teleported or the very expensive mods of class, which increase their own peculiar skills, very useful especially in the perspective of multiplayer games. Borderlands would seem a complex game, full of statistics and information to read, with frequent moments in which we stop to choose what to keep and what to sell, but luckily for us, every item released by enemies in a completely random way, but which still takes into account of the level reached, it is presented to us in a comfortable overlay directly in the game which informs us of its characteristics by comparing them with the weapon in hand, a way that avoids the continuous switching from the inventory. Deadly amusement park Pad in hand how does all this translate? Borderlands before being a Diablo-style RPG is a solid FPS. The long wanderings through the vast areas of Pandora could be boring, since in the end it is mostly about traveling to a certain point, killing everyone or picking up/operating something and then coming back for the reward, but thanks the good level design with areas full of shelters, high points and hiding places where you can recharge your shield, the action is never too repetitive also because as previously written the good variety of enemies, never too unbalanced with respect to the level reached, guarantees a rather diverse approach to shootings. This thing that balances an underdeveloped artificial intelligence that takes into account only the basic characteristics of the enemy, with some who by their nature charge with their heads down and others who keep more to the side, preferring to strike from a safe distance. Obviously the danger of repetitiveness is around the corner, but in such a game it is a calculated risk: the ardor in the search for new paraphernalia compensates for a barely hinted plot, a total and due respawn of enemies and missions that are almost always the same. In fact, the customization of your alter ego is so well implemented, that it doesn't matter to do tons of secondary missions waiting to perform the main one without worries, which is too demanding. Speaking of difficult missions, it is interesting to know how Gearbox handled the departure of his character. You often die in the game, but luckily for us the experience gained as well as the weapons are not lost. The rebirth in the many save points is paid in solid dollars, which however are found in abundance all over the planet. However, you shouldn't go overboard by entering the scene with your head down and shooting at random, since the amount of money you pay goes hand in hand with the level of your hero and ammunition is not always within reach. To make the moment of death spectacular, it is then possible in the moments that proceed with the actual death, with the screen turning blood red, to try to kill an enemy; if you succeed, you return to the game with a fraction of the shield and energy. Ultimately Pandora is basically a kind of large-scale target practice, a sort of immense playground in which to move around while constantly ~training~ for the next challenge: villages, abandoned mines, Skag-infested canyons, factories and wind farms are the our own shooting range, where you can experience the effectiveness of our arsenal seamlessly. It matters little if everything is linked only by a simple narrative plot, the story in Borderlands is our inventory, our firepower. Once the game is over, it is also possible to replay it while keeping your stats and your arsenal unchanged; the enemies will immediately be more difficult, more or less equivalent to our level, guaranteeing a respectable challenge and a loot with more valuable and devastating weapons and mods. An evening with friends If the single player works, but is still prone to a certain basic repetitiveness that could alienate many users, the potential of Borderlands literally explodes in games with multiple players. The menu is rich, you can play cooperatively over the network, locally via uplink or vertical split screen. The perfect calibration of the four classes present brings a good tactical part to the game in addition to the frenzy of the first-person action. Mind you, you don't play by strictly following the limits imposed by your character (fortunately, for example, everyone can heal others) but knowing how to fight enemies to the best of your ability is a source of great satisfaction. The boredom factor disappears in the face of a well-knit party, which one knows how to coordinate perfectlyand it is very important that he manages the loot collection phases with good prudence. Those who believe that playing with more people is equivalent to a drastic reduction in difficulty are completely wrong: the resistance of the enemies naturally increases, the same thing goes for experience points and loot. By choosing the multiplayer mode it is possible to participate in a started game or in a brand new one both with a character created from scratch and with one developed in the single player. The only thing to keep in mind is that if you enter a game later than ~your personal story~ the missions will not be counted, while fortunately experience and weapons will. The ideal is that the one who is furthest behind creates the match having also the foresight to choose traveling companions more or less at the same level to avoid single shots one shot one kill. To further diversify the action in each type of game chosen, it is possible to challenge your partner in a sort of duel to the death that blocks the game in a sort of space-time bubble or you can enter one of the many PvP arenas scattered around Pandora. Xbox 360 goals The game rewards the player with 1000 points for a total of 50 achievements, among which 8 are secret. The objectives are not particularly difficult to obtain, they are earned with the simple progression in the game, reaching a certain level or gradually unlocking the areas of Pandora. The others concern the number of enemies killed with special abilities, or with elemental damage weapons, the number of missions completed in cooperative and many others. The most interesting achievement is one that rewards the player with 10 points for playing with someone from Gearbox or at least someone who was lucky enough to do so. Cartoon splatter Technically, Gearbox's work is of great value, the radical change in style, from ~normal realistic textures~ to cel shading has certainly strengthened the game, giving it a unique and peculiar visual style. The strong and unsettling global impact is therefore that of a comic and cartoonish world, ironic and never too serious, with warm colors during the day and a strange night effect when the sun goes down (there is in fact the day-night cycle). Speaking of textures, the choice to resort to the comic book look brings with it what superficially may appear as flatness and lack of detail, but on closer inspection everything is functional to the style chosen by the developers. Instead, what is entirely questionable is the paucity of life on Pandora: animals and enemies aside, the planet is basically deserted. Not that we expected a pulsating setting like in Grand Theft Auto, the game doesn't require it, but one is taken aback to see an empty world that only comes to life when the guns are drawn. The character design is decidedly positive, with a good variety of bandits and soldiers to kill, some really well characterized such as the aforementioned psycho dwarfs, the ~hard gyms~ or some huge bosses, while a decided applause goes to the mentor robot Clap Trap, the only smooth-talking artificial being on amphetamines. The animations are good and what should be emphasized is the splatter that is particularly present, which goes hand in hand with the power of our weapons. We pass with ease from simple kills that make the hit enemy collapse, to shots that make the head explode in a nice fountain of blood or even better, single bullets that pulverize the bodies as if it were dynamite! The only real criticality that afflicts Borderlands, more than some sporadic drops in frame rate, is an insistent pop-in of textures when loading (actually rather long) a new area. Sometimes more than ten seconds pass before the game world takes on its final appearance. The video review", "date": "2009-10-23", "grade": "8.7"}
