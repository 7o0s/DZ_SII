If you have not yet understood what we are talking about, perhaps it is not entirely your fault; but in fact it is also difficult that you have never noticed the productions of GIANTS Software, and published by Focus Home. Farming Simulator, in detail, is the most credible, deep and rich rural life simulator: it puts the player in the role of the entrepreneur of a farm, which will be taken (literally) from rags to riches. Furthermore, although it is not a recent title, Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition now has a large number of additional contents available, which are definitely worth knowing. And you will know them precisely in the review. The news The Farming Simulator 19 review dates back to November 2018, so two years have passed since the first version of the game arrived on the market; no new Farming Simulators have been released in the meantime, and in fact there was no need. As you will remember, the 2019 chapter promised substantial renewals at the time, which in fact only went so far. But with 24 months of additional time things have definitely improved. Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition has decent news to offer players, in addition (of course) to all the basic content of the standard edition. The latter, we recall, is offered at the price of 29.99 euros on PlayStation 4; the Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition costs 49.99 euros instead, but for some reasons. In fact, it includes a whole series of expansions and DLCs: the Alpine Farming Expansion (very recent), the Kverneland & Vicon Equipment Pack, the Bourgault DLC, then again the John Deere Cotton DLC, the Anderson Group Equipment Pack, the John Deere XUV865M Gator DLC, the CLAAS DOMINATOR 108 SL MAXI DLC and finally the - CLAAS TORION 1914 Dev Mule DLC. Now, there are two cases: if you know the world of agricultural entrepreneurship and the Farming Simulator series in general, you will have already understood that most of these DLCs and expansions provide for the introduction of new licensed agricultural machinery; all really existing brands, complete with logos, vehicles and tools created ad hoc within the game engine. Instead, everyone else will see a string of incomprehensible names. We would like to underline one aspect above all: namely the presence of the Alpine Farming Expansion. On balance it is the most important novelty of all, because it introduces new fields to cultivate on the high European mountains, and then also 30 machines never seen before, including the Aebi CC 66, the first ever motorized mower of the Farming Simulators . Gameplay The novelties on the gameplay side of Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition are reduced to a minimum: basically the gaming experience is the same as it was possible to see at the launch in November 2018; what changes are precisely the possibilities offered by some unpublished agricultural vehicles, and by a handful of scenarios never seen before in the series. However, more generally and from certain points of view, the offer is practically identical to the past. The Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition player therefore finds himself, once again, having to balance the accounts of his farm: income and expenses, purchases and sales of the crop, repair of vehicles and so on. In all of this obviously (and it is actually what interests fans of the franchise the most) it will be necessary to plow, hoe, sow, irrigate and harvest. In the first moments of the ~career~ (which in reality has not been revised or enhanced, and remains a mere pretext) Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition will try to teach the buyer everything that the title has to offer; and the contents are really many, perhaps even excessive given that - only considering the agricultural vehicles - by now the series has exceeded 400 abundant units. The first hours will be spent exploring one's own plots, and understanding how and in which way the fields to be cultivated should be managed. From then on it will be a continuous refinement operation: the player will dedicate himself to the management of an activity that is increasingly competitive on the market, delegating secondary operations to ~farm workers~ and workers hired to perform specific tasks (the most boring ). Playstation 4 trophies Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition brings several valuable Trophies to PlayStation 4, including the Platinum Trophy. To get it, however, you will have to play a lot and thoroughly explore all the possibilities offered by the title. A matter of time, rather than skill: be a patient grower. The conversion In the case of FarmingSimulator 19 Premium Edition must also be analyzed separately the conversion on PlayStation 4: you will remember, in fact, how the launch on PC was marred by some technical problems. We haven't noticed anything like this on the Pro version of the Sony console, and performance should be optimal on the standard one too. It goes without saying that commands and management of agricultural vehicles have been revised in terms of controllers, so going from PC you will need a few hours and careful study before being able to adapt; but with a little patience you can do anything. There is also no objection to optimization and performance: Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition practically never crashed, and we only encountered minimal slowdowns in some fairly crowded situations on our farm, for example when we were harvesting an entire cotton crop. However, the physical and graphic engine remains the one already seen on PC, which among other things did not make one cry for a miracle; and there's nothing particularly exciting, visually, not even on consoles. After all, Farming Simulator 19 Premium Edition is not one of those titles that needs to capture attention with its breathtaking scenarios: it must give its best on a simulation and realistic level, and here it succeeds abundantly.", "date": "2020-11-21", "grade": "8.0"}
