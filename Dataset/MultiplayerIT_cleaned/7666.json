This new downloadable content pushes the accelerator on all the qualities of the game to which it engages and its strong points are highlighted here. Narration, atmospheres, intelligent and never banal stealth action. Everything has been said about the game developed by Arkane Studios on behalf of Bethesda but for those who don't know it yet, it is enough to know that it was one of the most universally appreciated titles by critics and the public of the past year and of the entire videogame generation, precisely thanks to its originality but above all to a balanced and fun gameplay. Survival horror twist The events narrated in The Brigmore Witches are parallel to those experienced in the role of the main protagonist Corvo Attaneo but take place in a different but close time frame, intriguing and interwoven with the history of Dishonored in different points. The plot takes shape exactly where it left off with the first DLC, with a Daud engaged in fighting the disturbing Brigmore witches and who will transport him through three different settings: the first, already known, is the prison from which Corvo had to escape at the beginning of Dishonored, while the other two, much more inspired and evocative, are totally new. The adventure lasts approximately three hours (one hour per ~scheme~) and bases many of its strengths on the charm of the environments that host the protagonist. The world of The Brigmore Witches is alive, pulsating and full of things to tell or snatch through the many non-player characters that populate it. By getting closer to them we can catch conversations, dialogues, we can find documents, books to read and various types of texts that make the Dishonored universe even more fascinating and multifaceted. The settings, especially from the middle onwards, take on an almost horror, survival, strongly supernatural turn and you find yourself busy fighting between fantastic creatures, witches and monsters. The story can be continued by facing enemies face to face or, as tradition has it, with a stealth approach that allows us to avoid our antagonists without even making them suspicious. The structure of the missions remains unchanged compared to the previous DLC and base game, even if some notable new features have been introduced. For example, through the use of Corrupted Bone Amulets it is possible to exponentially enhance some parameters, but also taking into consideration that these power ups are to the detriment of other characteristics of the character. Daud's powers and abilities return once again, as well as the option to make friends with informants through small payments that allow us to get bonus items for missions and secondary objectives. With the Brigmore Steghe, Dishonored rediscovers elegance in storytelling and the importance of atmosphere Xbox 360 goals The developer has provided only 10 objectives for 220 points to unlock, almost all through special actions to be performed during the adventure. Necessary a look at the list before leaving, the most difficult is perhaps to complete the DLC without killing anyone: pure stealth. The other objectives are quite simple to obtain and will come naturally with the natural course of the story. Goodbye Dunwall Another substantial novelty is obviously the presence of the fearsome Witches, supernatural and hostile beings that emit chilling and horrific sounds. The game turns from being an action stealth to becoming a stealth survival horror. There is also an objective which, in order to be unlocked, requires us to complete the three hours of DLC without ever killing an enemy, just to make you understand how stealth the game structure can be. In direct clashes, precisely, the game perhaps shows some of its small flaws, sometimes resulting in a bit cumbersome and not very reactive with the commands and the multiple options it offers. The stealth action is once again the favorite, more fun and better done. Situations can be faced from various points of view and by performing very disparate actions, such as encircling the enemy and taking him out, running away, hiding without being seen and sneaking away, using secondary roads and so on. Once again the graphic sector edited by the French software house Arkane Studios is top-level: full of details, distant horizon, excellent environmental effects and first-rate level design. It is no coincidence that the team responsible for Dishonored and this DLC was chosen to co-develop BioShock 2together with 2K Marin, taking care of the artistic side and animations. The conclusion of this expansion with a bang leaves an almost melancholy aftertaste in all of us. On the one hand the beauty of a very successful DLC, once again edited and developed with head and heart, on the other the awareness of being faced with the conclusion of the universe created around Dishonored, just now that we were starting to love it and get to know it better. This Brigmore Witches must be played with even more greed hoping to find Daud and Corvo on the next consoles coming out this winter. Arkane Studios has demonstrated how a DLC can be created that not only expands the original universe, but completes it and makes it even deeper and richer than before: for this reason, the Brigmore Charmed is a strongly recommended purchase for all those who have enjoyed Dishonored.", "date": "2013-08-16", "grade": null}
