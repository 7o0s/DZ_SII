{"name": "Snakes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/snakes.html", "text": "The snakes are out! Introduced by a captivating hype, Snakes paradoxically presents itself as the simplest and at the same time the most complete product available for N-Gage. Downloadable for free at https://www.snakesoutbreak.com/, freely distributable to other users via Bluetooth (in fact, the emblematic Send Game item stands out on the main menu) and complete with a multiplayer mode for four users, the title Nokia deserves applause a priori just for these three characteristics. But Snakes goes further, giving - it is appropriate to say - to N-Gage owners a game that takes full advantage of the console's capabilities, not so much in terms of technical realization as on a conceptual level: therefore a product with a simple but exciting, ideal when you have spare time away from home (theoretically the primary function of portable video games) and an excellent interpreter of the potential of Bluetooth technology. The foundations of the game structure have remained the same as the old Snake, with the snake still busy swallowing bonuses in order to stretch and thus increase the score, but with some precious innovations. The single player mode is divided into about thirty missions, to complete which the user will have to store a set amount of points within a time limit. Operation that is carried out not only in the collection of classic bonuses, but also in the passage over colored stripes which, if followed in their entirety, give increasing score multipliers. Scattered within the scenario you can then find items such as extra lives or letters making up the words ~N-Gage~ and ~Snake~, useful for maximizing the score and unlocking secret levels. Not only that, the new snake from Snakes is capable of performing a much more complex series of moves, complete with acceleration, braking, a tight curve and the use of objects, and is even capable of destroying some walls to access limited play areas. All this while being careful not to hit unbreakable barriers or to backfire against a part of the snake's body, on pain of losing energy - or worse - a life. In short, old and new blend harmoniously in this new Snakes. Spread the snakes Simple and captivating in its single player mode, Snakes is certainly no less in terms of the multiplayer option. Up to four users can challenge each other simultaneously via Bluetooth in special arenas, with the obvious task of scoring more points than their opponents. This is achieved either by collecting more bonuses than the others or by defeating an opposing snake using a variety of different power-ups. Fun albeit afflicted by some slowdown in crowded situations, the multiplayer mode of Snakes is an undemanding but extremely effective, intelligent and immediately assimilable pastime. And if on an exquisitely playful level Snakes amazes with its enviable quality / price ratio, even in terms of technical realization the title developed by Iomo certainly cannot raise criticisms. Characterized by a futuristic-minimalist style in some ways similar to Tron, Snakes presents scenarios made up of colored square and hexagonal panels on which a snake with highly geometrical features moves, taken from a third-person view usable in four different heights. Everything moves at 25 frames per second, with some even valuable visual effects, such as explosions in the event of the snake's death or the rotation of the game axis when reaching the edge of an arena. On the sound front, however, there are effects that go well with the graphic style of the game and only a couple of audio tracks, however these are also in perfect harmony with the minimal look of Snakes. In short, to be a freeware game, one can certainly be more than satisfied. Comment Snakes is an excellent freeware product that exploits the bulk of the potential of N-Gage, to the point that one cannot help but consider it a real shame that it was only released now and not at the launch of the console. Simple in concept and construction but very captivating in both single and multiplayer modes, Snakes reaches a goal with disarming ease that several other productions have not been able to reach. Nokia's free and free-sharing experiment is therefore perfectly successful, in the hope that there are further titles capable of following this example. Pros: Winning single and multiplayer gameplay Nice technical build Completely free to download and distribute Cons: Occasional frame rate drops Control system a bit imprecise at timesclear. Originally born as an experiment by a group of students, Snake has become over the years one of the most famous video games in the world, thanks also to its permanent presence within the software of Nokia mobile phones. Precisely for this reason, it is almost surprising that this Snakes, a natural evolution of the original title, arrives only at this moment on N-Gage, at a considerable distance from its market launch. Even if late, however, the son of the undisputed king of mobile gaming has arrived, simple, fun and above all free", "date": "2005-02-23", "grade": null}
