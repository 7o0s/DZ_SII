{"name": "The Swapper", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120249-the-swapper-quattro-anime.html", "text": "If we were to attempt to describe The Swapper in one word, we would definitely call him brave. Being able to add another one, we would be talking about unscrupulousness. Facepalm Games, the development studio that created it, has chosen not to compromise by working with enormous rigor and creativity to match the game mechanics with the narrative side, while choosing to address profound themes without thinking too much about the market . The result is that on the screen we end up with something completely different from what we expected. The Swapper provides the player with two tools that represent the core of the gameplay: a wrist cloner and the Swapper that gives the game its title. The first is a device that is used to create clones of the protagonist. Maximum if they can generate four that follow our movements in all respects. Clones can be created within the character's line of sight, but not behind various obstacles. So it's not possible to shape one behind a wall, where maybe there's a button to press, but you have to find a way around the problem starting from another visible position. Clones can easily be reabsorbed - just tap them to see them literally vanish. In case they are left behind or get trapped somewhere, they die. The second tool, the Swapper, is also the most interesting to use: it allows you to move the soul from one body to another. We define it as the most interesting because it is around it that the game dictates its themes and the narrative axis, built with very simple means, especially textual, begins to extend up to the splendid ending (of which, of course, we will not tell you anything) . The gameplay thus becomes a way to reflect on the soul and its existence, on what it means to be able to ~change body~ and on the consequences of the death of the clones and their still being part of a whole, which will be irretrievably lost as the game progresses. history. Soul fragments The philosophical questions opened by the game are set in a science fiction world, the Theseus station, built as if it were an immense womb: closed and dark spaces that seem to have been abandoned for millennia, where in any case the signs of the passage of human beings are clearly visible (indeed, immanent). The scenario itself conveys a certain uneasiness, which enhances and magnifies the sense of oppression created by the plot. It will be for the visual style (each level was first built with plasticine and real materials, to then be reproduced in the game), or for the shrewd use of music and sound effects, but it is undeniable that The Swapper manages to capture the player in his coils, involving him without giving him easy escape routes or phone situations. It is here that we saw the ruthlessness and courage of the developers we mentioned above: in this being able to create a personal and narratively powerful work around the gameplay, without the need to spend billions on filmed or scripted sequences (which are more or less the same thing made with different means) or other pleasant solutions. We challenge anyone to pit The Swapper against the richest triple-A story driven titles to see which one manages to shock the player in the same way without giving him any way out. Puzzle and game structure It is true that we are dealing with a puzzle platform game with asynchronous puzzles and it is also true that the apparent Metroidvania-like structure is only, in fact, apparent, and that the exploration of the world proceeds linearly and without having to continually go back to the own steps. In reality, it is possible to go back if an area has not been completed, but you never have new powers to use and, at best, you can solve the puzzles left behind by exploiting the knowledge acquired. Let's also admit that some puzzles are quite easy (for example to overcome a chasm just build a clone on the other side and then use the Swapper to move the soul), even if in the second half of the game things get a lot more complicated and there are various rooms that take a long time to tame. Especially when the lights enter the field massively, some of which prevent the creation of clones, others the use of the Swapper and still others the use of both devices, you have to start thinking a lot to unravel the skein. There are also other obstacles to take into account, such as gravity which applies differently to each clone creating different headaches, but in general you go quickly without getting stuck for too long. Here, perhaps if there is a defect of The Swapper it is that it does not fully exploit its means to create greater difficulties for the gameactor. It must also be said, however, that by remaining stationary for too long, one would find oneself outside the story, which instead requires continuity to be fully understood. In short, even the low difficulty seems to be intended so as not to break the narrative and make it central to the gaming experience. How many souls does a human have? What does cloning yourself involve?", "date": "2013-06-20", "grade": "9.0"}
