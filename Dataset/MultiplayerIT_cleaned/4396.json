It's not enough to slavishly copy every detail to satisfy an alleged idea of nostalgia, but you also need to understand where you need to put your hands because even the great masterpieces of the past, rejuvenated of their inadequacies, can still tell us something that initially escaped us. That was the case with Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap some time ago, but it certainly isn't that of Secret of Mana, a remake for PC, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 that gets it wrong, well, on practically every front. We played it with our hearts in hand, remembering all the affection we feel for a series that is slowly leaving the scene: and while the Japanese are enjoying the conversion of the first three unforgettable chapters on Switch, we have a cold remake. The sword in the Stone Mind you, Secret of Mana at the time was a simply extraordinary title, but those who played it on Super Nintendo many years ago remember it with even more affection precisely because they manage to place it in a much broader context. Secret of Mana was Square's answer to Nintendo and The Legend of Zelda and the series, which began a couple of years earlier on the Game Boy, represented the first spin-off attempt for the Japanese developer of Final Fantasy. The state-of-the-art bitmap graphics and beautiful music by Hiroki Kikuta managed to involve the gamer, transporting him into a colorful fantasy world, full of strange enemies, anthropomorphic animals and magical powers. The remake developed by Square Enix tries to reproduce, without fully succeeding, that bizarre atmosphere, employing a more modern rearrangement of the soundtrack - which you may or may not like - and a polygonal graphics engine that makes the game look like a production for mobile systems . It is evident that Secret of Mana is a low-budget title, developed mainly for PlayStation Vita and then converted for its older sister and for PC: the initial glance is remarkable - the game is very colorful, detailed and lively - but they emerge well soon several flaws which, absurdly, make it seem more antiquated than its predecessor, if compared to the standards of 2017. The polygonal models are graceful and faithful to the style of Hiro Isono, but as soon as they move you realize the poverty of animations that distinguishes above all the enemies and the supporting characters, but also the unpublished cinematics that should tell the story with greater emphasis, and they succeed until the dubbing audio track starts (in English or Japanese) and the characters speak without moving their lips. The absence of expressiveness, in the end, trivializes the most important moments of the adventure. The premise, for example, is resolved in a few poor dialogues when Randi, our protagonist, recklessly extracts the Sword of Mana from a rock, being exiled from his own village as he is accused of having attracted the wrath of monsters on it. Together with a combative blonde named Prim and an imp called Popoi, Randi will have to regenerate the powers of the sword and prevent the Empire from getting their hands on the deadly Mana Fortress. Playstation 4 trophies The thirty-eight Secret of Mana trophies (1 platinum, 4 gold, 7 silver and 26 bronze) ask you to defeat all bosses, upgrade all weapons and spells, find every object and of course finish the game. All in all, it's not difficult to unlock them, as you just have to follow the story without neglecting any fights or secondary paths. But if it worked... The player commands one of the three protagonists directly, entrusting the others to a mediocre artificial intelligence or to two human players who can take control of them at any time, hoping they are more shrewd than the CPU. In fact, when playing alone, our group mates tend to take every single hit without committing to dodging, often forcing us to buy every minimum defensive accessory to always keep up with the enemies who litter every map. This means often finding yourself broke and learning to micromanage equipment and consumable purchases with a minimum of parsimony. On the weapons front, fortunately, it is enough to use those that are unlocked by continuing in the game to increase the competence of the characters who wield them and who will thus learn new special attacks or spells in the case of elemental magic. The real-time action combat system is mainly based on the blows that we can deliver by pressing a simple button, downloading an indicator that regenerates within a few seconds and which decrees the effectiveness of the next attack. Basically, the playerand must move and attack with the right timing in order to prevent the actions of enemies. In this remake, however, the poverty of the animations already underlined and the unprecedented possibility of attacking in any direction, and not only in the cardinal ones, in certain moments contribute to exponentially increase the level of difficulty and not because the game is actually more complex , but because it is more difficult to evaluate the reactions of the enemies or to protect our comrades, targeted from every angle. In the narrowest spaces you end up making a huge mess, to which the management of the inventory and the secondary menus contribute, for example, to choose which weapons or spells to use during combat. Pressing a key pauses the game and a ring appears in the center of the screen with the various options available. This stratagem, innovative at the time, becomes clumsy and cumbersome in the remake which clumsily manages both the position of the menu on the screen and the memorization of the selected options, resetting them each time and making access to the interface much more awkward. Secret of Mana continues like this for the twenty hours needed to complete it, even less if you know the complex world map and know where to go, without risking getting lost due to the meager indications offered by the supporting actors: it almost seems that Square Enix has done two steps back for every step forward and even the most interesting novelty of the package, represented by the dialogues that deepen the characters every time you stop at an inn, quickly loses all its charm, above all because they often end up focusing on the idiosyncrasies of the characters, repeating the same gags to exhaustion. It is in these moments that we regret the original and its slips, children of another time and, precisely for this reason, much easier to forgive.", "date": "2018-02-20", "grade": "5.5"}
