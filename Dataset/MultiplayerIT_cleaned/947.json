Indeed, the various Google Play and App Stores are full of exponents of the genre. The reason is simple enough to explain: they are immediate and easily manageable with touch controls. It's kind of the perfect marriage. On PC and consoles, runners are less interesting, either because many see them as smartphone titles, or because with controllers or keyboards they lose some of their charm. There are still many around, but how many reach the general public? In this Aerial_Knight's Never Yield is already a title that we can define as brave just for the fact that it exists, even if this virtue wasn't enough to turn it into an excellent game, as we will see in the course of the review. Game mechanics Never Yield was born as a personal project of the American Neil Jones (Aerial_Knight) Aerial_Knight's Never Yield tells of a certain Wally, a black boy on whom we are not given many biographical details, who has to flee from unidentified enemies, carrying documents of which we know nothing. The villains' objective is to prevent him from spreading secrets that could change the face of the futuristic Detroit that is the backdrop to the action. To find out how, you must first finish the game. Once we have started a game, we immediately realize that there aren't many options: we can only choose whether to change Wally's clothes or to face the campaign, selecting one of the three difficulty levels available (better to play the second or third immediately, given how easy it is the first). Then we start running. In fact we are faced with an obstacle course played to the rhythm of music. Wally can jump, slide and dash forward. Every obstacle, be it a window to break, a car that tries to run over us, a giant photocopier left in the middle of the corridor, or a large ultra-technological helicopter, can be overcome with one of four moves (five if we consider a ballet that can be performed in running , which, however, is only choreographic). Depending on the difficulty level selected, we will have more or less marked aids during gameplay: slow motion as the danger approaches and on-screen suggestions on the key to press to overcome it. We started it on our own at a medium difficulty level, then selecting the most difficult one, because the aids make it really too simple. Unfortunately, the first problem of Aerial_Knight's Never Yield is that it's all here, that is, that it runs out in its basic concept. Too limited The gameplay is very repetitive Compared to what is described, the only extra element is represented by special stages accessible by collecting coins during the action, which are completely optional. Be that as it may, from such a title one would expect the overcoming of obstacles phase to be varied and to offer multiple levels of complexity, in order to give the player satisfactory answers to his actions. This is simply not the case here and there is no prize for performing stunts or well-executed passes. Indeed, there aren't really stunts: you run, you press one of the four keys according to the obstacle to avoid, you run again, you overcome another obstacle and continue so on until the end of the level. The only challenging factor is the stopwatch that measures the time taken to reach the finish, interesting from a competitive point of view, but certainly not decisive for the general monotony that pervades everything. Basically we are dealing with a game with very poor mechanics, which unfortunately is not saved by the engaging soundtrack created in collaboration with Detroit underground artists, and by the captivating graphic style which, however stylized, manages to give the world of I play the right alternate tone. Too bad, however, for the repetitiveness of the scenarios, which often reproduce identical situations in environments that are all very similar to each other.", "date": "2021-05-19", "grade": "5.0"}
