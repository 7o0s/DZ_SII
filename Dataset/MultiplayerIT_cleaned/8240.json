And not just because it comes out in October, the preponderance of red, yellow and orange is noticeable everywhere, you can still feel the summer influence that makes you want to hang on to your shirt and stick your elbow out the car window. And take a nice picture with our girl in the beautiful Colorado scenery. But there's no time to contemplate, Darius Flynt has just challenged us to a supercar race and we fight back with the raw power of a Viper. A race with no holds barred between breathtaking scenarios begins, but we will never see the outcome, because after a few minutes of play the camera cruelly moves away to frame a smaller reality, that of an ordinary boy with an ordinary car. Simply another story we could say, ours. A small, mischievous appetizer to introduce us to this first spin-off of the Forza series. Not just an operation to keep the brand name alive, but a pretext to broaden the catchment area by presenting a different, less rigorous and more Arcade product. To do this, Turn 10 has given the keys to its precious graphics and physics engine to Playground Games, a dream team made up of some of the best British racing game developers. Read on to find out how this unusual handover went. Reinventing Strength We had left our Avatar at the mercy of his dreams, but in the end we are in a video game and dreams can come true. Just turn on the radio and tune into the festival channels of Forza Horizon, Colorado's most prestigious car competition. We fortuitously learn that some seats are still available, but we have to run to the ticket office to win them before our opponents. Thus begins a splendid career made up of a long series of championships, each marked by a colored bracelet, at the end of which, needless to say, the infamous Darius Flynt, the undisputed champion of the event, awaits us. The first hours of the game are rather guided and full of functional cutscenes to introduce us to the story. The Horizon festival is an explosive crossroads of cars, beautiful girls and eardrum-shattering music as the good Vin Diesel has accustomed us to in his high-testosteronic films, in which as many as 250 competitors participate. In this rowdy Babylon we have the pleasure of meeting the charming organizer of the races, the sarcastic mechanic and we become familiar with the central hub of the map, a real base where we can expand our garage by purchasing new cars from dealers, carry out upgrades or apply decals in pure Forza style. And of course level up by collecting more and more prestigious bracelets. Don't expect a particularly detailed story, the plot is little more than a pretext to offer a less impersonal experience than Forza has accustomed us to, while winking at sagas like Need For Speed, but it must be said that it works. Once you have acquired the basic resources to get started, the very soul of Forza Horizon opens up to the player, revealing a free roaming structure on a map that mimics the layout of Colorado thanks to painstaking photographic work carried out by the developers. The map is not gigantic but is characterized by an impressive variety, from the canyon area to the rocky mountains, presenting glimpses that are nothing short of wonderful thanks to the visual extension offered by the Turn 10 engine. The choice of location is not at all random, the climate arid justifies the absence of rain and snow, but on the other hand, and for the first time in the series, Playground Games has managed to insert a complete day-night cycle that you won't soon forget. Curiosity Once upon a time there was fast travel... then Playground Games arrived. Forza Horizon offers a truly ingenious system by exploiting certain locations that can shorten travel. However, in addition to the fact that they must be found first, their use is quite expensive, if not prohibitive in the first hours of the game. How to do then? Very simple, by performing various certain operations Stunt PR, which require the completion of objectives such as taking a photo in a specific place, passing speed cameras at certain speeds or performing breathtaking drifts. Completion involves progressive discounts towards the station concerned, while if you manage to complete them all, the move will be made for free. Gone are the days when everything was solved with a single click... Attack the crates We therefore have full freedom to explore the entire map, without limitations other than those related to the races related to the color of the braccialetto, which open as we get a new one. To do this we have to win certain points that can be accumulated in the various races, in addition to the credits that represent the game's currency. The latter are particularly important as they allow the purchase of new cars and upgrades, but also the exchange of decals in the store integrated in the editor. There is also a system of tokens that can be purchased from the Live Marketplace, capable of providing a series of facilities, paying them in microsoft points. A big difference compared to Forza 4 is represented by the possibility to choose the level of the opponent's artificial intelligence at the beginning of each race, in addition to the degree of simulation. This, together with the various freely configurable driving aids, affects the credit reward obtained. In this way we are free to choose the type of gameplay that suits us best, even if beyond the normal level, winning races without adequately prepared cars proves to be a prohibitive undertaking. Forza Horizon immediately imposed itself for its considerable variety, combining different styles that synthesize the best of what the British industry has been able to offer in terms of racing. The basic competition offers conventional races on asphalt and dirt, closed track or course, but Playground Games has included an endless series of extra content, from clandestine races that take place in full traffic to head-to-head against helicopters, hot air balloons and airplanes ( !). To highlight the presence in the map of a hundred billboards to be destroyed to get discounts in the upgrades, and several vintage cars to be found in the various barns and warehouses scattered throughout the locations, in pure Tarantino's Death Proof style, which we can even refurbish and use in the game. Also worth mentioning is the possibility of beating the record time of friends on the list by directly addressing their ghosts, a mode that alone is capable of sucking up whole hours. It's still. Everywhere there are special ~dream~ speed cameras capable of measuring the maximum speed and proudly updating it in the online rankings. In short, a lot of irons in the fire, and the developers have ensured that various additional contents will be released in the coming weeks (including a Rally mode) to always keep interest in the product alive. However, the real protagonist is the soundtrack, one of the most successful in recent years, not only for the number of songs - a good 66 and ranging from rock to electronica - but for the way they are used in the game thanks to the collaboration with DJ Rob de Bank. Playing with Willy Moon's Yeah Yeah is an experience, experiencing the first sunset with New Order's Blue Monday is priceless. As if such a riot weren't enough, all the pieces are played by three themed radio stations, freely selectable (Grand Theft Auto style) complete with radio speakers who comment on the races, give valuable advice or open hilarious curtains with the characters of the game. Everything is localized in Italian with excellent quality. Playing Forza Horizon away from a stereo system is truly a crime. Xbox 360 goals Forza Horizon offers 50 achievements for a total of 1000 player points. To get half of it, it is sufficient to complete the entire single player campaign, for the others long sessions will be necessary to satisfy the various conditions imposed by the Playground Games product. And don't forget to dive online! Good guide. English style Those who loved titles like Project Gotham Racing will feel like coming home with Forza Horizon, the development team includes former employees of Bizarre Creations, and it shows. The game constantly rewards driving thanks to the lively hud, which highlights and evaluates every manoeuvre, even a trivial spin, archiving everything in a special layered menu called Sponsor challenges. These are able to raise the ranking of our protagonist among the 250 of the competition, so that nothing is left to chance. Scoring maneuvers such as drifting is also pleasantly reminiscent of the Kudos system. In the mere presentation aspect, however, the influence of Codemasters is perceptible, with sparkling and dynamic menus and a visual style very close to the Dirt series. The heart of the game is much more forgiving than Forza, with an aesthetic only damage system and gameplay that undoubtedly urges Arcade dynamics. This does not detract from the fact that, by deactivating all the aids, the game is able to return a challenging driving system and which benefits from the physics system guaranteed by the Turn 10 graphics engine. However the programmers have worked hard to add featuresic requests loudly, such as the aforementioned day-night cycle and an impressive series of effects, at the price, however, of a cut to the framerate, which drops to 30, rocky frames per second. The result is that Forza Horizon manages to acquire a distinct personality, in some ways all English, compared to its American older brother, and to which small sins are forgiven such as the limited interaction of the environment, more attributable to the limitations of this generation than at the work of programmers. Obviously, there is also online multiplayer, separate from the single campaign, which features a series of modes ranging from standard racing to those already seen in Forza, such as mouse hunting or king, or the possibility of running freely with friends on the map . Unfortunately, at the time of the review, the servers worked on and off, allowing us only to carry out a part of the many modalities, which took place without particular line impediments.", "date": "2012-10-22", "grade": "9.0"}
