The review of Hotshot Racing is therefore a starting point to retrace the avenue of memories, because the reference to that historical period and specifically to the SEGA arcade racing games is more than evident: it is in fact not only a quote, but of a real attempt to rediscover the playful lexicon of - mainly - Virtua Racing, but also Daytona USA and Namco's Ridge Racer. An idea not necessarily very original, given that Horizon Chase had already recently attempted something similar, however going to be placed closer to Out Run. In any case Hotshot Racing, already known during development under the name of Racing Apex and developed by the English of Lucky Mountain Games in collaboration with the most famous Sumo Digital, has arrived on the market generating the sincere attention of many former arcade goers. On the other hand, bringing that feeling back to the present day by refreshing it and renewing it with current technologies should be the recipe for guaranteed success... right? A gameplay that does not convince The first impact with Hotshot Racing is evidently exciting above all thanks to the artistic component, based on a very stylish low poly style based on bare polygons, which pays homage to the glorious past without however appearing excessively vintage: a good combination that can almost always be appreciated, even if with some missteps such as some poorer and more anonymous sections of the tracks or rather shifting attention to the design of the riders, trivial and not at all incisive. Each of the 8 selectable characters has access to 4 exclusive cars to choose from, which differ in the classic values of speed, acceleration and drift. In reality, in practice, the differences between the various racing cars are less palpable than one might expect and, also thanks to a very simplistic and direct gameplay, which does not leave much room for in-depth analysis and nuances. The basic idea of the developers is evidently that of giving life to a very accessible racing game, with a practically zero learning curve: anyone with a minimum of experience with the genre will find no difficulty in tackling the circuits by fully pressing the gas, dosing the drifts during the curves and possibly spending the turbo collected thanks to them in the appropriate bar. The driving model is pleasant, even if in reality a bit too nave even bearing in mind the intentions of the English team: the simplicity of the physical model, the lightness of the cars almost indifferent to inertia and the classic rubber band artificial intelligence make the races all somewhat the same, with the only difference generated by the greater combativity of the opponents at higher difficulty levels. The tracks then, even with some interesting peaks of track design, lack verticality, making the above sensation of repetitiveness even stronger. There are 16 in all, not exactly a record number. Being few, it would have been reasonable to expect a particular care in their realization, but instead it is difficult to find memorable passages. In short, in essence Hotshot Racing conquers at first glance, but deeper knowledge highlights defects and imperfections that cool the love story rather quickly. To complete the main mode it is necessary to complete the 4 individual championships structured with the classic points classification, each consisting of 4 different tracks, in all 3 difficulty levels. Apart from the greater aggressiveness of the opponents, there are no differences whatsoever, a further factor of fatigue in the medium term. In Multiplayer it is better Where Hotshot Racing tries to make up for it is in the surrounding contents, starting with the possibility of unlocking extra elements by spending the currency earned with your victories. However, yet another source of displeasure lies in the fact that these are not improvements in the performance of the vehicles or special skills of the drivers, which would undoubtedly have provided a concrete and tangible stimulus to progression, but simple cosmetic changes to the car liveries or clothing of pilots without any kind of impact on performance. Considering that in no case are these changes particularly incisive or attractive, it is easy to understand how this portion of the game also leaves various perplexities. Fortunately, the list of available modes is more convincing, which for the single player adds time trials and single races to the championship just described. In multiplayer dthere is even more fat, starting with the possibility of playing locally in split screen up to 4 and which goes well with the 90s atmosphere of the title: when online gaming was an idea for visionaries, it was right in the living room of the house that friends called to challenge each other in front of the same TV. Obviously, in this way, especially on not very large screens, you can struggle a bit, but it remains an almost exciting sensation for older players, and more generally a very uncommon mode nowadays. There are also a couple of variations on the theme, called Guardie e Ladri and Corri or Explodi which give the product a little more breathing space, offering the opportunity to jump into some alternative to the traditional race. Lastly, there is finally the online multiplayer for up to 8 players, structured in a very elementary but effective way, which at the time of the review, however, suffers from a lack of users such as to prevent more in-depth judgments from being made.", "date": "2020-09-16", "grade": "7.0"}
