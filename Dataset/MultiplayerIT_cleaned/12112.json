{"name": "Sudden Strike Mobile Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sudden-strike-mobile-edition.html", "text": "You can't improvise masters out of the blue, and maybe that's why Living Mobile didn't want to create a war video game from scratch and thought it best to use a series already established in the PC environment such as Sudden Strike. The strategy developed by Fireglow Games, in fact, already enjoys a certain popularity and its name is known to fans of the genre and not. What's more, the game has a structure that could be played on mobile without too much upheaval and it did. Once Sudden Strike Mobile Edition has started, and the language has been selected, we will be faced with the possibility of trying our hand at the tutorial or with one of the three campaigns available (German Campain, Russian Campain and Allied Campain), each consisting of four missions. The tutorial is absolutely essential to understand what to do and how to do it in this reduced version of Sudden Strike. In this case, we will lead a group of soldiers and we will have to achieve certain objectives from time to time, thinking carefully about how to do it and organizing each sortie in the most sensible way. Our soldiers have a certain sight range, graphically represented by a dotted circle, and can identify (and hit) all enemy units that fall within that area. Not all soldiers have the same value in this sense, for example snipers manage to hit from very far away and sometimes it is possible to access buildings to be able to look further and ~guide~ the shots of our allies. The fact that you can enter some buildings, as well as use heavy weapons and vehicles, is one of the great strengths of SSME, an element that makes everything more varied and multifaceted. In fact, the game is not reduced to a clash of numbers, in which the largest platoon necessarily wins: strategy is important and we need to exploit the environment that surrounds us to get the better of the enemies, albeit in a decidedly ~synthetic~ environment and also and above all suitable for a short and impromptu use. On a technical level, Sudden Strike Mobile Edition looks very good, with a rather fluid scrolling that offers us an overview of the locations every time. These are distinguished by a good level of detail, managing to never be too repetitive in the graphic elements (great value). Even the soldiers are well done, in their small way. And the sound commentary for once is catchy and not annoying. As far as the control system is concerned, in practice the mouse functions have been replaced by the use of the joystick and the FIRE button, which in combination with other numeric keys allows us to move our units, interact with objects and use weapons extra.
