Cutting intermediaries and unnecessary expenses, communicating directly with your community. However, an independent product does not automatically mean a masterpiece. And to demonstrate how being original and having even brilliant intuitions does not bring an essential game to the digital shelves, we find Cortex Command, a title that has been awaited for years now and has been available for a few days on Steam for just under twenty euros. Who needs a body? In the future, our brains will no longer necessarily be linked to the body but, just like in Futurama, they will be able to live independently and choose the support they prefer among those created artificially. Thanks to this nice expedient, Cortex Command establishes some basic rules to lay the foundations for its gameplay: in levels developed on two dimensions, the player will have to protect the brain, while trying to reach and eliminate the enemy one (even if it will not be the only objective proposed by the game) by taking control of different units. These can be purchased and sent to the field via rocket, while the money used to make purchases in the shop will be recovered by digging the ground in search of precious gold. The strategic content element of Cortex Command is rich and deep, asking to protect your base with units, turrets, shields and so on. The robots called on the field can not only be controlled directly by the player, but by giving them simple orders they can be left under the direction of artificial intelligence. The gameplay does not change much in the two modes available, namely Campaign and Scenario. The first will pit you against the computer or other players and will require you to conquer and protect the bases, which simply represent the levels included in the game, in order to eliminate multiple opposing brains. The management and implementation of one's own headquarters is not very intuitive and there is a lack of some more suggestions from the developers. The scenarios, on the other hand, are independent levels. On the other hand, the variety of situations and tasks proposed is interesting, effectively demonstrating the potential of the Data Realms title. Fight against physics with your gamepad The trickiest part of the game is actually yet to come, as we haven't talked about the bizarre control system. Cortex Command, in fact, is based on a realistic, or almost realistic, physics engine. Playable easily with a pad, the title allows you to move the different robots on the two-dimensional levels in the two horizontal or vertical directions thanks to the jetpack with a (very) limited charge. However, the force of gravity is not very permissive, so that getting up from the ground requires a certain effort and falling to the ground means seeing your ~dummy~ curl up, so that it will have to be raised by pressing the arrow keys. It will not be unusual to get stuck in the roughness of the ground, and crouching while moving is a feat for the brave few. Wrangling with the game's physics and animations, we were reminded of the insane QWOP, for one of the least intuitive control systems of recent times. The intentions were more than remarkable, the execution really unfriendly to the user. While trying to make the controlled robot stand up, the shot is directed with an analog, with the right trigger you fire, while the left one allows you to call up the circular menu that contains the various actions such as accessing the shop, changing weapons , pick up an object on the ground and so on. Finally, the two bumpers are fundamental for moving between the various units that can be controlled. Cortex Command implements another interesting feature in addition to physics that manages everything that moves: it allows you to destroy everything on the screen by calculating each impact one pixel at a time in real time. This gives great satisfaction while firing at any target, robot, zombie or other being, which when hit will fill the screen with organs, pieces of metal and so on. A real orgy of pixels! Unfortunately, however, this entails a further obstacle to playability, given that moving one's characters along the heavily modified levels will be even more difficult. Another element that needs improvement is artificial intelligence, at the moment somewhat incomplete, to the point of making solo games rather frustrating. Multiplayer up to four locally (nothing online at momento) partially compensates, but does not completely improve the fate of a gaming experience that in the current state of things belongs more to a title in the beta testing phase than to a paid release. And considering that the disbursement required is just below the twenty euro threshold, it is right to point out these shortcomings. Pixel art and the community that saves you goat and cabbage At this point you will have understood how we were not entirely satisfied with the final, or presumed, version of Cortex Command. The game itself admits it at the launch of the Campaign mode, with a writing that confesses the lack of polish in several aspects. Unfortunately, especially as regards the artificial intelligence and the control system, these imperfections spoil the enjoyment of the experience, which we remember being on sale for just under twenty euros. From his experience has an undeniable charm, given by the particular gameplay but above all by the excellent aesthetic aspect, which wisely pays tribute to the best exponents of 2D graphics. The particular management of the physics and the destruction of the environments then gives the whole a touch of modernity and madness which further elevates the stylistic code of the game. The sound accompaniment is no less, decidedly spot on even if the mix between music and effects is totally busted. It cannot weigh on the final vote but the conspicuous contribution from the community should still be mentioned, which following the development of the project over the past ten years, has already released several mods and even temporary patches to try to remedy some of the shortcomings of the title. This should guarantee the title a certain longevity, well beyond what is included and expected by Data Realms.", "date": "2012-10-16", "grade": "6.0"}
