However, this is not a novelty for the Milestone series, and on the occasion of the review of this new episode we were interested in verifying some aspects that had been handled poorly in the 2018 edition of the game. Last year's adoption of Unreal Engine 4 allowed developers to obtain a generally better visual rendering, in particular as regards effects, but at a high price: the halving of the frame rate, which went from the original 60 frames per second at 30 frames on the console, and the elimination of many contents and modalities probably linked to the original graphics engine, which therefore necessarily required a redesign work. We can say that in some ways the situation has improved, in others it hasn't: let's try to understand how things are. Game mode The MotoGP 19 main screen allows you to access the Career (normal or Pro, the latter designed for a higher degree of challenge), the fast modes (Grand Prix, championship and time trial), the Historical Challenges and two different options for the multiplayer. The standard one offers the possibility of creating lobbies or accessing existing rooms to challenge other players online or try your hand at the interesting Race Director mode, in which you improvise race directors and coordinators. Then there is the now consolidated eSport section, currently empty but which will cyclically see the arrival of new content and challenges. In both cases, the network infrastructure is based on Amazon servers which will guarantee low latencies and great stability, but which during our tests there was no way to prove: we will have to wait for the game to arrive in stores and for the lobbies to little populace. In terms of the single player experience, there are therefore several new features, in particular the Historical Challenges, which present themselves as thematic scenarios inspired by four different eras: Heroes of the 500cc, in which we will be able to relive exciting races from the 90s in the role of like Mick Doohan and a young Valentino Rossi; Dawn of the MotoGP, with the most important performances by Biaggi, Barros and again Rossi; The Great Rivalries, which stages the feuds between Rossi and Biaggi, Stoner and Rossi, Capirossi and Gibernau; and finally Era Moderna, with the exploits of various Bayliss, Pedrosa, Lorenzo, Dovizioso, Simoncelli and - guess what? - Reds. In short, we are talking about content that winks at long-time MotoGP enthusiasts, who will not fail to get excited in reliving certain situations. The Career, mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph, does not in any way distort what has already been seen in past editions, but confirms itself as the substantial fulcrum of a structure capable of entertaining for a long time, accompanying us on a growth path that can start from the short but pleasant Red Bull Rookies Class and then move on to the Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP categories as our virtual rider collects victories, increasing his popularity and obtaining points useful for improving the bike. The novelty of the MotoE class also stands out, making its debut this year by introducing motorcycles equipped with electric propulsion capable of pushing them up to 270 kilometers per hour, which in-game boast a different behavior compared to traditional vehicles, very pleasant to discover from race to race. competition. Gameplay and artificial intelligence As mentioned at the beginning, the MotoGP 19 riding model is confirmed to be solid, clearly legible in its facets: braking must be carried out rigorously before leaning and the brake and accelerator must be carefully dosed in order to be able to exit the corners quickly, ready to put even in confined spaces, but the dead zone on the left stick of the controller makes it difficult to ~brush~ and one must therefore adapt to a decisive approach, free of uncertainties, which fortunately can be assimilated with a little of practice on the various circuits. The many options present allow you to increase or decrease the degree of challenge, realism and the impact of physics on the behavior of the vehicle, determining a gradual progression that keeps interest alive and prevents the races from becoming banal. In practice, you can go from a relatively docile and reliable bike to something decidedly more nervous, adding further nuances thanks to the manual or automatic setup, to tire wear which in the long run affects freedom of action when cornering(apparently also for the rivals) and the weather conditions, with a very convincing rendering of the wet and what it entails in terms of speed, cornering and braking. Artificial intelligence, let's say one of the historical weak points of the franchise, received an innovative and potentially very interesting treatment this year thanks to the use of a technology based on machine learning. In practice, the pilots controlled by the system are able to independently decide how to deal with certain situations in order to obtain the best possible result. We were really interested in investigating this aspect in common practice, so as to understand how many and what differences were produced on the track. Well, unfortunately we weren't very impressed: realistic management of the AI means putting drivers on the track who also make mistakes, who make mistakes when braking, who end up off the track, especially when put under pressure by those chasing them. All of this basically does not happen in MotoGP 19: the other competitors have a better perception of the obstacles and do not throw themselves at us like kamikazes, nor do the traditional trains that follow the same trajectory are created in favor of a more realistic ~swarm~ layout, but it does not go further and it can only disappoint those who had high expectations of this feature. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-one MotoGP 19 Trophies can mostly be obtained by successfully completing the various grand prix, completing the championships of the various categories and the Historical Challenges. There are clearly achievements also linked to the online sector, but this is a mere side dish to the rest, placing a clear emphasis on single player progression. Scenarios and technical realization The scenarios of MotoGP 19 are those of the current season, nineteen tracks that lead us to compete in iconic locations such as Mugello, LeMans, Misano, Silverstone, Motegi and Jerez, in addition to three historic tracks: Donington Park, Laguna Seca and Catalonia. Environments reproduced in a very faithful way, just as the motorcycle models and the animations of the riders are well made, which cover a fair range of situations and therefore do not produce some of the blunders seen in the past. The general glance is discreet but remains very distant from the best racers on the market: the lighting system enhances vehicles and drivers well, but the sensation on the scenarios is relatively flat, especially when the weather (which remains variable but not dynamic ) is sunny. With the rain and in the wet the situation improves, the puddles seem to reflect the surroundings in a real way (but they could also be matter of strategically placed cubemaps, as far as we know) and also the asphalt is more convincing, while for the rest many adopted solutions appear dated. However, the big problem is the frame rate, which not even in this second edition powered by Unreal Engine 4 manages to reach 60 frames per second: it remains on 30 fps, however stable, and the options seen in RIDE 3 which allowed to decrease the resolution to obtain greater fluidity. If for MotoGP 18 the justification of the debut with the new graphics engine could have been valid, a year later it is difficult to understand the reasons for such a choice, which inevitably also affects the enjoyment of the gameplay.", "date": "2019-06-06", "grade": "7.2"}
