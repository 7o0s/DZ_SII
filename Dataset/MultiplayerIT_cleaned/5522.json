{"name": "Layers of Fear", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/layers-of-fear-recensione.html", "text": "At some point someone in Bloober Team must have felt the need to bring all the parts of the Layers of Fear series together to make it one story. That the two main chapters, plus the DLC of the first were connected was clear to anyone who had played them, because the stories had a clearly recognizable common matrix and generally concerned the themes of art, artistic inspiration and obsession with itself. They were also told in a similar way, although the settings are very different from each other. So it's not surprising that an overall reissue of the series has been decided, enriched by new content that serves as a glue for the various episodes, now the chapters of a single story. With the review of Layers of Fear we will see if the remake and synthesis operation can be said to be successful or not. History The settings of Layers of Fear are even more grim Layers of Fear begins with an all-new story of a writer who travels to a lonely lighthouse after winning a contest that grants her a free stay. It is a completely isolated place and distant from civilization. The woman is looking for peace to write her new novel, moreover obliged to do so by the contract signed with the organizers of the competition, but obviously she will find much more waiting for her, as can be understood right away, given that in the introduction the we see him return to the spot in search of revenge. She will write the stories of the other Layers of Fear, with her story that will evolve following their developments and will assume a truly central role in the whole experience. In fact, the different games are not freely accessible, but have been disassembled and reassembled in a larger, albeit always linear, plot. The visionary nature of the various stories remains intact, enhanced indeed by the technological leap, which we will discuss in a dedicated paragraph. So the mad house of the painter (the protagonist of the first Layers of Fear) is even more surreal in its succession of apparently random rooms and corridors, whose connections actually have a strongly symbolic and dreamlike nature. The same goes for the actor's ship (the protagonist of the second chapter), whose environments are even more enigmatic and effective in becoming the stage for the protagonist's obsessions than in the past, also by virtue of the general story that is now his background. The fact that the developers have made an enormous effort to connect the various events, creating a common mythology made explicit in that of the writer, makes it somehow interesting to relive both main chapters, even for those who have already played them in the past. Only the DLCs of the first chapter clash a bit with the work, given their nature of post-launch additions, but at the same time it would have been a shame to lose them, considering what they reveal about the painter's events. Horror or not? The gameplay of Layers of Fear has remained largely unchanged from the original chapters Now, let's try to define what Layers of Fear is in terms of gameplay. On the surface it appears to be a survival horror, but in reality it is a narrative adventure in which horror is more of a spice. The game communicates practically immediately that it has no intention of putting a spoke in the works in the discovery of the mysteries that await us. The various environments that can be visited are in fact full of documents to read, the main way in which we learn the facts that happened to the various characters, while the awkward movement system, with the very slow run and the lack of the possibility of crouching down and looking out from the corners, makes it clear that there is no stealth system and that, therefore, we will not have to hide from any particular hunter or enemy, so much so that the tension eases practically immediately. At some point we will acquire ~weapons~, if we want to call them that, which will make hostile-looking creatures appear. But don't expect much in terms of tension and terror, because they must be addressed in a very direct way. The only concern they raise comes from the fact that they can't be eliminated permanently. So they will annoy us as long as we stay in their areas. Be that as it may, usually it is enough to close a door behind you to make them disappear and move forward without worrying about their presence. The atmosphere is undoubtedly horror, but Layers of Fear struggles to build tension In short, compared to the previous Layers of Fear, nothing has changed in this sense, so much so that those who have already played them will find it very difficult to feel the slightest tension, even in the face of scenes that one would like to be more gruesome. There are some more tense moments, butthere is very little stuff in the general economy of the game, which above all asks us to advance, to look around and to find the various interactive objects. Exploration is also bare-bones, despite the seemingly labyrinthine maps. It's actually just an impression, since most of the time you go straight, making a few detours just to find the various collectibles. Sometimes there are keys and other small objects to collect, but the lack of a real inventory and the automatic use of them does not make it a big problem to understand where they are used. In this sense, the puzzles are used above all as rhythmic punctuation of the gameplay, rather than as mechanics that somehow challenge the player's intelligence, so much so that we stood still to meditate on what to do very few times and never for more than a few seconds. Layers of Fear is a narrative adventure, not a survival horror In short, Layers of Fear is above all interested in telling its stories, with the game mechanics put at the service of the narrative side, which is not necessarily a bad thing. So were the originals, so is this remake collection. So don't expect anything too distant, except where a way has been sought to merge the different experiences into a single game. Surely everything is broader, given that we are talking about two complete games with related DLCs, old and new, plus a connecting story that takes its time, compressed into a single title, but the game systems have not undergone unexpected revolutions. The Unreal Engine 5 is seen in Layers of Fear The Unreal Engine 5 is there and it shows Where Bloober and Anshar have worked the most is certainly on the technical side. Layers of Fear is the first game powered by Unreal Engine 5 to arrive on the market and exploit all the potential made available by the Epic Games engine, to the point of graphically appearing on another planet compared to the original titles, also by virtue of a larger budget, considering the growth of the main development team in recent years, growth that has also earned him prestigious collaborations such as the one with Konami for the remake of Silent Hill 2. Not only do the environments have an enormously greater level of detail, but the atmosphere appears much more elaborate, if you will, thanks to the use of Lumen for lighting, which has allowed the creation of really impactful places, however small. Thus the rooms of the painter's house now appear darker and darker, as are the rooms of the ship in which the actor acts. In general, everything is much nicer to look at than the original chapters and the style chosen for the game emerges with much less uncertainty, resulting more uniform, even in the completely new contents such as the story of the writer and the new DLC of the story of the writer (lived from the point of view of the wife). In a way, Layers of Fear is worth playing just to see Unreal Engine 5 in action.", "date": "2023-06-15", "grade": "7.5"}
