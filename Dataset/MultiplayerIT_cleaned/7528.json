Over the years of development of Path of Exile, the New Zealand team has managed to maintain a coherent, decisive profile characterized by an ideal sense of respect for users. When co-founder Chris Wilson reiterated the team's desire to make its free to play free from a mentality linked to the invasive need for paid content, few could believe that the humble model could have such a long and dignified life . Of course, it must also be said that the crowdfunding campaign launched in the past at the opening of the beta brought something like 245,000 dollars into the GGG's coffers in six days, a haul that reached around 1.2 million last October; money doesn't bring happiness, but it is certainly useful for ensuring a relaxed development plan away from hasty deadlines. The title, which has finally come out of the test phase, is free to enter the post-beta phase, a moment in which problems and bugs no longer have any excuses to exist: after many months of testing, the team expects a final test of credibility which will have to convince skeptics of the existence of high quality independent free to play. Difficult task, but fully achieved. Free, fun, deep: Path of Exile is all of this, and so much more! Put the horns on the devil When it comes to hack and slash, thoughts spontaneously float towards the sacred monsters that made the genre famous and appreciated, with Diablo and Torchlight holding the torch. And while observing the top, it is curious to note how among the paths of the undergrowth of the web the BFG creature is quickly climbing the mountain, thanks to a truly excellent sum of parts second to few others. Honestly, who would have thought that a free to play out of the box was enough to undermine the greatness of historic franchises? Path of Exile arises with intelligence, taking up a fast, frenetic style and a random generation of scenarios to merge it with practically boundless game systems and characterization of heroes, all for free. And when we write free, we really mean it. The micro-transactions entered do not fall into the ~pay to win~ category at all as the purchasable items are not even remotely essential to continue and shine in the game. The title without shyness provides all that is needed to make the euphoria of filling up with equipment varied and self-sufficient, letting the proposed paid contents draw almost exclusively on a sphere of audio/video aesthetics. The purchasable elements are superfluous: it almost seems that Grinding Gear has deliberately provided users with a way to repay the development house for the efforts made thanks to a disguised after-the-fact financing activity, perfect for anyone who had not placed funds in the past. Path of Exile is a solid product, tangible confirmation of the commitments and promises made by the team in the past and worthily fulfilled. Let's see what are the focal elements that can make developers proud of their creature. Lots of class, few classes Let's start immediately from the character creation phase, characterized by six classes to choose from. However, calculating the practically infinite evolution that awaits the development of our alter-ego, it is not wrong to say that the initial class is almost a screen rather than a real binary path between forced abilities and characteristic increases. Path of Exile is in fact made unique by an incredibly vast evolution tree that makes the progress and customization of each game session unique. The skills, improvements, achievements of certain sections of the grid depend solely on the player's willingness to develop towards one or another section, in line with the type of game on which to focus. And if a deep progress path weren't enough, an intelligent system intervenes to make the management of the equipment found in the environments varied and never predictable. Yes, because if other exponents of the genre base the dignity of the search on the preponderant importance of magical objects, Path of Exile, as well as on the intrinsic characteristics of the piece found, chooses to infuse a potential importance to any object thanks to the presence or absence of runes. Equipment features removable rune slots to be socketed inside; of various colors and characteristics, the runes will evolve from their own soul by acquiring experience and leveling up, thus giving access to new skills. The rune slots are combinable to formand synergies of intent, so as to make even a non-magical but slot-rich armor an element not to be underestimated and, what is even more important in the economy of replayability, not to be despised. Network crafting Path of Exile is differentiated by the absence of actual trade or purchase currencies; BFG has chosen to make artifacts called Orbi the game's practical currency. Of various types, the collection of orbs allows you to improve the equipment available or to buy new ones from the merchants in the meeting points of the non-player characters. The system works, as it does not focus solely on the loot of the artifacts but also on their procurement from the sale of more or less important equipment, thus making it sensible to return to the places of combat to raid, inventory permitting, the greatest number of enemy possessions. Perhaps the limitation of the bag available to accumulate equipment is one of the major gameplay flaws; the occasions in which the flow of the game will be broken precisely by the impossibility of collecting further objects, sometimes forcing the player to an almost forced backtracking, unless there are obvious inventory sacrifices, will not be rare. The exchange system with other players works easily: thanks to well-packaged instances, each hub is populated by players, thus leaving aside feelings of loneliness and allowing a constant update of the goods exchange offer and any associated PvP. In reality, bartering is only part of the online structure of the title: if the single-player adventure is designed to offer less than a dozen hours the first time, the map-based and cooperation-based end-game system works perfectly . On normal difficulty you won't have any progress problems, but the fun increases in company, as the difficulty curve rises in proportion to the team on the field, making the game more interesting and profitable in playful terms. Curiosity Although never openly revealed, there are not a few traits that the Grinding Gear Games team takes from the most influential episodes of Final Fantasy. The most striking aspect is undoubtedly the grid advancement system, which fully incorporates the Spherography of Final Fantasy X. On balance, Path fo Exile's improvement tree is even larger than that of the Square Enix title . Another element that can be easily combined concerns the synergy between orbs to be set in weapons and armor, a gameplay element that is very reminiscent of the synergistic connections of the material slots of Final Fantasy VII! Fantarandom Fantasy never goes out of style, especially that dark, no-nonsense style of yesteryear, when good fought evil without too many twists and turns. Path of Exile's art is balanced enough to ensure a purist's journey through lush wastes, filthy dungeons, ships and snowy mountains, all with an engine capable of handling even a multitude of on-screen enemies with ease. With clever tricks of refraction, the visual proposal of Grinding Gear Games amazes with its apparent simplicity, managing to give a pleasant aftertaste of early dark fantasy to anyone who lets themselves be captured by the world of Wraeclast, which is not by chance the land of the damned. The random creation engine of the environments and enemies does not shine, accomplices of not particularly brilliant level design algorithms that make each exploration not too dissimilar from the previous one, but calculating the vastness of the environments available, the risk of deja vu manages to remain a long time distant chimera. The audio sector performs its task worthily, guaranteeing the right immersion with well-directed effects, even if we would have appreciated at least one dominant theme that would make Path of Exile a pleasant acoustic memory even in the distant future, but on the other hand one cannot ask much more to the overseas team. With a minimal but functional interface and a chat window perpetually open to the dialogues of groups of connected adventurers, Path of Exile returns for free a title with some compromises but a lot of ambition: Wilson's promise has been kept.", "date": "2013-10-30", "grade": "8.5"}
