{"name": "Alpha Zone 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alpha-zone-3d.html", "text": "The first person shooter genre is taking its first, uncertain steps in that impervious territory that is mobile gaming. It is a genre that everyone knows very well and which boasts very important titles, above all Doom, which Alpha Zone 3D is clearly inspired by. A genre that has only begun to be represented on mobile phones in recent times, thanks to the technical possibilities reached by modern devices as well as the development of engines capable of effectively managing that particular mix of polygonal and bitmap graphics. In recent times we have been able to appreciate Covert Ops 1943, a technically excellent FPS, with a classic structure, set during the Second World War. The scenario in Alpha Zone 3D is completely different, but the game setup is identical: you have to eliminate all the enemies you come across and find the keys that open certain doors to go to the next level. As in any first person shooter, our character can move in four directions, rotate on itself, sidestep and turn quickly in case of need. All this takes place using the joystick or the mobile phone keyboard: if you have a phone equipped with an eight-way joystick, you can do everything with it and the gaming experience will benefit exceptionally; otherwise, you will be forced to do some things one way and others another: a rather cumbersome solution. To shoot you need to press the 5 key, while the # key changes the equipped weapon among those available and the * key brings up the stage map, which turns out to be very useful because it shows us the areas we have already visited and those that we haven't reached yet. Everything else proceeds according to the script: the enemies reveal themselves and shoot at us without ~cunning~, a symptom of a truly limited artificial intelligence, while all eight levels are characterized by the usual structure of closed doors, for each of which you have to find a key. The various rooms in which we will wander often contain supplies for vital energy or new weapons: both things will be very useful to us, since the game's difficulty is quite high and it will be very difficult to avoid being hit. After yet another game over, perhaps we will opt for a different approach to each stage, going to attack the enemies whose position we already know to have some advantage. Moving on to the technical implementation, unfortunately it must be said that Alpha Zone 3D is very, very far from what was seen in the aforementioned Covert Ops 1943. The graphics scroll slowly, with difficulty, and the rotation of the view lacks the necessary speed to be effective when needed, or when we have an enemy shooting at us from behind. As for the enemies, then, there is the usual ~pixel effect~ of this kind of title: the sprites appear detailed only at a certain distance, but you only need to get close to be able to no longer distinguish their appearance. Also, there isn't much variety in the ranks of our opponents. In short, it could have been done much better. The control system has already been mentioned, with the quality of the experience greatly depending on the joystick of your mobile phone: if it's comfortable and allows for eight directions, that's fine; otherwise, everything becomes cumbersome and frustrating.
