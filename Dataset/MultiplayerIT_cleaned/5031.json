{"name": "The Wardrobe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180194-the-wardrobe-uno-scheletro-nellarmadio.html", "text": "The Wardrobe takes us back to those point-and-click adventures that, after dominating the world of video games, have experienced some moments of difficulty, driven by three-dimensional action and first-person adventures that have focused the attention and creativity of the developers. But the genre has never died down, still capable of reminding us, from time to time, that the point-and-click interface doesn't necessarily boil down to a mere sequence of attempts to find the right combination of objects. Let me be clear, this dynamic is an integral part of the genre, but an adventure worthy of the name plays with its limits and manages to stimulate the brains, escaping from a heaviness that is always lurking due to the intrinsic limits of an extremely simplified. And it is precisely the ability to stimulate thought that is one of the strengths that meeting after meeting we thought we saw in The Wardrobe, an all-Italian game, graphically well-finished and full of that special humor that has given history some of the most beautiful graphic adventures ever. Today the time has come to verify what is one of the fruits of a new wave of enthusiasm in the Italian video game scene, a scene that has no problems adopting global languages to compete with the whole world. We measured ourselves with the complex puzzles of The Wardrobe, a surprising point and click made in Italy Burst quotes The Wardrobe begins with a deep friendship that ends abruptly with a deadly plum. The fault lies with a fearsome allergy that delivers a skeletal protagonist into our hands, a pile of bones with a large head who, thanks to supernatural forces, finds himself bound to a mysterious wardrobe from whose belly he must save his friend's soul from eternal perdition. Unfortunately, the already particular situation is destined to become even more complicated due to a move which, involving the esoteric piece of furniture, puts Skinny's sacrum at risk, suddenly forced to embark on a series of vicissitudes. And this is how he finds himself meeting a bizarre gallery of figures that include an alcoholic Gesoo, a pair of Ghostbusters, the painter Manet, a hallucinating talking bear skin and, during the first bars of the game, a monster of megalomaniac powder that immediately makes clear the surreal component of an adventure born from that cauldron of tentacles, macabre humor, time machines and assorted follies with which LucasArts has won the hearts of thousands of players in the past. Players used to being offended by an impertinent protagonist who also in this case delights us with his sympathy by breaking through the fourth wall with insults. And that works as well as the bloody details and tons of quotes that crowd every single screen. Inevitable references to video games, such as Portal and Fallout, accompanied by anime from every era, iconic films from the eighties, animated feature films and television series that have entered the common imagination, as in the case of the unmistakable pair of blue horn and yellow umbrella hanging from the kitchen wall. There's enough stuff in The Wardrobe's forty-plus environments to make any aficionado's heart beat faster, though there's a risk that this lover's heart will beat too hard or too slow in the face of puzzles that can be unsettling. . Often there is a logical connection, but it becomes clear only after passing passages made artificially difficult by the incomplete descriptions, the surreal vein of the game and the need to move through the different areas of a town that gradually opens up in front of us . Losing the thread trying to bring Skinny to the goal is a matter of moments and there is the risk that the nervousness makes it difficult to catch him again even if, when things unlock for a flash of genius, the satisfaction is palpable and for this reason our advice is to resist the temptation to resort to the classic external help, even when things get really complex as in the case of the time machine or the paint bucket. It must also be said that The Wardrobe is not lacking in understandable and sometimes decidedly spot on puzzles. Even several trophies are based on the collection of clues and include further mentions in a title that comes to use them as gameplay mechanics. Initially the enormous volume of citation fire even generates the suspicion that the references must fill something, but this is not the case although the juice of the experience, cleaned up by the backtracking and the myriads of attempts lengthened by the intentional lack of clues, is dramatically inferior at about ten o'clock chand it took us to get to the coveted finish. A full-blown adventure As we said, The Wardrobe allows us to move freely between different areas of a small town and allows us to face different puzzles in a non-linear way. But to the bone it is an old-fashioned adventure for mechanics, macabre jokes and, above all, for the excellent overall quality. To be honest some cutscenes are not that great, but the game C.I.N.I.C. it is full of valuable and effective animations, first of all the discouraged ones of our Skinny, and of curated content that highlights a remarkable commitment. The English-style humor is spot on, the irreverent characters abound and there is no shortage of jokes that we can consider courageous in a country that still hides its sins behind increasingly hypocritical morals. Furthermore, the ticket price, of only 14.99 euros, includes a spot-on soundtrack although a little too simple and the dubbing in Italian, as expected from a local title, with voices that are convincing, even in English. A not bad kit, initially overshadowed by a rather annoying bug that by mixing the dialogues in Italian and English dragged us into an auditory experience as surreal as it was annoying. Our digital copy also froze when talking to the mummy bartender and while dialogue wasn't necessary to progress, we did deal with some serious issues for a product sold as complete. In any case, these are flaws that have been fixed with a patch and there is no need to waste too much time on them, while not neglecting the issue, just as there is no need to waste too much time with the point and click interface of a classic graphic adventure that in addition to being simple helps us with an optional tutorial integrated into the game fabric. The only things to report are the presence of all the classic shortcuts, including a button that highlights all the interactive objects, and the context menu, strangely linked to the right button instead of the left, which allows us to decide how to interact with the objects. For the rest we can only be surprised by the search for detail that exploits quotations also to embellish the graphics and puts us in front of rooms crowded with objects, goodies such as the ribcage that becomes the inventory and tons of details, often animated, which give depth to a world that is inevitably limited, given the genre in question. We're talking about plasters used as stickers, talking heads, LSD-drenched flowers, screenshots full of inspired touches and one detail that is absolutely essential for a title of this type: tons of dialogues that, while not always useful to solving the puzzles, are enough to keep the will to go on always high. The volume of fire is high, for an adventure which lacks almost nothing, starting with a character who certainly cannot compete with a giant like Manny Calavera, but it is functional and takes us by the hand towards a spot-on ending and in some moving way, albeit so short and hasty as to represent the only real disappointment of the title C.I.N.I.C. games.", "date": "2017-02-22", "grade": "7.5"}
