The Hero for iPhone/iPod Tocuh, an original application developed by the Traplight Games studios and produced by Chillingo, is the confirmation of how a good idea, if carefully developed, can become a valid and potential success without excessive and improbable efforts, even more so if the equation is resolved on the practical as effective and immediate Apple devices, always particularly predisposed to support this type of initiative. Simplicity, immediacy and great fun are the foundations of the software house's work, for a product that is also very competitive in terms of price. Any hero The Hero brings back into the hands of the player a superhero inspired without many frills by the phenomenal Mr. Incredible from the well-known film by Pixar Animation Studios. An inspiration as explicit as in any case successful for the purposes of the game itself, given the characteristics of the brave little man who are absolutely well thought out. The muscular protagonist, in fact, equipped with a handsome physique also well highlighted by the inevitable close-fitting suit, has the task of facing the formidable Dr. Hubbub, who thanks to his powers and dangerous criminal organization undermines the peace and health of the planet. Hero has only three powers available, but very dynamic and simple to use: Freeze, Boom and Zappli. Thanks to them he can fly, and together with his immense strength save populations endangered by the numerous threats of the enemy, facing increasingly dangerous enemies. The controls designed for the gameplay by the guys at Traplight Games are probably the strong point of the entire production. With the classic virtual directional you can control the hero, while with the right button you manage the three powers available during the adventure. Perhaps never before has the punctuality of the response reached such high levels in terms of performance as this time, a delicate issue especially when there are completely touch screen controls at stake as in this case. Furthermore, it is possible to replace the entire basic controls compartment with the use of the motion sensor of the iPhone and iPod Touch, always very valid when used, with which it is possible to manage the protagonist just as effectively. The purely aesthetic aspect of The Hero is very successful, which presents some absolutely not indifferent peaks in terms of glance. The graphics are entirely in cartoon style, accompanied by a somewhat flat level design as regards the complex of settings, but still pleasant above all for the nice realization of the superman finishes. The level of fluidity that Chillingo's production is able to maintain constantly is amazing, anchored at 60 frames per second in every situation; on the screen of the iPhone and iPod Touch it is a technical datum, the latter capable of making the difference especially given the speed of play with which it is necessary to deal. The single player campaign is made up of 15 main missions, with a total duration that is not actually exaggerated, but which can still be combined with the servival mode, i.e. another 20 secondary missions with which to test reflexes and dexterity. The soundtrack assumes considerable importance, always quite engaging, especially if listened to through headphones that are certainly more suitable for appreciating all the potential of the speakers of Apple devices. The Hero is available at the price of 1.59 euros on the App Store, which can therefore be purchased directly from the devices or through the usual iTunes Store. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-22", "grade": "8.0"}
