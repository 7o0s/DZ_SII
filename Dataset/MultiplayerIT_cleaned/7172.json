A cauldron of stories and events set between the divine and the earth from which directors and novelists from all over the world have eagerly drawn, capable of influencing, of course, also several thick videogame works; just think of the famous God of War action saga by Santa Monica Studios. Although far from the dynamics and sumptuous budgets of the so-called triple A productions, the subject of our review also embraces the ambitious Greek mythological trend, specifically retracing the deeds of the courageous Athenian hero Theseus, who offered himself as a sacrificial victim in order to face and kill the monstrous Minotaur. Peculiarities of Depths of Fear :: Knossos, rogue-like adventure in first person with procedurally generated levels, is that it was developed by a single person (Philip Wiley) in the same way as the recent Banished, however achieving a completely different result in qualitative terms . Big trouble in Knossos, the labyrinth of Daedalus infested with bugs and glitches The shadow of the Minotaur Before delving into the so-called ~meanders of fear~ it is necessary to say a few words about the fascinating and controversial myth behind the game, which is particularly suitable for a work of this kind. As underlined in the introduction, the protagonist of the adventure is Theseus, son of Poseidon (or of Aegeus, according to the versions) who, driven by the desire to break the trickle of young Athenian lives fed to the Minotaur by King Minos, with a subterfuge offers itself in sacrifice to access the labyrinth of Daedalus in Knossos, where the creature has been confined. Half bull and half man, the Minotaur is none other than the son of Pasiphae (wife of Minos) and the Bull of Crete, a sacrificial gift from Poseidon who in revenge was transformed by the divinity itself into the blind love of the woman. In short, a valid reason not to complain too much about Beautiful. Helped by another daughter of Minos, the famous Ariadne (Ariadne) of the thread, Theseus is thrown into the labyrinth and here - license from the game developer - he is forced to face seven other mythological creatures before being able to grasp the sword capable of defeat his fearsome target. A decidedly interesting incipit capable of recalling the epic clashes of Shadow of Colossus in the player and which galvanized us not a little in the approach phase, but which unfortunately is irreparably clashed with the harsh reality of the facts. I lost the thread Beyond the technical sector, which defining antiquated and defective is an understatement (we'll talk about it in the next paragraph), what sinks the work of Dirigo Games, or rather, of its individual employee and founder Philip Wiley, is the presence of serious problems structural in any aspect of the production, between bugs, glitches (often hilarious) and the total lack of balance and depth. But let's proceed in order. Once thrown into the well in the center of the game map, a sort of main hub, it is possible to access the individual sections of the labyrinth where you can face the seven mythological creatures mentioned above, namely the Satyr, the Centaur, the Griffin, Cerberus, Medusa, Hydra and the Manticore (a half-lion, half-scorpion chimera), before the final showdown with the Minotaur himself. To help Theseus in his fearless enterprise, in addition to Ariadne with her loving messages and the iconic rolls of wool scattered in the labyrinth, there is also the architect and inventor Daedalus, according to the myth locked up by Minos in the structure - together with his son Icarus - immediately after finishing its construction. Curiously, the authoritative character has been portrayed as a simple arms dealer, and the music that accompanies the player's visits to the ~shop~ does nothing but underline the grotesque atmosphere. Returning to the heart of the game, it is possible to face the mythological creatures according to the desired order within procedural levels, i.e. randomly generated, therefore every time you start (or try again) a stage, the arrangement of enemies, rooms and objects key is completely distorted. In addition to the coarse and cheesy level design that this entails, since it is the result of rather simplistic and basic algorithms, too often the processing does not work properly, and it can happen that objects are placed where they should not be (for example on traps) or that even some of them become unreachable and prevent you fromcontinue. The confrontation with the creatures is divided into four distinct phases, where in each of them, with the exception of the final one, it is necessary to recover a key to open the gate that leads to the next step. The main purpose of the gameplay is to evade the close surveillance of the mythological creature on duty (some kill with a single shot or with a look) and overcome a whole series of minor enemies, ranging from giant ants, zombies (!), ghosts, annoying mice GMOs, demons and so on. The advertised horror component, for which even combinations with the terrifying Amnesia have been inconvenienced, is completely flattened by the bad technical sector and hilarious situations, with monsters often stranded in the architectures and sometimes piled up on top of each other. Rather than proceeding carefully, in the dark, being careful not to attract threats, the best method to complete a level is to run desperately until you locate the key and the exit door. In some cases it took us less than a minute to pass the single stage. Emblematic of the overall quality level of Depths of Fear :: Knossos is the final boss fight, which takes place in the fourth and final phase of each section. In this special stage the aim is to collect a medallion which makes the creature vulnerable to our attacks, immortal in the first three phases; well, you will be amazed to know that we have not directly killed even one. Once the medallion has been collected, in fact, the lava begins to flow profusely from the floor, and it is sufficient to position oneself on an elevated place waiting for it to do the work for the player. With the exception of the Minotaur, we have defeated all creatures in this way, and while wanting to ~fight~ the enemy we have always been anticipated by the deadly fluid. For the record, we recall that in each level it is possible to collect gold - necessary to buy weapons from Daedalus - and books, which provide suggestions or activate divine powers to be exploited as needed against enemies. It is also possible to drink some potions with diversified effects (the one that allows us to see in the dark is very useful, avoiding having to keep the torch on) and consume food that restores the energy lost in combat. Despite the gravity and quantity of defects that dot the entire experience, for which a series of substantial patches and complete rewrites of the code are urgently needed, the curiosity to face the next enemy still manages to spur and entice the player, a symptom that the starting idea and the concept were anything but to be thrown away. Back to the past To the serious structural and gameplay problems already underlined we must add a technical sector that is deficient from every point of view, poor in polygonal models (with the exception of some effects we are not far from the rendering of 20 years ago) and afflicted by interpenetrations, pop-ups, faded textures, cumbersome animations, disappearances inside the walls and so on. A visual ~spectacle~ out of time even by setting the highest quality setting, where the particle and lighting effects are practically not received if we exclude the basic ones, caused by torches or some monsters. There are no advanced graphics settings and it is only possible to set the resolution and a generic quality level of the game, which ranges from very fast to very high with minimal differences in the impact on the screen. The AI, when it works, is run by archaic routines and the hitbox is just plain buggy; the arrows fired with the crossbow, in most cases, do not hit the mark even if they hit the target, while the trident or the spear hurled at the enemies enjoy practically uniform rectilinear motion and very often pierce them without striking a blow. We're not kidding that we picked up our trident stuck in a wall 4 rooms away from throwing it at human (or beast, if you prefer) height. Finally, the physicality of the clashes with white weapons is impalpable, managed by an extremely basic control system and devoid of the necessary feedback. The technical picture closes with very annoying and redundant sound effects until exhaustion, and a bizarre 70s electronic soundtrack based on synthesizers that does not go well with the topics covered.", "date": "2014-04-22", "grade": "4.0"}
