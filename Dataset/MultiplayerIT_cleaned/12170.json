The rules to learn to play are very few, which makes the Geometry Wars learning curve substantially flat: every 10,000 points you get a weapon upgrade, every 75,000 an extra life and every 100,000 an extra smart bomb. To score more points you need to be able to make combos, or destroy multiple enemies repeatedly without spending too much time after each elimination. Becoming skilled in mass destruction is essential to being able to survive, as collecting power-ups soon becomes vital. The enemies are of various types but all are formed by simple geometric shapes combined with each other. So there are rhombuses, circles, rectangles and so on. given the success of Geometry Wars on Live!, many amateur developers have made clones that often have gone beyond the original What do you offer me? That's all, one might say, since the rules end there. The Bzzare Creations product has the sole purpose of putting you in competition with online players with stratospheric record shots with which to bully yourself. The simplicity of the action is intended as well as the absence of any complications. It loads and plays. We get carried away in its frenetic rhythm, we rub our eyes in front of the simple and incredibly effective light and distortion effects and we continue to play almost in the grip of a raptus, because not wanting to, perhaps with our thoughts elsewhere, we he realizes that it's tremendous fun, albeit very limited. In fact, here is his big problem: there is little meat in the fire. Not bad, one might think, given the negligible price: four dollars, which corresponds, more or less, to almost three euros. In short, the price of a couple of coffees at the bar next door or one at a bar in Piazza Navona. But PC is not Xbox 360. Given the success of Geometry Wars on Live!, many amateur developers have created clones that often have gone beyond the original (for example Veck), even offering something more in terms of modes of game. Obviously the advantage of these clones is that, in addition to being well done, they are also free. We're talking about completely legal creations, don't worry. Having said this, it is clear that the possibility of increasing the screen resolution is not enough to convince gamers to buy. Even online, already present on the version for the Microsoft console, is not a big incentive for the PC user, accustomed to multiplayer modes of a much different thickness for fifteen years. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Pentium 4 at a 1 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Any DirectX 9.0c compatible card, with 128 MB of graphics memory and Shader 2.0 support Disk: 150 MB DirectX 9.0C Steam Test Configuration: Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Intel Pentium 4 @ 3.4 Ghz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved has great immediacy on its side and the fact that it is truly for everyone but some rather important factors undermine the overall judgment. The main one, already expressed in the article, is that on the freeware scene there are free video games of the same genre that offer more for free. Too bad, because it would have been enough to add a few game modes to make it competitive and enhance its great qualities. However, the frenetic action is that seen on Xbox 360, which was of great quality and does not disappoint on PC either. If the idea appeals to you, try it, especially if you have a joypad and want to squeeze it properly. Pros Frantic and very fun Some graphic effects are spectacular in their simplicity It costs very little Cons There are free alternatives on PC that offer more Only one online game mode that practically does not exist Geometry Wars is a shooter with a simple and ingenious concept that manages to make perfect use of joypads with the dual analog stick (we tested it using an Xbox 360 joypad with adapter). Driving a spaceship in the shape of a hair tweezer, we have to fight against wave after wave of enemies ready to do anything to dent our bodywork. The backdrop to our record feats is a large squared rectangle on which it is possible to move in any direction using the left analog stick. With the right stick, however, it is possible to direct our fire which is emitted in a continuous jet. Finally, the two dorsal analog triggers are used to launch a smart bomb that completely clears the screen of enemies, which is especially useful in the most agitated and confusing moments, giving qsome brief moments of stillness waiting to suffer a new massive attack. Of course, it is also possible to play without having a joypad. Unfortunately, the keyboard control system is not very precise, with four keys to use to move and four to shoot, and the limitations in movement are felt a lot, especially as regards pointing the weapon which is reduced to only eight directions. The ideal solution for those who do not have a joypad is the hybrid mouse + keyboard control system which manages to be an excellent alternative although the precision is not at the same level.", "date": "2007-06-25", "grade": null}
