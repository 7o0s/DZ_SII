The author of the game, Lucas Wilde, has indeed developed a product that closely resembles the classic elements of the Activision franchise: from customization options to perks, from frenetic gameplay to kill streaks with their bonuses. The certainly positive thing about this project lies in the fact that the preliminary launch in some territories has allowed the creation of a very large and solid user base, capable after the official release of guaranteeing numerous online games to join and, consequently, an extremely fast and efficient matchmaking system. Once the application has been launched, it is possible to create an account or play as a guest, adjust the options (including graphics, with various quality presets to choose from depending on the power of your terminal), manage the three slots for equipment and finally access the various modes available: Team Deathmatch, Conquest, Free for All and Gun Game. Nothing transcendental, we are talking about a very traditional structure: the team deathmatch pits two teams against each other with the aim of scoring the highest number of kills; Conquest is a territorial mode in which you have to conquer areas on the map and keep control of them to score the points necessary for victory; Free for All is the inevitable all-against-all; and finally Gun Game will see us face all the other users here too, but holding only a gun. The seven maps included in the package are also derivative with respect to the tradition of urban shooters, but offer a fair variety both in structural and visual terms. Bullet Force is a solid and fast-paced multiplayer shooter, albeit a very unoriginal one Coming Call of Duty In addition to the resemblance to the classic episodes of Call of Duty, what is striking about Bullet Storm is the extremely soft approach to the freemium model: the developer wanted to avoid making a pay-to-win at all costs, and so he introduced a progression that allows everyone to unlock the same perks and weapons, limiting paid content almost exclusively to aesthetic customizations. It is also for this reason that the learning curve is not disastrously steep and allows novices to score a few kills during the first few games, according to well-tested canons that often and willingly emphasize the luck of falling behind the other players and therefore be able to eliminate them without too many problems, but at the same time looking at who will shoot at us in the same way. The touch controls are well organized and responsive, although it seems a glaring lack of using a separate fire button instead of activating the autofire when an enemy is in our viewfinder. The reasons behind our doubts are probably clear and obvious to anyone who has ever tried a mobile shooter: using automatic fire allows you to move with greater ease and gives dynamism and speed to the action, whereas instead having to manually pull the trigger creates in fact two separate mechanisms that lead to slowness of execution and cumbersomeness. Beyond this, the use of rather generic assets and the initial concept of Bullet Storm inevitably make the title anonymous and unoriginal, but it is a relatively low price to pay if we consider the positive aspects of the production, which undoubtedly stands as one of the best multiplayer shooter for iOS and Android devices.", "date": "2016-12-27", "grade": "8.0"}
