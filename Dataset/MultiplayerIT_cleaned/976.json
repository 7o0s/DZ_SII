The punisher, after a brief introduction aimed at showing his new personality, finds himself in handcuffs forced to answer for numerous crimes committed in the name of summary justice that he has decided to implement. The missions are therefore interrogation flashbacks that tell, punishment after punishment, the bloody successes of Frank Castle and the unorthodox methods used to obtain them. It obviously starts from the small fish and then reaches the peaks of the criminal organization with the aim of annihilating it completely, but the punishment is fair and final for everyone, whether they are slaves or bosses. The plot of the Punisher is at the same time the most banal and effective premise for a story of revenge, so much so as to inspire comics, films and video games for years up to the recent Max Payne who draws heavily on the events of Frank Castle. THQ has wisely avoided proposing for the umpteenth time an action-shooter based on bullet time, an element that appears occasionally and automatically in some scenes, and has found a way to give a touch of originality to its title. A thousand ways, one goal: punishment As we said, the strength of this title is its ability to offer a Punisher faithful to the original, and it succeeds both in the interludes, characterized by excellent dialogues, and in the game, with spectacular entrances and massacres of titanic proportions. Unfortunately, the game mechanics have all already been seen, starting from the possibility of using two weapons at the same time, to allowing the player to buy items and upgrades thanks to the points accumulated by playing. Even the possibility of using enemies as human shields is not new, but an innovative factor takes shape starting from this element. Once an enemy has been blocked, as long as he is alive, it is possible at any time to switch from shield mode to interrogation mode, which provides unorthodox treatments in order to obtain sincere answers. The refined interrogation techniques include strangulation, the classic beating with clenched fists, the highly effective gun pointed at the temple and, as icing on the cake, the projection of the victim's head against the hard concrete. the strength of this title is its ability to present a Punisher faithful to the original, and it succeeds both in the interludes, characterized by excellent dialogues, and in the game, with spectacular entrances and massacres of titanic proportions A thousand ways, one goal: punishment The interrogation mode, on certain occasions, produces useful answers, but a successful interrogation also allows us to recover a good dose of vital energy, a factor that often transforms the operation into an indispensable and satisfying sadistic practice. It goes without saying that a successful interrogation, in the Punisher's definition, includes the violent death of the subject. But the possibility of dispensing gratuitous suffering does not stop at the interrogation mode. In fact, the title, while remaining a classic action-shooter, inserts special points placed here and there in the maps, but always in correspondence with particular objects or precipices. These points, marked by a luminous signal, allow Frank Castle to reserve special treatment for criminals captured and forcibly transported to the indicated place. The figure of the Punisher emerges completely on these occasions which fortunately present themselves in abundance during the game and, I must admit, in some cases they are decidedly imaginative and satisfying. We are therefore given the possibility of crushing, choking, hanging, devastating, tearing up and torturing the unfortunate poor in dozens of different ways, inspired by films, books and comics of all sorts, and in that moment, more often than not, the sensation of being in Frank Castle's shoes is definitely intense. Another small addition concerns the possibility of entering Slaughter, or rather of abandoning ourselves for a few seconds to absolute fury, which allows us to attack only with knives and limits us to a botched black and white vision but, at the same time, it makes us extremely fast and strong and able to regenerate a good amount of vital energy. Unfortunately the game structure, despite the additions, is not only that of a trivial third-person action, but presents us with a starched character with mechanical movements and capable of a single disengagement move, which is also rigid and of little use. Furthermore the artificial intelligence of allies and enemies is poor and loften leads to absurd trajectories and reckless suicide attacks. To tell the truth, the enemies probably respond to noises even allowing us to distract them and then go around them, but they are often so confused and asleep as to make this possibility superfluous in most cases. Technically As far as the technical side is concerned, the Punisher, to sum up, is an average title, with a positive peak as regards the creation of the faces and a negative one for the movements of Frank Castle, too rigid and unnatural, a factor that also affects on the handling of the controls. Punisher, to sum up, is an average title, with a positive peak as regards the realization of the faces and a negative one for the movements of Frank Castle Technically Even the design of maps and environments alternates inspired locations, rich in details and objects, with bare places and anonymous corridors and the textures are decidedly coarse and repetitive and this applies to both the PS2 and Xbox versions. There is no shortage of visual effects, explosions and splashes of blood but also in this case the quality is not the best, while the absence of an engine capable of replicating the physics of objects is a tangible lack, considering that we are talking about a feature that has now been implemented from the vast majority of action stocks. The dialogues, on the other hand, are extremely accurate, the interludes offer good entertainment and some closing bars of the Punisher can easily be part of a register of famous phrases. The musical pieces are varied and of good quality, with a subdued and beating rhythm, and unquestionably suitable for a title like the Punisher. Comment The Punisher is a third-person action shooter without infamy or praise, which stands out exclusively for the characterization of the protagonist. To guarantee a certain longevity to the title, the score of the missions intervenes, which allows you to unlock secrets, buy objects and upgrades in order to give an edge to the punisher. Unfortunately, the innovations are limited and do not directly affect the gaming experience, limiting themselves to enriching the outline, but undeniably the numerous skits, dialogues and plot can only amuse lovers of the character and those looking for a few hours of healthy release.Pro : the faces of the characters are well characterized dialogues in tone and atmospheric music dozens of hilariously violent skits Cons: coarse game engine animations not always believable spartan and imperfect artificial intelligence Out for PC, PS2, Xbox. In the year 2005 AD even the Punisher, anti-hero par excellence, leaps from the two-dimensional pages of Capcom history to three dimensions, thanks to THQ and above all thanks to the new-found fame guaranteed by the recent film. We therefore wear the role of Frank ~The Punisher~ Castle, trained to kill but happily married with a splendid and enviable family, far from the common problems of domestic coexistence. But one sad day the Castle family's rare fortune ends in a bloodbath, caused by the gross hands of organized crime. An unfillable void is the only legacy that the world has left to Frank, who leaves the scene defeated disappearing from the face of the earth. After a few years a dark figure emerges from the mists of the past, a figure who has found a way to fill his existential abyss in an unoriginal but decidedly effective way, with revenge. Revenge is a dirty weapon and Frank Castle, now effectively the Punisher complete with a white skull painted on his macho T-Shirt, has no intention of making it any cleaner or more acceptable.", "date": "2005-04-06", "grade": null}
