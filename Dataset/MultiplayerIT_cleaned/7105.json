But it is also a valid way to flesh out the catalog of a console that may be in difficulty with regard to the release calendar. It is not particularly complicated to include PlayStation Vita in the latter category: if the Sony laptop has now created a solid ~second life~ in the field of indie productions, from the point of view of leading publications it is instead clear that there are obvious problems. God of War Collection is the portable conversion of the same product released in 2010 on PlayStation 3, which in turn (obviously) represented a collection of the first two episodes of the Kratos saga, which appeared on PlayStation 2 in 2005 and 2007. Factors that necessarily reduce the target user of this PlayStation Vita version: to nourish interest you should either have missed out on PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3, two of the titles that have most contributed to defining the PlayStation brand in recent years, or be so in love with the series that you want to replay it on beautiful handheld screen of the Japanese house free from the constraints of the living room at home. In the latter case, however, be prepared for some disappointment... God of War Collection on PlayStation Vita stumbles upon truly unacceptable technical problems I have anger One of the strengths of PS Vita has always been undoubtedly the hardware: in addition to the exceptional quality of the OLED (but also the LCD on the new version is certainly not to be thrown away), it is under the hood that the Sony laptop he has shown that he has such musculature as to allow him to manage games with ~home console~ technical qualities without any problem. It is therefore quite complicated to understand why the same machine that runs Uncharted: Golden Abyss or Killzone: Mercenary, just to name a couple, takes all this effort to return a convincing experience for stuff originally released on a less powerful system like PlayStation 2. And instead the work of the Sanzaru Games team, which has been entrusted with the porting, certainly cannot be said to be free from criticism. Starting with the resolution, upscaled to 960x544 of the PS Vita screen in a very little optimized way: in comparison with the other versions, the inferior graphic cleanliness is evident and more specifically a drop in the definition which returns an overall more blurred image, the which inevitably determines a lower level of overall detail. Even the interlude sequences have suffered a lot: instead of adapting them to the proportions of the screen, the programmers have preferred to place two large black bars on the sides, a factor which generates a significant gap between the in-game and non-playable phases. The compression work was particularly complicated, evidently linked to the need to fit within an acceptable size: however, the 3.3 GB resulted in a whole series of unpleasant artifacts during the movies, as well as a drastic drop in the quality of the track audio especially as regards the dialogues, which often seem to come from an old radio rather than a modern portable console. But the most serious blow that this God of War Collection for PlayStation Vita is forced to suffer is undoubtedly in the frame rate: if the originals aimed at 60 frames per second, then reached steadily by the PlayStation 3 re-release, in this case the programmers are not never managed to exceed 30 frames per second, with frequent drops even below 20 in the most agitated situations. This is a serious problem that irreparably also affects the fluidity of the gameplay of the product itself, inevitably making the version for the Sony handheld the worst way ever to appreciate the first two chapters of Kratos' story. The use of the rear touch surface, delegated to the interaction with objects and the opening of the chests, is also not entirely convincing; given the handle of the console, it is not at all uncommon to find yourself touching the back of the body by mistake. Therefore, if God of War Collection still manages to achieve a decent rating, it is only thanks to the quality of the original material: although compromised by the technical problems described above, the two Santa Monica Studio productions still manage to be appreciated after many years. Certainly the exploitation of the franchise and the almost 10 years that have passed have left some marks, but nevertheless these are titles that are playedare still with great pleasure today, above all thanks to an extraordinary characterization of the characters and an epic atmosphere that only very few other productions can boast. Finally, among the evidently few positive notes, it is worth mentioning the cross-buy function of the product thanks to which it is possible to download the game also on PlayStation 3: given what has been said previously, it is therefore obvious that - being able to choose - it is precisely the version for the last generation home console is the one to be preferred without reservations. On the other hand, we are sorry for the incomprehensible absence of the cross-save function.", "date": "2014-05-23", "grade": "7.0"}
