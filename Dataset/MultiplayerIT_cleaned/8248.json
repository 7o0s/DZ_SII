With the new film in the saga, Skyfall, to be released in cinemas in a few days, Eurocom Entertainment therefore thought of killing two birds with one stone, creating a ~celebratory~ title for the agent secret created by Ian Flaming that retraces some of his most famous missions, then adding the same ~Skyfall~ through the release of a free DLC, available from November 9th for PS3 owners and from November 20th for X360 owners. The single player campaign kicks off with a taste of the events to be told in the new film, with Bond being accidentally injured and falling off a bridge into the water, struggling to survive as life, as they say, flashes before his eyes . In this case, the character relives five of his adventures: ~Mission Goldfinger~, ~On Her Majesty's Secret Service~, ~Private Revenge~, ~Death Can Wait~ and ~Moonraker: Grand Slam of Death~, or at least these are Italian film titles. Each of these missions has a duration of forty to sixty minutes, depending on the approach we decide to use. As per tradition for the series, in fact, we will be able to explore the scenarios silently, without being spotted, taking care to deactivate the security systems and take any enemies from behind; or not care about the surprise effect and proceed with guns blazing, killing anyone who gets in front of us. There is also an option to choose between the ~modern~ energy bar, which recharges itself, and the classic one with the kits to be collected from time to time to restore it. In any case, at the end of each level we will be presented with a performance evaluation and the list of completed objectives, stimulating us to play it all over again in case the completion percentage is low. My name is Pappus. Pierpappo Beyond the dialogues, which faithfully reproduce what has been seen in the five James Bond films, with the character who however always presents himself with the appearance of Daniel Craig (which also creates a nice effect for fans of the film saga) , the game always throws us into the heart of the action, generally asking us to explore a building in search of evidence and, therefore, to face a series of frantic firefights until we arrive at the confrontation with the boss on duty. The investigative phase is based on the use of Bond's trusty smartphone, a Sony Xperia capable not only of taking high-resolution photos, but also of detecting electronic devices and visually scanning fingerprints, as well as functioning as a hacking (no, you can't play Crash Bandicoot! ed.). For example, when we are in Goldfinger's office, we must locate the hidden mechanisms that open a safe and appropriate the evidence inside it. The so-called ~Bond girls~ could not be missing, each engaged in the role that originally belonged to them but also willing to assist us during the fights. And speaking of fights, before analyzing the gunplay it is appropriate to talk about hand-to-hand clashes, which Eurocom has decided to include by adopting solutions that are on the one hand understandable, on the other questionable. When Bond is engaged in a fistfight, in fact, his opponent assumes a defensive position that leaves a point between the head and the body irreparably uncovered, so you have to strike in that direction to inflict damage and avoid counterattacks. The problem is that this sequence, which looks like a trivial quick time event, is not only repetitive in the long run, but also and above all very easy: we have never lost a match, also because the right moves are promptly suggested on the screen. Spin and shoot, shoot and spin So let's come to the core of the gameplay, or the firefights and the availability in terms of arsenal. That the developers were inspired by the Call of Duty philosophy becomes clear after a few minutes, after all it is actually possible to make your way through your opponents by placing short bursts, reload and proceed to the next area, in a fun and even spectacular way. The weapons are quite varied, but enjoy a truly anonymous and insubstantial upgrade system: using certain cases you access a virtual shop where you can buy sights, magazines with extra capacity and upgrades to improve effectiveness, but the procedureit ends up being trivialized by the ways and ease with which it can be accessed. Difficult to do otherwise with missions structured in this way, we realize it, and we still appreciate the balance of difficulty, which forces on several occasions to abandon a weapon to pick up another one, whereas there are shooters where you never run out of ammunition. The standard action also leaves room for some variations on the theme, such as when you try your hand at traditional target shooting from a helicopter, sniper rifle in hand, or when you face a snowy mountain armed only with a pair of skis and a light machine gun, or even when you race aboard a James Bond custom-built car to chase a dangerous criminal. Particularly noteworthy, in our opinion, is the last mission, ~Moonraker~, in which at a certain point we will find ourselves fighting inside a zero gravity orbital station, trying to better control the ascents and descents while we target our opponents with laser rifles. Xbox 360 goals There are fifty Objectives that can be unlocked with 007 Legends, for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints. The more modest rewards are obtained in the simplest way, that is by completing the missions at various degrees of difficulty, while to already get 20G you need to go into detail and obtain certain percentages of completion. There are also several Objectives based on the challenges and on the online sector. The playful offer It is not yet known what kind of consistency the DLC based on the film ~Skyfall~ will have, however the single player campaign of 007 Legends is completed quite quickly: as mentioned, it takes between forty and sixty minutes per mission, depending on the approach, and this therefore translates into a total duration of four, five hours at the most. The presence of numerous objectives stimulates a minimum of replayability, but it is above all the presence of the extra challenges that lengthen the life of the single-player game, with ten rather complicated skill tests to complete, in which we will have to really commit ourselves and rationalize the use of ammunition to achieve our goal. And then, it is clear, there is the multiplayer sector, both online and locally via split-screen, with eight modes to choose from (~Conflict~, or all against all; ~Golden Gun~, the same but with the of a single weapon available to all players; ~You Only Live Twice~, the second variant of free-for-all, but with lives numbered; ~Escalation~, a fight in which every kill corresponds to a new weapon and whoever gets as far wins to the last; ~Data Miner~, a variant of the classic ~seek and destroy~; ~Team Conflict~, or the team death match; ~Icarus~, a territorial mode based on the control of certain areas; ~Black Box~, in which each team takes turns defending or attacking a position) and as many maps. However, the question arises: with the new Call of Duty out, how populated will the 007 Legends multiplayer be? Finally, a few words for the technical sector: the polygonal model of James Bond is a copy of Daniel Craig and in this sense we have nothing to complain about, but in general the feeling is that of being faced with an ~old generation~ production , that is, devoid of effects and solutions that should instead characterize games at this point in the life cycle of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.", "date": "2012-10-19", "grade": "6.7"}
