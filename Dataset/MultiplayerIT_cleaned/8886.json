After all we are talking about a character born way back in 1938, to be precise on the pages of the first issue of the comic magazine Action Comics; a character capable, over the decades, of renewing and transforming himself, of dying and being reborn, in search of authors who were able to enhance his character rather than focus solely on his multiple powers. When it comes to the Man of Steel, the unmistakable red and blue uniform with the ~S~ on the chest, the face of the late Christopher Reeve, the engaging musical theme written by John Williams and even the numerous tie-ins come to mind. unfortunately almost never lived up to expectations. The transposition of the film ~Superman Returns~ produced in 2006 by Electronic Arts, probably represents the most successful experiment in this sense, yet it did not impress the trade press much, which branded it as a mediocre title. Now Tiger Games and Chillingo are trying again, bringing the Kryptonian to the iOS platform in an action game that in many ways winks at the ~classic~ characterization of Superman, the one that we can find in the fascinating cartoon from the 1940s and which sees the hero to act without hesitation for the good of the planet, and of the city of Metropolis in particular, abandoning the role of mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent in an instant to dart at lightning speed in the skies and hunt down the bad guys. Which is exactly what we will do in the game: after downloading the high resolution packs (if you have a latest generation iPhone), a list of eighteen missions appears in which we will have to catch fleeing criminals, rout soldiers stationed on the roofs, disintegrate androids of various types, rescue planes in trouble, send dangerous car bombs into space, eliminate missiles and so on. Applause and cheers from the citizens of Metropolis will crown each successfully completed level as the hero takes to the posts for photos. This is a job for Superman! Superman has always been a difficult character to manage, basically because he can do everything: he is invulnerable (unless you have kryptonite), he can fly and run at great speeds, he possesses phenomenal strength, he can emit a heat beam from his eyes, he is capable of hearing the sound of a pin falling miles away and causing a storm with a breath. That's not all: he can look as far as the curvature of the planet allows him, he is able to hold his breath for days (and therefore travel in space without problems) and to further amplify his power thanks to the sun. Do you think that in the ~JLA / Avengers~ crossover he even beat Thor, the god of thunder. The objective of the Tiger Games developers was therefore not to test the skills of the hero, who has his own energy bar but who can hardly be defeated, but those of the player: each mission is made up of a series of objectives that must be completed in the shortest possible time (the less it takes and the higher the final evaluation will be) and which provide a mix of rescues, combat, rapid movement and so on. The control system, based entirely on the touch screen, allows us to move Superman using a virtual analog stick placed on the left side of the screen, while on the right there are two buttons: one to attack and one to sprint. The first button is also called upon to interact with the scenario or use the thermal view, in a very intuitive way, but the problems arise when we are asked not only to be fast, but also to be precise. We will often find ourselves faced with fragments of meteorites that are about to enter the Earth's orbit and that we must destroy before their impact on the ground. Well, ~hooking~ them to complete this task will not be easy at all, precisely because of the poor precision of the control system. This creates difficulties even during the fights, forcing us to resort to a ~hit and run~ style approach and to get close to the target on duty several times to be able to hit it with a shot. Technically the game appears fairly well done, the graphics are very fluid and in functional terms this can only be a good thing, but the animation of the character is severely limited, almost as if it were a cardboard cutout, and the scenario has no variety as it is an anonymous urban backdrop. The music tries to mimic the aforementioned John Williams theme: the final effect is not bad, but not unforgettable either.The tested version is 1.0 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2011-12-05", "grade": "6.2"}
