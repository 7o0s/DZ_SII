It could be defined as the classic case of adolescent crisis, except that Neku wakes up in the middle of Shibuya, a well-known Japanese district, without completely remembering how he got there and why he has a brooch in his hand. What's worse, he can hear people's thoughts, and some of those thoughts are downright lethal, in their solid, hideous form. You see, Neku will discover that he has been involved in the Reaper Game (in the original Japanese edition they are the Shinigami, none other than the gods of death) and that he has seven days to win it, trying to carry out one mission a day for them. He's not the only one playing: other individuals like him are also involved, and to survive Neku will have to team up with an intrusive girl named Shiki. It's just the beginning of a truly hellish week: our protagonist will have to find out why he's participating in this macabre Game, what's at stake, how to win. But above all, he will have to come to terms with himself and especially with others, because the world ends with him, and each person is a world unto himself. Only by understanding this will Neku have any hope. In a truly original setting, everyday Shibuya, with its narrow streets and its hundreds of passers-by, traffic lights, cars and shops, a truly complex plot unfolds, of extraordinary power: what at first seems like a confused story and irrational quickly acquires more and more sense and meaning, shocking the player with continuous and unexpected twists. The protagonists are teenagers but their story is not a sweetened moral fairy tale about the all-Japanese sense of friendship and sacrifice: The World Ends with You is a strong and violent story, it takes on a positive and constructive morality but there comes through crude sequences and characters bordering on politically correct and blasphemous. And that's okay. Stylish. The young people of Shibuya and the particular style of this urban agglomeration influenced the artistic choices of Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi, character designer of The World Ends with You. The game has thus taken on a very particular and clear visual style, extremely modern and decisive, which has been perfectly translated by the developers in the rendering of the various locations into which the neighborhood is divided, which can be explored by the player in the role of Neku. Thus, abandoned forests, ruins, castles and mountains, caves and catacombs, The World Ends with You takes place entirely in an urban district, between crossroads, bus stops, underpasses, parks and shopping centres. The chaotic world of Neku, which is really ours, manages to be oppressive and threatening in the soaring of the inclined buildings to cover our passage and in the close-ups of wires, cables, signs and lampposts, which cover the camera that frames the passage of Neku, directed towards who knows what destination. The screens are thus an explosion of colors and animated sprites, very rich in detail and immediately recognizable in their everyday life, made supernatural by the story told, rather than by their immediately visible characteristics. And then there's the action of the fights, when the screen changes and Neku faces the Noise together with his partner, launching his attacks against all kinds of creatures, sometimes gigantic, including electric discharges, explosions, flames, tornadoes and hurled cars in thought, without the slightest slowdown, in a real orgy of well-animated sprites. The World Ends with You manages to be original even in the choice of the soundtrack: completely sung. There are no particular jingles and themes associated with certain game sequences, there are only songs, the same ones that presumably Neku is also listening to in his headphones, which almost shelter him from the outside world that he fears and rejects so much. Very good quality sung tracks, among other things, in English and Japanese, mainly hip hop and techno influenced, absolutely perfect for the atmosphere in the game, produced by an extraordinary Takeharu Ishimoto. An excellent soundrack, therefore, which culminates in the theme-song ~Lullaby for You~, and which accompanies the player throughout the adventure without boring him for a moment. The Lord of Brooches The basic mechanics of this JRPG are disarmingly simple: you control Neku and explore the huge Shibuya to reach certain goals, fighting enemies if necessary, solving simple puzzles and reading the conversations between the protagonists through which the plot. Yet, what seems like a very simple mechanic and far from itthat original hides a sensational playful depth and a truly refreshing breath of innovation. First of all, the combat: cross and delight of every self-respecting JRPG, in The World Ends with You this element has been rendered wonderfully, although its complexity makes it not easy to assimilate in the first hour of the game. When Neku enters a trance to read people's minds, he is able to visualize negative thoughts as well, called Noise and used by the Reapers to counter the Players. These fights take place on both screens: the lower one is dedicated to Neku, the upper one to his partner. Although Neku's partner changes during the adventure, the fighting style remains the same: using the directional cross or the A, B, X and Y keys (designed for left-handed people) it is possible to dodge and attack enemies by making combinations of shots; when certain requirements are met through these combos, it is also possible to activate a spectacular special attack that combines the strengths of Neku and his partner. On the lower screen, however, the matter changes decisively: Neku is not bound to the center of the screen, he can in fact move freely by tracing the trajectory of his next move with the stylus. Funny as it is to say, Neku fights through Pins, real pins that project his psychic powers: these Pins are obtained through the development of the plot, they are purchased or released by defeated enemies, and they are many and different both in capacity than in the way of activating them. At the beginning, Neku will only be able to equip three, but as the adventure progresses, up to six will be able to be brought into combat: considering, then, that the Pins increase in power and even in some cases evolve into more powerful Pins, one can already have a vague idea of the variety proposed by the battle-system. Furthermore, the activation of the Pins is absolutely peculiar: some Pins will require you to draw lines on enemies with the stylus to slice them with psychic blades, others will allow you to generate trails of fire by sliding the stylus on the screen, and with the same stylus you they will be able to touch cars and then hurl them at enemies via the Pin that expresses Neku's telekinesis. There are even pins that require you to blow or yell into the Nintendo DS microphone to unleash devastating area-of-effect attacks. The possible combinations for the player are truly infinite, and in just a few minutes you can perceive the potential of a system that invites you to customize your own fighting style. As a result, battles in The World Ends with You become a frantic control of both screens (don't worry: it's even possible to select various degrees of automation for Neku's partner!) to strike enemies rhythmically transmitting some kind of damage bonus from Neku to his partner and vice versa, being careful not to be damaged in both screens, since the life force of Neku and his partner is in common. ... what appears to be a very simple mechanic hides a sensational playful depth... The Lord of Brooches In this regard, a truly original and ingenious element of The World Ends with You enters the scene: the level of experience. As in many similar JRPGs, also in The World Ends with You by defeating enemies you earn the points necessary to level up, but the latter only affects the amount of HP of Neku and his partner, which obviously facilitates battles: and precisely for this reason the player can, at any time, change his level, increase or decrease it together with his HP, as well as he can change the difficulty of the clashes. The combination of the amount of levels and the difficulty of the fights very simply influences the prizes received at the end of the battles: the lower the level and the higher the difficulty, the more numerous and rare the obtainable objects will be. This mechanism easily manages to stem problems such as difficulty balancing or the oppressive ~farming~ of objects and experience points that afflict many JRPGs on the market: in The World Ends with You the player chooses the level of difficulty when looking for objects and how to progress through the adventure, at any time and without restrictions. Furthermore, objects play a decidedly important role in The World Ends with You, but in a certainly atypical way: each character can in fact equip up to four different garments such as shoes, hats, t-shirts, trousers. The many shops scattered around Shibuya will sell these items of clothing, and as you shop at a certain shop theaffinity with the seller who will begin to unlock their peculiar and very secret bonuses in the various objects on sale. Not only. The various clothes that can be purchased naturally belong to different brands, and each district of Shibuya has its own clothing trends. In a certain area, for example, a certain brand may be fashionable and, of course, if Neku dresses according to the trend, he gets bonuses during fights; ironically, if a brand in a certain area does not appeal to the player, you can also change the trend by using the Pins of the brand you want to ~advertise~ in multiple fights. An equally original approach is adopted with the foods, which temporarily enhance Neku and his partner: hamburgers, bowls of ramen and cakes can be purchased and enjoyed, but only in a certain amount of bites, and only after digesting the meal the bonuses they will activate and influence the progress of the clashes. Extras, amenities, quirks At this point we imagine that it is clear how original, fun and intriguing The World Ends with You manages to be, and how much complexity such an apparently linear game system hides. Yet, linearity is the only real defect of the Square Enix effort, which in fact, despite the enormous depth and playful innovation, maintains a unidirectional trend: despite the freedom offered to the player especially in the advanced stages, each chapter or ~day~ of Neku's macabre week requires the achievement of a certain objective, which often occurs by moving from one area to another, fighting if necessary, and reading the dialogues that frequently interrupt the action to tell us the story. It's not actually a real flaw, as the play structure works very well even like this, but sometimes you get the distinct feeling of being on the tracks of a train. Fortunately, The World Ends with You has many advantages to offer, which also include a more than discreet longevity, a series of numerous optional quests to be solved once the game is over, to discover all the backstory of the story, and even a mini- game (Tin Pin Slammer) in which Pins are used to fight on game tables by pushing them against each other: incredibly, the hundreds of Pins in the game have various characteristics that adapt them differently to the challenges. We could continue talking about the system that allows you to play again every ~day~ at will, or the stand-by mode in which you can put the Nintendo DS when you go around, in the hope that another owner of the cartridge in the same situation will send us thus his data expanding our collection of Pins... but at this point they would be trifles, that The World Ends with You is a masterpiece we believe we have already understood. Comment There is little to add to what has already been written: The World Ends with You demonstrates how it is possible to renew a genre with original, courageous and out of the ordinary ideas. The cartridge is an obligatory purchase for every lover of the genre and beyond, it is an incredibly captivating JRPG that makes its only flaw - excessive linearity - a workhorse for those less accustomed to the genre. Technically excellent, with an amazing soundtrack and a splendid storyline, The World Ends with You is already a milestone. However, it is sad to note that even on this occasion the Italian adaptation was forgotten: the texts are in fact in excellent English, but given the quantity and complexity we would have liked a translation into Italian. If the language doesn't scare you, it's a title to have, even in the face of the fact that in our country it is still sold with a guide completely in Italian attached. Pros Captivating story Varied, complex and deep Technically top notch, without a polygon that is one Cons Linear The main-quest could have lasted longer It hasn't been translated into Italian The World Ends with You is available for Nintendo DS. How original can a videogame genre be? How far can it go before becoming obsolete? Is there really a need to renew a concept for which there are hundreds of interpretations, when this always remains a winner, despite its solid stasis? Programmers, critics and users themselves often find themselves asking themselves these questions, especially in this videogame generation, where originality now seems a secondary quality, when it is much easier not to change the winning team, not to risk tested and safe. The Japanese Role Playing Game genre is one of the most static in today's playful landscape: each software house has given it its own interpretation, which then became a sort of archetype that divided the genre into sub-genres", "date": "2008-04-11", "grade": null}
