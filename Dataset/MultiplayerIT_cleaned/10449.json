He doesn't have any character nor any intention. Games are not exercise, there is no report of activities performed, calories burned and time spent playing. Only 15 games to be played using the mat to lay on the floor and the Wii controller. Once the nature of the game has been clarified, let's go into the details of the package and the offer proposed by Namco / Bandai in the second chapter of the Family Trainer series. The embarrassment felt by the creators in choosing the title seems to have also materialized in the setting of the game. The menus are not very explanatory, it is not clear the difference between one choice and another and which one is right for us. They are a sequence of cascading choices that lead us to sub-collections of the games included in the game. The first entries, those called ~beginners~ contain only three games, and gradually you can access an increasingly numerous and therefore more demanding both physically and in terms of time expenditure. There is no story mode, there is no party mode, just a list of unlockable items one after the other, until the list ends. I'll roll out the carpet for you Once the carpet has been unfolded and connected to one of the doors hidden in the Wii door, we are ready for action, just long enough to choose a character who represents us and who can be replaced by a Mii once the function has been unlocked. What the programmers have prepared for us are real sports representations. There is for example bmx, skateboard, roller, or even climbing with bare hands, or a simple jump rope. All these events have been adapted to the mat with sometimes more faithful results than others. When jumping rope, just jump on the spot, being careful however to always fall back on the central buttons, on the bmx or roller, you will have to simulate pedaling and striding by alternating your feet on the carpet. If we're driving, tilting the Wii controller we'll curve at will. More generally, the central keys of the carpet represent a jump, while the other directions are used for evolutions or movements. However the result leaves us quite perplexed, if in some cases the similarity between what we would actually do and what we are called to do is concrete, in others it is mostly a case of squashing by chance that a result is produced anyway . And the family? Although the games offered are actually suitable for everyone, the game is limited to only two people at a time, a choice probably due to the fact that there is only one play mat and you have to take turns at the commands. Longer waits would have annoyed players on pause. By facing the game in multiplayer, practically nothing changes compared to the one-player mode except for the fact that there will be two game rounds, and the comparison of the final score. Moving on to the graphic front, the game is represented by a nice characterization thanks to a graphic technique that simulates the characteristic lines of comics and cartoons. Nothing advanced but sufficient for the purpose. The main problem with Family Trainer: Extreme Sport is a clear confusion in the planning phase. It's too spartan for the market it's aimed at and the explanations of the games aren't always clear, nor is the interface, which doesn't guide the player without making him feel lost within the choices made. If some games are rewarding, most do not find a satisfactory consideration in the game. Surely the little ones will enjoy moving around and jumping in front of the TV, but the risk is to get bored soon, and the competition's offer is becoming more and more interesting.", "date": "2009-10-22", "grade": null}
