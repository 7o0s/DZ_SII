The main mode is the challenge, in which we will go from one pinball machine to another in order of difficulty, with the aim of exceeding a certain score with the credits at our disposal. Setting new records and moving forward in the game will allow us to earn tokens, which can then be spent to ~train~ with the other pinball machines in the room. Anyway, here's an overview of the classics we can try our hand at Genie (1979) Clearly inspired by the telefilm Bewitched, Genie is a bit of a forerunner of the times, as its structure in no way suggests its age. It is a very aesthetically pleasing pinball machine, in which shades of yellow prevail, equipped with as many as five flippers: two small ones on the top, one on the side in the middle and the two standard ones on the bottom. The peculiarity of this device is that the small paddles are arranged to form a pinball machine in its own right, so with a little practice you can keep the ball in that area for enough time to score a large number of points . El Dorado and the City of Gold (1984) The graphics of this pinball machine clearly refer to the Indiana Jones films, and the artists who conceived it thought of using various shades of green to represent the vegetation but also ancient stones and artifacts. A poor choice, sadly, as everything becomes confusing and there is little contrast between the raised parts and the ~carpet~, with dramatic visual results. Furthermore, the arrangement of the elements does not favor playability in any way, with the only positive note represented by the innovative central ~nail~ between the two paddles at the bottom, which allows us to save the ball from elimination if it falls centrally. Provided you have the reflexes not to operate the paddles at that juncture Black Hole (1981) and Ace High (1957) Black Hole is a pinball machine of great historical importance, as it was the first to cost 50 cents and therefore to represent a considerable source of income for the managers of the arcades that housed it. Unfortunately the characteristics of the device do not fully justify all this, and Black Hole turns out to be a modest and not very fun pinball machine. The black colour, clearly used to represent the open space, gives the device a dull and sad appearance, whereas such machines have always been characterized by bright colours. To be a device from 1957, Age High shows rather respectable characteristics. Very nice graphically, with the casino theme that gives color and joy, it is a pinball machine equipped with large bounce elements placed in the upper part, which in fact hold the ball hostage for a long time and which are able to totalize many points. The problem is that the rest is a bit missing, and the ball too often ends up falling into the outer side lanes, inevitably ending up being lost. Big Shot (1974), Central Park (1966) and Play-Boy (1932) Three different pinball machines in terms of theme and graphic design, however characterized by a certain difficulty and the lack of prominent elements. The first refers to the game of billiards, with predominant green and brown and the paddles arranged quite far apart, so that it is all too easy to lose the ball by pure chance. The second is more cheerful thanks to the use of warm colors, but it is equally difficult and not very fun. The third, Play-Boy, dates back to 1932 and can hardly be classified as a pinball machine, as it has a large number of balls that are placed inside holes corresponding to poker cards, using the oscillating pedal. Goin' Nuts (1983) and Victory (1987) Again, two essentially different pinball machines, both from the 1980s. The first, Goin' Nuts, was included for its particular story: the production of the device was immediately blocked due to too high costs, and so only ten were made. Obviously it is a collector's item, very particular for the frenzy of the action: you will find yourself managing a lot of balls at the same time, therefore some phases of the game will turn into a rebounding party capable of making you score very high scores. Victory is certainly less rare, but it is perhaps the funniest and most exciting pinball machine in this collection. Inspired by the world of racing, it is characterized by numerous sound and light effects, by a graphvery well done and by the presence of numerous variants with several floors, which will lead the ball to sometimes end up in a sort of upper mini pinball machine, sometimes inside fast galleries. Really cute. Teed-Off (1993) and Strikes n' Spares (1995) The two most recent devices from Gottlieb Pinball Classics. The first is a classic pinball machine, with discreet graphics, distinguished like Victory by the presence of numerous galleries and alternative tracks, which really make the difference in terms of playability. Strikes n' Spares, on the other hand, is an atypical product, as it cannot be defined as a standard pinball machine and is based on the game of bowling. You can try your hand at three different game modes, but in any case what matters is hitting the pins that are located in the center of the top of the table. To do this, you have to operate one of the paddles, drop a ball and throw it at the right moment: the result is exciting, although very different from what other devices have accustomed us to. Technical realization System 3's new product has no differences from the PSP version, except for the higher resolution of PS2. Each pinball machine can be played using different views, although there are no universally valid choices and you end up looking for the same solution with each device, in order to have more control over the ball. The graphics are very well done and the management of the polygons is fluid and without uncertainties. It should be noted the care with which all the devices have been reproduced, even the extra ones (Xolten and Love Meter), both in terms of graphics and sound. Comment We are dealing with an excellent ~celebratory~ product, sold at an appropriate price given the particular user it is aimed at. Gottlieb Pinball Classics is well programmed, reproduces a large number of pinball machines in an absolutely faithful way and represents an excellent opportunity to relive the days spent in the arcade. It should also be borne in mind that pinball machines for PS2 are not many, so even if the PSP version is more apt in terms of use (the game lends itself to short sessions), this conversion too has its own meaning and dignity . If you like pinball machines and want to travel through time, take a seat Pros: Faithful reproduction of pinball machines Very well programmed Excellent value for money Cons: Not all machines are up to par Only for enthusiasts After the PSP version, Gottlieb Pinball Classics also arrives on PS2 and allows us to relive the emotions of classic arcades at the command of eleven pinball machines, selected and included in this title for their historical importance and specific characteristics. Grab a few tokens, therefore, and get ready for a journey back in time, through the history of one of the most important pinball machine manufacturers in the world.", "date": "2006-11-13", "grade": null}
