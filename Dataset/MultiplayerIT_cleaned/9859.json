So it is no coincidence that the episode begins in a climate of zombie attack, with the protagonists holed up in Stinky's bar, from which they must find a way to escape to find out who has unleashed this canine army obsessed with toybox toys. Between literary and cinematic quotations, Beyond the Alley of the Dolls closes the subplots open up to now and enjoys misleading the player. As also happened in the penultimate chapter of Tales of Monkey Island, the Telltales make a clean sweep of all the minor questions and up the ante in view of the final climax, in the best tradition of the three-act screenplay. Unfortunately the story is slow and refuses to involve the player, only to wake him up abruptly in the final, superb from every point of view. However, the monotony is counterbalanced by the brilliant comedy staged by the authors, who have once again written formidable jokes for the scripts of Sam and Max, lucid and impeccable. Too bad only for the lack of temporal leaps in the narrative, abandoned in favor of a linear development of the story. However, despite the latest uncertainties, in the third season the Tellatales have dared everything, experimenting without inhibitions and creating what could become a classic of graphic adventures. Keep out of reach of children Sam's clones are on the hunt for the dangerous toys that give Max his powers, essential to overcome almost all puzzles. Except for three or four items, in fact, Max's new psychic abilities are all we need to continue the story. The wheel of powers is finally complete, even if many skills are neglected or rarely used, favoring the new talent, mind reading, with which we can unlock dialogue options and clues. Even if the dazzling idea of powers made us love the third season, arrived at the fourth episode it is no longer a novelty. Moreover, the puzzles are much easier than those seen in The Tomb of Sammun-Mak, just to give an example. This is why useless clues have been sown that divert the player's attention, even if rather than increasing the difficulty, they end up being annoying wastes of time. The one exception is the final sequence, which puts the best aspect of the powers to use and is underpinned by impeccable choreography. The shots and sequences are perfect, punctuated by hard and visually powerful music. The Telltales wanted to make a clean sweep of everything they had sown to clear the field in view of what could be a final episode with fireworks. We therefore remain in suspense and hope that the conclusion of the season is up to the peaks of excellence touched in the first episodes. These guys are too talented to disappoint.
