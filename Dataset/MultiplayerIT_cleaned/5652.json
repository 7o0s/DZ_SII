However, it remains one of the most successful formulas in the mobile sector and this encourages developers to continue along this path, sometimes trying to mix things up a bit and in other cases preferring a more cautious approach: it can be said that this is the road followed by Road to Be King by the French NoHuman Studios, but will it be enough to make it a title capable of lasting more than a few hours on users' smartphones? Road to Be King is an unpretentious title that works best in the short term A king like many In an extremely pragmatic way, Road to Be King does not waste even a second to tell a story that in all honesty would not be interested in anyone anyway: the initial screen in fact sees the protagonist (a kind of not particularly handsome blue toad) engaged in extracting a sword from a rock, an operation that ends successfully only when you tap the screen to start the real action. That's enough for NoHuman to introduce the game world, in which the unlikely aspiring ruler must make his way to cover the greatest possible distance avoiding impediments and various dangers and collecting bonuses, all in short, in full endless runner style. Framed from a bird's eye view, Road to Be King offers functional and colorful two-dimensional cartoon-style graphics that absolutely don't make you cry out for a miracle but which nevertheless performs its duty without smudging: a definition that could ultimately summarize the value of the entire Noodlecake Games production, a game that offers fair doses of fun especially if compared to its free nature, but which will hardly write a page in the history of mobile gaming. This is above all because the French developers obviously wanted to play it safe, following the rules of the genre without daring practically anything: Road to Be King therefore behaves like many of its other colleagues, with distinctive elements that are noticeable only in some marginal details. The user must therefore move the protagonist who runs forward independently by dragging his finger on the touch screen, making him collect the gems scattered along the way, turning him against smaller enemies to defeat them and helping him to get around obstacles and bigger opponents whose contact causes the loss of one of the three hearts that identify the vital energy. This is precisely one of the few details in which Road to Be King stands out from the crowd, together with a precise (and pleasant) peculiarity of the control system, which automatically pauses the game when you lift your finger from the display. The rest is pure endless runner academy: there are trophies and achievements to unlock, upgrades to buy by spending the collected gems and the inevitable in-app purchases which mainly involve diamonds which are essential to continue after a game over or to have access to the most powerful items . In short, everything has already been widely seen, for a title that in its being even banal in its way behaves in an excellent and orderly way: to say that Road to Be King is not immediate and fun would be a lie, but it must also be emphasized that the title NoHuman present all but all the endemic defects of the genre, among which the almost total absence of a sense of progression stands out, which in the long run makes the product lose a lot of bite.", "date": "2016-03-12", "grade": "7.0"}
