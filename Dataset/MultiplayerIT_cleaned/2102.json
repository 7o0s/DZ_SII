The main underlying problem was the following: to allow the reader to get to know the production in all its strengths and weaknesses, but without putting too much pressure on the latter due to the high expectations of recent months. In itself, in fact, Harvest Moon: One World is a revolutionary title, and it has wanted to be so since the announcement. The problem is that - ideas aside - it won't be able to revolutionize the series; if anything, it will propose a nice and pleasant new farming simulator, seasoned with minimal ~social~ mechanics, but which at present already several other productions (any Stardew Valley, to say) abundantly exceed. However, let's analyze well what is in all respects, we anticipate it, a new adventure that is more than enough but never really brilliant. Plot Harvest Moon: One World, farming is the key to experience Harvest Moon: One World also has a plot, which is a pretext, but so be it. The protagonist (he or she, you can create him/her through the initial editor, with the historical minimum of possible options active) lives in one of the five game regions, Calisson, the most anonymous and hilly. The world finds itself in a situation where the only food that exists is potatoes: you can plant, grow and eat potatoes, and that's it; the goddess of the harvest no one has seen since. But, surprise surprise, the protagonist turns out to be a special little fellow: he can see the harvest goblins! Precisely from these cute little creatures, the player will immediately get new seeds that no one had ever seen in a very long time. Hence the beginning of a (long) adventure through the five regions of the title, in search of all existing crops, while trying to restore the world to its former glory (from an agricultural point of view, at least) by favoring the return of goddess of tale, who never really lost her faith in humanity entirely. We talked about a pretext, and that's it: for the first time in the history of the series, the protagonist does not inherit a dilapidated farm to be restored and brought back to its former glory, but embarks on a journey full of discoveries with his business in his pocket. Portable farm Harvest Moon: One World, here are some animals that you can raise And here is the great revolutionary news that we had already told you about in our special dedicated to Harvest Moon: One World: our tone may seem ironic, but it is not. In itself, the game mechanic in question is truly remarkable and could have really refreshed the entire production ... only then it was not fully developed. Thanks to a scientist friend, the protagonist of Harvest Moon: One World can literally put the farm in his pocket and take it around the world with him: having arrived in a new region, he positions it, finding everything as he left it. A portable farm? What is all this for? To vary the play offer, of course. There are five regions in all: Calisson (rural), Halo Halo (tropical), Pastilla (desert), Lebkuchen (volcanic) and Salmiakki (polar). In each of these places the player will find animals to raise, look after, cuddle that are not present elsewhere, as well as unpublished seeds. These same seeds (which must always be obtained from the goblins) once planted in other regions either need time and special attention, or ripen in special crops different from the original ones. Satisfy an NPC here, travel to find a seed there, you can sense how interesting the experience itself is, and how it encourages you to constantly move around the open world. But the implementation of the whole is quite bland. Harvest Moon: One World and its bachelors Let's take the open world itself: one would expect that as many as five regions, and so varied, give life to a vast, stimulating game, satisfying in its exploration. But no: in the end it is almost always linear roads, small villages with houses all the same, and characters who, except in rare cases (the bachelors are one of these exceptions) appear really excessively similar to each other. A general level of detail at historic lows, and a genuinely cheesy graphic-technical sector certainly does not help. Gameplay Harvest Moon: One World, there is no shortage of shops and secondary activities However, the gaming experience of Harvest Moon: One World proves to be satisfying for fans of the genre; but we would recommend it, in fact, to those who love to repeat the same actions to exhaustion and who don't expect too much from everything that goes beyond the actual gameplay linked to a self-respecting farming simulator. And therefore, exploration and interaction with the gore open world characters aside, here you will obviously have to manage a farm. The plot will immediately show itself full of stamina: tilling, hoeing, sowing, watering and collecting every single square of land will require energy. Once this energy is finished, the poor fellow will no longer be able to continue: it is better to let him rest a bit in his bed at home. The passage of time is naturally marked by months and seasons; breeding, on the other hand, represents the farm's second possibility. All the proceeds from your agricultural activities can be invested to buy new resources and tools, but for the seeds you will need the harvest fairies hidden almost everywhere. Finding them is easy, but predicting the seeds they will give you is impossible.", "date": "2021-03-17", "grade": "6.8"}
