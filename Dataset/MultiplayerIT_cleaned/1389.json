{"name": "Sega Gt Online", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-gt-online.html", "text": "~I was going at 100 per hour...~ The new version of Sega Gt was created to offer Xbox users everything that was already seen in Sega GT 2002 with the addition of the online mode, but not only. Seven new car manufacturers are featured in the game for a total of about 40 more cars. There are many new car models, but also among the classic cars there are some additions that will amaze you above all for the splendid technical realization. Perhaps even if the old fleet had been adapted to the quality standards of the new entries, the graphics sector would have benefited more. Instead, even in the construction of the circuits, the air of renewal is barely perceptible. Added to this are the game menus, where the inexorable inscription ~Sega GT 2002~ stands out to indicate the main mode. Nothing different in terms of modifications to be applied to your cars, you can choose between new parts or go for cheaper (and often unreliable) used parts. The modifications can, as always, be purchased thanks to the money earned in the various single races or in the various championships. Returning for a moment to the ~circuits~ speech, it must be said that Sega GT (since the first edition) alternates an excellent graphic realization of the same with a decidedly questionable design that partially undermines its playability. Sometimes one has the sensation of being faced with a kind of scribble made on a piece of paper, then transformed into a circuit; in short, in general, little inspiration in the design of the slopes, with consequent and inevitable lack of fun in following them. Sega GT VS Gran Turismo The first goal was scored by the Polyphony title with Gran Turismo, the first real driving simulator ever made, Sega's draw took place when he released his Sega GT on the late Dreamcast with a much better look thanks to the 128 of the aforementioned. Further response from Sony with the third chapter of the well-known racing game, which boasted an almost perfect technical sector lacking an online mode, instead present (and here is the definitive draw for now) in this latest incarnation of the Sega simulator. With Sega GT Online we are facing the first driving simulator for consoles that can be played online, a not negligible detail also in light of the fact that the release date of GT4 (Sega GT's potential No. 1 opponent) is still far away. For those who want to play online we are facing a title to be taken seriously, despite some lag problems, for those who expect a worthy sequel to the 2002 version from Sega GT Online, we inform you that we are essentially facing an upgrade or a little more. ~...in the corner to the right, he passes me at 180...!~ Have you bombed your car properly? Are you connected to Xbox Live? Well, now start the engines and get ready to compete against eleven crazy, fanatical and reckless virtua-pilots who will do anything to win what you have up for grabs as a prize. Yes, you got it right, one of the most interesting Sega GT online gimmicks is being able to give away parts of your car or even the car itself, which makes (I assure you) the race even more intense and adrenaline-pumping. In addition to being able to race each with their own car, prepared with relative effort in the offline sessions, it will be possible to participate in races in which all the competitors will compete with the same car. To win it will therefore be necessary to be better than the others and to know well the circuits which in online mode will initially be six. It will obviously then be possible to compare the times on the various circuits with all Xbox Live players. One of the most original and entertaining modes is the one that puts one player behind the wheel of a car and another in the role of navigator. The former barely sees the track due to a curious fog effect, while the latter has to act as a navigator directing him in real time along the entire route. But that's not all, still in online mode, it will in fact be possible to exchange parts of your car with other players and thanks to the use of the voice communicator, you will also be able to discuss how to tackle a bend or how best to prepare your car. Well, to tell the truth, we may even insult ourselves a little if episodes bordering on correctness occur, but that's another story and we trust in your good taste! Comment This new version of Sega GT presents players with about 40 new cars and with a graphic restyling which, if it had lived up to the few new features included in the game, would have elevated the Sega title to decidedly higher quality levels. Instead we are faced with a title almost identical to its predecessorand therefore inevitably aged, but which has a magic word in its title: ~Online~. And it is precisely the fun online mode that gives Sega GT a dusting that makes it very attractive, especially for those who have not played the 2002 version. Sega GT Online is not a masterpiece, it has good, but not exceptional graphics and musical themes decidedly atmospheric, but which in any case almost always take a back seat. Nevertheless, we are faced with a title that still shows a personality, which, although faded, keeps alive an aura of charm around the game that probably makes it the only real rival of Polyphony's Gran Turismo. Pros: Decent graphics Fun online mode Simulation driving style... Cons: ...but not very easy to assimilate Offline is ~just~ an upgrade of SegaGT 2002 Not very fun circuits Some lag problems A bit of history... When the first edition of Sega Gt was released on the Dreamcast, in the year 2000, the community of dreamcasters from all over the world rejoiced: finally a worthy opponent had arrived on the Sega console, for what was until then the driving simulator par excellence. we are obviously talking about Sony's Gran Turismo. Although SegaGt did not reach the heights of realism of the Poliphony masterpiece, it had its own style which combined excellent graphics with very good car physics, which excelled above all in the management of loads entering and exiting corners, but which lacked in sensation of adherence of the car itself with the asphalt, leaving the players with the impression of having to do with an arcade-simulation hybrid, rather than with a real simulation. All in all, however, the game has conquered such a host of admirers that, when the 2002 version (the first on Xbox) was released, users of the green-crossed console thought that the hours for GT3 were numbered. It didn't quite go like this, but Sega Gt conquered another slice of the public, which allowed Sega to evolve its racing game up to the version presented here. Sega GT Online should somehow represent the definitive evolution of the Wow Entertainment driving simulator, which reaches its peak in online mode, at least as regards the expectations of Sega and the players.", "date": "2004-02-16", "grade": null}
