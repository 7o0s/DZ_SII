{"name": "Tomb Raider II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142079-tomb-raider-ii-tombarola-scomoda.html", "text": "It is curious to note how, already in 1997, Tomb Raider II showed all the main signs of modern videogame serialization: increased spectacularity through new and exotic settings, increased game pace with a greater shift towards shootings and, last but not least, a further increase in the feminine characteristics of the already famous protagonist, through a general rounding of the shapes and the presence of new costumes (read: alluring sexualization of a heroine/sex symbol). In any case, like the first chapter, Tomb Raider II is a classic of videogame history, only that in some respects it does not seem to fall into the ~timeless~ category, at least based on what emerges after a few sessions at this reissue for mobile platforms. The historical period in which it came out, on the other hand, was particular: with the overwhelming advance of polygonal graphics, all genres had to be reconverted in the new three-dimensional context and in such a transitional period the mechanics could not yet be too refined , also due to non-optimized control systems. At the time we walked over it quietly, enraptured by the wonderful settings and the excellent level design but the platform structure of Tomb Raider II continued to be rather crude, despite Nintendo with its Super Mario 64 already demonstrating to the world how to make a pass to the third dimension not only painless, but downright enriching for the genre. However, the strength of the series was confirmed elsewhere: in the involvement able to arise with the charm of the settings and in its atmospheres, making us immerse ourselves in the great adventures of the archaeologist grave robber. In short, in a period in which the movement of a character in a three-dimensional environment for an action game was not yet optimized, the controls were easily wooden and unfortunately such a characteristic can only be further aggravated by an adaptation on a touch screen. Tomb Raider II returns to mobile devices: a game too big to fit in your pocket? Lara modernized The adaptation made to the graphics sector in this new edition of Tomb Raider II is pleasant, with reworked textures and a general increase in resolution to better fit Retina screens. The amount of polygons is the same and has not been affected but it must be said that the construction of the levels manages to be pleasant even after almost twenty years. It should also be noted that this Tomb Raider II also includes five additional levels of The Golden Mask expansion to enrich the package. The title obviously plays on the nostalgic effect but even those who have not had the opportunity to fully experience it at the time of its release (or later) can easily get carried away by the adventures of the globetrotting archaeologist Lara Croft, in this chapter engaged in the search for the mythological Dagger of Xian, a Chinese relic capable of turning men into dragons. A search that leads her to travel from China to Venice, going from an oil platform to the submerged wreck of an ancient ship, in a continuous change of scenery that keeps interest high. While on the one hand one cannot avoid noticing how Tomb Raider's mechanics are now a bit dated, based on elements that may now seem obvious such as the exploration of three-dimensional environments, on the other hand the sense of challenge given by the need to finding the way to go and precisely calculating the movements, now accustomed to the constant accompaniment typical of current games, is particularly stimulating. The enormous problem of this Tomb Raider II is the same already reported for the first chapter, i.e. the control system: by replicating all the original inputs on the screen we end up with (take notes) a virtual directional cross, a key to look around, one key to move slowly, one key to jump, one to draw the weapon, one to shoot/interact and one to turn abruptly. A dashboard worthy of a Steel Battalion to control the battleship Croft capable of discouraging even the most eager nostalgics at first glance.", "date": "2014-12-11", "grade": "5.8"}
