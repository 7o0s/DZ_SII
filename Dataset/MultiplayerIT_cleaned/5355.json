Although present only in the capacity of publisher, the stamp of the historic team from across the Channel is also clearly evident in the brand new Overcooked by Ghost Town Games, a culinary-themed party game that makes pure arcade fun its strong point. Usable up to a maximum of four players, the title was launched a few days ago on the digital stores of Microsoft and Sony and on Steam, the platform where we put it to the whip for several hours. Virtual cooking has never been so much fun as in Overcooked, a party game published by Team17 Add a seat at the table The kingdom of onions is threatened by the atavistic hunger for a horrendous meatloaf (called ~La Belva~) and the chefs are unable to satiate its compulsive - and destructive - need for food; for this reason the king sends them back in time with the aim of improving their technique and speed in the kitchen, the only way to avert the apocalypse. This is the grotesque plot behind Overcooked, a title that, despite having a single player campaign, offers maximum fun when played in company, both cooperating and competing. Before diving into the analysis of the work, however, it is necessary to underline what in our opinion is its greatest flaw, namely the absence of online multiplayer. Although it is mainly designed to brighten the evenings with friends and relatives sitting on the same sofa, a party game in 2016 should absolutely not be without online gaming, a feature capable of extending its longevity and involving even those who, for one reason or another the other is often found playing alone. After closing the necessary parenthesis, let's dissect the simple but ingenious mechanics of Overcooked, a work created by just two Cambridge developers. As specified, the chefs, i.e. the characters controlled by the players, are sent back in time (in 1993, to be precise) in order to improve their skills around the world, a journey consisting of about thirty levels absolutely out of head. The main purpose is to serve the dishes requested by customers within a time limit, and the difficulty lies not only in the preparation of the various recipes, but also in the delicious level design of the kitchens, which changes the cards on the table in each new stage. The cooks, at least two even when playing in single player, must follow the instructions on the screen providing for the recovery of the ingredients, the treatment, the cooking and finally the delivery of the courses; everything must be done as quickly as possible, always taking into consideration the timing of the various phases, given that the dishes can burn if left on the fire for too long (even triggering fires to be eliminated with a fire extinguisher) and the dishes must necessarily be washed for the reuse. The collaboration between the players is therefore fundamental and dividing the tasks is the best method to conquer the fateful three stars in each stage, a rather difficult goal to reach especially in some kitchens and playing alone. To get an idea of the crazy - and very funny - levels created by Ghost Town Games, imagine having to prepare hamburgers and pizzas while the hob, sink and other kitchen services constantly change position inside a haunted house, having to keep the mice at bay while they try to steal the ingredients or having to pay attention to the slippery ice sheets of the arctic world, with disastrous falls into the water while trying to serve the famous fish & chips to some Eskimo customers. Add the possibility of getting in the way of other players and the challenges in the competitive arenas and you will obtain an explosive final result, a harbinger of great laughs but also of constant bickering between the improbable chefs, as you can appreciate in the nice game room of Pierpaolo and Vincenzo in the player below. The drive to complete the campaign, as well as the curiosity to discover new worlds, is fueled by the unlocking of chefs and arenas for fun competitive multiplayer. Cooks and flames Overcooked is the classic game for the whole family that however requires a good deal of practice to master. The commands are quite simple and use only a part of the joypad, the use of which is also highly recommendedu PC: in the standard configuration with A you take/move objects and ingredients, with B you perform a sprint and X is assigned to the actions. In the case of playing alone, the LB key is used to switch from one cook to another, but there are also alternative methods for simultaneous control. From a technical point of view we are faced with a product that winks at the most refined mobile titles based on the Unity engine. The graphic options can be counted on the fingers of one hand and beyond the resolution, only the windowed mode can be enabled and a general quality level that goes from ~very low~ to ~dreamy~, the equivalent of Ultra with a greater detail especially as regards the rendering of the shadows. Overall, the look is still pleasant and colorful, enhanced by basic but effective animations. The audio sector is a little more scholastic but the soundtrack is catchy and the sound effects are clean and well integrated into the atmosphere that permeates the entire production.", "date": "2016-08-10", "grade": "8.0"}
