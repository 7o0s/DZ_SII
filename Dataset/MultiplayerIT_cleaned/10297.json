It starts from the bottom, with a modest shop and a few customers looking for the perfect look, but there is no shortage of opportunities to make a career: depending on the degree of satisfaction of the patrons, in fact, it will be possible to gain access to various competitions, which allow to improve their skills and become the most popular hairdressers of the moment ~cut after cut~. The transition to the next level is also sanctioned by a sum of money, which can be spent in the ~shop~ section for the purchase of equipment for hairdressers and beauticians, wigs for special hairstyles or even new premises to carry out one's business! Not only hair, however: the most satisfied customers will also request the make-up service, during which you can indulge yourself in eyeshadows and lipsticks. Great space is also dedicated to the creation of the protagonist, who can be created both using elements already present and with the innovative use of the DSi camera: in this way it is possible to personally experiment with the proposed cuts and perhaps discover the most suitable look! Lots of tools The working life of the Hair Stylist salon is very close to reality. The client arrives and makes her request; at that point it will be up to the player to use the great variety of tools in the right sequence and with the due timing to obtain a splendid result. You will have to juggle brushes, shampoos and conditioners, scissors, straighteners, hair dryers and much more. The palette tool is important, essential for choosing the color and shades of makeup. However, one must not get carried away: there are many customers and having to close the place without having completed one's work with all of them could be an unpleasant starting point for negative publicity. Thanks to a complete game screen, it is thus possible to view the time remaining to the end of working hours, the profit for the day and the number of customers waiting. After having exhausted all the requests or once the work shift has ended, we move on to the final report, characterized by some statistics, but above all by a vote, which is essential for accessing the barrier tests and therefore the competitions. These too take place in plausible ways: there is a registration fee and the exam consists in the execution of a cut established by the commission which will then decree the sufficiency or otherwise of the work, therefore the possibility of climbing one's career. To come prepared for the ~test~ there is also a ~quick test~ mode available, where you can simply practice cutting only (no tricks in this section). ... never without the DSi The absolute strong point of the title, you understand it right away, is the large amount of tools you come across. The Shop element, where you can expand the assortment of your equipment, makes this aspect even more captivating and constitutes a real stimulus to progress in history. The decision to articulate the ~challenge~ through the barriers of the competition proves to be successful, the result of which is not always so obvious, but above all on the degree of customer satisfaction (all of which is quite realistic!). And if the game system, in which the various customers take turns at the work table, seemed somewhat repetitive, it must be admitted that in reality it is lightened by the presence of many different combinations of cut, color and make-up. A further positive element is the photo mode, in which you can create characters in your own image and likeness, and the wireless communication system, with which you can exchange the created characters with friends. A note of demerit goes, however, to two elements; first of all, the fact that the title is exclusively playable with Nintendo DSi. If it is true that the use of the integrated camera is one of the strong points, it is also true that it is not strictly necessary for the purposes of the story (a title could very well have been created even for older consoles and reserved the ~photographic~ part only for DSi owners). Finally, the game settings turn out to be sparse and not very detailed, and risk offering little scope for a more in-depth type of entertainment, as indeed happens in many titles for a more dispassionate user.", "date": "2009-12-21", "grade": null}
