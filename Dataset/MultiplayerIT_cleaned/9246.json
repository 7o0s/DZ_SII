{"name": "Di quali Dimensioni si parla?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/89237-dead-or-alive-dimensions-di-quali-dimensioni-si-parla.html", "text": "It was the now distant 1996 when Team Ninja, an internal team at Tecmo led by the famous (and in some ways infamous) Tomonobu Itagaki, who at the time, however, was still a fairly obscure character, decided to enter one of the currents that at the time most represented the world of video games, that of 3D fighting games. Virtua Fighter and Tekken beat each other out (it is appropriate to say it) for the domination of the sector by respectively representing two opposite philosophies: with the extremely technical Sega title and the much more immediate Namco one, Tecmo decided to place itself halfway with his Dead or Alive, with a very simple and immediate combo system supported by a decidedly more refined and profound one of grips and counterattacks. Three years later the second episode was released, which represented the explosion of the series and its creator, and not only by virtue of the goodness of the title: Dead or Alive 2 also became very popular (above all?) for the presence of very busty anime-style fighters , often portrayed in adventurous shots and whose ~best parts~ were graced by the presence of a physics (in technical jargon we say ~sballonzolamento~) perhaps not very realistic but definitely suggestive. The rest is history, not always edifying (has anyone mentioned Beach Volleyball?) but history nonetheless, to which, it seems, it is time to pay the right tribute with a worthily celebratory episode. Chronicles a little confused The celebratory intentions of the game are expressed in the Chronicles mode, which in six different episodes summarizes and retraces the plot of the four main titles of the series. The fundamental problem of this ~Story~ mode is that very little is understood about history... If already taken individually the various Dead or Alive would hardly win a literary prize, here we go towards the borders of the delusional: missing links, incomprehensible branches, endless dialogues between two characters only to then face a fight between two totally different characters... Even those who know the background of the saga inside out will have difficulty orienting themselves, which is a pity because the world set up by Itagaki, although does not have any ~noble~ pretension, it could give rise to interesting dramatic situations, centered as it is on the theme of families and succession dear to certain Japanese popular culture. Much more interesting is the style used to tell these incomprehensible events; in fact, some FMVs taken from the previous games alternate, canonical sequences made with the game engine and particular videos, always managed by the graphics engine, in which, however, the characters remain still and only a few details move: a choice in line with the 'Japanese atmosphere entirely, as well as able to enhance the 3D effect almost as if we were faced with dioramas. However, the Chronicles mode mainly serves as an introduction to the typical DoA Battle System, it is, among other things, a sort of tutorial that allows us to gain confidence from battle to battle both with the quick, fluid and fast combos, to be carried out with just two buttons for punches and kicks plus the various movements of the directional cross, both with the deep and tactical system of holds, counter-holds and counter-attacks. According to the ~vulgate~, in fact, DoA would be a ~button masher~ in which it is sufficient to press the keys almost at random to win any match, but this is actually true only at the lowest difficulty levels: to win the most difficult you need to master well a system that rewards not passive defensiveness, but an active response to the opponent's moves thanks to the numerous possibilities of holds and counterattacks available, to be carried out with the right timing. All this, combined with easy-to-make combos, results in fluid, fast, spectacular and elegant fights both from a visual and gameplay point of view; moreover this combat system, based on only 4 buttons, adapts very well to the console. In truth, as well as Super Street Fighter IV, DoA would also give the possibility to carry out the moves by simply selecting them on the touch screen, but where the competitor Capcom offered 4 customizable slots for this purpose, here is the entire list of moves: the small size of each slot and the need to switch from the list of combos to that of tricks and so on always via touch makes this option completely unusable. A complete experience Once the intense but short Chronicles have been completed, there is a whole plethora of modes to explore: ranging from the classic Arcade divided into different paths of increasing difficulty, to Survival which opens with a challenge against 10 consecutive wrestlers up to to the great Endurance that ends only when you die definitively, you pass through the classic Training against opponents who will be meekly beaten to allow you to become familiar with the moves, up to the interesting Tag Team, a challenge in pairs against an opponent who already starts from levels high in difficulty; the latter mode is unfortunately afflicted by a somewhat bizarre AI, with the CPU alternating between the two characters with non-standard criteria always clear and is capable of replacing the character you control perhaps while you are about to carry out a devastating combo with the consequent need to reconsider all your plans. The most fanatical can multiply all this by the beauty of 25 characters each with its own style, and even when this is not enough, here comes the multiplayer, which would seem complete in all its parts but deserves some slight criticism. We have both local and Internet multi available, as well as a solution linked to Street and SpotPass. Locally you are necessarily required to have two game cards as well as two consoles, while as far as online is concerned the situation is particular: when it works, it works well, but unfortunately often our games have been affected by a obvious lag that compromised its use. Furthermore, the lack of options (you can only make dry challenges against friends, opponents in the Region of origin or all over the world) and incentives makes the option undesirable, apart from the basic appeal of any online multiplayer. Finally, the StreetPass: based on game statistics, Dead or Alive: Dimensions creates a virtual avatar of its owner to exchange with those you meet on the street, who can then be faced in a challenge, however, very similar to those against the CPU ; it should be noted that Tecmo makes some avatars available through SpotPass every certain amount of time, to overcome the objective difficulty, at least in our part, of meeting other owners of the game with the console in Stand-By mode. The 3D effect Undoubtedly very well implemented, it adds value to the cut scenes and to the already considerable depth of the arenas, as well as to the anatomical details of the young ladies present, always graced by particularly suggestive shots. During the fight, however, activating 3D means going from an almost granite 60 fps to 30, exactly half; although this does not affect the gameplay, the difference can be seen, especially in such a fast and fluid game: most likely you will prefer to deactivate it completely during the actual game. Unmissable, however, in the detailed ~analysis~ of the many 3D models that are given to you as a reward, and in the related photographic mode. Dimensions or measurements? From an aesthetic-technological point of view we are simply facing one of the most beautiful titles to date appeared on 3DS, second, perhaps, only to the direct competitor Capcom and certainly in the Top 5 of the most beautiful things ever seen on a portable console. The characters are very detailed, graced by clean and clear textures and by spectacular, fluid and fast animations, but the arenas also impress thanks to their large size, the details they show off and the fact that they are multilevel: hurling an opponent over the edges of a 'arena in fact, this falls below resulting in a spectacular effect and loss of energy. Furthermore, the fluidity is almost always anchored to 60 fps during combat, unless the 3D effect is activated as illustrated in the appropriate box; from a graphic point of view the only defect that can be pointed out is a certain aliasing, but it is really a small thing: Dimensions, certainly also because on a reduced screen, it's probably the best DoA to see if we exclude the fourth episode on Xbox 360, and it does justice to the potential of the 3DS. The goodness of the graphics can also be appreciated in the different models, there are dozens for each character, which you will unlock during the game and which you will rotate and zoom at will in the photo mode which, among other things, we are sure you will not use to linger on the very generous dcollet or on the poorly covered pelvic areas of the female wrestlers (or on the well-defined muscles of the wrestlers for the female audience). All of this is enhanced by Team Ninja's typical sense of entertainment, which gives its best in epic and intense, although often difficult to understand, cut scenes. Only good can we also speak of the sound, with compositions ranging from traditional Japanese to the wildest electronic and which are always crystal clear, as well as the tons of dialogue present, in English and Japanese, which perhaps is not recited by Oscar but which represents a last, definitive sign of the commitment that Tecmo has made to giveand 3DS owners a complete title from (almost) every point of view.", "date": "2011-06-03", "grade": "8.3"}
