After the missions of Paris, Sapienza, Marrakech and Bangkok, the fifth appointment takes us to the remote countryside of Colorado, the crossroads of a cunning conspiracy hatched against the Agency. The current adventure of Agent 47 is winding down but IO Interactive already seems willing to confirm its strategy by proposing two further episodic seasons in the years to come. Episode 5 is available for download from Tuesday at the usual price of 9.99 euros. The new package was accompanied by the 1.16 update, which brings significant additions especially to the Contracts mode. First of all, it has become easier to identify the assignments starting from the title, the description or the tags. At the same time it is possible to modify the conditions of killing thanks to sixteen types of assassination and seven categories of accidental deaths, so that the target can be eliminated with the strategy already adopted by whoever created the contract. The update also involves the reset of the online leaderboards - both for the main missions and for the Escalation and custom contracts - which occurred after fixing a bug that altered the scores when using the Jaeger 7 Lancer Sniper Rifle weapon. In the Colorado estate, Agent 47 has targeted four targets If you want to get answers you might as well double your post Agent 47 is on the trail of the shadow client, a mysterious individual who with astute orchestrations has managed to make fun of the ICA. In the mission briefing Diana informs us that all the data in the possession of the technicians seem to lead to Olivia Hall, a cyberactivist involved in acts of computer vandalism. The traces left by the girl have allowed the agency to trace a lost farm in Colorado, which has become a training ground for a private army in the pay of a dangerous man. His name is Sean Rose, an Australian eco-terrorist specializing in explosives and credited as the proponent of multiple attacks in different parts of the planet. On the recommendation of the director Erich Soders, the agency was given the task of entering the rural complex and definitively putting Rose and the other key members of the organization out of action. There's something for everyone, from analyst Penelope Graves, formerly of Interpol on terrorism matters, to dangerous and unstable Ezra Berg, former Mossad agent and expert in reagent-based interrogations chemists, not forgetting the paranoid arms dealer Maya Parvati. Before closing communications, Diana observes that Soders' decision seems to be sudden and not very lucid, but in the end the final objective remains clear: to identify at any cost the origin of the shadow client, to whom Rose seems to be doubly linked row. Compared to the previous appointments, the new map is very immediate and, without many preambles, you must immediately get your hands dirty. The area is subjected to very strict surveillance and almost all the individuals on the map are armed soldiers, which makes it significantly more difficult to be able to move without being noticed. Being an agricultural complex in the hands of a handful of criminals, the layout and structure of the area are completely different from the other environments with which it has been possible to interact so far. A preponderant part of the playing surface is located outdoors, among agricultural machinery, apricot trees and military field equipment, while the operational buildings are located in the northern part. On one side the large barn, flanked by a workshop and some warehouses, on the other the manor house, consisting of two floors and the basement. While offering a very special visual and logistical context, the map of this fifth episode soon turns out to be much more linear and easier to memorize than the previous places, especially if we think of the destinations of Sapienza and Marrakech. Playstation 4 trophies The Hitman - Episode 5 Trophies follow the well-established structure in the previous appointments. Others include completing all Opportunities, obtaining the maximum level in the Escalation contract, and reaching Proficiency level 20. Openly hostile territory The Colorado stage is the first to offer us four targets to shoot down in rapid succession, certainly a welcome surprise compared to previous assignments. Given the premises, however, it would have been legitimate to expect a greater number of assassination opportunities to be exploited, at least in line with the alternatives that had been proposed in the Paris map. Unfortunately expectations quickly collided withreality. The variants offered here are only six, which means that for two out of four characters there is only one type of approach. Once we entered the hostile area we were able to take advantage of the first opportunity, discovering that Ezra Berg was busy interrogating a hostage in the basement of the main building. After recovering a militia soldier's uniform, we headed towards the tool shed to take possession of the keys. Having eliminated two obstacles and recovered the elite soldier's uniform, all we had to do was arrive at the interrogation site and alter the dosage of some chemical reagents to make our target suspicious. Returning to the shed, where we had previously loosened a gas cylinder, the torturer blew up without arousing too much suspicion. Our attention then turned to Maya Parvati, busy training a commando for an incursion. Rose was also roaming nearby, so we caught two birds with one stone: after having tampered with the hydraulic device that simulated the impact with the vehicle to be attacked, we waited for the two criminals to be both exposed to danger before sending them to the creator. The masterpiece was completed by sending Penelope Graves to bathe without a life preserver at the bottom of the sewage pit. The opportunities described above were fun to experiment with and substantially different than the other episodes, yet the limited alternatives available keep the overall longevity below the standards set in first dates. As usual, Episode 5 also adds a new contract escalation, titled the misfortune of Mallory. This time it will not be easy to be able to successfully complete the five challenges provided, since each task requires very detailed actions and the danger of making individuals nearby suspicious is always particularly high. The first level involves taking out Mark Hicks with a hay baler or causing an explosion, while the second level's objective is to knock him out by smashing him under a car or starting a fire. However, the beauty comes from the third level onwards, when we will have to face a stalker who hunts down Agent 47. Finally, we remind you that on PlayStation 4 the fifth episode offers a further target of the exclusive ~Sarajevo Six~ missions. This time the target to be eliminated is called Patrick Morgan, a former member of the CICADA paramilitary group.", "date": "2016-09-30", "grade": "7.5"}
