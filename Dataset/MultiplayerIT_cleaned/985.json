{"name": "The Bard's Tale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bards-tale.html", "text": "The game Despite the lack of a localization in Italian, which would have at least ~lightened~ the experience even if only in the subtitles, The Bard's Tale has the ability to immediately project us into a fairytale world, thanks to the soundtrack signed by Tallarico and a narrative voice that in addition of an occasion he is amazed at what the bard combines, giving life to extremely enjoyable interludes. After all, you understand what the game is made of right from the tutorial: ~Press the Triangle button to jump~; and the bard: ~What the hell button are you talking about?~. As mentioned, the game consists of numerous missions, which are accessed through dialogue with non-player characters. Of course there is a clear difference between the ~mandatory~ and ~optional~ missions, as you are practically ~guided~ to the former, while the latter you have to find them. The speeches are handled in a rather original way, without a list of possible answers to give, but following a positive or negative attitude... which will lead to different outcomes, of course. Everything takes place in an overhead view, which you can rotate using the second analog stick. This proves to be fundamental on more than one occasion, especially during fights: the elements of the landscape will prevent you from seeing your enemies well, forcing you to take a few hits before you can react. The fights are always very spectacular. There are plenty of animated sequences. Shall we sing him a song? The combat system The bard has the possibility of carrying a main weapon with him (which is replaced whenever a more powerful one is found), with which to attack or parry, and to use his musical instrument to conjure spells that are gradually more complex and powerful. In particular, he can make use of the help of elementary creatures, to whom simple orders can be given to get the better of numerous enemies or in particular situations. If everything is just mentioned at the beginning, just continue a little in the adventure to realize the depth inherent in this system, which requires a certain strategy and repays the right choices in a whirlwind of light effects. Unfortunately, however, this approach does not lack defects: the particular game view and the cumbersome control of the character expose him too much to enemy attacks, especially when outnumbered. And in that case it also becomes difficult to operate tactics of the ~hit and run~ type, as the opponents will surround us very quickly, preventing us from effective defense. The main character, as in any RPG, can ~grow~ by developing their skills and collecting the many objects that are found along the way. The spells that he can perform, however, are sixteen in all and range between offensive and defensive functions. Collected weapons automatically replace previous ones. The top view works well in open places, less so when there are ~annoying~ objects around. The busty owner of the tavern promises you something in exchange for your services... Technical considerations The characters of ~The Bard's Tale~ are very well drawn, probably made up of a good number of polygons and covered with convincing textures. The bard, in particular, has a very ~communicative~ face, which makes his character clear from the first glance. Likewise, the environments show an excellent level of detail, while not excelling in the variety of elements. Too bad that the graphics engine sometimes loses a few frames along the way, in the most agitated situations. The sound, for its part, is one of the greatest strengths of the game. The music is definitely spot on and contributes substantially to the general atmosphere, while the speech boasts an excellent level of acting, with the characters speaking in archaic English (or with particular accents) and often singing ~tavern~ songs  [C] The appearance of the locations changes radically, in some cases. Elementals are essential in combat. Hitting one of the enemies will make you lose it. vulnerable to each other's attacks... [/C] Comment There is not much to say about The Bard's Tale, except that it is a very well done action-RPG, engaging in terms of narrative and very entertaining in its many humorous nuances. Of course, the particular top view and the control of the character make the fights a bit cumbersome and open to unexpected conclusions, but you can't have everything in life. The game is long, full of missions to tackle and discover, and lets itself be discovered in a pleasant way, without arousing particular emotions. If you like the genre,it is a recommended purchase. Pros: Funny dialogues, sometimes brilliant Detailed graphics Spectacular fights Cons: Completely in English Visuals sometimes awkward Very linear The life of the itinerant singer is hard: you go from village to village to cheer up the life of provocative damsels and to kill wolves and giant mice... inXile Entertainment has decided to tell ~the story of the bard~ with decidedly humorous connotations, giving the protagonist of the game a real bad temper. In fact, the character we take control of never acts out of generosity for its own sake, but always for his own benefit, in a myriad of more or less demanding missions that are accessed through dialogue.", "date": "2005-03-31", "grade": null}
