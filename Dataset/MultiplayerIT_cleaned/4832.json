The transalpine software house has never counted originality among its strengths, but has often managed to compensate for this lack by offering solid and technically impeccable products: a trend that has not actually been reaffirmed by some recent releases, but which nonetheless has distinguished with a certain constancy the path of the French team over the years. Therefore, assuming that this Iron Blade is also a mixture of suggestions taken from successful titles, let's see if at least it manages to show off some significant qualities. Pay to slay For this latest effort, Gameloft has opted for a rather apt setting that blends some elements of medieval history with the typical fantasy imagery, with the player playing the role of a Templar knight engaged in fighting the demonic hordes commanded by the evil Lord Baal: a setting that probably would have deserved better treatment than the trivial narrative that punctuates the adventure, narrated in a boring and superficial way by sequences of dialogue so marginal as to soon induce the user to abuse the skip button. Fortunately, Iron Blade is not a novel but an action with RPG nuances, and in this respect the Gameloft work immediately showcases qualities of undoubted impact. With an extreme but far from wicked move, the title solves the age-old problem of the touch control system by removing the right of movement from the player, who therefore cannot directly decide where to move the protagonist on the screen: it is only allowed to act with a tap on the right side of the screen to attack the selected opponent and do the same on the left half to parry the blows delivered by enemies with the right timing. A mechanism that works particularly well thanks to fights that are heavily inspired by the model cleared by Rocksteady with its Batman series: the protagonist autonomously decides whether to use the bow or the sword depending on the distance with the target, the opponent's aggressions they are highlighted by a special indicator that suggests when to defend yourself and a combo counter measures how many hits you can land without interruption. It goes without saying that such a simplification in the controls implies a thinning of the playful complexity, and in fact the levels of Iron Blade are simply composed of a series of clashes with a certain number of waves of enemies within the same setting, without any exploratory nuances . A situation that - as expected - tends to become repetitive very quickly and which unfortunately the French developers have done nothing but worsen by peppering the product with all those free to play dynamics aimed at making life impossible for those who do not want to spend tens of Euros in microtransactions. There is the energy that is consumed every time you face a stage, the double currency system, the resources to collect to improve your equipment (obtainable in very small quantities through the gameplay but miraculously at hand in the appropriate shop ), the chests to open with the consequent unpacking of prizes and the always nice bottlenecks that prevent you from continuing if you do not meet certain requirements. In short, in Iron Blade the credit card hurts more than the sword, with consequent discouragement for all those who want to enjoy a bit of hack'n'slash action without having to take out a loan. This is even more irritating considering the potential of Gameloft's production, equally divided between successful RPG elements, interesting PvP modes and excellent graphics.", "date": "2017-06-02", "grade": "6.0"}
