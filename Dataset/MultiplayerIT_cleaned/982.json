{"name": "Recensione Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-splinter-cell-chaos-theory.html", "text": "Sam Fisher is meaner, more mature and Ubisoft has done nothing to hide it The game is really well balanced from this point of view, a practical example is found in the equipment supplied, which you can choose before starting the various missions, selecting more or less lethal weapons, or simply taking the recommended ones. One of the most interesting additions in this regard is the knife, which in addition to allowing you to cut some materials, such as plastic sheeting or paper walls, allowing you to discover alternative paths in certain levels, proves to be an extremely lethal offensive weapon. Using it correctly, you can kill any guard with a single attack, remaining in total silence. Sam Fisher is meaner, more mature and Ubisoft has done nothing to hide it Artificial intelligence Not all innovations are to our advantage, in fact the artificial intelligence of the guards has been improved, who prove to be more efficient in returning fire and in patrolling paths, at the same time for Sam it is now more difficult to survive enemy bullets, especially a short distance. The discourse of Artificial Intelligence and its relevance to the real world is however a factor that needs discussion. A faithful reproduction of the behavior of a guard is impossible, because the game in these situations would become practically impossible to overcome. So we must take note of some videogame licenses that can be felt during the game, the guards will be intelligent but stupid at the same time, which is not so dissimilar from the counterparts of the cinematographic world, in the dark no one will be able to notice you, despite the presence of the phosphorescent green visor on the head, and so on. No one tries to pass off Splinter Cel as the perfect stealth game, 100% faithful to reality. It wouldn't be a game, and above all, it wouldn't be a fun and exciting game like this Chaos Theory. James Bond... Who? As in any self-respecting sequel, our secret agent has learned new moves, in SC3 we will have up to four ways to open a door, including stealth and breakthrough opening, particularly useful if combined with the use of the optical cable. since it will end with a martial arts strike to knock out the enemy immediately behind. We will also be able to perform particular actions based on the characteristics of the level, an example made famous by the trailers released in recent months, is that of being able to cling and pull enemies down, while on a ledge. The user interface has been improved, offering a context menu, in situations where you can perform different types of actions. Other changes have been made to weapons and secondary shots. Our gun can now emit an electromagnetic beam, capable of altering electrical devices such as light bulbs, car alarms, cameras or anything else, allowing them to temporarily disable them. Our gun can now emit an electromagnetic beam, capable of altering electrical devices such as light bulbs, car alarms, cameras James Bond... Who? In Splinter Cell CT we will not only have to be careful moving in the shadows, but also take advantage of and manage noise. The relative indicator also becomes very important for referring to external factors, in fact, in levels where there is strong ambient noise, it will be more difficult for the guards to hear us, while in other situations we will have to literally move on tiptoe. To complete the single player section, it takes about 15 hours, depending on the difficulty level selected, and thanks to the possibility of choosing different ways to complete a mission, the level of replay value is much higher than in the previous chapters. In fact, numerous secondary missions have been included, the completion of which leads to a ranking for each level completed. For Sam Fisher lovers, completing the game with all levels 100% complete becomes an obligation and a long lasting pleasure. The Official Strategy Guide of Multiplayer.it! Splinter Cell reaches its third incarnation and is confirmed as one of the best sagas born in this generation of consoles. The non-linear structure, full of missions and submissions lent itself to the creation of an ad hoc guide, to guide you through all the meanders designed by the Canadian Ubisoft team. The Official Strategy Guide is valid for all four versions of the game and can also be purchased at our Shopping. Cooperatives mon amour.. The real novelty of SC CT as regards multiplayer is, as mentioned, the cooperative mode that can be used both through split screen, both via Xbox Live, where, thanks to the microphone, it is exploited to the maximum. This section consists of facing a series of ad hoc levels, together with another Third Echelon operative. The environments in question are much larger than a single player level and offer the possibility of exploiting the moves dedicated to cooperatives. Our agents will have to work in harmony to overcome these challenges, and to do so a co-op button has been added. That is a button which, used in the correct moments and situations, leads to particular moves, such as making a ~ladder~. to reach higher positions, use the companion to hurl yourself against an enemy or overcome certain slopes and so on. Playing in this mode you discover the true philosophy behind Splinter Cell and stealth mode. We will be able to take advantage of a visual coverage through the security cameras, guiding our colleague to systematically avoid the guards, we will be able to carry out cover fire and much more. Another gem is represented by the use of the microphone, which in this mode is ~recognized~ as a real source of noise (the sensitivity level can be changed) and in certain situations it will really be necessary to maintain radio silence to avoid being discovered. The only flaw that can be found is that there aren't many dedicated levels, in practice the 5/6 hours needed to complete them really make you hungry... let's hope for additional downloads from Ubisoft. Next Gen? From a technical point of view, Ubisoft Montreal's work is truly spectacular. After seeing the E3 2004 PC tech demo live, I thought Xbox couldn't handle such detail, never been happier to get it wrong. The graphic rendering is at the highest levels for Xbox titles, dynamic shadow effects and self shadow, normal mapping, improved polygonal modeling, bump and specular mapping everywhere, more accurate particle effects and physics management; new animations included, note the use of the knife for melee or Sam's facial expressions. Optimized graphics cleaning, solid frame rate. Splinter Cell CT is one of the most beautiful titles ever released on Xbox and in this generation of consoles, going to undermine Riddick and the best titles in the line up. Next Gen? Splinter Cell CT is one of the most beautiful titles ever released on Xbox and in this generation of consoles, going to undermine Riddick and the best titles in the line up. The audio management is confirmed at the height of the graphics department, honorable mention to the soundtrack, truly splendid, curated by Amon Tobin. Even the rest is not far behind, thanks to the Italian dubbing and localization, or to the environmental effects with DD 5.1 support, the degree of immersion in the game is really excellent, with the best that can be seen in the external levels. Comment Needless to go around it, this ~Chaos Theory~ is on balance one of the best stealth/action games of this generation and, at the same time, the most convincing and well-crafted chapter in the Sam Fisher saga. More than real defects, the only real negative side is having seen how much the game mechanics have improved compared to the previous chapters and ~wanting~ even more .. More levels, more interactions, more Splinter Cell. Pros: Co-op Superb graphic design Excellent single player Cons: Interaction with objects could be improved Few Co-op missions Even the PC wants its share (edited by Matteo Caccialanza) We should argue that the differences between the Xbox and PC versions of Chaos Theory are purely technical, but in fact, from this point of view, we are dealing with the same game. Of course, the new shaders and the new normal maps look much better in high resolution, perhaps combining them with a good pass of anti-aliasing, but the game is already beautiful to look at on its own, without having to resort to oversized hardware. However, it is a pity to note that, on PC, Chaos Theory suffers like its predecessors from the same lack of attention to the menus, only partially modified, which present obvious graininess on the monitor, like the loading artwork, evidently designed for the least demanding television viewing. Conversely, an element that is not too appreciable in the console version, but which is fully justice in the conversion to the Windows platform, is the detail profuse in redesigning Sam Fisher's face and above all the discreet lip of the characters when they speak in-game. In fact it is an almost invisible feature, in particular due to the almost always dark levels and the camera. This probably explains the lack of synchronism with the Italian dubbing, which seems to have iignored the thing. From a gameplay point of view, the differences are, once again, to be implied in the control system. If Pandora Tomorrow forced the player into an almost fundamentalist stealth action (via the thankfully removed multi-level alarm system), Chaos Theory not only allows a more direct approach to missions, but even allows you to choose an assault equipment before every mission! It goes without saying that the PC version's mouse and keyboard combination tends to promote this style of play, perhaps tipping it slightly in its favour. Chaos Theory not only allows for a more straightforward approach to missions, it even allows you to choose an assault loadout before each mission! That said, the last further discriminant worth mentioning is the obvious lack of co-op in split-screen, while we can't help but applaud the native microphone support, a standard element in console multiplayer, still inexplicably rare on consoles. PC. If Pandora Tomorrow had impressed us almost exclusively for the brilliant multiplayer mode, Chaos Theory presents so many and such improvements to nominate it as of now as one of the most convincing titles of the year, for PC as for consoles. Pandora's Legacy Single player only? Absolutely not, in Pandora Tomorrow, a parallel world dedicated to multiplayer was experienced, in Chaos Theory, Ubisoft pushes this mode to new levels. All the ~Versus~ online modes present in Pandora have been revised and better balanced, such as in the management of objects and gadgets, in the better realization of the levels, which now have a less linear design, presenting more ducts, openings, hiding places and so on , to enhance the qualities of spies. The cooperative mode can be tackled both online and offline thanks to the split screen and the engine proves capable of handling any situation without uncertainty, giving life to a true marvel of playability and technique. The combined moves between two agents allow for spectacular solutions and the online fun soars. the engine proves capable of handling any situation without hesitation, giving life to a true marvel of playability and technique Sam Fisher comic Multiplayer.it has the honor of hosting the comic in 24 pages by Sam Fisher, a great Italian co-production between Ade Capone (prestigious cartoonist author of Lazarus Ledd) and Ubisoft. You can find it at this address. Sam Fisher and the Third Echelon operatives are back on our screens, ready to save the world from a new terrorist threat. Splinter Cell: The Chaos Theory since its presentation, which took place during E3 2004 in Los Angeles, has been labeled as ~The real sequel to Splinter Cell~, made in hand, we can confirm this reputation. Not only from a practical point of view, given that this chapter, unlike Pandora Tomorrow, was developed by the Ubisoft Montreal Team, or the authors of the first Splinter Cell, but also for what the title offers as a gaming experience, ready to redefine once again the standards of the category. I won't dwell even for a second on the plot, you will be able to enjoy the introduction for the various details, I prefer to save characters and immediately describe the news, changes, upgrades present in this Splinter Cell, because they are many, interesting and useful to understand the superb work done by Ubisoft. The novelties that immediately catch the eye are those relating to the single player campaign. The programmers have optimized every single aspect, trying to make the limits imposed during the levels less restrictive, all this starting from the general setting of the missions. Now we will no longer be forced to follow a predefined script to overcome certain obstacles, in fact we will have much more freedom of action, the 10 levels of the main campaign, as well as being much more extensive, allow them to be interpreted according to their own way of playing. Excluding some key passages, it will be possible to finish the mission in different ways, overcoming obstacles with cunning, remaining invisible, or with force, systematically eliminating all our opponents.", "date": "2005-04-01", "grade": null}
