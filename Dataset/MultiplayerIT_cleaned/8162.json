We often asked ourselves this, especially when a highly anticipated title turned out to be a disaster on all fronts. We asked ourselves: ~how did they not notice?~ To correct the shot, perhaps, after realizing how the work was progressing. Questions left unanswered, but which some publishers should think deeply about. On stage at the conference that Sony held at E3 2012, Jack Tretton had officially confirmed the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified for PlayStation Vita, enthusiastically announcing that for the first time players could enjoy a triple A FPS portable. However, when it turned out that it would not have been Treyarch (nor what remains of Infinity Ward) to deal with the creation of the title, but Nihilistic, the team behind the insipid Resistance: Burning Skies, we seriously began to fear that not even Tretton had the right clear what he was talking about. And now the result is here, in our hands (this is true!), testifying how a series of unfortunate choices and the lack, as mentioned, of adequate quality control can transform a potential killer application into a monstrous disappointment sold at full price. Short and not intense Do you think we are exaggerating? So let's try to clarify some simple concepts. The Call of Duty series has never been famous for the length of its single player campaigns, but the PlayStation Vita episode really exaggerates from this point of view, giving us an ~Operations~ mode made up of ten essentially self-contained missions, in which we alternate in the role of Frank Woods and Alex Mason (the protagonists of the first Black Ops), which can be completed in 3-5 minutes each, for a total duration which therefore ranges from half an hour to fifty minutes. If you are not particularly skilled (and the artificial intelligence of some hostages won't help you, eh) you could put in a little more, also because given the length there are no checkpoints and every game over you have to start the stage over, but the substance it's this one. We can say that in practice there is no single player campaign, also because there is no real plot and above all there is no spectacular situations to which the latest episodes developed by Treyarch have accustomed us. You simply proceed to systematically eliminate all the enemies present in a given scenario, save some prisoners and maybe use special equipment at some point. The action is devoid of treble and the aforementioned artificial intelligence, this time on the enemy front, makes some stages pathetic. How else to judge a hostile soldier who takes up position behind a low wall and starts shooting? Shooting into the wall, we mean, waiting for a headshot to put an end to its pathetic retaliation. Alternatives and gunplay The ~Operations~ mode is not the only one available for the single player, but we are close to it. We don't even want to consider the ~Time Challenges~, which are mere exercises with cardboard targets, so let's take a look at the ~Hostiles~ mode, which within five maps asks us to eliminate as many as possible enemies, trying to survive ever more consistent waves using the weapons that we gradually manage to get from the killed opponents. The idea in itself is not bad, but on the one hand the simplistic behavior of the hostile soldiers leads once again to absurd situations like the one described above, on the other hand the anonymous design of the maps does not help and, above all, the gunplay shows all its limits. In fact, if during the ~campaign~ the bad work done by Nihilistic in terms of reticle management is ~masked~ by the presence of the automatic aim (which, moreover, doesn't even work as it should), in the ~Hostiles~ mode this advantage is canceled and you are confronted therefore with problems that are far from negligible, which make it very difficult to correctly frame a target and add to this element the frustration of the ~jumps~ when you are hit. It is clear that a control system like that of PlayStation Vita, with such short analog sticks, had to be tested properly to guarantee the necessary precision even in the absence of aids, but this important tuning work was not done. The result is a flawed combat system, in which it is absurdly difficult to shoot even the enemy we are facing, and which we end up remedying by equipping a shotgun and systematically avoiding aiming. Not quite an idyll. PSVita trophies There are thirty-four Trophies contained in Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified and are by no means impossible to get. In fact, most of them are unlocked by completing the single missions of the ~Operations~ mode, and by killing a certain number of enemies in a certain way, for example four with a single grenade, ten with a knife, ten with a headshot and so on . Multiplayer and technical sector So let's come to the online sector, which has always been the strength of the Call of Duty series and also in this case the best thing that Black Ops Declassified has to offer. There are five modes available: ~Team Deathmatch~, which needs no introduction; ~Kill Confirmed~, in which the team's score increases if we collect the dog tags left by killed enemies; ~Drop Zone~, a territorial mode that asks us to control and defend an area for twenty seconds while waiting for supplies to arrive from the sky; ~Team Tactician~, that is, a cycle of the first three modes; and finally the classic ~All against all~. Participation in online matches is limited to a maximum of eight players and unfortunately the matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired, despite the release of a patch that has fixed various problems (so it was even worse before!). In fact, it happens quite often that not only are not enough people found to fill the eight slots, but that the loading of the session closes abruptly, forcing us to close the application with the PSVita button because at that point you can't even go back to the main menu. When multiplayer works, the experience offered manages to be decent but it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the ~real~ Call of Duty, both for the big aim management problems we've already talked about (no auto aim in online games, obviously), both for the absurd dynamics of respawn (sometimes our character is reborn exactly in front of an enemy with a drawn weapon), and for the aforementioned design of the maps, whose dimensions are appropriate in relation to the number of players present but which in any case, they neither shine nor convince. We didn't notice any lag issues, at least that, but with only eight people online that would have been a joke. In conclusion, a few words on the technical sector, which is also very disappointing. The characteristic of 60 FPS, which has always been one of the cornerstones of the franchise, has not been maintained and Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified therefore runs at half the frames per second, albeit stable. However, it is not a renunciation based on the need to be able to insert more polygons or greater detail, because visually the game has nothing to do with what is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360: the models are simple and quite angular, the surfaces leave a lot to be desired, the enemies are almost all the same and in general it was reasonable to expect much more. We don't know what the marketing strategy behind operations like this is: PlayStation Vita continues to be advertised as a device capable of offering graphics comparable to that of the PS3 in a portable environment, only to be badly denied by products like this. As for the sound, there is a good dubbing in Italian but the rest is bad, especially the sounds of the weapons.", "date": "2012-11-23", "grade": "3.0"}
