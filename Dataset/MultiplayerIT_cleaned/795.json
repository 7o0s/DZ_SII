{"name": "Recensione MotoGP 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-motogp-3.html", "text": "I feel extreme The main portion of the British production is obviously to be found in the Grand Prix mode. As can easily be understood, this option allows you to take part in a career within the 16 official tracks of the 2004 Moto GP world championship, challenging all the riders who took part in the competition on board their perfectly reproduced bikes. The ~outline~ is extremely valid and well-finished, with videos that briefly but effectively introduce each path; winning the races also unlocks other tasty FMVs that summarize the real results of the same competitions, complete with interviews with the various Rossi, Gibernau and company. The highly appreciated possibility of creating your own rider, customizing the liveries of the bike, the suit and the helmet as much as possible, is obviously also present in this third episode. Race after race, points are awarded to be distributed in a handful of characteristics (speed, braking, cornering ability and acceleration), thus allowing you to transform a rookie into a true champion, ready to be taken online to battle other human opponents. In reality however, the differences compared to the second Moto GP are truly imperceptible, both from a graphic point of view and from that of the control system; in fact, it is not rash to say that, with the exception of the update to the 2004 season and little else, the Moto GP mode of the Climax title is almost completely identical to that of its illustrious predecessor. And where then did the English programmers spend their development period? But it's simple: in Extreme mode. Among the indisputable merits that it is right to admit in favor of Xbox, the fact of having been the scene of the best video game reproduction of ~real~ motorcycling should certainly be mentioned. We are obviously referring to the Climax Moto GP series, which after a promising but rather immature debut, managed with the second episode to achieve the objective of combining a first-order technical aspect with a credible implementation of the behavior of a motorcycle on the track. A perfect compromise between simulation, realism and accessibility, without forgetting an excellent Live component, they then did the rest, making Moto GP 2 far better than the very static Namco series of the same name on Ps2. It is with these excellent premises that Moto Gp 3 therefore made its debut on the market, obviously always on Xbox. Skidding Artificial intelligence has not undergone major improvements compared to the second chapter of the series, reaching acceptable levels even with some excess of aggressiveness that is difficult to find in ~real~ professional drivers. In fact, if you can understand a vigorous attack on braking when cornering, the same cannot be said after lying down on the asphalt due to another rider who completely ignored your presence. From a technical point of view, the THQ production differs little from the second episode as regards the Grand Prix mode. This, mind you, is not a defect at all, since we are talking about a product that is one of the graphically best racing games available for the Microsoft console. The level of detail is excellent, as is the visual depth and frame rate, solid at 60fps even with several bikes on screen. The level of detail is excellent, as is the visual depth and frame rate, solid at 60fps even with several bikes on screen. Skidding The use of colors is valuable and realistic, and the reproduction of motorcycles and riders reaches peaks of absolute goodness. But probably the best graphic aspect of Moto Gp 3 lies in the sensation of speed, truly capable of at least partially restoring the emotions you feel by speeding well over 250 kmh aboard one of these splendid bikes. Obviously of different impact, but equally excellent is the result in front of the Extreme mode. In this case, the richness of the settings and trackside elements is also notable, confirming the validity of the graphics engine programmed by Climax. The sound system, on the other hand, is not as good, the victim of a techno/rock soundtrack of really dubious quality; nothing to complain about on the contrary for the effects, with a valid reproduction of the engines and all the rest. Last but not least, the online game mode; as per the tradition of the series, the implementation of online multiplayer is an integral part of every sector of the game. With support for up to 16 players in Grand Prix mode, and 10 in Extreme mode, combined with a practically perfect ranking system, Moto GP 3 represents a true paradise for lovers of challenges on Xbox Live. Comment Moto Gp 3: Ultimate Racing Technology is a title with two faces.Very similar, if not almost identical to the predecessor in the Grand Prix mode starring the Moto GPs; decidedly more arcade and mainstream in the Extreme mode, with fancy bikes on urban circuits. A choice, that of the Climax programmers, probably capable of making its title less sectorial, but which in fact compromises in some way that personality that had decreed its success among two-wheel lovers looking for something more than a simple arcade. Of course it is not (yet) a game for everyone, since the control system is much more realistic than that of the Namco series of the same name on Ps2. But it is a step towards a more conventional route that not everyone may fully appreciate. Having said that, the THQ production remains the best motorcycle title for consoles, without a doubt. Pros Great graphics Challenging and rewarding mechanics Cons More arcadey than the previous ones Not perfect artificial intelligence Bad soundtrack Cross-platform Moto GP: Ultimate Racing Technology 3 is also available in the PC version and, if the substance of the game remains unchanged, the conversion is not the best, so much so that the Xbox version is advisable. The Personal Computer version, in fact, suffers from problems with frame rates and a much less effective set of commands. Considering also the better network game support of the console version, especially if you are an online enthusiast, the choice should be directed without hesitation towards the latter. Arcade power The Extreme mode is a clear sign of the arcade trend that the team of programmers wanted to follow in this Moto Gp 3: Ultimate Racing Technology. Abandoning real riders and motorcycles, this section allows you to compete on urban and city courses set in 16 locations. Divided into 600, 1000 and 1200cc classes, distinguished by difficulty and maximum achievable speed, the Extreme mode represents an excellent complement to the Gran Prix mode, if not even the main choice for those who prefer spectacularity and a pinch of originality rather than serious rigour. of the classic Moto Gp. It is clear that with this novelty, Climax wanted to bring a wider slice of users closer to its product, especially those who had been discouraged by the rather steep learning curve of its predecessors. This is evident not only from the choice of settings, much more intriguing for casual gamers, but also from the rather accommodating and passage-free track design that is really able to put the user with a minimum of familiarity with the pad in difficulty. But Extreme mode is also a means to de-Europeanize (excuse the horrendous neologism) a product based on a sport appreciated and followed by the vast majority of the Old Continent public. This change of course can be read differently according to personal tastes; as far as we're concerned, we honestly preferred the ~seriousness~ of the previous episodes. Undoubtedly more sectoral, less mainstream, but also more intriguing for the people of two-wheel lovers looking for something more than a classic arcade.", "date": "2005-10-21", "grade": null}
