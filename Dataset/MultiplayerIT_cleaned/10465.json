This has nothing to do with the fact that Amanita Designs are Czech, or rather, it has a lot to do with it, but not in terms of geographical distances. The development team does not come from the school of video games, understood as a tradition, but from that of animation. Its members were trained on the benches of the Academy of Art, Architecture and Design in Prague, and their teacher was Jiri Barta. How relevant this is, we will understand shortly. Now let's sit down, and let our eyes enjoy. We quickly discover that there is no prologue; no introduction or comment line introduces us to the game. Machinarium proceeds by omissions, narrative voids that stimulate the imagination, unsettle and leave the player with the task of finding his answers. Only occasionally does a comic speech bubble illustrate a brief memory of the character, usually hilarious, and what we see - because the wonder is in the gaze - helps us understand what's going on. The anti-hero, that dime we found in the first screenshot, thrown in pieces in a landfill, even had a girlfriend (holy woman), who seems to have been kidnapped by a gang of scoundrels with black hats: the Black Cap Brotherhood. It also seems - we see one of them planting a large bomb - that they plan to blow up this world of automatons. You wouldn't give our little robot two euros, but he is the missing cog that will set events in motion until the end. So now silence in the hall, the robots go on stage. A drop of the universe How big is the world of Machinarium? Is it part of the same galaxy as Samorost? To us it looks like a wonderful tiny mechanism, like that of a mechanical wrist watch, which can only be seen with a magnifying glass. On closer inspection, the backdrops are drawn in pencil, static, essential, like the scenography of a theatrical performance. Could it therefore be a puppet show animated by invisible hands, which then in the end someone puts back in the suitcase to leave us in front of a melancholy closed curtain? Maybe, but meanwhile we are part of this picturesque theater. Machinarium is in fact a graphic adventure based on the solution of numerous puzzles, generated by a world of bolts, levers, cranks and strange inventions. The unnamed robot we move knows how to do a few things: walk, pick up objects, and combine them when possible. However, we can, with our invisible hand, stretch or compress it, pulling it or pressing it on the head. Funny as it is, by changing its height it can go where it would have been impossible before. Collected items instead end up in a disappearing inventory; and here comes the beauty. We don't walk around with more than two or three objects at a time, and there aren't many sensitive points in the different screens, but despite this, many puzzles are damn difficult. We often have to rack our brains to understand which path to follow in the solution: understand the problem, imagine a path, implement it. Often it involves guessing the sequence of actions, or solving a mini-game of logic or skill. The variety of puzzles is amazing. They fit so naturally into the story and the game world that they seem like ordinary incidents in the life of a robot. Don't let the difficulty put you off though. Amanita Design have in fact inserted a button that provides a key clue on how to proceed for each puzzle, and a solution book that you can consult for the level you are on. You'll see that every time you'll wonder how you didn't get there on your own. On the other hand, the challenge is an integral part of the fun. Words on the staff The visual and musical impact are predominant, and it could not be otherwise, considering that it was born from the inspiration of professional animators. Every single robot, from the joints to the facial expressions, the environments, the objects of daily life: everything comes alive, dangles, or floats in the air. We see the protagonist struggling in vain on the toilet in a cell, opening his mouth to take out an object, or pushing heavy weights with his little hands. As in an animated film, events follow one another according to a logic that distorts logic. You can lose an arm and fix it, and everything changes just for the taste of the choreography, to please the eyes. We have only one gripe: not being able to make you listen to Tomas Dvorak's music with a player, because his ambient and chill soundtracks are the real emotional narration; Machinarium renounces words to rely on notes. And to think that all this is contained in a simple flash game, almost volatile, it is so light. Like everything, not everyone can like it, but for yougamers in particular, always suffocated by an industry that talks to each other and gives little breathing space, at least a glance can open up unexpected horizons beyond those - often limited - to which we are used to.
