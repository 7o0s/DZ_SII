The game offers a series of challenges, puzzles and fights in 3D environments like the most typical of The Legend of Zelda: the Cyanide product is clearly a clone of the most famous Nintendo series, like many others before it. Too bad that The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks has also been released in these days and that at this point the question to ask becomes only one: why buy Dungeon Raiders? The Lord of Tortelli The Dungeon Raiders plot is clearly a parody of the most common fantasy clichs and at least manages to elicit a few smiles before the repetitive puns and gaffes become invasive. The protagonist is an old wizard named, ahem, Glandalf (we swear!) who finds himself in the painful situation of having to save his friend Butcho, employed in Count Dracula's castle. To embark on this adventure, Glandalf will need the help of the thief Luigi, in turn a prisoner of the pirates: thus begins a double rescue mission told through sparkling and ironic dialogues, in fact it must be said that Dungeon Raiders absolutely does not take itself seriously. serious. The comedy of the game is also accentuated by a caricatured graphic style and by a modest three-dimensional engine that offers distinctly cartoonish settings and characters, animated in a satisfactory even if not exactly brilliant way. The settings are quite varied and colorful but poor in details, the layout of the dungeons is rather trivial and a certain repetitiveness of situations and enemies to fight is soon felt. Even the sound sector leaves us indifferent: cheerful and well-chosen music, but repeated a little too often for the twenty stages that make up the adventure. Without too many pretensions Despite a few too many graphic glitches and a few bugs here and there, all in all Dungeon Raiders lets itself be played and also manages to be fun: the Cyanide product, as already mentioned, is a clear imitation of The Legend of Zelda and as such offers a mixture of puzzles and fights, scattered throughout the various areas that we will have to explore. It must be said that the best part are definitely the rather intelligent puzzles, which often require the use of the skills of the various characters, and undermined only by a lack of clues that lead the player to solve them without frustrating him too much: in short, there is a risk to get stuck in front of a particularly difficult puzzle, especially in the final stages of the adventure, without the game somehow indicating how to solve it. Fights are typically hack'n'slash with Glandalf's variant spells that can generally be produced by drawing symbols with the stylus; certainly a good idea, but a pity that the touch-screen inexplicably struggles to accurately interpret the player's inputs. Making a jump, for example, is a difficult undertaking despite the fact that it is only necessary to double-tap a point on the screen. Considering that the entire adventure is played with the stylus, moments of real frustration will not be rare.", "date": "2009-12-23", "grade": "5.6"}
