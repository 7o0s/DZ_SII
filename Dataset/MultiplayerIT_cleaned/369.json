What you have read is the narrative background (which during the game will manifest itself with very short text messages before the missions) of Wings of Honour: Red Baron, a sequel to that WoH that came out without too much fanfare a couple of years ago. The game takes us back in time to the beginning of the last century and attempts to simulate the deeds of the Red Baron and his opponents but immediately we remain a little perplexed by the presence of rather powerful missiles capable of literally annihilating the base camps or enemy aircraft. Who is writing this review is not a fan of military vehicles but the feeling is to be faced with a rather coarse ~historical fake~. But let's proceed in order... False Historian? After a rather ~skimpy~ presentation, we are faced with the options menu where we will be able to choose whether to play the game in single or multiplayer (with the classic dichotomy of Internet or LAN connection). As for the solo experience, we will therefore have the opportunity to face two campaigns, one with allied vehicles, the other with the Red Baron and his faithful ~servants~ of the air. Once we have chosen which side to take, we will still have the opportunity to choose our favorite among 24 aircraft. And finally it starts to fly... it will be the excessive redundancy of titles similar to WoH of recent times but the sensations that the production of City Interactive has left us have certainly not been the best Mediocrity, mediocrity, mediocrity It may be the excessive redundancy of WoH-like titles of recent times (Battle of Europe, Blazing Angels among others...) but the sensations that City Interactive's production left us were certainly not the best. Beyond the choice between two game modes (arcade and simulation) Wings of Honor fails to involve the virtual pilot sufficiently due to an absolutely mediocre level design (and the two campaigns are almost literally similar), very dull and a sensation of an excessively ~old~ title (we are talking about a setting that could also make some 8-bit productions remember...) in every respect. There isn't a flash, a particular emotion, but not even an exasperated realism (you should have already read the question of the missiles...) or in any case a simulation perspective that gives a particular depth to the interactive experience in the strict sense. Unfortunately WoH is the typical mediocre gaming experience unable to shine in any aspect or element. Things are certainly not better from an audiovisual point of view. Beyond an almost zero background component, structural problems also come from a graphics engine that requires very low hardware requirements (800 MHz for the processor, 256 MB of ram and 64 MB of video memory) but which on a machine with characteristics equal to 4 or more times than those just listed, it presented fluidity problems only because two antialiasing lines and some more graphic effects were added to the basic settings. And after seeing Prey running on the same PC, the feeling is truly disarming given that the quality of the models present and the textures would have disfigured even three or four years ago. The presence of two views (from the cockpit or in the third ~person~) and the dynamic weather are not sufficient to avoid the rejection of this aspect of the title which does not even reach an acceptable quality in the sound field due to very repeated musical compositions and mediocre sound effects. the sensation is truly disarming given that the quality of the models present and of the textures would have disfigured even three or four years ago Final comment It may be that other similar titles have already been released in 2006, but it's really hard to understand the meaning of a production like this Wings of Honour: Red Baron. The City Interactive title fails to offer anything already seen and revised and also under various structural profiles (graphic engine, level design, historical veracity) unfortunately it fails miserably. If the first WoH had been mostly ignored, this sequel will not have a better life and we don't feel like really recommending it to anyone since there are certainly more valid products such as Battle of Europe and Blazing Squadrons on the market. Only if you are a fanatic of the First World War but at the same time have the complacency to accept some elements that smack of false history, could you become passionate about these mediocre Battles of the Red Baron... Pros The Red Baron always has its charm Reduced price Cons Mediocre in every respect Technically it would have been insufficient 3-4 years ago There are much more convincing similar products on the market Cursed Red Baron! We are in 1916, plusDuring the First World War and Manfred von Rochtofen (the damned Red Baron as Snoopy would say in the ~ace of the skies~ version) with his squadron Jasta 11, rages in the skies of Europe devastating the opposing units. However, the allies did not stand by and formed a ~dream team~ of pilots to try to regain supremacy in the area. Will ~The Angels of Annihilation~ be able to stop the threat of the Red Baron?", "date": "2006-09-16", "grade": null}
