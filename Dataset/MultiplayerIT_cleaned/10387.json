The ability to imagine sounds and melodies is inherent in all of us, even if clearly there are those who have more talent than the others or are blessed with an ear capable of distinguishing, cataloging and memorizing sequences of more or less long notes. In the PC environment, there are dozens of professional software that allow you to create a song on multiple tracks, which are composed of samples digital or recorded live. In any case, these are programs that require not only a certain computing power (especially for activating effects, equalization and anything else on each track), but also dedicated hardware (professional sound cards, in this case) which makes it possible the synchronization of sounds with minimal latency. At some point, someone must have wondered if it was possible to create such software for the PSP. Well, we have the answer before our eyes and it was created by Rockstar in collaboration with Timbaland, who for the occasion lent not only his own image (in fact, he is the star DJ of the live sessions) but also a wide range of exclusive samples that will delight any fan of electronic music and beyond. Go with the liquor Beaterator basically offers three levels of experience, which gradually go deeper into the composition of the song. The first level undoubtedly consists of Live Play: we have our dear Timbaland at the console and using the four main PSP buttons we can activate a different sound loop for each of the eight available tracks. The loops available by default already allow us to create something nice, pitch management is automatic and the only thing we have to worry about is placing the sound we like where we think he's better. After spending a few minutes listening to what comes out of a few simple presses, it is natural to go further to see how the loops are managed by the system and assigned to the various keys. To do this we have to go to the Studio Session, which through a simple interface gives us the possibility to determine which loops are played by each of the four console buttons for all eight tracks present. We can use the first track for the drums, as is usually done, and assign different rhythms to the buttons that can best match each part of the song: introduction, verse, engraved, special. For the second track, perhaps we think of the bass accompaniment, leafing through the available loops in search of the sound that best suits our idea of a song. The third can be dedicated to a ~carpet~ of keyboards or electronic sounds that are repeated with the aim of creating a sound atmosphere. And so on, gradually adding guitar or piano loops, sampled vocals and so on. Curiosity Intrigued by the potential of the Rockstar product, we tried to see if Beaterator lends itself to any type of composition or limits our creativity to electronic atmospheres only. Using the Song Editor, therefore, we set about creating an instrumental ~cover~ of the song ~Gravity~, written a few years ago by Chris Martin for Embrace. Here you can listen to the result of a few hours of messing around. Let's also say that the drum and bass sounds work well, and the wind instruments lend themselves discreetly to replace the voice (unfortunately we didn't have a microphone...), while as far as the piano and guitar sounds are concerned, they were not made miracles. Full control When we feel that simple Live Play, with all its possibilities, is no longer enough for us, it's time to switch to the Song Editor. It is an environment characterized by the typical sequencer interface, therefore with an overview of the tracks that flows through a timeline. Beaterator also allows us to use the loops and samples in the archive in this context, but at the same time we can create our own loops from scratch, save them on Memory Stick and place them within the tracks. Each track can contain different loops, meaning that with eight tracks you can really make a complete song of everything. If you have a PSP microphone, you can even create voice loops. However, we must bear in mind that the Rockstar product does not work like a normal multitrack recording program: the philosophy of loops imposes sounds of a maximum duration of eight bars, and this means that any vocal track must be composed piece by piece and then arranged in sequence within a track: a rather cumbersome operation, which requires a lot of time. Speaking of time, don't be surprised hereThe hours will go by without you realizing it: composing music is an art that can give you great satisfaction (you can't help but get excited when you hear your first song) but that requires an equally great passion and commitment. The sounds The editor for creating loops varies according to the case. For the drums we need to select the set of sounds we prefer and then program the hits, so it's not exactly a job for beginners and we need to know, albeit broadly speaking, how this instrument works. The interface is similar to that of the Song Editor, with the difference that each track corresponds to a drum part, in this case two kick hits, two snare hits, three hi-hat hits and so on. Unfortunately, the thoms and plates that are usually used for deadlifts are missing, but in general the final result is of good quality. For adding realism to shots is possible to determine their intensity (velocity), but doing it using the d-pad is a very slow and fiddly procedure. In the lower part of the screen there is a control panel that we can use to move the instruments in the stereo panorama: kick and snare in the center, hi-hat moved 50% to the left or right (depending on your taste). Editing the other loops is a little different, as you're at a keyboard and need to place the individual notes the way you want them. All after choosing the instrument and the type of sound among those available. There really is something for all tastes: acoustic guitars, effected with chorus or distortion, normal basses, with glissed notes or played in slap, different types of piano, horns, synthesizers, percussions and voices. Making a complete list is impossible, but the software allows us to edit and customize every single sound. When the job is done, we can even export the complete song in MIDI or WAV format to Memory Stick, or upload it to the game's official website to join the community put together by Rockstar.", "date": "2009-11-12", "grade": "8.0"}
