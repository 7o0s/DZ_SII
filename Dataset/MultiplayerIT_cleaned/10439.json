Well, if we talk about football games for the dual-screen portable console, there is very little competition by now: FIFA has convinced with solid gameplay, a discreet technical realization and a good online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. but in fact the series stopped at last year. The lack of fierce rivals hurt him. The developers of the Electronic Arts sports division didn't feel the need to improve their product and they have simply made a few changes to the squads and added the editor of plays and formations. For the rest, FIFA 10 for Nintendo DS is identical to last year's episode, both in terms of the technical aspect and the available modes. Even the defects have remained the same and have not been remedied: very often the passes are carried out in an awkward way, with the ball reaching the player in the most unlikely position instead of the closest one (and towards which we directed the d-pad ), and in certain situations the AI leaves something to be desired. This last problem occurs both during the offensive phase, when our teammates don't go deep and are unable to break free, and during the defensive phase. No difference in the goalkeepers' skills, all in all balanced: they easily intercept shots from outside unless they are powerful and very angled, while up close they suffer as it should be. Shot management has also remained unchanged, with a plausible behavior of the ball and a good idea of ~physicality~, especially in front of goal. The tackles are a bit the weak point of the game, because in most cases they are easily won, thus creating sudden numerical superiorities that perhaps lead to the goal more than the classic choral and well-organized action does: too bad. Subway As mentioned at the beginning, the game modes in FIFA 10 are the same as in the 2009 edition: quick game, tournament, manager mode and professional mode. The last two are the more substantial ones and guarantee lasting entertainment. Manager mode is a bit like the ~master league~ of Pro Evolution Soccer, only seen purely from the eyes of the technical commissioner. We can therefore organize the team according to our preferences, change form and training, manage the transfer market based on the available budget and our needs by department. The system that regulates purchases and exchanges is very simple, and it usually suffices to offer a slightly higher figure than that requested by the club to acquire a player immediately, unless the operation costs him a lot in terms of prestige ( for example if we ask the Barcelona top scorer to move to A.C. Culonia). In addition to money, it is possible to offer technical compensation for up to two players. We know the professional mode well by now: after selecting a single player from those available or creating him from scratch, we have to control him on the pitch during matches and try to contribute to the final result as best we can. Interesting on paper, limiting and boring in practice, at least in a portable environment. Then there is the online multiplayer, which works quite well and is in fact the trump card of the EA Sports production, given the shortage of Nintendo DS titles that boast this feature. The technical sector is functional to the action but nothing more, with a not very stable frame rate and polygonal models that are a little too simple and all the same.", "date": "2009-10-26", "grade": "6.8"}
