{"name": "L'immensit del cosmo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131474-the-last-federation-limmensita-del-cosmo.html", "text": "Arcen Games has become known among lovers of virtual strategy thanks to AI War, which has received good reviews from critics and audiences. This is why there was a certain expectation for The Last Federation, a strategic-tactical with a space setting, seasoned with some adventure elements. Does the mixing of genres make you immediately fear the worst? Wait, because there is time for criticism. Arcen Games' goal is to make the player live in a constantly evolving universe where artificial intelligence responds effectively to his interactions, so as to create a multitude of possibilities in the advancement of the main mission. In fact, the feeling of freedom is really strong and, although the introduction to the game is gradual, you soon find yourself having to make choices after choices among a huge squad. Do you think that the artificial intelligence that moves the universe is so developed that it is possible to select a spectator mode to see how it evolves on its own. But let's go in order so as not to get confused. The galaxy in which the game takes place is inhabited by several races (eight in total), each with its own starting planet and space technologies. We will take on the role of the last of the Hydral, an aquatic race whose members have four heads and are aggressive to the point of having committed real genocides. Do you understand why the other races decided to exterminate our people? Our task will be to resurrect the Hydrals by founding a peaceful federation among the other species. Unfortunately, the universe is involved between saying and doing, also because at the beginning we only have a spaceship and a slightly crazy artificial intelligence to guide us. The premises for the success of the mission are certainly not brilliant. A universe of possibilities We will soon understand that in order to succeed in founding the federation, it is first necessary to enter into the dynamics of the different races, studying their behavior and reciprocal interactions. Here The Last Federation begins to get really complex, because the study of data, collected in precious summary screens, becomes a fundamental part of the game. Each race has different values in the economy, people's happiness, development and so on. The protagonist does not have direct control over the choices that are made, which are up to the various governments. His, and consequently ours, is a more subtle role, which requires us to influence choices in such a way as to direct them where we want. To do this we have to decide from time to time how to act. Do we want to make one race build up its defenses in anticipation of war against another? Then we will have to make him feel the danger, perhaps with sabotage actions. Do we want one race to catch up with another in technology? Then we will have to help her in the search. Do we want two races to make an alliance? And then we will have to choose the diplomatic route and work to bring them closer. In short, the game system of The Last Federation is so open that it is difficult to summarize it in a few lines. What we hope is that you understand its purpose, which is to guarantee complete freedom of choice... sometimes too much, given that the impact of our actions is not always very clear. This is one of the flaws that emerges after several hours of play and which tends to disappear (or lessen) with experience, when you acquire such knowledge of the interface and the various options that you can predict in advance what the results will be. certain actions. But let's go back to our galaxy, where you should have understood that Machiavellianism pays, and how. Space is a dangerous place, where only those who can make sensible decisions can survive If you really have to fight... In addition to choosing from the various options available to influence others, sometimes you have to take the field directly. The fights, presented from the beginning of the tutorial, are very simple to manage. The view of the battle is from a bird's eye view, while at each turn you have to choose where to move (with a click of the mouse), which weapon to use and the fire mode. It soon becomes clear that there is no one-size-fits-all choice, as enemies may be more resistant to certain weapons than others. Sometimes you need to use multiple weapons against the same ship, perhaps to break down the shields first and then to hit the hull. If combat missions are the most common, there are some variants that should be mentioned, such as docking missions, which basically require you to resist opponents for several turns before being able to enter a space station. The most important prerequisite to always have the upper hand is to take into consideration only one big factor: the svtechnological development. If you fall behind the others, it's best to avoid any conflict, because you would inevitably be shredded (it's a bit like the story of slingshots versus rifles). Compulsory choices The picture that we have presented to you is very summary compared to the overall offer of The Last Federation. If desired, we can add the good story that forms the background to the action, the sympathy of the pet artificial intelligence, the very high longevity, guaranteed especially if you play at the highest difficulty levels and much more. Too bad only for the visual side, subdued compared to the rest and compared to the standards, although not very high, of the genre. It doesn't matter, because the real defects, which are there, are to be found elsewhere. Throughout the article, we praised the freedom offered by the game system, which we confirm while emphasizing that so much interactivity involves some balancing problems. Basically, after a couple of games you understand how to win without having to rack your brain too much and focus on some actions that are more likely to lead to the desired result. In fact, if you don't take the initiative on your own, all other aspects become optional, i.e. no longer necessary to win. As we love to report from time to time, what good general would sacrifice his troops if he knows he can win with minimal casualties using a certain tactic? Here, a strategist should always make sure to offer choices with an unexpected result, so as not to make all the others useless.", "date": "2014-05-07", "grade": "7.5"}
