Pikmin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186453-hey-pikmin-tutti-gridano-hey-pikmin.html", "text": "Arzest is a Japanese developer who in recent years has begun to make a name for himself by mainly making mobile and Nintendo 3DS titles. The studio - founded by some former members of Artoon, including Naoto Ohshima, the father of Sonic The Hedgehog - has already signed the discreet Yoshi's New Island and is now back on the scene with a spin-off inspired by the popular series of strategic adventures in real time by Shigeru Miyamoto: Pikmin. His portable Pikmin, however, will make fans of the franchise discuss a lot, as it stands out decisively from the mother series, while capturing its atmospheres and peculiar characteristics. After playing and completing it, we are ready to tell you if it is worth holding the Nintendo 3DS to step back into the shoes of the legendary Captain Olimar. Hey, you with the antennas! In an attempt to convert the colorful universe of Pikmin for the big N portable console, Arzest had to come to terms with some technical limitations and so, instead of awkwardly trying to work around them, he simply opted for a brand new formula which, however , risks clashing with what a Pikmin fan would expect from the series. Hey! Pikmin is in fact divided into about forty stages of different lengths: the former are obviously very short and simple, while the advanced levels can be a little longer and more demanding. However, each stage has been designed for portable use and it takes a few minutes to complete them without paying too much attention to shortcuts and secret passages that could lead to new treasures or even extra stages. The purpose, good or bad, is always the same, and this is perhaps one of the weakest points of the game: Captain Olimar crashes on a new planet that... looks exactly like those already explored in the past, complete with Pikmin and other creatures already addressed to populate it. The only way to put the Dolphin II ship back on track and take off is to collect the fuel called luminum, by converting the treasures hidden in the various levels. Obviously we didn't expect who knows what complex narrative, mind you, but the presentation offered by Arzest is also truly essential in the shape of the menus and their contents. In this sense, the logbook is a nice diversion that offers Olimar's amusing annotations, but which actually adds very little to the general offer of Hey! Pikmin. Once a stage has been started, however, the first Pikmin for Nintendo 3DS reveals its unique characteristics, primarily the horizontal and more rarely vertical scrolling structure. Hey! Pikmin is in fact a kind of platformer, even if the slowness of Olimar's movements is such that labeling it that way is perhaps not accurate. Let's say that it's more of a puzzle game with small ~action~ sessions in which you have to fight enemies or move from one platform to another using Olimar's temporary jetpack. The control system is very simple: the analog stick controls Olimar's movements in the four main directions, while all other interactions take place by touching the touch screen with the stylus. The whistle icon allows you to attract the attention of Pikmin hidden nearby, who will start following Olimar: at that point, just touch an interactive element such as an enemy or an obstacle to automatically order our Pikmin to remove, hit or pick it up. Each stage hides up to twenty Pikmin and some obstacles require a certain number of aliens to overcome. The game is structured so that you can practically never go Game Over running out of Pikmin; however, to collect every collectible or unearth every secret you need to learn to micromanage our small army of aliens, being very careful not to lose them along the way and not to feed them by mistake to the enemies who wander around the stages which, however, lack the traditional day/night cycle that characterized the original adventures. The 3D effect In Hey! Pikmin can not set the three-dimensional effect. Is the park open? Unfortunately we could say that Hey! Pikmin is all here: the stages look similar to each other, if it weren't for the appearance of enemies and backgrounds which, however, Arzest has taken care of quite well since they convincingly evoke the atmospheres and design of previous Pikmin. Unfortunately, however, the sense of repetitiveness soon makes itself felt and already from the second ~sector~ the various internships tend to become extremely predictable. The types of pikmin that we will be able to drive are the usual: there are the red ones, the yellow ones, the blue ones, the rocky ones and the winged ones, but once they have touched a target, the aliens tend to decide for themselves how to behave, consequently the difficulty is moreThis is low, and there are no really tough puzzles that require more than a couple of seconds to think about. This also and above all applies to the stages that can only unlock certain amiibo: in total there are about twenty of them and without the figurines in question you can't play at all, a choice that made us turn up our noses a bit especially because they are very short challenges that , from a purely content point of view, they are not worth the purchase of amiibo. The end-of-sector bosses, on the other hand, are much more interesting, which despite being quite simple and intuitive require a minimum of precision and timing if you want to complete the stage with all the pikmin in tow. Once we return to the planet map, in fact, we will be able to access the so-called Pikmin Park, an area divided into small areas where we will be able to send our aliens to scout ahead in search of other treasures to convert into luminum, choosing the pikmin of the right color to be sent to areas with elemental obstacles that only they can overcome. The Pikmin Park is a minigame that makes very little sense and is easily completed long before the main ~campaign~ that we finished in about ten hours. Completionists might appreciate the need to replay some of the stages to collect previously missed treasures, but we suspect that everyone else, as the credits roll, will have little desire to return to the portable planet of Hey! Pikmin.", "date": "2017-07-26", "grade": "7.0"}
