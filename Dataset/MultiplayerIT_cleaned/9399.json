Developed in Kiev for several years and without extraordinary funds, it still offers an extremely complex formula. Furthermore, the graphics engine, although subject to some obvious limitations, manages to manage a large and detailed setting that is undoubtedly capable of immersing us in the peculiar atmosphere of the Deep Shadows title. The story starts from an alien environment filled with extremely dangerous flora and fauna. Thrown to the ground in the middle of a battle, we find ourselves lost with the aim of reaching the allied forces. But the beginning is deceiving. In fact, in the first moments of the game, despite the tooltip informing you of some peculiarities of the title, Precursors seems like a classic sci-fi FPS, perhaps a little too rigid in the controls and differentiated from the competition only by atypical aesthetic choices. But, after the introductory part, the experience reserves us several surprises involving the plot, wide-ranging and rather complex, and which also concern the graphics engine, involving us in the events both as players identified with what is happening and as human beings who observe the screen. A surprise therefore, visible from the images but which we will not reveal in detail obviously, for a game formula that the developers are mastering with ever greater skill. Too bad for the lack of support for the English version and for too many elements ~inspired~ by other videogame franchises and beyond. But when the commitment is still considerable and there are no multimillion-dollar earnings involved, certain things can easily be considered as substantial citations. Modest but capable of surprising As we said, the main structure of Precursors is that of a classic FPS with precise aiming, sprint, weapons of all kinds, grenades and medkits. But the mechanics gradually expand towards an RPG component that includes exploration, crossroads missions and character customization. And, while not surprising, the technical sector is also growing, which in some situations is quite satisfying. Furthermore, the title does not miss espionage, vehicles and also reserves us a large-caliber surprise. Proceeding in the main plot, in fact, it also adds a spatial component to its formula that allows us to directly control a spaceship and travel between planets. In short, the game is ambitious and capable of offering a peculiar gameplay. Even the system related to the health of our character is particular and considers arms and legs independently. Wounded arms cause aim loss, while damage to legs slows movement speed. Once a fight is over, functionality gradually returns to normal, but healing or food is required to fully restore health. And as in any self-respecting sci-fi free roaming, there are also natural or synthetic drugs that can enhance the character but cause addiction and therefore determine physical penalties. With such a complex system it is reasonable to expect talents, in addition to the various basic statistics that grow with the level. And the talents are numerous and cover a wide range of options such as weapon accuracy, damage, sprint duration and sprint recovery. In addition, there are talents that also increase lockpick, stealth, ability to heal and even some dedicated exclusively to the free flight phase in space. Articulated but difficult gameplay The Precursors aiming system isn't particularly nimble. Not even with the 1.1 patch fixes which still improve the experience. But in any case to enjoy the most evident improvements it is necessary to install the latest Russian patch, since the English one is not out yet despite a year having passed. The problem is that installing the Russian patch over the English version is a cumbersome process that can even cause bugs and malfunctions. The title is still playable without updates despite the slowness and despite an excessive search for realism, which also determines a too drastic reduction in aiming speed when switching to precise aiming mode. This detail in itself is certainly valuable but combined with the flaws of the control system and with the difficulty of some situations, especially when the character level is low, it can lead to frustrating situations. In fact, sometimes the difficulty is really high and dying is not difficult even in Normal or Easy mode. Hidden opponents, the agility of enemies and the arrival of some enemy from another hostile faction are elements capable of transforming a seemingly simple situation into a real hell. Of courseMindfully, taken individually, the agility of the enemies is not a penalty and the gameplay becomes more intriguing when they manage to avoid our blows. Furthermore, many animals use their speed to get around the player, while the soldiers often stay at a distance and don't skimp on grenades, which rain down from all sides. Among the other advantages of the title there are more than valid physics, the management of many enemies at the same time, the vegetation that reacts to shocks and the suggestive cycle between day and night seasoned with excellent quality atmospheric effects. And among the elements related to the role-playing game there is no shortage of different factions with which it is possible to go to war or ally; with these which obviously can be hostile to each other or allies. Furthermore, weapons are damaged, it is possible to slide the time to reach a certain time and it is possible to enter almost any house. But Precursors goes further by absorbing other genres and other titles into its structure. The Deep Shadows title also includes alien weapons in full Half Life style, exoskeletons, dungeons and gives us the possibility to modify the vehicles to repair or improve them. All integrated into something like 250 quests ranging from persuasion, to investigation, to the obvious killing of specific enemies or creatures that annoy someone. That said and given the modest nature of the production, there are also aspects that are not taken care of. The most striking concerns the non-player characters who cannot get on our vehicle and, when it happens that we have to lead them through long journeys, it is often necessary to abandon the vehicle and proceed slowly to complete the mission. Furthermore, artificial intelligence, which in certain moments is almost diabolical, sometimes goes dazed, leaving even the most formidable enemies defenseless. Unfortunately, the least convincing element is undoubtedly the spatial component. Aesthetically, the sky and planets are not very credible and the interface is confused and uninspired. Furthermore, the driving system is wooden and despite the possibility of purchasing dedicated skills it does not improve that much during the adventure. But the possibility of trading still makes the travel experience useful and fairly deep as well as allowing us to scrape together some money to buy new equipment for the character. We also have the possibility to install various upgrades and move around the spaceship and this element counterbalances, at least in part, the not exciting gameplay. A melting pot of styles Although technically backward, at least in some respects, the Precursors universe is full of objects and creatures. To hide the defects we take care of film grain, HDR and post processing. The physics are good and involve vehicles, bodies, barrels and some other objects and also the vegetation reacts to hits and the passage of the character. Models of human beings are defined though simple but variety is scarce and city streets often become a melting pot of identical twins. The alien models, on the other hand, are not always convincing but are undoubtedly colorful and original. Vehicles, spaceships and mechs are modeled very well, at least in relation to the possibilities of the engine and the architectures get along even if the design is rather trivial. Excellent visual distance, good environmental effects, excellent dynamic lights. But there are also several low-quality lights such as those used to color alien environments or to illuminate weapon shots. Even the textures are fluctuating and while some environments are extremely vivid and defined, others are washed out, not very credible and practically devoid of furniture. As for the quotes, Precursors takes full advantage of Half Life, which has influenced many other titles, but it also does not disdain numerous film productions such as Star Wars which is also evident in the sound effects of the droids. Just to be clear, the spaceport in which we find ourselves in the early stages of the game, including sound, is incredibly reminiscent of Mos Eisley. Then the music moves slowly towards arabesque tones and some structures appear between the Egyptian and the futuristic, in full Stargate style. In any case, beyond the obvious inspirations, the column is decidedly atmospheric and changes dynamically depending on the place or situation in which the player finds himself. Even the sound effects are qualitatively good even if they are not particularly inspired but the global mix between music and samples is effective and more than worthily supports the ~alien~ atmosphere of the title. Unfortunately there is no voice for the dialogues which in the English version are dubbed only in the cutscenes. This takes away a lot from a productionsurprising in some ways and that's not the only drawback. In fact, many players who have purchased the Anglo-Saxon version from GamersGate, the only portal that sells it, for around 30 euros, are often forced to play without sound effects due to a rather frequent and still unsolved bug. On the test configuration the title generally runs at 60 fps but when the engine drops below a certain threshold the fps are automatically reduced to 30 to avoid slowdowns. In any case, even in the most agitated situations we have never dropped below 30 frames per second but the engine, however ambitious and characterized by a considerable visual distance, certainly cannot be said to be optimized given the overall technical performance.", "date": "2011-03-24", "grade": "7.5"}
