{"name": "Binario morto?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/172926-midnight-star-renegade-binario-morto.html", "text": "Published a year and a half ago on the App Store and Google Play, Midnight Star proposed an unprecedented approach to development on iOS and Android, made up of long-lasting projects (in that case three years) and particular attention to the lore and the component narrative, elements considered essential for the success of an intellectual property with great ambitions. The final result, in reality, did not live up to expectations: while being able to count on a series of interesting ideas, the game remained trapped in its nature as a shooter on rails, lacking variety and involvement. For the sequel, Midnight Star: Renegade, Alex Seropian and his colleagues have therefore decided to change register, firstly by completing the works substantially faster, secondly by giving up the plot and the characterization of the characters in favor of an immediate approach , less demanding, probably more suited to the reality of mobile gaming. The original system has also been modified to emphasize the frenzy of the action: our character does not necessarily remain stationary in front of enemy fire, but can move on the tracks by performing simple swipes on the touch screen. Midnight Star: Renegade is an immediate gestural shooter but with little incisive gameplay Random firefights Several titles have shown how it is possible to create solid and fun first person shooters even on mobile devices, so it is precisely the assumptions of Midnight Star: Renegade that leave us perplexed. The game developers evidently felt the need to create a gestural shooter, and they must be acknowledged for the originality of the result, probably captivating for anyone who is not the least familiar with virtual analog sticks and, therefore, with the shooter genre itself . The numbers of the offer are substantial, with as many as one hundred and fifty missions divided into fifteen zones that must be unlocked progressively, with a view to a single player campaign capable of entertaining for quite some time, devoid of the constraints that often characterize this type of freemium productions and even equipped with a pinch of variety as regards the objectives to be achieved from time to time, whether it is the simple elimination of enemies or a survival sequence. In this regard, the multiplayer component offers resistance challenges in which we will have to face waves of opponents in search of the high score, then comparing ourselves with the results obtained by other users. Added to this is an upgrade system which is also quite generous at first and allows you to modify the equipment so that you always have a good shotgun at hand, with which to hit targets even from long range thanks to the pinch-to- zoom and a convenient attachment system. In terms of technical implementation, we are not far from what we saw in the original Midnight Star, with well-differentiated but very simple and circumscribed scenarios, a successful cartoon style and a roster of enemies clearly inspired by the Halo series, including bosses.", "date": "2016-08-23", "grade": "7.0"}
