For the uninitiated, Bleach is an action manga based on the misadventures of a teenager who, due to a series of circumstances, unwillingly becomes a Japanese god of death (a ~shinigami~ or, as he is defined in English, ~soul reaper~ ). This is a rather original premise for a series that basically stages dozens of characters intent on beating each other up, between training sessions, transformations, conspiracies and all the ambaradan typical of this genre. Given the nature of the series, it was easy to produce several fighting games for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii and Sony PSP, with both excellent and mediocre results. With The 3rd Phantom, however, we are witnessing a different approach whose results, however, are quite unexpected. Almost a ~filler~ It's not the first time actually that an action series has been adapted to a completely different type of video game. The results have often been embarrassing, this is true, so when Bleach fans discovered that the new video game would be a strategic one, there were many perplexities. The 3rd Phantom actually manages to capture the spirit of the series very well, thanks also to the contribution of Kubo himself, who wrote the plot: almost considered as an addition to the original series, The 3rd Phantom retraces the main events by focusing on two unpublished characters who steal the leading role from Ichigo Kurosaki. In fact, the player can choose the star of the game between twins, Fujimaru and Matsuri Kudo, and the choice changes very little the development of the game, which essentially explores the relationships between the various characters and offers a new point of view on some famous moments by amalgamating the sometimes separate story arcs of the comic, animated series, film, and video game. The result is a narrative meatloaf that is sometimes a bit contrasting with the original continuity but which has the undoubted merit of characterizing the characters well, on the other hand the amount of English text between one mission and another will be really heavy for those who have little interest in the series or not familiar with its mythology and terminology. Fans will be delighted, for example, by the interlude sequences, called Free Time, which reward the player with bonuses and items if you choose the right order to interact with the supporting characters... through further, very long text dialogues. Once this obstacle has been overcome, however, we move on to action. Successful experiment The 3rd Phantom will certainly not win the prize for originality but at least he manages to mix the ideas stolen here and there offering a quite enjoyable product. The gameplay is a mix between that of Fire Emblem, Super Robot Taisen and Final Fantasy Tactics: each mission will allow us to field up to a dozen characters, who will be represented as super-deformed sprites on a grid of squares which, like by tradition, it establishes the possibilities of movement. During his turn the player moves the characters and has access to a good amount of options such as absorb surrounding spirit energy to power up units, attack enemies or use various defensive and offensive magic (or Kido). The rules are quite simple, for example only some spells can be used after a movement and each character is characterized by a specialty (Tech, Power or Speed) which makes him more or less effective against his targets. Furthermore, it is possible to be helped by characters on adjacent squares, if the relationships between them favor collaboration. During the twenty-five main chapters and additional optional ones accessible after finishing the adventure, the player will have access to dozens of more or less famous characters from the series, all customizable by spending the points earned in battle to upgrade their characteristics or their peculiar weapons ( the so-called ~zanpakuto~). The actual clash between the units evolves into a different screen, where the sprites involved, mostly taken directly from the previous fighting games, show off their characteristic special attacks through excellent animations, sometimes associated with comic skits and jokes recited in English. In some cases it is even possible to produce combined attacks that will delight the fans, perhaps anxious to field their pair of favorite characters. Of course, the canonical ~Bankai~ of some of the gods of death are inevitable, ranging from an enhancement of the character who uses it to the creation of a nspawn units on the field with the most varied effects. There is therefore no lack of variety, indeed the quantity of characters available, while varying above all in aesthetics, makes each new mission interesting. All this would be magnificent, if it weren't affected by an excessive slowness in the execution of the simplest actions, which above all makes the enemy's shifts really exhausting, and by the impossibility of shortening or deactivating the combat sequences as in the more classic Fire Emblem: it's okay to be a fan, but seeing the same twenty-second attack for the hundredth time is really tiring.", "date": "2010-03-24", "grade": "7.0"}
