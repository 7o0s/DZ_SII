{"name": "Sapere  Potere: I Decenni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sapere-potere-decenni-recensione-party-game-ps4.html", "text": "Last November 2017, Knowledge is Power arrived on PlayStation 4: the White Studios title presented itself in a very immediate and festive way as the heir of dear old Buzz, offering players a series of pressing questions. A carefree but fairly solid quiz game, also strong in an evident charisma and an artistic style so bizarre as to be immediately recognizable. One year later, White Studios tries again, but instead of updating the ~old~ game, it has decided to directly launch the revised, corrected and enhanced version. It's called Knowledge is Power: The Decades, but it's a real separate game: the time has therefore come to discover all the introductions and to take up smartphones again, but stay a few more minutes in the company of our review. Don't worry, we won't ask you too many questions. A party game for the whole family Knowledge is Power: Decades is nothing more than the improved and updated version of the title released last year as the leader of the PlayLink line. It is a series of exclusive titles for PlayStation 4, where the console controllers are carefully set aside and all the players (strictly present locally) take hold of their smartphones, download the appropriate game app, and enter match. The procedure does not require more than a couple of minutes of time, and if the home Wi-Fi network is not sufficient to guarantee stability to the party, PlayStation 4 itself will take care of acting as a hotspot. The strategy at the time was studied in an intelligent way, so much so that PlayLink titles prove to be effective and immediate for all situations, also accessible to as varied an audience as possible. Also thanks to the intuitiveness of the game controls, all guided by the smartphone and in general never more complex than simply pressing certain areas on the screen at the right time. We can't understand why White Studios didn't limit itself to a simple, full-bodied update of the previous Knowledge is Power: in this way the risk is that of creating an unpleasant duplicate on the market, to be repurchased among other things at full price; Knowledge is Power: Decades could easily have been treated as paid additional content for the first game, but it is useless to think about how things could or should have gone. Knowledge is Power: Decades will be sold at a budget price on PlayStation Store, and that's it. The game mechanics are very entertaining, and especially for those who have not played the first chapter they will also prove effective: the production of White Studios bombards those present with a series of themed questions, relating to the 80s, 90s and the first two decades of the new millennium. Obviously, the winner is the one who knows more things than the others, but also the one who with the same knowledge is faster in answering than the competitors present: timing and responsiveness are also very important aspects of Knowledge is Power: The Decades. Not to mention that each game turn is preceded by the selection of a Power to launch against one's opponents: most of the time these are traps such as explosive bombs, chains, dancing letters, and any form of disturbance capable of slowing down the selection of correct answer. Each game of Knowledge is Power: The Decades is marked like the previous title, by a rigorous routine: three questions in a row with a variable theme (the historical period and context change from time to time) interspersed with nice mini-games. The latter may require you to hit the target containing the intruder between three different statements, connect the villain of a film to his corresponding film, and much more: all with a simple tap on the display of your smartphone, or at most with a swipe from side to side of the screen. Questions and mini-games then flow into the final phase of the game, the Pyramid of Power: here, based on the score obtained up to that moment, you will be positioned on a specific step, and new questions (and obstacles) will continue to arrive until one of the players has reached the top. Playstation 4 trophies To unlock all the Trophies of Knowledge is Power: The Decades you will have to not only play many games, but also own at least six smartphones, or at worst borrow them from someone. Several trophies require the simultaneous presence of many players to be unlocked, others instead of realizing very specific game conditions: if you intend to dedicate yourself to obtaining Platinum, we advise you to carefully study the description of the individual trophies and plan yours accordingly. gaming experience. Proceeding at random it could take much more time (and luck) than it should. Gameplay and Content: whatthere again Knowledge is Power: Decades is almost identical to its predecessor, except for some differences in terms of content proposed by the developers of White Studios. First of all the questions: the quizzes offered by the funny characters in the title are all unpublished and nothing has been recycled from the first Knowledge is Power; otherwise releasing a sequel wouldn't have really made sense. The new questions proposed all revolve around the last forty years of pop culture and range from music to cinema, from comics to TV series, also with attention to the specific Italian panorama (for example, some questions about Rai 2 and Rai 3 programs of a certain year). The pronunciation of proper names and of the names of bands and works is not always correct, nor accompanied by a really pleasant dubbing, indeed more often than not the host of the fake TV show even gets to be irritating, but it is a detail that can be omitted . On the other hand, we can overlook the fact that, questions aside, Knowledge is Power: The Decades has practically nothing else to propose again: there are some unpublished Powers with which to hinder the opponents, funny original protagonists to be selected as avatars of game and little else. Even the atmosphere, the Pyramid of Power and in general the scenario and the settings have remained almost untouched after a year: which further validates the idea that a simple additional content would have been extremely sufficient. In general, however, we also felt that the speed of the game experience as a whole was slightly improved. Knowledge is Power: Decades seems more responsive and faster in passing from one question to another, in submitting the interlude minigames and also in the selection of the initial character, the traps to launch and the new theme to face. A not indifferent positive detail, considering that the games of a quiz-based party game must never get boring, instead always proving to be pressing and without downtime. In short, if the game worked and was fun a year ago, how could it be otherwise now that it has also been enriched and enhanced?", "date": "2018-11-13", "grade": "7.0"}
