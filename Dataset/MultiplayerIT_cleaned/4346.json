Welcome back to Burnout Paradise, welcome back to what represents in all respects the most important step in the transformation of arcade racing games from simple containers of races to real open worlds. Because if it is true that many other titles before Paradise had tried to take the plunge, just think of Microsoft's Midtown Madness for example, it is the Criterion title that has remained impressed in the minds of the players so much as to become almost idolized. After more than ten years we return to those same roads to see if the memories, the ones who usually play tricks on us, had pulled yet another trick on us or if instead that damned Burnout Paradise was really the paradise of clandestine racing. Takedown Baby! It's Rock FM. to welcome us irrepressibly as soon as we start this remastered and the sound waves shot from the speakers envelop us cuddling and embracing us with a very sweet melancholy. We can't help but have continuous flashes hearing Guns'n'Roses and our heads begin to move to the frantic pace of Paradise City, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The whole soundtrack is of the highest level, made up of timeless classics that today, like ten years ago, still sound terribly good with those exhilarating and adrenaline-pumping indie rock bits. It doesn't matter if that crow's voice of our least favorite DJ ever returns: it was heavy to hear then and it still is today, pompous and exalted as to redo all the game tutorials for the umpteenth time, with such insistence to explain us almost how to put gas in the tank. He also asks us for the photo to apply on the driving license, a simple photo to have this time if only our account interfaced correctly with Facebook rather than requesting a camera attached to the Playstation 4. We are sorry dear Electronic Arts but we can't remember the last time we we used the Camera with the Move and we don't have the slightest intention of going to remove the dust from the device to have our big face on the document, the PSN avatar will do just fine. The roar of the engine of our Hunter Cavalry, a monster made of rust and scrap metal, makes us think of how the Burnout series was interrupted at a very high level, a factor impossible to conceive in the current market, accustomed as it is to squeeze one's IP down to the last dollar. Yet here everything was still so beautiful, certainly perfectible, but the game ten years later is still tremendously fun. The first corner is enough, the first acceleration with the nitro on the straight as you whiz through the traffic kissing the holy card on the dashboard to understand how much this game is still current. The sense of speed is tremendous and what you have in your hands is only the first car, one of the slowest in the entire catalogue. On a whim we try to go to the workshop and we are literally overwhelmed by bonus cars from all the DLCs released later; some of the other things we had completely lost at the time and it is a pleasure to experience them again. There are toy cars, police cars, motorcycles and even some iconic cars that just can't help but drive the geeks out there crazy. There's the Ghostbuster ambulance, for example, but it's K.I.T.T. to steal our hearts, especially given that she is the only one to make sense of the lack of pilots inside the vehicles: a choice that we have never appreciated since it takes away all the credibility factor from the game. Attention, let's talk about credibility and not about realism since Burnout Paradise is the furthest thing from a serious driving simulator: not only for the machines available, clearly invented from scratch and only inspired by real models, but also for the driving model that allows stunts and curves with the handbrake on under any circumstances. Playstation 4 trophies Being able to get all the trophies on Burnout Paradise Remastered is not that complex. The most difficult are those related to multiplayer and you will need to be lucky enough to find other virtual pilots intent on completing them while for all the remaining online challenges it is simply a matter of playing and having fun without even wasting hundreds of hours on the title. In fact, it will be enough to collect only a part of the collectibles to obtain most of the trophies, often succeeding without even concentrating too much on the enterprise! Full throttle content! After ten years of playing style, glthe crashes, the races from point A to point B on the map, without indications or obligatory roads, are still there to remind us why this game was one of the best arcade games ever seen. Playing Burnout Paradise today means still enjoying an extremely satisfying and fun experience, despite all the technical limitations of the case and the idea that Criterion was then torn to shreds to give life to Ghost Games and to carry on only the brand of Need for Speed a tear still brings it down. It's also a little angry to think that EA could have invested a little more in this remaster and refreshed the textures, fixed the vegetation or even slightly improved the navigation between the various workshops. Fast travel, a dogma now accepted everywhere, is missing here and we don't hide the fact that as fun as it is to run in Paradise City, after more than a hundred hours of play, maybe a little help could also be granted. However, one can turn a blind eye to the graphic layout since even the poor polygonal modeling vanishes when crossing the cities so quickly, this time with the majestic 60 FPS as the master. And then Burnout Paradise is still full of events and things to do: there are normal races, takedown challenges, specific competitions to unlock particular cars, there is multiplayer, there are online rankings and even the crash mode where try to score as many points as possible by bouncing your car in the most immense road mess you will be able to create. And if you are lucky enough to host an Xbox One X or a PlayStation 4 Pro at home, you can even enjoy all this in the majestic 4K which, in short, are not really to be thrown away. As we have let you guess, Burnout Paradise also includes Big Surf Island, Cops And Robbers and Burnout Bikes but in this case, incomprehensibly, you will find all the cars unlocked immediately. The progression and sense of satisfaction of being able to grow with licenses and unlock increasingly stronger cars is a bit lost, especially since you can easily take some of the best cars in the game and break every record with those competition after competition. The problem is certainly stemmed by the very strong elastic effect of the series and also by the self-balancing of the opponents but, in short, a different progress in our garage would certainly have been more desirable.", "date": "2018-03-16", "grade": "8.0"}
