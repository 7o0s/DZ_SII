Between comics, television series, video games and dedicated films, counting the iterations dedicated to the fourth son of the fist is literally lost. Born from a collaboration between the most fortuitous ever seen, the one between the designers Tetsuo Hara and Buronson, Kenshiro maintains his bipolar charm unchanged: charitable towards the oppressed as ruthless with the torturers, on whom he does not hesitate to unleash his martial arts skills . A real avenger, devastating and relentless as opposed to a world gone mad that knows only the language of violence. A model that has actually been much criticized since its inception, but which still manages to exert an irresistible magnetism on kids of all ages for the values it manages to convey, those of the individual who fights adversity relying exclusively on his own strength. Its success can also be attributed to the particular graphic style, which gives an absolutely unique atmosphere, the incredible explosions of violence, the care placed both in the characterization of the characters and the various fighting techniques, and a marked theatricality. We have seen a bit of everything on the video games dedicated to the series (to learn more, take a look at the dedicated box), obviously focusing on the fighting game features, but Koei was the only one to bring the saga to the consoles of this generation, exploiting the typical setting of musou titles to set up highly spectacular fights. For this sequel, the developers wanted to make a gift of encyclopedic value to the fans, recovering the material of the first chapter in order to cover the entire arc of the events narrated in the original work. It is therefore a unique opportunity to retrace the entire anime from the meeting with Lynn to the island of demons. Let's take a look at what awaits us! Two chapters in one For some time now, Koei has found a reliable and cost-effective solution (at least in terms of concept development and design) to create video game adaptations of manga/anime: take the typical structure of the long-running Dynasty Warriors series and apply it to different contexts, in this case by inserting characters and settings from the series in question into this container. In short, the Musou has become a sort of modular structure according to needs and has already led to the videogame transposition of Gundam, One Piece and Ken, in fact. Direct heir to the almost-defunct scrolling fighting game, Musou seems to have remained the best form in which the glorious beat'em up has managed to reproduce itself in 3D, an area evidently harmful to this genre, born and raised with the bitmap. Mixing frantic action with a simple but rigorous progression by levels, the genre in question adapts particularly well to the transposition into video games of those stories that make the constant confrontation with increasingly powerful enemies, the classic leitmotif of many manga and anime productions, their basis storytelling. Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage 2 is based entirely on this proven structure, modulating it on the characteristics of the universe created by Buronson and Hara. The two game modes present do not differ much from each other in terms of gameplay, but offer different solutions from a narrative point of view. The main mode, Legend, follows the entire plot of Hokuto no Ken, set on the journey of the protagonist first towards Raoul and then to Demon Island until the final meeting with Kaio, therefore adding to what was already present in the first chapter the ~second series~, thinking in terms of the anime. The choice to re-propose all the (enhanced) contents of the first chapter entails ambivalent consequences, because if on the one hand it can also be irritating to have to repeat the entire first part already experienced previously, we cannot complain about Koei's zeal, which could have simply propose the second part and that's it, instead offering in this way a very long journey along the complete story. There is talk of more than 15 hours of fistfights and re-propositions of historical moments from ~tears~ or maximum exaltation, a paradise for the great fans of the series and a potential hell for those who are not attached enough to the character to get caught up in the nostalgic spirit. Curiosity There are many titles dedicated to the Kenshiro saga, unfortunately almost all relegated to Japanese territory. Among those who have managed to land among us it is impossible not to mention Sega with Hokuto no Ken for Master System, essentially a clone of Kung Fu Master totally distorted for the western market withol name Black Belt. It went a little better for Hokuto no Ken: Seikimatsu Kiuseishu Densetsu, released on the Mega Drive and renamed in America and Europe as Last Battle. Characterized by excellent graphics and gigantic sprites, the title was a scrolling fighting game with an adventure vein that did justice to the manga, covering the entire second part culminating in the island of demons. The western version was heavily censored and, probably due to rights issues, featured different names and a different color palette. Curiously Kenshiro became ~Aarzak~, General Falco ~Duke~ and so on. Most sensational of all proved to be the removal of the bloody effects caused by the pressure of the tsubo, replaced with the enemies that flew off the screen after taking blows from Ken. To mention in the following years the Punch Mania by Konami, arcade versions complete with cabinets to punch, and Hokuto no Ken by ARC System, a two-dimensional fighting game released first in the Coin-op version and later on Playstation 2. The essence of Musou according to Hokuto In Legend mode we find ourselves going through numerous levels infested with armies of thugs, freeing them area by area and thus advancing up to the encounter with the bosses, who represent the nodal points of the story, as per tradition. The dynamics of the action are repeated in an extremely regular way: exploration, elimination of enemies in the area (a useful counter shows how many are missing to be eliminated each time, and we also speak of hundreds of enemies) with the occasional presence of ~commander ~ more difficult to bring down or diversified types of thugs. Then a new area to explore, another mob arriving and so on. In some cases some variations on the theme are proposed, with the need to protect hostages or companions, or cross areas trying not to be seen or secondary objectives appear which can partially distract from the simple inexorable advance towards further confrontation, but the structure remains fundamentally unchanged throughout the game. It is clear that this is a gameplay that soon slips into monotony, also given the scarce stimuli that derive from an artificial intelligence of the enemies (at least of the myriad of standard soldiers) decidedly deficient, with the armies that are hardly able to put in difficulty, except thanks to the sheer number and mix between melee attackers and ranged marksmen. It is true that if you play Kenshiro it is also right and normal to be able to make fun of entire armies by suffering little more than scratches, but from a gameplay point of view a slightly more stimulating challenge would have been welcome. The levels are connected to each other by interlude sequences built with the game's graphics engine and staged as if they were comics, i.e. with a fixed 3D image and camera movements to frame the various scenes, complete with original dialogues reproduced with great fidelity. The other main game mode, Dream, shares a large part of its structure with Legend, but presents several interesting hints regarding the narrative substrate, allowing you to use characters other than Ken, each characterized by their own fighting style and background specific. In this option it is possible to participate in individual missions detached from each other, which provide insights and unpublished digressions on the main storyline, highlighting backstories, hidden plot connection points or events represented from a point of view different from that of the hero. A real gem for enthusiasts, who will also find unpublished material to devote themselves to. The Dream mode also opens up to numerous game possibilities and hours of gameplay, with the possibility of tackling the many missions available for each character proposed according to the Story, in Free mode or by dedicating yourself to multiplayer, present with the cooperative or competitive option in teams. In both cases, the multiplayer also allows you to collect rare scrolls otherwise impossible to obtain in the single game, in addition obviously to the stimulus given by the competition or collaboration with a human companion or more (in the case of team play). In Dream mode the gameplay remains broadly the same as in the Legend, but the clash with enemies focuses on the control of some bases scattered within a map, a variation on the theme that does not seem to have a logical sense particularly linked to the unfolding of events, but which still provides a slightly different approach. Being Ken The controls feel comfortable and intuitive, making it particularly easy to unleash theand devastating moves by Hokuto (or by the other schools, in the case of the other characters present in Dream mode): two keys referring to rapid or powerful attacks and related combos, one key to dodge blows, one for grappling (scenic, more other) and the ability to grab objects and throw them. Eliminating enemies determines the charge of the Aura bar, the energy that allows you to perform the special techniques of the various schools, which can be selected from a list that grows as the game progresses. It is clear that these are the moments that most tend to exalt the enthusiast: unleashing Hokuto's 100 hits with the simple push of a button is probably an emotion that can be worth buying the game, in the most striking cases of ~ hokutism~. It is therefore not a properly technical fighting game, since it is rather a ~button masher~, as per Musou tradition, but some tactical insights (or at least a slightly more reasoned use of the parry and special attacks) are introduced in the boss fights , which offer a much higher level of challenge than cannon fodder that is thrown in buckets against Ken's (and supporting actors) fists. However, as the game progresses, the average difficulty level increases and a certain caution in managing the character and his statistics becomes indispensable. Yes, because there is an evolution of the main character, which helps to enrich the structure of the game a little, giving further meaning to the progression between the levels and adding a certain strategic depth. Kenshiro advances from level to level by collecting experience points which affect (also based on the player's behavior in battle and the moves used) on five main parameters: life, aura, attack, defense and technique, each characterized by its own level progressive also based on the use made, in combat, of standard and special attacks, parries and combos. These can be further modified with the application of scrolls containing special powers, which can in turn be linked together by placing them close together within the available slots, adding a sort of small mini-game that leads to an interesting customization of the protagonist . Xbox 360 goals The game contains 50 unlockable achievements for the usual total of 1000 points. The achievements are distributed fairly evenly between Legend and Dream modes and are mostly unlockable by continuing normally throughout the game. Some, and they are the most difficult to achieve, instead require the achievement of certain results, to be calculated on the overall duration of the game, but in general the conclusion of both modes (no small effort) allows you to collect most of the points. Shine up The idea of proposing all the material present in the first chapter also derives from Koei's desire to partially remedy the release of a first chapter that is still rather immature from a technical point of view, linked to a graphics engine that did not seem decidedly in step with the times. For Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage 2 the graphics have tried to bring the graphics sector to a higher level, using an updated engine and finally showing off high definition graphics. The result, to tell the truth, is especially noticeable on the main characters, because standard scenarios and enemies still fail to fully convince, the former characterized by anonymity and simplicity at times disconcerting and the latter by an evident repetition of all the same models . On the contrary, the protagonist and the historical characters are modeled in a remarkable way and even in the close-ups they are perfectly recognizable, excellently reproducing the stroke - albeit in 3D - and the style of the original drawings. Even the desire to make everything more fluid has only half succeeded: in moments of relative calm, with few elements on the screen, the game reaches 60 fps but these are fleeting moments, because as soon as the waves of enemies begin to show up the framerate drops significantly, without falling below the guard levels. Particular consideration should be made for the interlude scenes, structured in a rather particular way like 3D ~dynamic comics~, punctuated by shot changes and camera movements but on mostly immobile characters. A solution that probably allows a more faithful reconstruction of the original scenes and that thanks to the good modeling of the characters is pleasant, but one cannot help but wonder if, with more in-depth work, it would not have been possible to propose animated scenes, or maybe original materials of the series, even if in qu", "date": "2013-02-06", "grade": "6.5"}
