In this sense, TT Games has always shown an uncommon delicacy, making itself appreciated for years with the sparkling LEGO parodies of Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter, among others. The fantasy universe of J.R.R. Tolkien seemed to have escaped this fate, but the imminent start of the new film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson and based on The Hobbit was a commercially too tempting opportunity to miss. Understandably, our fears carried some weight. Although always cared for and fun, TT Games' LEGO video games have begun, after so many years, to show their side. The latest proposal, LEGO Batman 2, received a rather cold reception only a few months ago, despite the innovations introduced. In short, there was the risk of finding ourselves faced with a missed opportunity, and a pretty big one too. Fortunately, LEGO The Lord of the Rings turned out to be of a completely different kind. Tolkien according to LEGO Already last summer, LEGO had positively impressed fans of The Lord of the Rings with a series of delightful construction kits inspired by some of the highlights of the trilogy. Found an excellent consensus, a themed video game was the most logical step to take. But how to convey the sense of wonder, adventure and fraternity that characterizes much of Tolken's literature in a LEGO-videogame key? Not to mention Peter Jackson's directorial choices, which have become practically iconic for the collective imagination. Like it or not, it is now almost impossible to imagine Frodo Baggins with an expression different from the perpetually melancholic one of Elijah Wood, so to speak, and therefore here he is again in a minifig version, just as depressed, as are all the other characters, immediately recognizable. The choice of TT Games was quite courageous, but it did not fail to raise some perplexities. For example, it was risky to re-propose the original dialogues of the film, recited by the small minifigs representing Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and associates, during the cutscenes that reproduce the most important moments of the story in a parody key. In the end, the result is absolutely convincing. The contrast between the serious original jokes and what happens on the screen is hilarious. Aragorn preens as Arwen tries to comfort Frodo after the battle at Collevento; a dying Boromir declares his allegiance with a giant banana bursting out of his chest; King Theoden admits defeat at Helm's Deep as his soldiers try to barricade the gate with pianos and pigs. On the other hand, the long cutscenes (however shortened compared to the films, of course) maintain an epic tone far removed from the comical silent sketches of the first LEGO video games. It's a choice that could make franchise veterans turn up their noses, but which we found perfect in the economy of a more imposing project than usual; this is also demonstrated by the care taken in the creation of Middle-earth, the gigantic hub that connects the various stages of the game. We'll talk about it in detail shortly, but here we can only promote the attention paid by the guys at TT Games to what Peter Jackson proposes in his films. Beyond the pitched battles, spectacular without excesses, the glimpses represented are substantially the same as seen in the films, on a smaller scale and dotted here and there with objects and constructions made up of bricks all to be destroyed. As if that weren't enough, the developer has taken the liberty of inserting multiple references to the original novel, characters and settings that had not found a place in the film trilogy, to the delight of purists who will be able to play, for example, even as Tom Bombadil . Wandering through Middle-earth There was talk of a spirit of adventure and exploration: of course, the very long and wonderful journey of the Company would be squeezed into a simple package of consecutive levels. One almost thinks that the controversial ~almost~ free roaming setting adopted for LEGO Batman 2 was nothing more than a great test: LEGO The Lord of the Rings in fact, presents a solid free roaming component that is decidedly more convincing than what was seen in the adventure with DC Comics superheroes. Middle-earth then becomes an immense hub to explore in search of the next destination (appropriately indicated by a customizable path of transparent bricks) while, between one level and another, the misadventures of Aragorn, Frodo and their companions follow one another. The player therefore follows the story through a real itinerary: after the playable prologue, at the time dn the defeat of Sauron, we naturally start from a Hobbiton as always festive, to the enchanting rhythm of Concerning Hobbits, to reach Bree under an incessant rain and start the first, real level of the game, which will see the Hobbits grappling with the Specters of 'Ring. Upon reaching the inn of the Impennato Foal, the group joins Strider and the new destination becomes Collevento, where the second level can be played. We believe we have made the idea and we are sure that fans will be able to predict the next stages for each of the three chapters that make up the saga. However, it must be emphasized that the ~real~ dimensions of Middle-earth are appropriately distorted: you certainly don't need six days' walk to reach Gran Burrone from Collevento, but only a few minutes, and Brea is visible right from the bridges of the elven city. However, the vastness of the explorable area is more than decent, above all because it hides tons of ravines and secret areas to be reached once the story is completed and the Free Play mode has been unlocked which allows you to use any character in the game in each area. In fact, as per tradition, the various characters have special abilities, essential for solving the various puzzles that hinder the path. Gimli, for example, can break through cracked walls, while Sam can light bonfires or grow seedlings. Knowing the abilities of the various characters and how they interact with each other (for example, ~tall people~ can carry and throw shorter characters such as Dwarves and Hobbits) is therefore essential if you want to complete the adventure one hundred percent. Playstation 3 trophies The Trophies department is large: forty Bronze, five Silver, three Gold and the precious Platinum. Needless to say, you will unlock at least twenty of them by completing the story levels, but exploring Middle-earth, solving puzzles and buying each minifig will lead you closer and closer to Platinum. There is so much to do... In this sense, LEGO The Lord of the Rings does not limit itself to offering a vast explorable area and eighteen levels, but also takes on the appearance of a kind of Role Playing Game sui generis with a whole series of extra activities. Hidden almost everywhere in the hub and in the individual levels, which can often be acquired by solving intuitive puzzles, the player can collect Mithril bricks, necessary to forge a whole series of objects, such as weapons or armor, which can be equipped by the various characters. Some of them enhance their abilities, others grant new ones, such as the ability to open otherwise impassable passages. Many of these objects will have to be forged even just to solve the various missions entrusted to us by the inhabitants of Middle-earth, real RPG ~quests~ that require the discovery of the objects or, even earlier, the fundamental recipes to manufacture them. Most of the quests are completely optional, but they offer one more reason to revisit the already explored areas and levels: after all, the aim of the game is always the same, and that is to collect hundreds of thousands of LEGO bricks with which to unlock bonuses and new characters. The game, already long enough in itself, will take at least twice as long to complete at its maximum. There are dozens of minifigs to unlock and then buy, objects hidden in the most unlikely places, even a secret level: in short, there is no shortage of content. The difficulty level is, as always, calibrated downwards: it is literally impossible to die and the various puzzles are as simple as they are ingenious, a balance that makes the experience particularly attractive especially to the little ones, but not only. LEGO The Lord of the Rings is overflowing with affection for Tolkien's work and its cinematic representation, just think that TT Games has not only revived the original dialogues but also the award-winning soundtrack by Howard Shore, on which there is very little to discuss. The fact that the aforementioned dialogues have remained entirely in English also in the Italian version of the game leaves a bitter taste in the mouth: in short, no Gianni Musy or Pino Insegno, but at least the subtitles, in our language, are absolutely faithful to what we have listened, and listened again, for the last ten years.", "date": "2012-12-03", "grade": "8.8"}
