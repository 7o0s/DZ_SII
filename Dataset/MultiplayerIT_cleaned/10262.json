{"name": "Marvel Super Hero Squad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72021-marvel-super-hero-squad-super-eroi-o-super-deformed.html", "text": "Tested version: PSP In the last ten years, the popularity of Marvel (but also DC) superheroes has grown dramatically, mainly thanks to film productions. Videogames, however, have always played their part in the ~customs clearance~ process of the various Spider-man, Iron Man etc., and in fact the more elderly players will certainly remember the old Captain America & The Avengers in the arcade, a scrolling fighting game starring some of the most representative Avengers (Avengers): Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye (Hawkeye) and the Vision. Let's also say that this Marvel Super Hero Squad, which we tested in its PSP version, tries to offer a similar experience, but presents itself as a very simple alternative with no particular depth to products like Marvel: The Great Alliance. The game developed by Blue Tongue for THQ is based on a series of cartoons that reinterpret the Marvel universe from the point of view of the very young, thus showing us ~super deformed~ characters engaged in spectacular missions but always seasoned with a pinch of humor. The numerous animated sequences included in this tie-in take up the style of the television show (indeed, to be honest, they are generally better done...) and offer us some really nice interludes between one stage and another. The problem is that at some point they finish and leave us to the bitter reality of a too ~slippery~, limited and monstrously repetitive gameplay. Violent punches After selecting our team of two characters from those available (Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Falcon, Wolverine and Captain America), we have to face a series of stages in which the opponents to beat change but the substance remains the same: we have to annihilate all enemies and possibly destroy their vehicles as well. The action takes place within a relatively small scenario, devoid of exploratory ambitions, with our heroes who are often forced to move back and forth in search of surviving criminals to exterminate. The clashes act as the central element of the experience, but are based on a combat system that is not very varied and devoid of bite. The characters can attack in two different ways and possibly perform short combos, but the total number of maneuvers available is too low for there to be a minimum of diversification. Furthermore, it is not possible to parry the attacks, which in the more advanced stages forces us to apply the usual ~hit and run~ strategy to score our blows without receiving as many in return. It is possible to jump and some heroes can stay in the air for some time (Iron Man, Thor, Falcon), but this does not translate into new attack possibilities. The representation of powers is not very convincing. Iron Man, for example, can fire his famous repulsor beams, but these are so ineffective that we will soon forget them in favor of simple punches. Some objects and vehicles can be lifted and thrown towards enemies, but this has been handled in a somewhat cumbersome and lacking precision way: often you end up missing the target. The ~hook~ system allows us to hit the closest opponents, but from afar it works poorly. The feeling of the fight in general is poor, the hits scored do not return any sensation of impact and the collision detection appears too ~slippery~. Furthermore, the fact of not being able to manage the view sometimes puts us in uncomfortable situations, perhaps with some enemies out of reach who still manage to cause us damage. The game of couples Our team of superheroes is managed half by the AI, which behaves discreetly, also thanks to a balance of the difficulty that is anything but prohibitive. However, we have the possibility to switch from one character to another at any time, by simply pressing the d-pad. This is an optional operation and far from mandatory. which is perhaps used to try to mix the cards on the table a bit when boredom occurs and we want to experiment with different attacks. The presence of a multiplayer mode would perhaps have offered some element to support the fun, but there is no such thing: the only alternative to the ~story mode~ is a ~clash~ mode in which you can confront a couple of super-villains trying to score as many takedowns as possible within the time limit. Given the aforementioned poor quality of the combat system, it is clear that this mode is immediately frustrating and devoid of any attraction. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, it can be said that he developed themThe Blue Tongue team did a good job but only halfway. The graphics of the game are nice, with discrete polygonal models and fluid animation, while the scenarios are poor and the fixed view certainly doesn't help to increase the sense of freedom as we move inside them. The use of colors is appropriate to the type of product, with an atmosphere that is always quite lively. The sound, unfortunately, relies on very repetitive music and effects that leave the time they find: at a certain point you feel like completely turning down the volume of the PSP.", "date": "2010-01-07", "grade": "5.8"}
