{"name": "Pine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pine-recensione.html", "text": "Pine is a title with excellent premises, but half successful, as we will see in the course of the review. The player takes on the role of Hue, a boy who, following a traumatic event told in the introductory part of the game, will have to leave his people to explore the island of Albamare in search of a place to rebuild his village. Apparently the gameplay seems to be that of a normal open world action RPG with very strong references to the Zelda series, in particular to Breath of the Wild, but also to the latest Fables. It's actually much more multifaceted and original than it seems, even if its peculiarities don't emerge right away. Factions Albamare is a lively place, inhabited by five factions fighting each other for the resources essential for survival. Soon Hue will come into contact with them and will have to begin to understand the simple economic and social mechanisms that regulate them, choosing which side to take (you can ally with up to two of the five factions) and exploiting these alliances to essentially gain influence such as to allow its people to move without any danger. All this translates into an apparently well-conceived mixture of third-person action, resource collection, with related crafting, and management of relations with the factions. The problem is that some aspects of the game are too simplified, so as to be a bit forced in some passages. For example, relationships with factions are only healed in a handful of ways: by trading, donating resources, and doing or not doing certain things (going to sacred areas, killing resource gatherers, and so on). As we mentioned, the factions of Albamare, which are randomly placed on the map at the beginning of each campaign, behave dynamically, so much so that they collide with each other and expand according to the resources they manage to find. Here Hue's role becomes fundamental because his gifts are not simply used to increase the friendship of a faction towards him, but are actively used by it to increase the well-being of its inhabitants and strengthen buildings and equipment. In all of this, the player unfortunately spends a lot of time going around the game world to collect objects and kill some enemies, carrying out the not too interesting main missions. Every once in a while you get some new crafting blueprints, or some new piece of equipment, but that's about it. In short, to get to the best part of the game, the one in which the factions provide us with troops to set out to exterminate our rivals, we need to work hard and carry out a series of fairly repetitive actions, also made so by the narrative side, decidedly subdued and characterized by a overall mediocre writing. The whole thing is not quite as suffocating as it might seem, but it is more superficial than it should be. The excellent initial premises are therefore somewhat nullified by the dynamics of the game, which leave a strong aftertaste of incompleteness in the mouth. Combat and graphics If in general the mechanics of Pine can be considered as successful, but very superficial, it is the combat system that does not work very well. Hue can carry weak and strong attacks with his weapon, he can push opponents away, he can dodge their blows and he can execute lethal combos. If desired, it also has ranged weapons, very useful on some occasions, which add an extra pinch of variety to the clashes. Too bad for the delays in the execution of the orders that are given and for the slipperiness of the shots, which frequently do no damage even if they are clearly on target. It must also be said that the clashes are all very similar from the beginning to the end of the game, probably due to the need of the developers not to complicate life too much with the animations of the different clans (we are always talking about a title made by seven people ). The result, however, does not change: fighting is often a nuisance, so much so that one avoids doing it whenever possible. Even the puzzles have a similar problem: on paper they serve to make the gameplay more varied, but in most cases they are trivial and far from the glories of the aforementioned Zelda series. There are gears to activate, platforms to reach, switches to flip with the thrown weapon, and so on. Something is missing that maybe it's not, but at least it looks memorable. From a technical point of view, however, Pine is well done, especially at a graphic level where in any case the inspiration for the series... let's see... the one with the character often dressed in green, ah yes, Zelda (we never had mentioned, right?), it is obvious. There is some uncertainty in the overall fluency, whichfor a title that is certainly not very heavy it can be a problem, but Albamare, its biomes and the creatures that populate it are overall well done, although not exactly very inspired. The characters are less impactful, all awkward in design and with few variations. In short, if you want to be bad even stylistically, Pine has the same defect as the other elements of the game: it is a well-done homework, but without anything that goes beyond what is due. We are therefore faced with a relaxing experience with some original elements, but which cannot remain in the memory for long and which gives more dead moments than it should. It's not bad, but there's definitely better out there.", "date": "2019-10-23", "grade": "6.0"}
