In fact, we will be able to more easily frame all the enemies present and their relative distance from our protagonist to always keep an eye on even what we do not see directly. Indispensable in the most supervised locations. With a soft step Too difficult and too long to tell you the plot of Alias if you have never seen even one episode on television: in fact, it is impossible to reconstruct the dense web of events that revolve around the agent Sydney Bristow. Not only espionage and recovery of confidential information, but also a complex personal conflict with his father and sentimental events are a worthy side dish to a compelling and well-structured plot. At least as far as the TV episodes go... [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] With a soft step My name is Bond, James Bond... The game itself, despite some pleasant aspects, lacks a very hasty and approximate overall realization. Graphically the world of Alias (at least on Ps2) is very sparse, devoid of details and with a management of lights and shadows undermined by numerous sometimes annoying bugs. Also with regard to the animations of the characters, one can only be disappointed by imperfect collision routines and a very limited interaction with the surrounding environment. Only our beautiful protagonist is saved, extremely similar to Jennifer Garner and equipped with numerous well-crafted combat moves, ranging from normal kicks and punches to jumping on walls in full Matrix-style. Certainly Sydney also suffers from the same problems of interaction with the background, especially when dealing with stairs or other non-level structures, but all in all the overall result is very pleasant. In recreating the atmosphere of the television episodes as much as possible, I a careful work of dubbing and adaptation of the dialogues could be missing, exploiting the voices of the Italian voice actors of the series. Even the cutscenes, made with good attention to detail and a careful use of shots, prove to be one of the most valid aspects of Alias. The same cinematic cut will also be underlined during the game by double-frame shots, in which the movements of Sydney and the moving guards will be shown simultaneously: a good idea, a little less the realization, which sometimes leads to errors of evaluation in carrying out the actions. Being mainly an action game, to complete each level the stealth component will prove indispensable only in the most critical cases, with many enemies nearby. Structured with consecutive objectives to be achieved, Alias leaves no particular freedom to the player, who indeed finds an arrow on the screen for the entire duration of the game to indicate the exact position of the place to visit well in advance. Even the puzzles are very rudimentary, and often they are resolved more with a certain number of random attempts than with logical reasoning. There is also another rather serious technical aspect which should not be underestimated, which certainly denotes a lack of care in the code drafting phase: not only are there numerous uploads and rather slow, but sometimes they have something inexplicable. In fact, that a part of the level is loaded when a checkpoint is reached can also be acceptable, but that even the game accesses the disc simply by pausing and removing it without having changed anything is symptomatic of sometimes approximate programming. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] With a soft step [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment Unfortunately, yet another missed license. Despite the great care taken in the drafting of the plot and in recreating the same atmospheres of the television series on PS2, the technical component leaves much to be desired, in every respect. Rather flat, it does not offer great freedom to the player but rather suggests in no uncertain terms the way forward to achieve a goal. Some puzzles must be solved in a purely random way, without receiving clues from the exploration of the level, and in general the artificial intelligence of the people Sydney interacts with leaves much to be desired. some shots inserted in the key points and the adaptation work, which make this Alias a must try for fans of the television series. A TV series that is highly appreciated all over the world and which is not here eitheri has met with considerable success. It is therefore natural that the adventures of Sydney Bristow were transposed into a video game halfway between action and stealth, a genre that seems to monopolize the releases in shops these days.", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
