Let's focus first on the career mode, the true soul of the game. Once we have selected our favorite skater, among the many available, including Tony and all identical to their real counterparts, we can then start our career. Initially we will only have the first level available, set in a foundry. The gameplay of the game is basically the same as its predecessors, this aspect could be seen as a lack of innovation, but I prefer to refer to the old saying: ~the winning team doesn't change~... and in this specific case it is more appropriate to say ~playability who wins does not change. Anyone who knows the series knows exactly what I'm talking about and will also know that Tony Hawk's game structure has been literally copied from most video games of this genre (see Dave Mirra); the game develops in various settings, all different from each other and located in some cities. So we'll go from a skatepark to an airport, from Los Angeles to Rio, from Tokyo to a cruise ship and so on. In each of these levels we will have to perform certain actions with our skateboard or achieve objectives that will be listed before starting each game. The objectives are the most varied there can be, for example hitting certain objects, collecting the 5 letters that form the word ~s-k-a-t-e~, performing particular tricks in precise points, obtaining a certain score, generating disasters with our actions (even earthquakes!!) or impress passers-by in the rooms. The latter is a real novelty of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. In fact, while in the first 2 episodes there was an enormous sense of loneliness during the games, especially in the levels set in the city, this time the developers have inserted a considerable number of passers-by and cars, where it is allowed of course. The most important thing about this aspect is that the passers-by themselves, for example, interact, even if to a limited extent, with our character by throwing not too nice phrases at us if we whiz very close to him and can make us fall disastrously by hitting them. Cars then dutifully stop if we stand in front of them just like good motorists would. Once we have achieved some objectives, we will be able to increase our character's skills, win new boards and unlock the next tracks. Not all levels are excessively large, but they all still contain a large number of ramps to jump on or bars and walls to grind and above all, each point can be used to perform tricks, so as to guarantee fun and interaction that are difficult to imitate by other video games. It must be said that in any case the difficulty level is quite high, perhaps not initially, but in the last levels the challenge is really strong and this could cause some frustration for those who want to complete the objectives 100%. Even the control system has remained practically unchanged, resulting in being precise and very intuitive and, thanks to an enormous series of combos, it will allow us to perform an infinite number of tricks. I can't help but mention the very pleasant possibility of creating both a skatepark to our liking and a skater as well as being able to change the clothing of all those present. In addition to the career mode, there is the training mode (very useful for those approaching this series for the first time), single race, free race and multiplayer. Then, for those who don't know yet, it must be said that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is the first PlayStation 2 game to offer the possibility of playing online, which makes this game even more interesting in the future. Graphics Thoroughly examined the playability of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and judged with the highest marks, let's now move on to the graphic aspect which is obviously another trump card of the game. The generational change can be seen! And that the power of the PlayStation 2 shouldn't be underestimated is a fact! The graphics are therefore the aspect that more than any other benefits from the work of the guys from Neversoft. As I said previously, the settings are not very vast but still large enough, well detailed and full of objects. The thing that immediately catches the eye is the pulIt starts with the image that perhaps most PS2 games lack. The textures are excellent and have been made with a good choice of colors, even if not all environments reach the same level. In particular, there are 2 settings that exalted me the most: Tokyo, where light effects such as neon are the best example of the capabilities of the Sony console and the bonus level (unlockable once the game is completed) set on a ship from cruise populated practically only by girls in bikinis! The ship of dreams we could say ... but in fact the majesty given by the polygons and the perfect realization of the same is striking. In all settings, the visual range is still very wide. Even the animations of the skaters are excellent thanks to fluid and very realistic movements, well simulated falls with related bloodstains imprinted on the floor. The 60 frames per second are a reality even if every now and then there are very small and completely insignificant slowdowns. Aliasing and flickering are unfamiliar terms in this game. Sound Another fundamental element and always further strength of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is the sound. The soundtrack is a perfect mix of Rock and Hip-hop songs and whether it's good or not is obviously a matter of taste, but I certainly find it very suitable for the game. Some may find it annoying, others (like me) may find it perfect. I remember the presence of songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rollins Band and Motorhead, just to name a few. For the rest, the audio does its honest job with effects all in all similar to the previous chapters such as the noises of cars, various machinery and above all the voices of pedestrians who chatter to each other which is very effective. Conclusions The final verdict for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 can only be largely positive, even if not everyone likes the game. Those who don't like the sports/extreme genre could in fact also find it frustrating, for those who have already tried Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and loved them then this game can be bought with your eyes closed. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 offers incredible longevity with many hours of fun and rest assured that even after a few months, you will suddenly be seized by an irresistible desire to play it again. Neversoft's game is without a doubt one of the best games for PlayStation 2 and well deserves the first place in this genre of games. Maybe it can't be considered a real Killer Application, because it's certainly not for everyone the classic game that pushes you to buy the console, but if you already have a PlayStation 2 and you like the genre, buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3! Conclusions Pros: Immense gameplay Fun like no other Great graphics Screaming soundtrack! Tons of tricks Precise controls Prepared for online play could go on for hours Cons: Tiny slowdowns Nothing else comes to mind Premise The best skateboarding simulator has finally arrived on our continent after having had incredible success in America, or rather in the United States of America, a country that more than any other is passionate about this kind of 'extreme' sport. Just in America, the magazines of the sector and the most important videogame sites, have literally crowned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 as one of the best games ever to appear on consoles and in particular on PS2, often with votes and judgments that many have appeared a bit ' exaggerated, but which have always been motivated and mostly confirmed. As the title points out, this is the third chapter of this series born of the incredible skills and great passion for this sport of the guys from Neversoft Entertainment. The first episode of Tony Hawk dates back to the times of the old PSX, on which the first 2 chapters saw the light. So said, that of Tony Hawk, it might seem like a rather obvious and repetitive series, but fortunately we are faced with something else. Have you ever wondered why episodes of this game have appeared on practically every platform: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PC, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, GameBoyAdvance, GameCube and Xbox? The reason for this huge success is that this series has all the trump cards to satisfy different types of gamers, i.e. playability at the highest levels, detailed graphics, great longevity and above all the enormous fun guaranteed in single and multiplayer modes.", "date": "2001-12-14", "grade": null}
