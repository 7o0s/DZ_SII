{"name": "Beautiful Katamari - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beautiful-katamari-recensione.html", "text": "Katamari was one of the most eclectic and bizarre titles of the past generation. Arrived almost quietly on Playstation 2, it has been able to create, thanks to its particularity in the visual style and playability, a large group of fans and positive criticisms on its marked originality. Katamari is a game of ~rolling~ and collection, which basically means nothing, at least until you grip the pad and start its crazy run. Katamari migrates platform and its sequel arrives right on Sony's ancient adversary machine, Xbox 360. Beautiful Katamari, this is the full title, is actually the third installation of the now popular brand (at least in Japan) created by the visionary Keita Takahashi : the first chapter never reached Europe, while the second, called We Love Katamari, was the popular episode on Playstation 2 a few years ago. Rolling has never been so much fun! The creator, designer and lead-artist of the series, Keita Takahashi, is not responsible for the migration of the title from Sony console to Xbox 360, nor for the development of this brand new chapter, which has instead been entrusted to the same lead game designer of Me & PSP My Katamari, Jun Moriwaki. Despite this, the spirit, the madness and the general feeling of the game have remained almost intact, in all respects. The game is very self-deprecating and demented, and begins with the King of the Cosmos, the Queen and us, the Prince, busy playing a game of tennis during a well-deserved space vacation. Due to a too powerful serve by the King, the game ball creates a kind of black hole that swallows planets, asteroids and stars. After causing the damage, the King of the Cosmos gives us the task of restoring the celestial order by creating new planets to replace those that have now disappeared. To do all this, we are called to descend to earth to collect as much useful material as we can, trying to create increasingly large clusters of objects by rolling them from our Katamari, a funny and helpless space creature, in the same way in which those nice insects on the beach collect their ~balls~ of raw material. The gameplay has remained substantially unchanged compared to the previous chapters: we must try to amass as many objects as possible in the time set by the scheme, rolling them and creating a sort of ~snowball~ that gets bigger and bigger. Once a level is completed, we can then replay it as many times as we want in ~Time Attack~ mode, where we have to try to make the sphere as big as possible. These performances are constantly recorded and sent via Xbox Live to an online leaderboard, updated with the results of our friends and players from all over the world. Once you have obtained a ~perfect score~ of a level, it is finally possible to play it again without time limitations, having fun discovering the most remote corners and browsing among the thousands of objects present. However, Katamari's gameplay changes often: for example, when the King of the Cosmos orders us to create the planet Mercury, we must try to hook and attach as many liquid objects as possible to the rolling cluster. Conversely, to create Mars, we need to generate a sphere that reaches at least 10,000 degrees Celsius by rolling around on hot objects and avoiding cool ones. The arbitrariness of the choice of objects is one of the variables of the game. The sphere is controlled by the simultaneous use of both analog sticks, a bit like moving a tank. The control is simple to learn but sometimes slightly uncomfortable because the rotations are slow, especially when there is little time left and we want to proceed quickly. Controlling the ~ball~ as if we had Metroid's morphosphere at hand, on the contrary, could perhaps make Katamari's control too easy and casual. The developers may have realized the excessive slowness of the commands, and have included an option to instantly rotate the view by pressing both analog keys. The immediate change of direction helps a lot, especially in the more hectic and lively sections. Rolling is easy and beautiful, let's all roll! At the basis of the ~rolling~ of the Katamari there is a simple rule: the smaller we are, the smaller the size of the objects we can hook. As the size of the sphere grows, we can take in bigger and bigger things, right up to people and pets. The variety of what we can take is impressive: there are thousands of objects of any category; food, kitchen, garden, knick-knacks, jewels, coins, toys, knick-knacks and much more. In any case, once you get enough gred everything can be attached to the sphere, even wooden fences, boats, dogs, cats, umbrellas and everything that comes within range at that instant. The actual game can be brought to its natural conclusion in a few hours, but despite this, understanding every secret will take us many, many hours. For example, there are secret objects to find, such as clothes for the Prince to wear; or we can try to complete the collection, as everything we ~catch~ is unlocked in a special list of everything present in the scheme. It is also possible to play cooperatively, offline, with a friend. Basically everyone takes one side of the Katamari and with a little coordination and communication you have to make it move together. Xbox Live is instead used for the versus mode, in which we are called to collect as many objects of a certain category in a head-to-head match with a challenger, in ranked or personalized matches. Katamari's visual style is unique and unmistakable: the scheme is always full of things to take, all colored and stylized, all extremely Japanese and oriental. Living beings are represented as large LEGOs, animated in a deliberately unrealistic and funny way. Depth of field and level sizes are well reproduced with a progressive blurring effect of game backdrops. The graphic sector is pleasant but does not exploit the power of the next-gen Xbox, resulting in a mere high definition update of the Playstation 2 counterpart: the polygons on the screen are many, but the quality of the textures and the modeling of the objects leave something to be desired, showing clearly giant pixels. The audio sector, on the other hand, is one of Katamari's strengths. Despite having recycled almost all the sound effects, the accompanying music is spot on, cheerful and in full style with the spirit of the game. The genre is a sparkling and perfect electronic j-pop, which makes the soundtrack of this title a classic to have at any cost. Comment Beautiful Katamari is essentially a ~more of the same~ that follows the same lines as its previous chapters: the substance remains unchanged once again, adding to its bizarre and particular gameplay the online options through Xbox Live, to play against a friend from a distance , and also the cooperative, already seen in ~We Love Katamari~. Completing the game is a matter of a few hours, but discovering every secret will make you sweat much more time. The graphics are certainly not the best, but the music is absolutely spot on, and with their Japanese-loving originality they fit perfectly into the spirit of the game. Recommended for those who have never tried it and fans of the series. Pros Lots of modes and things to do Audio compartment Online leaderboards Cons Controls sometimes too slow Takes little advantage of the power of the Xbox 360 Too similar to the previous chapters Xbox 360 - Goals The Namco-Bandai game provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock. Beautiful Katamari is generous: online you can get 50 points by playing 50 games, while the others are obtained by creating increasingly larger spheres, collecting objects or performing some particular request such as never stopping, not hooking any object or doing a quick flip. Completing 100% Katamari is challenging and tough, no matter what.", "date": "2008-03-03", "grade": null}
