The fact that Bandai Namco also brought us the tie-in for PlayStation Vita, about a year ago, still took us by surprise, when the work was still a fairly niche in our territory: after all, Hollow Fragment was the revised and corrected version of Infinity Moment, the game released for PSP some time before, and the localization operation left a lot to be desired, especially from the point of view of the dialogues and the English grammar bordering on decency. Here, then, is that developer Aquria has tried to fix the mistakes of the past, making another revision for Sony's new flagship console. We've replayed it, and we'll tell you what's changed since the PlayStation Vita edition we reviewed last year. Re: Hollow Fragment is a welcome overhaul of the good Sword Art Online tie-in We finally understand each other For those unfamiliar with the assumptions of Hollow Fragment, and who have followed the two seasons of the animated series, it is worth briefly summarizing the original incipit of this story: the game, in fact, begins at... the end of the first narrative arc of Sword Art Online, but the outcome of the battle with the bad guy on duty differs from what was seen on TV (or on the net, crafty ones). Instead of breaking free from the virtual prison that the hugely popular MMORPG titled Sword Art Online has become, the protagonist Kirito and the others get stuck in the world of Aincrad, forced to climb the floors of the dungeon that could offer them an escape to reality. The main storyline intertwines with the subplot conceived specifically for the PlayStation Vita version, which players can undertake or leave pending at any time, and which represents an absolutely new excursus even in relation to the animated series, revealing a completely new area (the Hollow Area) and a character who has never been seen in the anime, and who will join the rich cast of supporting characters, which also includes a couple of heroines from the narrative arcs following the first. In short, for a true fan of Sword Art Online, it is a very interesting and enjoyable spin-off, based a lot on the fanservice since Kirito will be able to hang out with the numerous players - starting with the beautiful and very much in love Asuna - and strike up relationships with them more or less deep friendships that will unlock more costumes and skills. The PlayStation 4 version, fortunately, is graced with a completely new English adaptation, which replaces the very bad one seen on PlayStation Vita. The dialogues are now smoother - but always too long, mind you - while the descriptions of skills and mechanics are finally understandable, where in the past some had been misleading if not completely wrong. The script is still what it is, mind you, and some conversations remain knee-deep, but fans of the animated series will find practically all the characters with their own peculiar idiosyncrasies, while newbies will finally be able to understand some gags that on PlayStation Vita it had made the slightest sense. Playstation 4 trophies Even the PlayStation 4 version offers fifty-five trophies that are far from easy to unlock. Some risk losing by mistake, forcing us to start the game over again, while others require perseverance and commitment both by playing alone and in company. It's not Type-0 Many have compared Re: Hollow Fragment to Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. After all, the two games have a very similar past: both were born on PSP and then ported to PlayStation 4. The Sword Art Online tie-in also passed to PlayStation Vita, as we know, thus enjoying two revisions . The reality, however, is that the situation is very different. The ~remaster~ of Final Fantasy Type-0 is practically a remake, given that Square Enix has almost completely updated the technical sector, updating textures, animations and polygonal models. Bandai Namco, with Re: Hollow Fragment, has done practically nothing of the kind, limiting itself to retouching the polygonal models and little else. The locations, especially those belonging to the original PSP chapter, are repetitive and dotted with very low resolution textures that clash like an eyesore. The situation improves in the Hollow Area, but the game always remains a handheld title summarily converted for a new generation console, which only partially justifies thebudget price of the package. From this point of view, the frame rate drops that occur above all in Arc Sofia, the city/hub in which to shop and socialize with non-player characters, appear incomprehensible, and which on PlayStation Vita we don't remember ever having suffered so much frequency. Rarely occur in combat, also because the clashes in Sword Art Online are exciting, but certainly not frenetic, also due to the general slowness in the animations, something that could have been tweaked during the revision. The combat system is very reminiscent of that of World of Warcraft-style MMORPGs, but invites the player to dribble the enemy's attention between himself and his group mate, so as to balance the bonuses and disadvantages during the fight. Beyond the disappointing technical conversion, Bandai Namco has however added some extra features and content for those who decide to immerse themselves in this experience for the second time, mostly in the form of unpublished bosses and special objects. The most interesting news, however, are the ability to further customize Kirito's avatar, also choosing his gender, and the multiplayer mode. In the first case, the addition is essentially useless, given that the polygonal model of the protagonist returns to being the default one in every cinematic; in the second case, however, the new cooperative mode replaces the original ad-hoc one, allowing players to form a group with their friends and to complete various special missions in the game's dungeons.", "date": "2015-08-17", "grade": "8.0"}
