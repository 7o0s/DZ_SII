In the specific case, however, The Room, this is the title of the game, has evidently been able to trigger word of mouth among users capable of placing the product among the highest positions in the rankings, all this despite the ~premium~ price and the certainly not casual gameplay. In the wake of these results, the release of a sequel could only be more than likely, which promptly reached the window of Apple's online store right at the gates of the Christmas season. Heachache The Room Two is therefore a product which, precisely on the basis of the great impetus offered by its predecessor, has certainly not struggled to show off and find space among the magnum sea of applications for the iPad; an enviable situation therefore, which however simply constitutes a starting point to be supported with the essential quality necessary not to disappoint the user. Certainly Fireproof Games wanted to avoid distorting the original formula, and in fact The Room Two is an instantly recognizable title for anyone who has had anything to do with the first episode: in short, it is a game based on puzzles and enigmas that take place inside well-defined rooms, in which mysterious boxes or objects of various types represent the elements with which to interact in many different ways. The peculiarity of the gameplay created by the British team lies precisely in the ability to offer well-studied, intriguing and interesting puzzles, linked together with complexity, intelligence and astonishing coherence. And all this through the almost perfect exploitation of the iPad touch interface: commonly used gestures in The Room Two become the tool through which to interact in a natural and immediate way with everything the game has to offer. Opening drawers, pressing switches, turning knobs, examining and using objects: everything is initiated through the optimal use of the touch screen, which finds exceptional effectiveness in this playful environment. The naturalness with which the mysterious world created by Fireproof Games is manipulated is therefore one of the cornerstones of the product, which, while remaining faithful to the mechanics of the first chapter, has nevertheless introduced some innovations. The main and most important is undoubtedly the greater complexity of the different rooms in which the adventure takes place; whereas in fact in the debut of the series everything took place limited to a single table and the objects present on it, in this case instead the environments are enriched by multiple areas of interaction, and not only populated by Chinese boxes to be opened piece by piece. Now there are desks, a model of a galleon, chests, showcases and so on, for a final result which - while hardly changing the rules of the game - appears decidedly more varied and organic. The claustrophobic, disturbing and oppressive atmosphere is then taken care of by the excellent technical component, truly of a high level: despite the fact that these are extremely static environments, the quality of the modeling, the use of lights and the goodness of the textures guarantee a hit eye of particular value. The same goes for the audio component, perfectly capable of maintaining tension and underlining the most important moments of the progression; precisely for this reason, the use of headphones appears highly advisable. Finally a note on longevity: the 6 levels present will hardly be able to keep busy for more than 4 or 5 hours, but in our view it is an optimal duration that keeps the experience compact and interesting. The price of 4.49 therefore appears completely justified, all the more so given the excellent translation into Italian. The Room Two is undoubtedly one of the most interesting iPad games of the year", "date": "2013-12-20", "grade": "8.6"}
