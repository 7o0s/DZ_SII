It happened that a film license, on paper destined to be nothing more than a sloppy tie-in, became one of the funniest, most appreciated and even innovative titles on the market at the time, becoming fertile ground for the exploration of new roads along which to develop the still uncertain genre of FPS on consoles. It was the era in which Rare was making Rare, on the other hand, and it seemed to be able to turn everything it touched into gold, under the wise gaze of the great N. Thirteen years have passed and Activision has decided that the time is ripe to dust off the title in question, first proposing a remake on the Wii, maintaining in this world a link with the spirit of the original, conceived and released exclusively on the Nintendo platform, and then clearing it - with all due respect to the purists - also to the rest of the consoles with what is in all respects a remake of the remake, graced by high definition graphics. However, a decisive distinction must be made between the two levels of remake: the first, the one released for Wii, represented an original reworking of the progenitor for Nintendo 64, a rather convincing reinterpretation, at least in terms of content - although not at the levels of excellence of the classic Nintendo 64 - of the particular hybrid between shooter and stealth-style action game that had characterized the old classic Rare, updated in order to create a product that can be enjoyed today even without necessarily relying on the nostalgic factor. Starting from this base, this further remake is a simple graphic update of the previous title, already the result of an intense reworking of the original. This Goldeneye 007: Reloaded therefore recalls the particular hybrid structure between stealth and FPS that characterized the original from Rare and this does it credit, but by adding various spectacular factors and a greater rate of action, however, it ends up offering the side to the inexorable barbs of a competition that on this factor proves to be extremely fierce and much more prepared, especially with the transition to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 which have numerous valid alternatives on this front. A new bond in an old story At first, the solution adopted by Eurocom to update the character of James Bond seems strange: the protagonist in fact has the appearance of Daniel Craig, the new 007, but is inserted within the setting and story of Goldeneye, a film starring Pierce Brosnam, an actor who played the famous British spy with a completely different style. Not that this changes the gameplay experience much, as there isn't much time for dialogue within the gameplay. The level design is profoundly different from what characterized the original for Nintendo 64 but the reference remains clearly visible in the settings which obviously follow the story of the film, albeit with some new unedited introductions. Starting therefore from an investigation into a Russian chemical weapons plant, the story evolves following James Bond grappling with a planetary threat represented by a terrible military satellite capable of destroying any target on Earth. The double face of man of action and silent and resourceful spy typical of 007 is reflected in the very structure of the game, which builds a hybrid mechanics based on the first-person shooter in which silent action is generally rewarded and the achievement of various tactical objectives becomes an indispensable node for the continuation of the story. It is therefore not just a matter of shooting wildly at everything that moves, but of pursuing precise objectives during infiltration missions in enemy territory, a situation in which it is always preferable to act with caution. The choice of difficulty level deepens the very structure of the game by gradually inserting new secondary objectives to be achieved, on the basis of which real additional game fragments are added, which increases the longevity of the single player campaign. If this weren't enough, Eurocom has prepared a truly impressive amount of single and multiplayer game modes: the ~MI-6~ missions, in single player, allow you to tackle a dozen detached levels, pursuing different objectives and trying to reach the maximum score, which can also be modified on the basis of a series of initial settings that act as handicaps or points multipliers, while on the multiplayer side there is a large number of different game modes. Among these are team options or free-for-all, missions withobjectives in perfect espionage style or aimed at simple destruction, as well as historical reminiscences such as offline multiplayer with 4-player split-screen and the Golden Gun mode. Among numerous maps of various types, multiplayer provides a truly remarkable reservoir of hours of gameplay, able to offer different experiences and suitable for various tastes, without disdaining certain recent standards such as the progressive ranking linked to the specialization in the use of the various match weapons after game. Muscles and brain As in the original Nintendo 64, which perhaps enhanced the alternative approach to the simple firefight even more, here too it is preferable, when possible, to act silently - ~stealth~ - reaching the objectives without causing too much fanfare, hiding behind the elements of the scenario, using silenced weapons and avoiding traps and surveillance mechanisms. The problem with this approach is that it is rather simplistic, when compared to other titles with a similar structure: enemies often do not notice the elimination of their companions even at a short distance and the detection of corpses does not exist as they disappear after a few seconds. with a somewhat antiquated solution. To fix the surveillance cameras, just shoot at them without arousing the slightest suspicion, as long as you use a silenced weapon, the use of espionage and hacking systems is limited to prearranged moments and in general there aren't many alternative paths to choose to go unnoticed. In short, in terms of stealth action and the variety of approaches to avoid or render enemies harmless we are decidedly far from the levels reached by Deus Ex: Human Revolution to give a practical example, despite the defects also present in the Eidos product. The particular charm of Bond's espionage style certainly remains, between plans to steal, planetary threats to thwart and the constant need to face an entire army alone. If you choose the ~action~ approach, or you are detected during the mission, the structure changes significantly returning to the usual FPS paths. Although in terms of pure action the comparison with other productions of the same genre on Xbox 360 and PS3 may be merciless for this game, Goldeneye 007: Reloaded knows how to be fun and the constant parallel presence of the possibility of acting in a stealth manner represents a double approach which is all to the advantage of identification and variety of action. Xbox 360 goals There are 50 unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points in Goldeneye 007 Reloaded, but the complete collection is no cakewalk. They are located fairly evenly between the various game modes (single campaign, MI-6 missions, multiplayer) and their achievement generally requires a fair amount of effort on the part of the player. For example, to unlock campaign objectives it is not enough to progress through the levels but it is also necessary to complete all the objectives, both primary and secondary. The hunt for 1000 points is therefore not a challenge to be taken lightly. James Bond polished The high definition restructuring of the graphic sector did not take place through a direct transposition of the system built for the Wii version, the remake was implemented starting almost from scratch, with the exploitation of a new graphic engine. The results, although not up to par with other current productions of the genre, are decidedly decent, with the notable characteristic of constant 60 frames per second, at least as regards the single-player campaign (some uncertainty can be seen in the multiplayer, but nothing shocking). The realization of the scenarios is a bit fluctuating, which alternates rather anonymous sections - in particular as regards some interiors - with others having an excellent visual impact, while a particular mention should be made for the possibility of hitting and eventually destroying some elements of the scenario, in order to modify the battlefield not make the covers safe, although the interaction is limited to some types of materials and objects. The interlude scenes within the single player campaign are well constructed and ~shot~ with a cinematic taste perfectly in 007 style. The control system on Xbox 360 incorporates the classic mechanics of the genre, while on Wii and PS3 it to motion detection through Remote Control and Move, respectively, but in this test we were able to use only the ~simple~ controller of the Microsoft console, which still behaves properly. There is a good active cover system that allows you to hide behind the elements of the scenery and ~emerge~ from themto aim and shoot, and then go back undercover again by pressing the button again, which makes the mechanics of the firefight particularly intuitive and fluid, tainted only by a certain inadequacy of the artificial intelligence which tends not to make it particularly credible and the movements and behaviors of the enemies are effective, which in any case can be partially compensated by raising the level of difficulty.", "date": "2011-11-14", "grade": "7.3"}
