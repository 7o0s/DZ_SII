Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War review is an opportunity to write about a title that is the ultimate sum of what has been said because this new chapter, orchestrated by Treyarch but created in collaboration with Raven Software, aims to become the tip of launches a series that this year celebrates its tenth anniversary, ready to face a test that is certainly not within the reach of all studios under the Activision wing. This Call of Duty wants to be unassailable from every point of view and in order not to disappoint even one of its most ardent supporters, it is presented on the starting grid with a series of features to take off your hat. In addition to the natural, but not obvious, possibility of updating the game to switch easily from Playstation 4/Xbox One to the sisters PS5 and Xbox Series X | Yes, the title also boasts a multiplayer sector that provides for cross progression and cross save, with the icing on the cake represented by that single progression of the account shared between all game modes. If you are not entirely accustomed to these terminologies, and in short, know that from wherever you start Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War you can always and in any case play with your friends, wherever they are, without ever leaving a single point behind. experience. The future, today, starts from this small step. Protagonists and first missions Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is the direct sequel to the first Call of Duty: Black Ops, narratively speaking, and you can expect to find some of the familiar faces of the saga in the game, faces that you have come to hate and love over the last few years. years. Among the protagonists of this campaign to eradicate a Soviet conspiracy set in the 80s make their appearance Alex Mason, dear old Woods and also Adler, among others, agents with a solid characterization and a charisma not to be underestimated. However, you will not always find yourself using them in the first person, however, since for the first time in the series you will have the possibility to create your personal alter ego by choosing its gender, skin color and other distinctive features of its past, with related character options to combat perks. Do you want a swashbuckling soldier? The game will satisfy you by assigning a resistance bonus to explosives, for example, or much more trivially increased bullet damage if you plan to play as a stormtrooper. They are absolutely not revolutionary changes, but it is still nice to find them in a context that has remained very armored up to now. The first missions flow pleasantly between disruptive and spectacular actions and a dynamism that has now been tested over the years. However, if you have already played the other chapters of the series, what happens on the screen leads to strong deja vu, with the classic choreographed explosions but phone calls and chase or combat actions aboard vehicles already experienced at least a dozen other times only in the last chapters. As we were about to throw in the towel however, the game took an extremely interesting turn, appropriating the free will features seen in Call of Duty: Black Ops II and until today always regretted. Thus, while chasing your target on the rooftops you can decide to save him or make him do a flight without a parachute of some floor, going to actively modify the story and its conclusion made up of multiple endings. Cold War does nothing to hide obvious narrative crossroads, with dialogues capable of leaving the player with maximum freedom of choice, and this also unlocks interesting secondary missions and plot twists, inevitably increasing the replayability of the production. Another thing that has left us completely satisfied is the great variety of action that the title puts into play, often forgetting that it is that call of duty caciarone we are used to and transforming itself into a game where intelligence to solve delicate objectives of infiltration or being able to speak with a contact behind enemy lines, become the order of the day. There are stealth missions, sniping action, head-on assaults aboard military helicopters and several other options for truly amazing overall variety, both in terms of gameplay and pure visual spectacle. In fact, with some tricks, we will go from the war in Vietnam a few years earlier to missions in Turkey of the more recent past, then jumping between snowy locations and cities in check without interruption. Allor very nice at least until we focus on the technical side of the production, with an artificial intelligence that unfortunately hasn't evolved, remaining half dazed with the body out of the shelter and unable to adopt the most basic tactics of circumvention or animations anchored to a game engine that just doesn't want to make progress from this point of view. Finally, on Playstation 4, the waiting times were a real thorn in the side in all modes, forcing us to stare for whole minutes at a screen that just didn't want to throw us into the action. Multiplayer and its modes Although the statistics say that the campaign is of interest to a very small part of players, the effort made in that component of the game has not affected what we usually find in the multiplayer sector. Let's start from the greatest interest in this context, emphasizing how Call of Duty: Warzone has now become an integral part of the experience and has been assimilated for completeness in the game menus, but still remains an experience mainly managed by Infinity Ward, complete with external client to download in case you want to access the games. The Battle Royale mode is therefore forcibly excluded from our evaluation and today we are going to examine all that Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War offers unique and original and, trust me, there is really a lot of meat on the fire. So let's start with the unique and distinguishable weapon feedback, with that feeling of knowing exactly, even before pulling the trigger, how each individual weapon can react to fire, its recoil and even aiming times, with snipers perhaps still a little too strong but a generous time to kill and capable of giving the possibility of an answer in all other situations, while remaining in the perspective of a frenetic and excited game like COD. We have substantially appreciated all the maps of the team deathmatch modes, although there are only six of them at the moment - the post-launch support will be completely free, we remind you - for game locations capable of always alternating between open spaces for long-distance duels and narrow corridors for body to body. They are obviously not all perfect, with some blind spots tedious to manage and chiaroscuro points that make it extremely difficult to focus the objectives in time, but we are really satisfied with the time we spent on them. All modes are now properly broken in, whether it's Dominion or the beloved Confirmed Kill, for a classic package that we take and throw in the pile of things that work without even breaking a sweat. When Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War gets out of hand and tries to do something that doesn't belong to it however, such as VIP mode and Combined Arms, the delicate balance is shattered and the feeling of having a satisfying game it fails. We found the tanks almost unfair which, although fragile, give an immense advantage to those who govern them, making them fun to drive but extremely unnerving when you have to fight against them, exactly like with the boats on Armada. However, we can overlook the question, especially when on the other side we found a very amusing Dirty Bomb, a perfect link between Deathmatch and Warzone, with some not bad goodies in the game structure and in the dynamism of the action, made up of continuous movements to reach the nuclear sites and a succession of assaults and really exhilarating strenuous defenses. The response from the servers was also excellent as always, at least in the review phase, but we feel we can go quite calmly given the good quality to which Treyarch has accustomed us in the last 10 years. Transition to next gen A box is a must to clarify the various packages available on the market, so as to unravel any doubts about which version to buy based on the console in your possession. Let's simply say that the official price, net of various discounts, for the next gen versions is 74.99. You will also be able to purchase Cold War in its Ultimate Edition, which already includes the Season Pass for the first season and two packs of extra content for 99.99. In both cases, you will have access to both the Playstation 4/Xbox One versions and the Playstation 5/Xbox One Series X | St. If instead you want to buy Cold War EXCLUSIVELY for Playstation 4/Xbox One you can fall back on the standard edition at a price of 69.99. Regardless of the package chosen, you will also have access to the operator Woods and an exclusive assault rifle blueprint. As for the qualities of the next gen version, we finda 4K resolution, ray tracing, 120 fps, Dolby Atmos and tactile controls on Playstation 5, all elements that we will analyze in an article dedicated to the new consoles. Even the zombies are renewed The really boring thing about past editions was that huge wall erected between the multiplayer mode and the zombie mode, a division that prevented dialogue between the two sides of the fence. With Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War this year Treyarch finally comes to give an incredible sense of continuity, allowing accounts to have a single progression profile shared between different activities. Play multiplayer and level up your favorite weapons, move onto zombies and use those same weapons since the first wave by getting kills to unlock more attachments and scopes to then return to multiplayer and make good times bad in an overwhelming loop . In a nutshell a really excellent solution from any angle you look at it. Zombie this year is not revolutionized but rather perfected with a myriad of adjustments on the so-called ~quality of life~. It starts precisely from the possibility of starting the game with any weapon you have unlocked, instead of relying on the usual boring pistol for the first rounds, with the game adapting and offering you an interesting challenge regardless. Instead of giving you area-specific weapons, guns are now offered in different rarities so an uncommon shotgun can be left behind in favor of a rare SMG and then pick up the same epic shotgun later in the adventure and so keep your favorite style of play. And then secret chests return, puzzles to solve and portals to activate, for an optimally refreshed mode. While we're not exactly the biggest Zombie fans, we can't deny that an absurd effort has been made this year to further lower the difficulty curve and offer a more gradual approach for all players, probably in the hope of attracting some of the many new users present on the Warzone servers. In case this wasn't enough then the crafting for improvements to weapons and gadgets takes care of it, both in the game and in the menus through the collection of specific materials and a Dead Ops mode, now in its third edition, which as usual plays a filling role in an excellent way, giving further hours of extra leisure without a fight.", "date": "2020-11-13", "grade": "8.5"}
