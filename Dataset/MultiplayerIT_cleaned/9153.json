Some work better than others, but the general rule is that you are unlikely to transform your physique and/or lose excess fat while sitting comfortably in front of the TV. Life is stressful, we all agree, but a certain type of physical activity, absurdly, can relieve this stress and give you a boost, an energy you never thought you had. In short, a little effort, an initial adaptation work made of a lot of good will, a minimum of constancy and voil, the rest will come by itself. The question arises: is it really possible to train effectively with a video game? As Wii owners well know, there are numerous publishers and developers who have ventured into so-called ~fitness games~; of software, rather than games, which imply the execution of a certain type of physical activity and which can lead to an effective improvement in one's fitness, through movements that are recognized by the Wii-mote and Nunchuk (or by the Balance Board) for check its correct execution. UFC Personal Trainer is just the latest example of this type of product, created in collaboration with the reference federation for shoot fighting, i.e. the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and the NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine). What do you want to do today? UFC Personal Trainer allows us to familiarize ourselves with the various exercises before embarking on a long-term program, an operation that can prove useful if we want to have a picture of how the system developed by THQ works. From the main screen you can access the ~workouts~, ~activities~ and ~programs~ sections, as well as experiment with a quick, randomly generated routine. In the ~workouts~ section we can decide to follow the suggestions of Mark Dellagrotte, Greg Jackson or Javier Mendez, three industry experts who will offer us as many approaches to training. Our activity can be based on increasing strength, on increasing endurance or be oriented towards weight loss. You can carry out a test to verify your current cardiovascular condition, then program a cycle of training organized according to the dictates of the NASM and the UFC, therefore with each week organized in such a way as to have three days of activity, one day of rest, two days of activity and another day of rest. Each session includes a few minutes dedicated to warming up, then we proceed with an alternation of exercises that involve the upper and lower parts of the body, with targets that are revised upwards from week to week to create the necessary progression. A quick example: if in today's session the coach asks us to perform at least thirty push-ups in the space of one minute, next week he could ask us to perform thirty-one, and so on for each individual exercise. It does not hurt! It does not hurt! The ~activity~ section, which we mentioned earlier, allows us to quickly access four single exercises, i.e. without an accompanying routine: training with protections, punching bags, tire lifts and punching balls. Each of these movements can be performed for one, three or five minutes. The first sees us hitting our coach's boxing gloves following his instructions from time to time, the second is a free punching session, in the third we have to mimic the gesture of lifting a large tire (therefore squatting down and getting back on our feet, lifting the arms) while finally in the fourth our goal is to hit and keep the punching ball moving as long as possible without making it stop, following certain ~rules~. In this particular case, the wire that connects the Wii-mote and Nunchuk can be a significant obstacle, since it will end up ~slapping~ us several times due to the rotational movement. However, this is not the only limitation of the UFC Personal Trainer, which if from the point of view of the training programs and their ~scientific nature~ is certainly valid and effective, it does not do the same in terms of detection of movement. A video gym class? It is possible to play using a pair of Wii-motes, the classic Wii-mote / Nunchuk combination and even the Balance Board, but the results in the end are not very distant: UFC Personal Trainer does not always correctly ~read~ our movements, indeed often the detection leaves much to be desired. The activities that see us hitting the bag or our coach are the ones most affected by this problem, seen che can't increase the speed of the punches without most of them getting lost in the rep count. The belt bundled with the game, which allows us to hook the Wii-mote to a thigh for lower body movements, likewise does not guarantee correct detection of the same. In short, the accelerometer integrated in the Wii controller turns out to be endowed with poor precision, or the THQ developers have not been able to make the most of it, the fact is that this element cannot be ignored to train effectively. Unless you follow the quick routines, which do not require any controller to be performed and which therefore are the same as any gymnastics video course. Not exactly what you paid for, right?
