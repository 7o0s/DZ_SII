With Assassin's Creed Recollection for iPad we are faced with a very different situation: carrying Ubisoft's strongest franchise with us is undoubtedly the reason why the game immediately shot to the top of the App Store sales charts, but behind the names and places taken from Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood, however, lies a strategic experience so successful and original that it can easily do without the fame of Ezio Auditore. Time strategy Let's start by setting aside all the aesthetic trappings given by the Assassin's Creed license and analyze Recollection for what it is: a collectible card game in which two players compete to conquer three different areas. Unlike the more common card games, in fact, in this case the arena is divided into three territories within which one's moves must be played. Reaching ten points in each territory conquers it, while the game is won by whoever first gains control of at least two areas. The most interesting component of the game is not the collection of points itself, which occurs largely through traditional clashes based on the strength and constitution of the units, but the fact that each turn is based on the passage of time, indicated by a bar horizontal in the center of the screen. Once a card has been placed on the playing field, it needs a certain amount of seconds to activate and become effective, and this applies to any type of unit: whether it is an Agent-card, capable of attacking the opponent or its defenses, whether it is a Location card, which remains in the background and gives bonuses and points at each turn; there are also Action-cards, which in a similar way to the Instants of Magic: The Gathering can be activated at any moment of the turn, perhaps in order to neutralize an opponent's action. The time factor is one of the reasons why the full experience of Assassin's Creed Recollection is strongly linked to the platform on which it was conceived, but it adds a very interesting component of urgency: the challenge between the two players becomes a sort of competition of speed, in which to think quickly and better manage your own scale of priorities, while you find yourself constantly changing strategy in the three battle areas based on the opponent's decisions. Technically you need to wait for your Gold reserve to fill up enough before you can use this or that card, but after a few turns the speed with which the money is accumulated increases to the point that it is difficult to remain idle. Clearly this is a very different approach from the considered and slow one that usually characterizes collectible card games, and those who don't like playing under pressure could end up hating the speed with which Recollection forces you to face each game. Unfortunately the downside of a fully timed mechanism and less emphasis on the single unit is a lack of emphasis on each move. In Ubisoft's game, one hardly gets the feeling of having displaced the opponent with a card played at the right time, of having overturned the entire game with a single move or of having stolen a fundamental card from the opponent. Everything flows quickly and in some cases you realize that you have conquered a territory only thanks to a graphic feedback from the game. The strength of a franchise like Assassin's Creed represents a clear advantage for Recollection: in addition to allowing the instant birth of a large number of online players, the Ubisoft brand has allowed the game to aim higher and show off a huge collection of splendid illustrations based on the ~Italian~ chapters of the series. The same menus are visually reminiscent of the Animus and there is no shortage of long computer graphics films or unlockable image galleries, while the 228-card database is destined to expand and include a whole series of additions taken from Assassin's Creed Revelations. Although this huge amount of content will undoubtedly make Ezio Auditore fans happy, at the same time it could make those who don't find charm in a card game entirely based on the names and settings of Renaissance Italy turn up their noses: after all, Vieri de ' Pazzi and Donato Mancini are much less pompous namesnts of a Dragon of Shivan or a Mahamoti Genius. Above all, the thousands of aesthetic doodles that should make the menus more captivating do nothing but slow down and make navigation less intuitive, so much so that in some cases you find yourself waiting a couple of seconds before the visual effects of a screenshot.", "date": "2012-07-25", "grade": "8.3"}
