{"name": "Fallout Shelter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/151934-fallout-shelter-larte-della-sopravvivenza.html", "text": "Tortured by years of waiting and a rather robust secrecy policy, millions of fans eager to re-immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the Bethesda series have rushed to Fallout Shelter, spending, among other things, a lot of money. So many to take the mobile management system that appeared out of nowhere to third place in the ranking of the most profitable in the App Store in defiance of a giant like Candy Crush. But although there are quite expensive microtransactions, Bethesda's Vault manager is free and the good news is that it is a fully usable title even without putting a hand in your wallet. The gameplay of Fallout Shelter, a title that puts us in the shoes of that supervisor who hated those who played the first Fallout so much, revolves almost entirely around the resources of the Vault which allow us to guarantee light, water and food to the survivors who show up at the our door in search of salvation. By admitting more and more survivors, new structures are unlocked that allow you to expand the functionality of the fallout shelter. Our task, dragging the characters in a decidedly intuitive way, is to assign new workers to the structures, checking that the statistics of the characters are those suitable for the job they will take care of, ensuring that the workforce and overall productivity are always sufficient to grant the entire Vault sustenance, care, and good cheer. But there are also side activities that effectively fill in the dead time such as exploring the Wastelands. Among other things, sending one or more survivors to the Wasteland is a rather useful activity since you can obtain additional resources such as caps which are essential for building and improving structures and experience. When you send out scouts, the camera stays focused on the ever-growing shelter as survivors smother the fires, procreate, and increase productivity through sprint functionality to make up for any resource shortages. But during the exploratory phase we can interact with the indomitable explorers by following a diary accompanied by statistics that indicate when to use anti-radiation treatments or drugs or when it is appropriate to recall the heroic survivor to the base. Wanderers try to escape from desperate situations and often succeed but death, inside and outside the Vault, is always lurking among radiations, marauders, hunger and fires. But in case one of our survivors passes away we can bring him back to life by spending the priceless caps. Not all structures produce resources or equipment but they are still essential for the ecosystem to survive. Closets allow you to store more items, elevators to expand the Vault in depth and dormitories to increase the number of survivors that can be housed while also guaranteeing them the privacy necessary to procreate. Some inhabitant with not too pleasant features might have some difficulty finding a partner but the bar allows you to increase your charisma even if, as we all know, if Fallout Shelter were a simulator it would be the one who drinks to find all the others decidedly more fascinating of what they are. Net of the gameplay licenses, in any case, life goes on even underground and the search for a new normality forces the unfortunate infants to attend school even in the midst of the apocalypse. The result will not be a new Vault Dweller but an intelligent child will soon be an excellent scientist and will be able to contribute more effectively to the survival of humanity. Fallout Shelter makes post-atomic survival a matter of management In the uncomfortable role of a supervisor Fallout Shelter is not a particularly complicated title but it is not poor in content either and becomes quite complex when we find ourselves having to manage the assignment and equipment of a hundred inhabitants. The latter, made up of a weapon and an item of clothing, helps them to survive outdoors but also allows them to increase specific characteristics that are essential for improving the functionality of the structures. Assigning the right survivor to the right job increases the effectiveness of the generator that provides power, the purifier for clean water and the medical center that allows you to create stimpacks. The structures are varied and include the entrance that allows you to hinder the looters. If these overcome the defenses, it is the citizens who have to intervene and it is good that they are properly equipped. To resist radiation, plagues, marauders and to improve the performance of the base it is necessary to take care of the clothing and weapons that can be obtained by exploring the Wastelands or by opening the classiclunch characteristic of the Fallout setting. These can also be purchased, together with the even more classic caps that act as coins, but they can also be obtained by achieving certain objectives and it is never necessary to dip into the wallet to fully enjoy the title. Of course the more expensive packages that guarantee rare items can help a lot those who can afford to buy them but since it is a single player title there is no danger that this factor will alter the overall balance of an experience that can prove to be quite long-lived. Fallout Shelter includes a large number of structures that become available as the population of the Vault increases until it reaches one hundred units, offering us a rather intense management effort. Obviously the available space is not infinite and this is where the expensive upgrades for the structures and the increase in the level of the inhabitants who become less and less expendable come into play. But once everything is unlocked, the dominant part is played by waiting. Waiting to click on the resources produced by a room to store them, waiting for a fire to send survivors to and put it out before it spreads to other rooms, waiting for a raider to attack or waiting for the return of an explorer. In essence, the experience becomes largely passive even if it is always possible to optimize what has already been built to aspire to better periodic evaluations or start all over again to try to create the perfect ecosystem. And it must be said that the technical sector is one of the inviting ones. We are certainly not dealing with a technological prodigy but visually Fallout Shelter is much more accurate than most of the titles of this genre. Carefully animated two-dimensional characters move in a base which, although viewed from the side, is completely three-dimensional. The camera rotates as we move the camera and we see other environments in the background that are exploited by the survivors assigned to the various rooms. The survivors who are characterized by the perfect and iconic style of the Fallout propaganda spots often exchange jokes, get sick, scamper around fleeing misfortunes, overcome pregnancies and go to eat in an environment that becomes increasingly lively and engaging also thanks to the sound sector that he draws heavily from the series by alleviating that need for Fallout that cannot be satisfied until November 10th. In the meantime, we just have to enjoy the Italian adaptation of Fallout Shelter, the intuitive interface and the fact that the title also works in the background, allowing us to do more to get back into action based on what the notifications tell us. And this is a game mode to keep in mind if there are no power outlets at hand because we are faced with a title that literally devours the battery. Furthermore, the characters of the menus are difficult to read on the screens of the iPhone 5 and 5S which are inevitably disadvantaged compared to iPad and later models. In any case, what we would like to underline is that Fallout Shelter is a real video game, available on the App Store and arriving on Android, and not a side application developed to give us advertising and news that can be consulted elsewhere. That will probably come with the title but will be incorporated in the much more delicious companion app which, loaded on smartphones and inserted in the $119.99 collector's Pip Boy, promises to make us feel like real vault dwellers.", "date": "2015-06-20", "grade": "7.5"}
