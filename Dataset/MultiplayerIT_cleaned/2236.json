{"name": "Earthworm Jim", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/earthworm-jim_a.html", "text": "We are obviously beyond sufficiency, but we are sorry that this conversion has not been treated more, because the product is valid and deserved more attention: the GBA could have been used more thoroughly. The purchase is recommended but an earful to the producers was needed, also because at the time of the SuperNes, Earthworm JIM marked the new standard in the action / platform category. 6 Pros: Nice ideas Humor Cons: No password, no SavePoint, no good... tu gabire buana Response to commands to see and see again Comic animations and intercalations (in the sense of tragic) Since JIM was transformed for the first time into a sort of SuperEvolved Worm by a space suit plummeted to earth, a long time has passed and there have been different formats on which to play his adventures. Now it's time for the GBA. To find the kidnapped princess it will be necessary to pass 6 levels plus peculiar stages, bonuses and last challenges, hunted down by those who crave our virtuous power suit. To face this long crusade you will have 3 lives and 3 continues. You will not find passwords or save points, so the adventure must be drunk in one go and restarted once the console is turned off. This is not good and right (it almost seems like a trick to increase longevity...). As if that weren't enough, the difficulty level (low, medium or tough) is still challenging. The game is full of nice gags and captivating gimmicks that parody the platform genre by also mixing extra-videogame references (cinema...). The actions that ours can show off are the flagship of the title: shooting with a plasma pistol (in the bell that the ammunition drops), whipping using your own head (this allows you both to put your opponents in line, and to emulate IndyJones to cling to sharp handholds and like Tarzan glide through the levels) and flutter by transforming your head into a propeller. The look is cartunesco and extremely cool (even after all these years). The sound system makes itself felt and is among the most successful parts of the whole game. In your wandering against Psy-Crow (bounty hunter who works to bring about your death), you will encounter a whole series of trinkets that will empower you. Levels are rewarding and well organized, as are the boss challenges. The matches are always enlivened by new irreverent news. The racing on the motor rocket is among the best parts of the game. However, the entertainment experience is undermined by some flaws: some elements of the background seem to have been put there with the cut and paste of Microsoft Paint (in the sense that the elements sometimes collide badly, creating visual discontinuities on the levels), the animations of characters on paper had to be extraordinary but a great imagination is needed to reconstruct them through all the missing frames and finally the most serious setback is a latency in the response of the commands (which will cost you your life every now and then). There are no options and configurations to do other than the difficulty level. On the other hand, the booklet is also in Italian and gives nice descriptions making reading pleasant.", "date": "2002-02-22", "grade": null}
