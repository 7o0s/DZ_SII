A sheet of which he has no memory and which gives no clues as to the reasons for his presence within the thick walls of that residence, but which urges him to find and kill a certain Alexander; no explanation but a goal, something concrete to pursue in the physical and mental chaos of those first few minutes. Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the latest work of the Swedish Frictional Games, the talented guys behind the Penumbra series, is preparing to reach virtual shops around the world, on Windows PC and Mac, asking to immerse themselves in a particular adventure, strongly linked to what the developer has previously done, quality and out of the box. Horror tale Immersing yourself in Amnesia: The Dark Descent means first of all doing it in its plot, a horror that mixes Poe, Lovecraft but also Barker, so much does the visual theme of flesh and physical horror become predominant in the second half of the adventure, and in its setting , the aforementioned Brennenburg castle, a series of rooms that will be revealed as you progress along the puzzles, almost always environmental, which soon become the main reason for interaction within the game. Daniel, the protagonist's alter ego, then moves around showing the player, with no interface other than a menu that can be called up when necessary, useful for inventory management, what he sees, asking him to use the matches scattered around the levels or the lamp in oil to light up the way, also a way not to completely lose the light of reason: mental health, like physical health, will in fact have to be kept constantly monitored, trying to recover it by being in the light and seeing its negative effects in case of deterioration, with the vision that blurs and the movements that become gradually more difficult, up to the point of dragging oneself on the ground in the grip of hallucinations. The first person view and the identification it brings with it are treated in the round, being justified both by the excellent atmosphere that is created, and by the physicality returned by the control system, which asks you to interact with the objects by mimicking with the mouse the movements made by the protagonist and making extensive use of the physics management capabilities of Frictional Games' proprietary engine, the HPL Engine 2. Everything was therefore developed with the idea of immersing as much as possible into the 'inside a dark and truly frightening atmosphere if enjoyed, as suggested, with the right environmental premises, at the same time carrying out a very well written plot, full of initially obscure plots and passages, arranged on several floors but gradually closer and closer until at the moment of their collision and at the end, the arrival point of a journey made of alchemy and mysterious spheres found around the world, horrible experiments and other planes of reality than what we live. The large number of documents all to be read or listened to, to which is added if desired the commentary of the devs in full Valve style, combined with an enviable visual variety and a leading audio sector, also manage to put an excellent production value on the plate especially given the scale of the project. Where and for how much The game will be released on September 8th but anyone who wants to pre-order it can find interesting offers. Both Steam and GamersGate, in fact, offer it for just under 12 euros instead of 15, making the title even more attractive. Shadow corners Looking at it from the point of view of the ability to excite, of the narration and of the courage in re-proposing and enhancing what was experimented in Penumbra, already not a little particular titles, Amnesia: The Dark Descent could come from the parts of the best indie masterpieces. In reality, however, there are some problems, deriving precisely from what is perhaps the best feature: if the methods of interaction are excellent, making every gesture mimic and linking practically all the puzzles scattered throughout the levels to these, it is equally true that the element of challenge is almost completely missing, given that it was preferred to make the experience linear and simple, to involve as much as possible without giving the feeling of artificiality inherent in almost all videogame experiences. The level of difficulty in adventures, point and click or with a first person control system, as in this case, is a classic problem but here the outlines of this discussion are sharpened in a negative sense by certain choices, such as those to include some potentially interesting opponents because the more aggressive they aremore time is spent looking in their direction - asking to stand in the dark, still and without looking at them, an attitude that is unsettling and unnatural - but undermined by a terrible artificial intelligence, than in the second part of the game, when they are more present, at times makes them a hindrance to identification. Nothing dramatic in the economy of the seven-eight hours of gameplay, however one of the small details together with some bugs, better made environments than others and an Italian localization - text only, the voice always remains in good English - with more of some imperfections, which partially turn up their noses, before forgetting about them and throwing themselves headlong into the mysteries hidden in Brennenburg castle.", "date": "2010-09-07", "grade": "8.5"}
