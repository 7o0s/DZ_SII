{"name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120771-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-vengeance-vendetta-dolce-vendetta.html", "text": "Third DLC after the previous Uprising and Revolution, Vengeance does not differ at all from the classic package usually offered by Treyarch, thus offering four standard maps and one zombie, as usual the highest point of the usual 1200 Microsoft Points required. Four maps, therefore: Cove set on a tropical island, Detour which leads us to fight on a half-destroyed bridge in a city on the East Coast, Rush, or frenetic firefights inside a Paintball facility, and Uplink, the 2013 version of the classic Black Ops Summit, only instead of snow is rain-soaked jungle in Myanmar. And then there's the huge Buried, a western town complete with a zombie-infested mine. Nothing substantial new, but the average quality of the maps of CoD: Black Ops II Vengeance is very high At sea and in mines Cove, a medium-small sized map, takes us to the beaches of a tropical island, fighting among the remains of an airplane, seeking cover among the rocks scattered on the sand, sneaking along the paths between the trees that lead to the sea, and more generally looking for the elevated points that allow a good glance on the playing field, or putting in place tasty ambushes in the numerous bottlenecks of the internal areas. An average map, neither particularly brilliant nor tedious, but undoubtedly well done and fun, capable, given the not exactly exaggerated dimensions, of unleashing very fast and frenetic matches, perfect for raising the kill count in Team Deathmatches, but at the same tempo seems not to suffer even in goal matches. We didn't like Detour very much. The half-destroyed bridge offers just too horizontal a layout to battle. There is also an ~underground~ section, but the impression is that this map does not give the possibility of looking for secondary roads, secluded passages and so on, focusing everything on the simple face-to-face race of the factions. The elevated areas are a rare commodity, there are some protrusions from which to try to snipe, but in fact ~strategically speaking~ it is the poorest of the package even if built on two levels. A shame given its length and what on paper could have been a perfect and wide-ranging level, but ultimately it is simply the least interesting and inspired scenario of the package. Rush belongs to the category of ~weird~, or rather peculiar maps. This time, after visiting the Studio soundstages, we find ourselves inside a structure made specifically for playing Call of Duty in real life, holding air rifles that shoot balls full of ink instead of . 5.56. A setting that not only makes us shoot around in the arena proper, moving stealthily among the paint-stained inflatables, but which also leads us to explore the adjacent areas, i.e. the shops and offices, without forgetting the passage placed at the top, perfect but not too much, to have a privileged point of view on the battlefield below. A well-designed, intricate map, but full of defiles and stalking areas, perfect in short for very tight matches as per tradition. As written at the beginning, Uplink takes us into the past by updating the old but appreciated Black Ops Summit. It is therefore useless to go into a description since those who intend to buy this DLC know the map inside out: we are still faced with a perfect mix of outdoor and indoor fights, between laboratories, containers, towers and walkways secluded on the abyss . Furthermore, the night setting, the jungle and the pouring rain instead of snow actually make the map quite different, but obviously the more savvy player will know perfectly how to move. In Buried, on the other hand, there is no shortage of news, even if they do not give real added value to the new setting like the previous Alcatraz. However, the ghost town is not a map to be despised, on the contrary it puts us to the test in a rather varied space, large but decidedly twisted, where, as in any western film, we can find the bank, the prison, the saloon and obviously the mine, queen of the map. It also gives us a new weapon, the Laser Mark II, but especially in the most dangerous moments it gives us the ability to free Leroy, a huge CPU-managed ally who can help us by fighting zombies or building barricades, just give him candy or whiskey. In short, nothing new, a similar solution had already been seen with Romero in Mob of the Dead, but it is something that works and amplifies the game mechanics. Buy or not this new DLC for Call of Duty: Black Ops II? The newsThere aren't many substantial ones, we are faced with the same problems as the previous package, but compared to Uprising the average quality is higher, even if Detour doesn't really make you cry out for a miracle. Of course, Uplink is not a new map in every sense (like Studio), but luckily for us Cove and especially Rush are really well done and perfect for the frenetic gameplay of Call of Duty.", "date": "2013-07-05", "grade": null}
