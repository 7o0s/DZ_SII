{"name": "Zitto e spara", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/136540-crimsonland-zitto-e-spara.html", "text": "Crimsonland is the remastered version of the homonymous game developed by 10tons and released for the first time for PC in 2003. It is a top-down shooter in which you move up and down the screen, avoiding being sliced and shooting like hell to eliminate the enemy hordes wave after wave, which arrives on PlayStation Vita effectively bringing all the adrenaline and carnage of home editions to the Sony laptop as well. That the production of 10tons is a no-nonsense shooter is demonstrated by the very fact that the story is totally absent, and no details are provided on who the protagonist is or why he finds himself in that haunted place fighting thousands of monsters, if not that he is an anonymous interstellar marine separated from his company after landing on the planet. Shooting anything that moves on the screen is practically the only thing the user is called upon to do, and the only stimulus that pushes him to go on until the end of the adventure is linked, on the one hand, to his will to destroy any alien life form, on the other hand by an unlockable system that makes him get a new weapon from time to time (there are over thirty to collect including machine guns, flamethrowers and other more imaginative ones, such as the 3-Way Ion Rifle), perks and other missions. Hundreds of zombies, giant bugs and creatures to eliminate in the fast-paced shooter from 10tons Ltd PSVita trophies There are twenty-one Trophies made available by Crimsonland. To get them you have to complete some of the challenges required by the game, such as completing the various acts of the Quests mode, or finishing the game on the Hardcore or Grim difficulty level and blowing up 50 creatures within the first 30 seconds of playing. start of a level. Burn them all The perks are around fifty or so, and serve to make the protagonist faster, depending on the type, or to quickly regenerate his health or to protect him for a certain amount of time, just to name a few. Furthermore, some of them, depending on the game mode, integrate perfectly with the other advantages acquired or with certain types of weapons, resulting in a combination that is much more effective than normal and more useful for the success of the mission. In addition to weapons and perks, to try to keep the swarms of parasites and living dead at bay that will launch themselves against him, the gamer also has real power-ups at his disposal which, identifiable by special icons, are randomly released on the battlefield. Elements such as fire and freezing smart bombs, or those capable of slowing down time can be useful for making a clean sweep of dozens of hostile creatures more than a burst of machine guns in a flash. As far as the controls are concerned, the character responds quite well to the inputs and is controlled quite easily with the left analog stick, while with the right one you tinker with the layout of the viewfinder. With the X button you load the weapon supplied, while with the right backbone you shoot at enemies. The ~special~ functions of PlayStation Vita are relegated only to the alternative commands of the pointer or the shot, which can therefore also be used via the touch screen. Closed the parenthesis relating to gameplay and controls, let's take a look at the game modes in the product. Of these, playable in local co-op mode for up to four players, there are a handful between the main and secondary ones, that is, those internal sub-sessions to the first ones. The two primaries remain those called Quests and Survival. The first represents a sort of campaign (so to speak), divided into half a dozen acts for a total of about sixty pure action missions. The player, as mentioned before, finds himself under a constant attack, at an increasing and variable rate, of monsters of all kinds, from giant insects to lizard men, up to zombies, to be blasted mercilessly, wave after wave, until to the filling of the progress bar which indicates the degree of completion of the framework. Each scenario can be tackled by choosing the most welcome difficulty level among those available (two out of three are to be unlocked), with the highest one offering a decidedly difficult challenge even to the most hardcore players. Everything that is unlocked in the Quests mode can then be used in the other main section of the game, namely Survival. The latter, which in our opinion is the most interesting, allows you to compete for first place in a special online ranking, and is made up of five distinct and separate sessions, two of which to unlock. If in principle in each of them the final aim is to soprevive, each still offers a different type of challenge, which can range from the ~simple~ attempt to resist as long as possible to the assaults of enemies and the inevitable death, being able to count only on the basic weapon supplied, to that in which you can use all the weapons that are randomly generated on the screen. More interesting is the more classic form of survival mode, where the gamer can count on a level-up system which, with each kill, allows him to accumulate useful points both to determine his position in the standings and to level up. And every time he does it he can then choose a perk among the four-five that are offered to him in the video. It is here that the above advantages perhaps play a more decisive role than in the rest of the game, thanks to the possibility of combining their effects with those of weapons: equipping a plasma cannon with a bonus that increases its reload speed can result for example a winning move, and so on. On a technical level, the product is nothing exceptional, but in relation to the type of game, genre fans could also like it, especially as regards the general color choice and the sound. The gloomy and desolate places of the planet are in this sense well represented on the screen, thanks to a different coloring and the addition of details that differentiate the various areas that the user finds himself visiting, even if given the type of setting many scenarios appear overall quite anonymous and in the long run repetitive to the eye. In any case everything is in a short time always covered in red, that of the blood of the killed enemies. On the other hand, the models of the enemies and of the main character are too small, at least in relation to the screen of Vita. On the other hand, the general fluidity is excellent even in the most chaotic moments, and the soundtrack, characterized by heavy metal songs capable of ~motivating~ and spurring even the laziest of gamers to battle.", "date": "2014-09-04", "grade": "6.5"}
