{"name": "Park Beyond", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/park-beyond-recensione.html", "text": "The construction of theme parks has always aroused great fascination in video game developers who, as soon as they had the technical means and exhausted the most obvious sources of inspiration such as cities or railways, wanted to immediately create experiences that would allow them to build mountains roller coasters and the most complex amusement parks ever. RollerCoaster Tycoon and Theme Park are among the progenitors of a genre that over the years, thanks above all to technological advances, has become increasingly crazy and colorful. In fact, in the review of Park Beyond, you will discover that in the latest effort by Limbic Entertainment, the studio of Might & Magic VI and Tropico 6, the tools made available to players are increasingly refined and, thanks to them, it will be possible to create craziest and most complex roller coaster ever. What the game lacks is, surprisingly, a little more madness. In other words, it lacks some of the secret ingredient that you will use in the game to make the various rides special: the impossibilities. Very classic Behind the crazy veneer, Park Beyond is a pretty classic experience From different points of view, Park Beyond is very similar to Two Point Hospital: the developers have taken a classic formula, have cloaked it with a cutting-edge technical sector, have introduced all those improvements to the quality of life necessary in a modern product, there they've sprinkled a dash of humor on top and packaged it all for PC and consoles. The end result could only be pleasant: these are games in which you find yourself having to build and perfect some very particular places and the balancing of all the various systems is designed to ensure that there is always something to do and to improve . In this way we often find ourselves enraptured by a virtuous circle of cause and effect that pushes us to go on for hours without realizing that time has flown by. Nella is crazy enough for Park Beyond In this case, then, the subject is particularly fascinating: in the entertaining Park Beyond campaign mode, it makes us take on the role of a new creator of amusement parks who, somewhat by chance, ends up helping a group of crazy and down-at-heel characters, committed to their own way to improve the fortunes of their company. This mode is nothing more than a long tutorial designed to teach all the secrets of the game, but it has the advantage of being well structured (apart from some objectives or parameters that are not very clear to find) and above all well written. The many interlude films, as well as being dubbed in excellent Italian, give a somewhat crazy and light-hearted tone not only to the characters, but to the whole work. Between the renovation of an old park in an abandoned village to the creation of the craziest rides in the world, you will gradually learn all the secrets of Park Beyond so that you can jump into free mode without major difficulties. Park Beyond is a roller coaster builder's dream Park Beyond's traditional rides aren't very traditional... There are two main ways to bring a theme park to success: either focus on traditional rides or dedicate yourself body and soul to creating the craziest roller coaster on the planet. In the first case, things are quite simple: the ~traditional~ rides (in quotation marks because some are, obviously, crazier than normal) have predefined dimensions and characteristics and all you have to do is find a suitable position for them in the park and trace a functional input and output. Of these rides you can set the ticket price and some other parameters, in order to better control their profitability and attractiveness. Roller coasters, on the other hand, are the best that Park Beyond has to offer. You can opt for one of the pre-set templates, or you can use the many tools available to create the craziest roller coasters you can put together. Because it is true that there are slightly over the top tools available such as cannons, but before being able to open this kind of carousel you will have to verify that all the trolleys return safely to their starting point. So no excessively sharp curves or too steep climbs: your convoy must leave and return to the start of the carousel. The how is another matter. The various tracks, in fact, can be bent, crooked, passed through mountains or waterfalls. Nothing is precluded to the player and, on the contrary, the comfortable and powerful tools available allow you to always dare a little more. This doesn't mean that it's easy to create beautiful roller coasters, you need a good knowledge of each piece and precisionl place them, but using the prefabricated parts, the preset models and a little patience it will be possible to create crazy courses, but that work right away. There will be time for the chiselling. Also because Park Beyond offers dozens of different objects just to beautify your park, such as fences, bulkheads and lights: you can use them in the most classic way or indulge yourself in positioning them where you think is most appropriate. From this point of view the game is very forgiving, there are no finer parameters to manage, such as power lines, water or anything else, so you can put a restaurant on top of a mountain with a crazy ramp to get there and the customers there they will go without major problems. Stores are also critical to the success of Park Beyond parks In addition to the rides, in fact, you will have to think about the services. Customers will not only want to have fun, but during the day they will be hungry, thirsty, tired and have to go to the bathroom. Your task will also be to analyze their needs and insert between one attraction and another those structures that you think are suitable for their needs. Complicating matters slightly is the demographics: the audience is divided into families, adults and teenagers. Each ride has specific parameters that attract one audience more than another: the secret of a good park is to provide the most complete experience possible for a certain type of customer, so as to have a very satisfied and unsatisfied type of visitor. a set of people rather cold from the experience. Will you focus on young people, families or adults? Also because satisfied visitors will allow your park to make a real leap in quality: their entertainment, in fact, will fill a particular parameter which in turn will allow you to perform impossible actions, or impossibilities to use the jargon coined by Park Beyond . Behind this name lies the possibility of improving the staff or facilities of the park so that they are even more profitable. Maintenance workers could unlock a flamethrower that can greatly speed up the cleaning of dirt on the streets, unavailable shops will have new goods, while the roller coaster can unlock an additional unique feature. It is a way to give an additional hand of madness and personality to your park, even if it will not upset the flow of the game: all the euphoria generated will have to be balanced in some way so as not to make visitors dizzy. predictable action There's no shortage of style at Park Beyond In Park Beyond, therefore, everything works quite well, of course there are some balancing problems, but nothing that cannot be solved with future updates. The graphics are colorful, the tools for building roller coasters and terraforming your map are powerful, and the options are plentiful. The impression, however, is that the developers have focused a lot on wanting to publish a game thanks to which to build the most beautiful and glittering theme park in the world, without however digging very deeply into the more managerial mechanics. Kind of like the Two Point Hospital mentioned earlier. As long as the game unlocks new options and possibilities, everything works well, the co-stars are crazy at the right point and the sense of freedom given in the construction of the attractions is total, in spite of environmental and urban planning permits (~it's quicker to apologize than to ask permission~ is the cutting philosophy of Phil Bailey). Once all the upgrades have been obtained, however, Park Beyond seems to lack that extra gear, that impossibility that would allow it to be a classic. In fact, everything becomes a little too predictable and controllable, without unexpected events, big problems on the horizon or limits to get around. That is the spice of this kind of experience. The crazy characters are one of the best parts of the game However, it is a very solid foundation on which to build, with which editor lovers will be able to indulge themselves in creating the most beautiful and complex rides ever thought of. Those who ~limit themselves~ to playing and were looking for an heir to the great classics of the past will find themselves faced with an absolutely well-packaged experience, but with a shorter breath than the infinite exponents of the past.", "date": "2023-06-19", "grade": "8.0"}
