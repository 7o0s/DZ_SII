The tie-in of the first film, also developed by SEGA Studios San Francisco, in fact, while generally offering a gameplay of modest quality, was distinguished by a series of really interesting ideas, which we would have gladly wanted to see developed in this sequel. We are referring in particular to the flight system, extremely enjoyable and realistic (light years ahead of what was proposed by Dark Void, to remain on the theme of ~flying men by means of thrusters~), to the possibility of momentarily directing the energy of the armor towards a specific sector (shields, weapons, flight, physical strength) to improve its efficiency and to purchase new devices (modified repulsors, rocket launchers, etc.) to then equip them quickly and intuitively before embarking on a mission. Believe it or not, all these positive elements in Iron Man 2 have either been redesigned (badly) or completely eliminated. But let's go in order... The super friends As can already be understood from the image on the packaging, the game takes into great consideration the relationship between Iron Man and War Machine, the military variant of the armor piloted by Tony Stark's best friend, Jim Rhodes. Depending on the mission, in fact, we will control one or the other character and we will therefore be able to use generally different weapon systems: on the one hand the classic repulsors, on the other large-caliber machine guns. Both armors (but the discussion extends to all the unlockable armors in the game, one for each of the eight stages if completed with good results) have four ~slots~ in which it is possible to place weapons, located on the forearms and on the shoulders, and the possibilities in this sense are quite varied: they range from the aforementioned repulsors and machine guns to single and multiple rocket launchers, from lasers to firing cannons. The first, bitter surprise concerns the arsenal, the usability of which is strongly undermined by a system of development and assignment of weapons that cannot be more cumbersome: it took us about five hours to complete the game (it doesn't last so long, already) and it's almost not enough to understand exactly how the thing works, it's so bizarre. In practice there is a section dedicated to ~research and development~ where we can ~invent~ new weapons, new types of ammunition and energy modules upon payment of a certain number of experience points, followed by a section called ~weapons manufacturing~ ( but the translation error is likely, given the very poor quality of the localization in Italian) in which we can use six ~slots~ to configure each weapon as we wish, assigning it the ammunition and energy modules we intend to use. The setup operation is so long and complicated as to discourage any attempt to experiment to understand which is the most suitable solution for each mission. Xbox 360 goals Iron Man 2 includes fifty achievements, for a total of 1000 points. Most are obtained by completing the various stages, including the final one, while the more complex objectives involve a certain degree of skill in overcoming the missions with zero damage, eliminating enemies within a time limit or defeating a hundred of them with each of the weapons in our possession. Fly, o-oh The second surprise, in many ways even more bitter, derives from the new control system: where in the first Iron Man the flight was controlled via the right back buttons of the controller, pressing the A button to use the boost, in this sequel things are been heavily modified and all the depth that this experience was able to give has been lost. To take flight now you have to press the back button LB twice, then act on the left analog stick to accelerate, stop or manage the yaw, while the triggers have been assigned to the weapons of the left and right side of the body, to be alternated by acting on the d-pad (a far from comfortable operation, especially in the most agitated situations). We realize that the actions that can be performed by the armor are numerous, but the reassignment of the commands has made the learning curve of the game decidedly steeper, taking away, as already mentioned, what good had been done to make flying in armor spectacular and fun. The developers have thought of balancing the aerial and ground phases compared to the first tie-in, in fact Iron Man's movements on the ground appear decidedly more plausible and some effort has been made in the direction of melee combat (previously almost absent ), which however are often confusing and repetitive. The sector grafico has undergone a series of improvements, the armors are very well made (apart from that of War Machine, who knows why) and the scenarios look much better, less desolate but still limited in terms of interaction. The frame rate remains constant even in the most difficult situations, while the sound deserves a separate discussion, in particular the dubbing in Italian by the same ~team~ that dealt with Red Steel 2: we understand well the economic needs of the distributors and a he company that offers its services at ridiculously low prices is always tempting, but you also need to understand that by putting the dubbing in the hands of people who haven't taken a diction course, they don't have the slightest idea of what it means to act, they eat the words and it doesn't even manage to respect the timing of the original jokes, it doesn't offer a good service either to the users or to the dignity of the product itself, which comes out even more battered. At this point it is better to leave the original dubbing (which in the cast includes Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson themselves, for example) and insert the subtitles: Italian gamers have waited decades to have good localizations, let's not throw everything away in this way.", "date": "2010-06-03", "grade": "5.8"}
