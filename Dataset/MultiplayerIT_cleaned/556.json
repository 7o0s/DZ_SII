{"name": "Driver: Parallel Lines - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driver-parallel-lines-recensione.html", "text": "Parallel and perpendicular Many users seem to have forgotten, or pretend not to remember, that it was the Driver series, with its first two chapters on PSX, that definitively launched the ~criminal~ racing-game genre into the videogame galaxy. Precisely for this reason, it is evident how Reflections is particularly keen to give prestige to its franchise, especially after the unfortunate parenthesis of Driv3r: and although this Parallel Lines certainly constitutes a step forward towards the return of the series at high levels, at the same time cannot be considered a real point of arrival. Of course, compared to the incomplete prequel there has been progress and it is clearly visible, but the work of Gareth Edmonson and associates still seems destined to remain distant from the highest part of the podium. Such a sensation is already conferred by the storyline of the product, unable to conquer the user due to various deficiencies in terms of plot and characterization of the characters. The protagonist, as mentioned, is the eighteen year old TK, who through the acquaintances of some local gangsters, begins his career as a criminal driver in New York in 1978, only to be betrayed and framed by his ~colleagues~ and find himself having to serve as many as 28 years in prison: needless to say that, at the end of the sentence, our (anti) hero's only thought will be to take revenge on the instigators of his arrest. As it is easy to understand, precisely because of this plot divided into two temporal sections, the action in Parallel Lines is split more or less equally between the New York of '78 and today's, even if the substance does not change much: Precisely by virtue of a plot divided into two temporal sections, the action in Parallel Lines is split more or less equally between the New York of '78 and today's Parallel and perpendicular the user always has the task of carrying out missions - which are rather conventional - on board the car on duty, drawn from among the 80 specimens available in the game. The behavior of the cars is always convincing, as per Reflections tradition, even if under the profile of the controls there is perhaps an excessive lightness of the same, thanks to a very sensitive steering and a slippery asphalt beyond all logic: instead the massive presence of traffic on the roads, which forces continuous zig-zags and which congests the narrow bridges that connect the three parts of the city, forcing the player to ramming wildly. However, four-wheelers are not the only protagonists: in addition to being able to drive some motorcycle models (moreover characterized by questionable handling), TK often finds himself moving on foot, this time in terms of pure free-roaming complement and not because of precise playful choices as in Driv3r: fortunately, these portions of gameplay are harmoniously inserted into the game, even if they turn up their noses at some imperfections in the control system, mainly concerning the lock-on of firearms. Not enough Parallel Lines offers the user a series of main missions flanked by other secondary ones (you go from races on circuits or checkpoints to jobs like car theft or collecting lace), only useful for earning extra money, which can be spent on upgrades for their vehicles in the workshops scattered throughout the city . Too bad that this option turns out to be a useless waste of time, given and considered how much more convenient and faster it is materially to steal a new vehicle on the street rather than going back and forth between the various garages. Apart from that, the gameplay of the Reflections title runs without great acute nor terrible lows, enlivened in an even excessively pedantic way by the police chases, whose patrols need only a minimal pretext (it is enough to run a red light, exceed the speed limits or travel in the oncoming lane) to turn on the sirens: realistic, sure, but not exactly fun. The gameplay of the Reflections title flows without great acuteness or terrible lowness, enlivened in an even excessively pedantic way by the police chases Not enough However, losing the cops turns out to be an all in all easy operation, mainly because the game divides the crime level between the car and the character, so after committing crimes on the road you only have to turn a corner and change cars to come back clean: moreover, police cars have a curious intolerance towards turf, capable of slowing them down and making them skid in an objectively ridiculous way. Two aspects of Parallel Lines that should be promoted with flying colors are TK's ability to shoot while driving leaning out the window and the opportunitythe unit provided by the game to restart a mission at any time by simply pressing a key, something that Rockstar developers should finally learn as well. Overall, however, Parallel Lines offers a medium-intensity playful experience, accompanied moreover by a graphic design that can also be enclosed within evaluations that oscillate between sufficient and discreet. In fact, if the fidelity of the reproduction of New York is certainly remarkable, the same cannot be said for the unhappy color palette adopted by Reflections and for the woody animations of the protagonist; again, alongside well-defined cars with likely behaviors, unexciting textures, pop-ups and a frame rate susceptible to some drops should be noted. In short, the graphics of Parallel Lines is a real mixed bag, generally a bit rough but all in all appreciable also considering the good quality of the FMVs that surround the action. Finally, thumbs up for the sound in terms of effects and music, almost all spot on and pleasant, while the speech suffers from excessive compression and an Italian dubbing that is anything but extraordinary. Cross-platform As expected, Driver: Parallel Lines runs better on Xbox, again mainly for reasons of better texture definition and lower aliasing, even if the detachment is much more visible if you view the game at 480p. Using the normal resolution, however, the two versions do not differ so glaringly. Comment Driver: Parallel Lines is an all in all honest product, which unfortunately still fails to bring the series back to the levels of the first two historic chapters. Reflections is mainly criticized for having wanted to do things in a perhaps too conventional way, with an excessively timid commitment in trying to take a new path: the result is that Parallel Lines offers a fairly satisfying but at the same time playful experience substantially anonymous and colorless, also thanks to a non-transcendental graphic sector and a rather banal and not very engaging storyline treatment. In short, the improvement compared to the prequel has been there and must be rewarded, but Reflections must definitely try harder if it intends to return to the glories of the past. Pros Several steps forward compared to the prequel Faithful reconstruction of New York Solid behavior of the cars Cons Gameplay a bit bland and derivative Graphics between ups and downs Some really gross ingenuities The rules are clear: after a misstep, there's nothing better than a good cleanup to start over. It is therefore not surprising that, following the decline suffered due to Driv3r, Reflections has well thought of giving a clear change to its franchise, at least in stylistic terms: having abandoned the role of Tanner and the multiple locations, this Parallel Lines puts scene the young wannabe-gangster TK in the roaring New York of 1978. Now let's see if this trip back in time has allowed the Atari series to make a real leap forward in terms of quality...", "date": "2006-04-05", "grade": null}
