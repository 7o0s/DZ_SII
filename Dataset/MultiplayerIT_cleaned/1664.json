{"name": "Il Signore degli Anelli: Le Due Torri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-signore-degli-anelli-le-due-torri_a.html", "text": "Honor, respect and fidelity As announced at the beginning, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is not exclusively linked to the events narrated in the second episode of the trilogy, but merges the first two chapters into a single playful experience. A choice, this, which has allowed the developers to guarantee the user a dozen different stages and at the same time to maintain absolute fidelity to what is narrated in the two films. Consequently, the various levels of the game all take place within settings that are immediately familiar to anyone who has followed the adventures of Frodo and company in the cinema. The mines of Moria and Helm's Deep are just two examples, among the most spectacular, of scenarios in which the player is called to slaughter Orcs and Uruk-hai. It must be said that the entire EA production is imbued with a particular care aimed at reviving the same atmosphere of the two films in the game, an operation made a success thanks to a series of important tricks. First of all, the graphic realization of the title, which both in terms of the characters and the settings is decidedly similar to what was seen on the big screen: the EA polygonal engine, then, further contributes to the work by managing to easily manage large quantities of characters simultaneously, effectively recreating the real brawls characteristic of action scenes from the movies. Another important element for the purposes of correspondence with the films is the sound, which in EA's slash'em up reaches important qualitative peaks: the epic musical accompaniment that acts as a background to the fights is taken directly from the original soundtrack, while the dubbing in Italian was rightfully cast by the same actors who lent their voices to Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and company. The various introductory sequences to the levels conclude this overview in style, consisting of film clips that seamlessly ~transform~ into films managed by the game's graphics engine, establishing a link that is not only ideal between film and video game. Orc barrel Beyond the excellent audiovisual component, however, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers also proves to be a well-made slash'em up. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are the characters that can be used during the adventure, who have been respectively assigned the classic roles of the ~balanced~, the ~fast~ and the ~mighty~. All three start with a rather limited base stock of moves, which can still be exponentially expanded by spending the points accumulated in the various stages in the purchase of both new shots and various upgrades. In any case, the actual game is decidedly complete: there are two keys for attacking with the sword (fast, useful against weaker Orcs, and powerful, to be used mainly against shielded enemies), while the remaining buttons on the Gamecube pad manage parries, shoulder thrusts (useful for making enemies lose their balance) and aiming and operating long-range weapons. In short, the EA title is not resolved in a simple and casual button-smashing, but requires a certain dexterity in exploiting the swordsmanship skills of your alter-ego: and even if on more and more occasions you find yourself having to face many opponents simultaneously , the game never expires in a meaningless brawl, but always retains a minimum of ~technical~ depth. So The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a product that is widely recommended even for the most experienced players, who would probably prove to be more willing to tolerate the fluctuating level of difficulty of the game; if some internships can in fact be completed without problems, others prove to be really difficult, capable of putting even the most savvy users in a crisis. Comment The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a successful tie-in in almost every aspect, able to both satisfy fans of the film trilogy (thanks to the more than good fidelity with Peter Jackson's first two films) and more demanding, offering a non-revolutionary but absolutely enjoyable and well-crafted gameplay. The EA title also features excellent cosmetics, a sound sector of absolute excellence and a series of unlockable bonuses and extras of great interest: in short, a decidedly well-finished product, which however is not lacking in defects. First of all the absence of a multiplayer mode, which severely limits the already unmemorable longevity, closely followed by a level of difficulty that is not always well calibrated, which makesde some decidedly easy stages and others incredibly difficult. Pros: Excellent audiovisual sector Compelling and well-constructed gameplay Large amount of extra content Cons: Absence of multiplayer mode Rather poor longevity Very fluctuating difficulty level Tie-ins. A definition that almost did not find space in the dictionary of synonyms as the equivalent of the term ~videogame crap~. In fact, there have been too many and too frequent products inspired by a film that during the entire life of the videogame industry have made a sensational fiasco, often disappointing both as games in and of themselves and in terms of fidelity to the respective films. And it is precisely for these reasons that the announcement by EA about the creation of a slash'em up inspired by the first two films of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings has made many fans jump. Fortunately, however, this time the humble tradition was not respected at all...", "date": "2003-05-07", "grade": null}
