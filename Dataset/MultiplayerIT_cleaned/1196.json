Starting from the single game, we discover that in addition to the free construction of tracks and practice on the various tracks downloaded, we have a main mode in which we will have to unlock all 24 tracks present in the game ~step by step~, completing the tracks in a time pre-established limit rather within everyone's reach. However, if we want to accumulate points for the purchase of particular pieces in the editor, we will have to earn as many gold medals as possible (which are awarded to us in much less time) and the undertaking will not always be easy. If we are so good at winning all the gold medals, three secret tracks will also be unlocked. Next we find the ~puzzle~ mode in which the two components of the game (build & play) merge. In a sort of scheme that closely resembles the ancient Pipemania (does anyone still remember it?) we will have to build from scratch or complete an existing track with a limited number and type of pieces and then test it in person to see if it will be practicable from 'start to finish (also passing through the pre-established checkpoints). If the first schemes present will be very elementary, the level of difficulty increases in a very short time, making Trackmania also a puzzle game of interesting caliber. The last expected mode, called survival, sees us busy beating the three antagonists moved by artificial intelligence in the tracks already known previously. We will never be allowed to retire or finish in fourth place under penalty of the end of the match. If, on the other hand, we arrive in front of the whole we will be given the benefit of crossing a track without even running along it. Or well accompanied When you connect to the network, in a very short time, you will understand that the single game is just an introduction to multiplayer (also possible via LAN). Also in this case there are three game modes: ~laps~ (whoever is best positioned in the total of the planned ~vueltas~ wins), ~time trial~ (in a given amount of time, we will try to improve our performance on the track and better than the opponents) and ~teams~ (like ~giri~ but the players are randomly divided into two teams and the points are added up to decide the winner). Only by playing it can you understand how hypnotic Trackmania is in company: as in Formula 1 trials, after completing what you thought was the ride of your life, you will see yourself pass by one, two, three opponents and then you will dive headlong into the whirlwind of chicanes to offer a more convincing test hoping that the total time available doesn't run out first. And the possibility of playing on a basically infinite number of tracks helps to make the experience almost endless. Perfection (doesn't) exist After more than 6,000 characters of elegiac praise for Trackmania, it's time to also highlight some of the limitations of Nadeo's production which, however, do not affect its excellence. If one can also overlook the very low longevity of single-player modes, given that we can consider them as a sort of training for multiplayer, the first aspect that is not completely convincing is the replay: it is true that it presents many tools to aesthetically optimize your recorded performances , but at the same time suffers from the total lack of immediate direction capable of giving the action a cinematic appeal. I wasn't asking for something of the same level as the psychedelic filters present in GT3 but at least a quick, engaging and above all automatic display. Small imperfections can also be seen in the editor which, although sensationally flexible and capable of incredible results, lacks a certain freedom in displaying the track. Or well accompanied Moving on to the technical aspect, we must immediately applaud a graphics engine that is not too demanding in terms of hardware resources, capable of lending itself to the needs of the editor and fluid enough to associate a game of Trackmania with a ride on the highest roller coaster in the world . On the other hand, however, it is quite easy to notice truly spartan textures and cars whose polygonal models are rather squared. Not infrequent even real bugs with cars driven by other human players in multiplayer who enter the asphalt and the like but which in any case do not affect our performance but only our aesthetic sense ... Even under the point of from a sound point of view, the work done was really minimal: very few effects, three pieces of music (one for each level), some jingles at the end and beginning of the run and a main track in the main menu that quickly gets on your nerves for a bass line performed by a instrument with excessively distorted sound.If there was Achilles' heel to be found in Trackmania, it is surely to be found in the audio component If there was Achilles' heel to be found in Trackmania, it is surely to be located in the audio component Comment At the cost of exposing myself to predictable criticism, I cannot hide my more than enthusiastic judgment on Trackmania, a title that has already been raging all over the world for months and which arrives in Italy only now thanks to the intervention of Koch Media given the total disinterest on the part of other operators in the sector. After having drawn on so many hours of sleep to play Nadeo's work, I am truly incomprehensible the lack of attention to the French cult which, in addition to having gathered many fans, as well as the enthusiastic comments of specialized critics (with very few dissenting voices), has also received many awards and recognitions of various kinds in every corner of the world. The elements of alchemy are really simple: immediate and overwhelming gameplay (seasoned with a pinch of sadism on the part of the programmers), track editor and network sharing of tracks that make it virtually infinite, engaging multiplayer and a massive dose of roller coaster speed. The result is the true spiritual heir of Micromachines, the typical title from ~the next is the last~ and instead it will never be. It's the night game in front of the monitor but also ideal for that free quarter of an hour between one commitment and another. Trackmania is not free from defects starting from the absolutely rejected sound to move on to a rather spartan aesthetic and the questionable lack of interaction between cars (but it was the only way to balance the game appropriately) which could make you turn up your nose to someone. But the elements just exposed do not question the excellence of Made in France production. And let's hope that the already announced sequel Sunrise (watch the movie in our file area to be amazed) not as late as Trackmania did We don't deserve it! Pros: Overwhelming gameplay Fantastic track editor Potentially infinite Cons: Audio to be reviewed Graphically spartan The lack of interaction between cars could dissatisfy some The first necessary thing to do in this review is to thank Koch Media who fortunately had the good intuition to grab the distribution rights for Trackmania in Italy, filling an inexplicable void. Throughout the rest of the world, the title programmed by Nadeo has already become a real cult on the net for some months but for us poor ~white-red-green~, the game only materialized in stores in September 2004. The second dutiful thing to do in this review is to anticipate the final comment: Trackmania is a title worthy of all the praises I have available in my vocabulary, the true heir of Micromachines in the field of racing games of a certain genre that reaches peaks of excellence and variety not even touched by Mashed or R.C. cars. And now let's try to put in order the many thoughts that are to be exposed in this review. In case it's not already clear enough from the images, I announce that Trackmania is a blatantly arcade racing game but not only. It is true that the driving setting is really immediate and pleasant, regardless of any simulation ambitions. But one cannot remain almost enraptured by the dynamics with which the very simple interaction of the commands (via keyboard, pad or steering wheel) manifests itself on the screen: the minute machines react so immediately even when they are in flight and so easily let themselves be dominated by the player which make the gameplay of Trackmania something very close to the infamous term ~Stylish~. There is always a few tenths of a second to shave off, finding the most advantageous trajectory without leaving the course (which happens very easily). It's the classic game of ~the next is the last~ and instead it will never be. It is the title for a night in front of the monitor but also ideal for that free quarter of an hour between one commitment and another. It is simplicity that becomes gameplay with an excellent dose of spectacularity that does not hurt at all. There is always a few tenths of a second to shave off, finding the most advantageous trajectory without leaving the course. It's the classic game of ~the next is the last~ and instead it will never be In Trackmania the challenge is mainly against oneself and the more or less hidden pitfalls of the circuits since the presence of the car controlled by the CPU (but also by the other players in multiplayer) does not lead to a Micromachines-style interaction with possible races based on door and pushed towards the cliffs. If the thing, at first blush, could preoccup someone, I can tell you that the choice of programmers was the right one since the frenzy and speed of the challenges would not have allowed our reflexes to properly manage even the dirty game of the opponents. The backgrounds of our crazy races are three: in the desert where American muscle cars give their best in terms of speed, loop-the-loops and jumps from exaggerated trampolines, to then move on to the arctic ice where grip on the road is the main problem (there is no shortage of races in which we will do nothing but slide for hundreds of metres) and finally to the English grass fields where mega-modified similar Renault 5s will prove to be very fast and agile but at the same time not very reliable in terms of road holding and control after the spectacular jumps. Building is my profession But the real peculiarity of Nadeo's work and which has led it to become a real point of reference on the net is certainly the track editor. With very few clicks of the mouse (or with the same number of keystrokes) it will be possible to build customized circuits worthy of the best dreams (or worst nightmares) of the urban planner in you: tunnels, trampolines, impossible curves, chicanes, banked and much more. Let me paraphrase the famous quote from Blade Runner: in multiplayer I've seen tracks that you non-Trackmania players can't even imagine. The beauty is that once tested (you can do it at any time of your construction work), you can also make these tracks available on the net, creating a sort of virtually infinite exchange between enthusiasts and this is Trackmania's real plus. Think that it will also be possible to directly download the tracks that you will play in multiplayer and have them available for single play or edit them as you wish. As you can understand an almost infinite circle of mods that elevates the longevity of the title to Himalayan peaks.", "date": "2004-10-08", "grade": null}
