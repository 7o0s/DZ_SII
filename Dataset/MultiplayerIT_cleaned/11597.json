{"name": "Metal Gear Acid", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-acid_a.html", "text": "As often happens, the success of the most popular video games is ~ridden~ to create something new and different. This is precisely the case with Metal Gear Acid, released for PSP in 2005. Unlike Metal Gear Solid, this new Konami title puts the player in command of Snake within missions that are very similar to puzzles to solve, in which you have to reach certain objectives relying only on the cards at our disposal. In fact, every turn we will be assigned six cards and we will have to choose one to move, attack or perform other actions. The rounds are divided into two phases, so we will be able to do two things in a row and the same goes for the opponents positioned within the stages. From the start screen you can try your hand at a detailed tutorial (which never as in this case is it advisable to face in full), start a quick game or face the sequence of missions available. Each is introduced by some text instructions provided to us by our commander, who indicates the objectives to be achieved in order to move on to the next stage. Having said that, it will only be up to us to be able to bring home the result, solving the puzzles that we will face thanks to some suggestions, especially at the beginning, a little after having learned well how our character moves. At each turn we will have to choose one of the six cards available and ~play~ it in the way we deem most appropriate. There are four different types: movement cards, attack cards, defense cards, and equipment cards. Each can be used for its own specific purpose, or converted into a movement card (an action that remains fundamental, of course): depending on the value of the card, we will see a more or less high number of ~boxes~ appear that represent our possibility of movement, so we will use the keys on the phone to take Snake where we want. At any time we can press the 0 key, then explore the whole level and understand what is the viewing angle of the enemies. The stealth element, in fact, is not only present but is also predominant in the game mechanics of Metal Gear Acid: very often we will find ourselves having to cross guarded locations, and to succeed in the enterprise we will be able to attract the attention of the opponents to make them momentarily leave the post (knocking against a wall, for example). The use of weapons is also regulated by turns and cards, as well as by the characteristics of the weapon itself: a rifle will have greater power and range than a pistol, as it obviously is, but in any case we will have to approach a lot to our target and hit it in two stages to eliminate it permanently. The game is available in a classic, two-dimensional, and a 3D version. We only had the chance to try the first one, which comes with discrete and functional graphics for the action, even if it's far from spectacular. Snake boasts a good design and a good number of animations, while his opponents can count on much lower numbers. The final result is discreet, with somewhat repetitive locations especially for the use of colours. An almost similar discourse for the sound sector, with some well-made but far from unforgettable music. The control system sees the use of the numeric keyboard for the selection of cards and the movement of Snake, with the 5 key for action and the 0 key, as mentioned, to explore the stage before making any move.
