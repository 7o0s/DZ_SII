{"name": "Out There: Omega The Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/out-there-omega-the-alliance-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Space travel is a sort of videogame topos, linked to the archetypes of this entertainment system since the 70s. If it could once have been an ideal way out to build stylized settings and stage a threat to be defeated with minimalist game solutions, now it has become the ideal place to unleash the possibilities of unlimited exploration also given by new technologies and new procedural-based development systems, which allow for an unlimited extension of virtual worlds. However, there are also those who have decided to use these themes to give them a profoundly different representation from the highly technological one of certain simulations, recovering older game styles and lowering them into new and hybrid forms. The use of the roguelike scheme has proved to be particularly apt for staging the risk and wonder of space travel, as the now famous FTL: Faster Than Light has amply demonstrated, from which Out There: Omega The Alliance clearly draws inspiration, as we see in this review. The game is an updated version of Out There which was previously released on iOS and Android platforms. The story is deliberately poorly defined, focused on a few essential points but with a development that changes according to the journey we choose to undertake at each game, which is thus detached from the previous one as a truly different experience, albeit following a path common. The protagonist is an anonymous astronaut who awakens from cryogenic sleep and finds himself, instead of on Jupiter's familiar satellite Ganymede, in deepest space, due to some anomaly in the navigation systems. Shortly after waking up, he meets an alien structure from which he receives a new technology that allows for interstellar travel at considerable speed and from there his mission to return to Earth begins, even if various events occur along the way that introduce further possible objectives . On his journey, the astronaut often finds himself in contact with various alien species, whether friendly or not, within a narrative that evidently invests his journey with a deeper meaning than the simple attempt to return home, finding himself inside an occult web of connections between different space civilizations. It is a particularly challenging game that hides different endings, which can often be frustrating and unfair, yet also irresistible, thanks to a clever mix of ingredients and a charming atmosphere. On Nintendo Switch it also acquires the advantage of portability (which was then an original element in its first incarnation for iOS), associated with the comfort of a double interface that allows you to play with both the touch screen and the traditional controls. Explore, collect and manage Within a star map, we find ourselves choosing the systems to visit trying to follow the route towards one of the established objectives, bearing in mind that only vague indications can be obtained on the various stages to touch. Each shift from one system to another costs fuel and oxygen, while any accidents result in damage to the ship's hull. We can then say that everything revolves around the management of three primary needs for the survival of the protagonist: fuel, oxygen and hull resistance. The player's action must be based around the maintenance of these three elements in good condition, as well as trying to follow a vague route towards the set objective. This involves a careful calculation of the movements to be made and the actions to be taken to better manage resources, but to think that everything is based only on a meticulous strategic evaluation of the moves would not be correct. As it should be in a travel simulation at the edge of the universe between unknown systems, chance has an enormous weight in the development of events, often resulting unfair but reproducing in a plausible way the climate of constant uncertainty and danger that characterizes the space travel to unknown portions of the cosmos. The actions to be performed are practically always the same, yet particular situations are encountered from time to time with each new game. The basic interactions concern the drilling of rocky planets in search of the various materials useful for the maintenance of the ship and the construction of new technologies, the launch of probes on gaseous planets for the recovery of fuel or the landing on planets with a breathable atmosphere for meet new alien species, with which to establish some form of contact. In addition to the strategic management of resources, in many cases we find ourselves having to make choices or laughSolve some puzzles, presented in the style of text adventures, which can lead to new discoveries and obtaining further bonus materials or blueprints for new technologies to be applied to the ship. Gravitational attraction The gameplay basically boils down to this limited number of actions, but the amount of variables in terms of technologies to be discovered, built and installed on the ship to amplify the exploration possibilities, the random events that emerge upon arrival in each new system and the possibility of boarding and using new ships are all elements that manage to inject the right amount of movement and variations on the theme, always keeping the interest in the game high. In the numerous restarts that we will be forced to make, some runs will be practically doomed from the beginning by a chain of negative events that can be fatal and this can increase the sense of frustration in a game that already allows a very small margin of error for the survival. Yet the magic of Out There: Omega The Alliance lies precisely in being able not to be abandoned, even after yet another bad end due to fuel, oxygen or damage to the hull. There is obviously the displeasure of seeing a journey concluded prematurely which perhaps we had managed to extend in an optimal manner with careful management or a series of particularly fortunate events, but also in the face of more unjust endings, because perhaps caused more by the case that from actual errors by the player, it is difficult not to press the key and immediately start a new game. The speed with which we return to the heart of the action obviously has to do with the ease with which we find ourselves projected again on a new journey, but it is also the random development of events that drives us to always try new businesses. Within a roguelike system that could be dispersive, the introduction of unlockable objectives and the possibility of obtaining additional ships that can be selected from the beginning, once certain targets have been reached, at least manage to provide goals, creating a certain sense of progression among the numerous experiences that can be faced from game to game. Interactive cartoon Representing an infinite space with few means available is never an easy task and the solution adopted by the French team Mi-Clos Studio, with the support of Raw Fury, is particularly successful: the game looks like a sort of interactive comic, complete with typical lettering and hand-drawn illustrations that blend with the three-dimensional elements and effects applied in a mixed solution of excellent impact. The classic Weird Tales sci-fi aspect manages to infuse a certain charisma into Out There: Omega The Alliance, which on this front easily surpasses other similar exponents such as the aforementioned FTL, more based on a basic 2D representation. On the other hand, they are titles that are also presented in a different way: unlike others, this game tries to propose a certain narrative basis, albeit fragmented and vague as a story can be that must be told in so many different ways and the his universe therefore needs a strong characterization, excellently found in this particular graphic style. The absence of fighting does not make the Out There universe less threatening, which relies on other aspects to instill fear, further enhancing the mystery of the journey among the wonders of discovery and the drastic consequences of wrong choices or random accidents. Also in this sense, the choice of a sci-fi comic style, combined with the atmospheric soundtrack, enhance this sense of suspension between the two extremes. It is obviously a simple representation, but it is also quite clear considering the minimum dimensions of the interface and the elements to be displayed on the screen, especially when using the Nintendo Switch in a portable version. As for the adaptation on the console in question, the possibility of using the touch screen and the traditional controls at the same time in portable mode represents an extra convenience, given that the game was born on mobile devices and is particularly enjoyable in this version, even if the extreme smallness of some on-screen objects and texts could be annoying. The game is translated into various languages but unfortunately not into Italian.", "date": "2019-04-17", "grade": "8.0"}
