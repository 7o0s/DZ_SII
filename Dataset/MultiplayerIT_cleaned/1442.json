{"name": "Gran Turismo 4 Prologue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gran-turismo-4-prologue.html", "text": "A bittersweet dish The appetizer offered by Polyphony for its loyal fans is basically divided into 2 sections, called respectively Arcade Mode and School Mode. The latter consists of a series of tests structured in a very similar way to the ~licenses~ that we got to know with the previous episodes; it is therefore mostly a question of covering short stretches of track, rarely complete laps, with a pre-established car and trying to complete the route within a set time. Although the formula is tested, or precisely because of this, the School Mode struggles to really entertain the player, in reality spurred almost exclusively by the idea of unlocking, with one's successes, the cars used in the individual challenges. The reason is simple: the buyer of GT4 Prologue, i.e. the one who deprives himself of an abundant thirty euros for an import demo, is in the vast majority of cases a lover of the series, who can hardly find the idea of learning from zero the most basic driving techniques aboard a 1.4 van unable to reach 100 per hour. Of course, this is an example, and as you continue through the various tests, you get behind the wheel of ever more competitive and faster cars; but we still remain doubtful about the actual rate of fun that this section is able to provide. Fortunately different speech for the Arcade Mode, which is certainly the mode to which everyone will turn once the tedious phase of unlocking the entire fleet of machines is completed. In this case, in fact, the possibility is finally offered to demonstrate all one's driving skills, within 5 completely new tracks. In detail, these are two racetracks, Tsukuba Circuit and Fuji Speedway, the urban route of New York and the Italian Citta di Aria; to these must be added a rally circuit, or that Grand Canyon that made the jaws open during the first presentations of the game. As far as the first two are concerned, a good track design faces a bleak poverty of trackside details, especially in the case of Fuji Speedway which in fact results in a snake of asphalt immersed in the green of the surrounding hills. Extremely different speech as regards the other three routes, certainly of greater visual impact and capable of better expressing the indisputable talent of Japanese graphics. New York is a veritable orgy of details, with huge buildings perfectly reproduced and full of advertising signs; even more satisfying is Citt di Aria, set in the very narrow alleys of a beautifully recreated city in the Umbrian hills. Excellent Grand Canyon, probably the most technically beautiful course of the GT4 Prologue roster and able to offer absolutely breathtaking views. For a choice that demonstrates the absolutely work-in-progress level of Polyphony production, the presence of opponents is not possible by competing on Citt di Aria and Grand Canyon. In reality however, in the Sony production demo the presence or absence of CPU-controlled pilots is resolved only in an aesthetic quirk or little more, given their total and absolute inadequacy in representing a real element of challenge. As evidence of what has been said, it is enough to know that at the highest level of difficulty among the three present, the writer gave 5 seconds of gap to the first of the pursuers at the end of a first lap that was anything but perfect. The hope, but we should say the certainty given the current situation, is that Polyphony has implemented largely incomplete artificial intelligence routines and far from those destined to be part of the title destined to be released in stores. A Skyline in the garage So what remains, besides the possibility of admiring the landscape? Fortunately, GT4 Prologue allows you to touch the novelties in physics and car control, which is certainly not a small factor. The Japanese programmers have evidently tried to shift the center of gravity of their effort slightly more towards simulation; in fact, already from this demo it is possible to denote a greater heaviness of the cars, realistically less reactive to the player's orders and subject to boarding and loss of stability following too abrupt maneuvers. You therefore finally have the sensation of having to work harder to obtain perfect control of the vehicle, taking into account additional factors such as inertia and giving greater importance to the correct use of the accelerator and brake. In this sense, the impossibility of using the right analogue lever for these two commands leaves at least dumbfounded, forcingthus having to readjust to the less precise and comfortable keys of the pad. The search for greater realism in this aspect unfortunately does not correspond to a similar revision of the collision system: impacts against the settings and objects on the edge of the track result in an immediate stop of the car as in the past, while it is still possible to use the opposing cars as banks to your advantage. In this sense, the attempt to insert a penalty system is the laziest and most painless choice to avoid reprogramming an aspect that is certainly not excellent in the series. In summary, large impacts against the setting or opponents cause a limitation of the car's speed, forced to continue at 50 km/h for 10 whole seconds. Let's go back to the graphic discourse, touched upon previously: GT4 Prologue is at the same time a source of excellent impressions together with other decidedly less positive ones. We have already talked about the fluctuating quality of detail on the 5 routes present; unfortunately an engine that is hopefully not yet definitive often offers the side to obvious aliasing and pop-up phenomena, the latter even more marked using the new view introduced by the programmers. Yes, because in addition to the classic first-person view and the external one, Polyphony has introduced a third one, always external, even higher up and capable of offering greater visibility of the track. Unfortunately the result is far from satisfactory, since from this perspective the car remains motionless in the center of the screen, and the setting rotates in relation to the commands given with a very unsatisfying result both from an aesthetic point of view and from a the practical one. Also disappointing is the lack of streaks, scuffs or marks on the asphalt as cars pass, as well as ruts in the meadows following powerful off-piste accelerations. Moving on to the positive aspects, it must be said that GT4 Prologue certainly remains a visual spectacle, and it would be difficult for it to be otherwise given the results obtained from the previous chapters. In reality, this appetizer of the fourth chapter differs only slightly from GT3, confirming the incredible optimization work done by Polyphony on the Ps2 hardware at the time of the latter's launch. The most evident step forward is undoubtedly represented by the public, which remained in 2D but is now animated in a rather credible way and capable of offering a good overall effect; moreover, in rallies, one is literally overwhelmed by many spectators on the edge of the track, with some daredevils waiting for our arrival in the middle of the track to take a photo and then flee like hell. The modeling of the cars is impeccable, and has always been among the real strengths of the series: the fifty or so cars present are in all respects very faithful counterparts of the real versions, with a very high level of detail capable of leaving one speechless, especially during the now inevitable replays. On the other hand, the frame rate is granite, capable of always returning perfect fluidity. Finally the sound, which accompanies certainly not unforgettable songs with sound effects on the contrary at the top of the category, especially as regards the roar of the engines. COMMENT In conclusion, therefore, GT4 Prologue struggles not to appear as a commercial operation aimed at monetizing on the basis of the hype that surrounds each new chapter of the series: the evident largely incomplete stage of many aspects, the general lack of ideas of real interest and a structure with little overall appeal make the Polyphony demo a ~taste~ that would have had a reason to exist only as a gift, perhaps aimed at rewarding the millions of people who made the series the best-selling we all know. Among the greatest prides of every Sony console owner, first with Psone and then with Ps2, there has always been the possibility of exclusively enjoying the splendid Gran Turismo series made in Polyphony Digital, a true milestone of the automotive genre. The transition from the 32-bit console to the black monolith brought with it a painful - due to delays - but exciting third chapter, followed by the pleasant arcade excursus of Tokyo-Geneva; as it is obvious that it is, from that moment the wait for the fourth episode began, the last destined to appear on Ps2 and therefore hopefully able to take full advantage of its hardware potential. While waiting for the full version, scheduled for spring, the Japanese programmers had the bold idea of launching a paid demo on the market, intended to temporarily appease the hunger of enthusiasts.i and give way to touch the differences compared to the previous version. All this responds to the name of GT4 Prologue.", "date": "2003-12-20", "grade": null}
