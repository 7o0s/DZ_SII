{"name": "Genji: Dawn of the Samurai", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/genji-dawn-of-the-samurai.html", "text": "Almost God-ly A burden that every action-game on PlayStation 2 will have to bear by now, is the willy-nilly confrontation with the titanic God of War. In this case, Genji is decidedly close to the superlative quality of the Sony title, ultimately being undermined by its own graphic arrogance. The environments in Genji are falsely three-dimensional, as in Onimusha the polygonal models of the protagonist and his opponents fight in pre-rendered environments, but of enormous visual quality: various, extremely detailed and richly animated, the locations are a joy to behold and make every stage a pleasant discovery. The same goes for the polygonal models, even if it is clear right from the start that the utmost importance has been given to Yoshitsune: built with more polygons, and dressed in the most graphically elaborate armor in the game (in Genji the armor and weapons found or worn, once equipped, they are visible and differentiated), our hero also enjoys a greater and more fluid number of animations, which clashes a bit with the woody and exaggeratedly heavy ones of Benkei, who seems so bound to the role of speck absolutely secondary that the supporting actors of the protagonists of Onimusha 2 and Onimusha 3 had already had. The price to pay for the graphic orgy through which Genji presents itself is a rather annoying drop in the frame rate which occurs above all when facing more than two or three enemies at a time, or on the occasion of the most spectacular boss-fights: this involuntary slow motion can be hidden by the Kamui, but still remains visible and a cause for disappointment. The technical sector, already excellent, is however enhanced in particular by the sound side: the music is of the highest quality, typically Japanese and absolutely suitable for every moment of the action, be it a battle or a cutscene; on the other hand the dubbing is striking for the choice of keeping the Japanese dialogues, providing English subtitles, in order to maintain a sort of realistic ~atmosphere~: perhaps not a completely acceptable choice, but certainly effective. Practically programmed by a rib of Capcom, Okamoto's Game Republic team, Genji is inspired by Onimusha in an almost embarrassing way. Feudal Japan, a perfidious tyranny, supernatural adversaries, magical powers, duels with white weapons... all amalgamated in a short action-game with a linear and specious plot: seven hundred years ago, the powerful Heishi family lorded it over Japan, in possession of the arcane stones known as Amahagane, capable of granting those who hold them superhuman powers; obviously the Heishi family, corrupted by the power of the stones, sets the country on fire in search of other Amahagane that can allow it to obtain ever greater power, and fate wants our young protagonist to own one of these magical crystals. As Yoshitsune, we will therefore have to travel in search of other Amahaganes before the Heishi can get their greedy hands on them, in order to obtain in turn such power as to put an end to the Heishi's dominion once and for all. At our side, the mighty monk Benkei; in our hand, our trusty katana... While not worthy of sacred monsters such as God of War or Onimusha, Genji is an excellent but unfortunately repetitive action-game that will certainly satisfy fans of the Capcom fantasy-medieval trilogy in particular. The intriguing play mechanics are the fulcrum of a title that is perhaps too interrupted by narrative sequences that dampen its rhythm, making it even shorter than it already is: the balance between action and narration is therefore poorly respected, and the plot is not not particularly compelling, though certainly valid. The technical sector is excellent, however the frequent drops in the frame-rate, especially in such a title, are decidedly unpleasant. However the overall excellent visual quality and fantastic soundtrack manage to make up for it. An appreciable start to a saga that will see its sequel appear on the future Playstation 3. Pros Graphically excellent Very good soundtrack Addictive gameplay... Cons ... but extremely repetitive Frequent frame-rate drops Far too short Slice'n'Dice Despite the semblance of an RPG that Genji manages to assume in several situations, starting with the gain of experience points that allows the level-up of our two heroes and the consequent improvement of their psycho-physical attributes, we must not be deceived: Genji is a raw action-game, where the story is nothing more than an intrusive pretext that justifies the indiscriminate slicing of dozens of enemies. Going from one stage to another through a sort of ~mappa~, the player can choose whether to face certain missions in the role of Yoshitsune or Benkei, aware that despite the minimal gameplay differences, the selection of one or the other character will influence the complete exploration of a location: sometimes the force brute of Benkei can break through doors and walls, for example.The possibility of choosing your own hero from stage to stage, however, has almost no effect on the gameplay, as the game and combat system remains the same: a key assigned to single or repeated attack, a button for more powerful blows and so on, with the possibility of performing simple combinations against the unfortunate enemies. Is that all? Well, no. Obviously the similarities with Onimusha continue, in the form of the Kamui: defeating the various enemies, a special bar will load ideally connected to the Amahagane which, once filled, will allow you to activate the Kamui, or a sort of slow-motion mode in which for each attack animation of an enemy we will be able to match a devastating and unstoppable counterattack, in many cases simply lethal. The various stages therefore become an escalation of fights aimed at filling the Kamui bar, which once activated will transform the rest of the action into a slow ballet of death, which in the case of the spectacular bosses will also be the only way to escape unscathed from the battle. As exciting and spectacular as it is, Kamui is the only thing that makes Genji unique, and its obsessive repetitiveness from stage to stage, often interrupted by non-interactive narrative sequences of dubious interest, makes the use of the Game Republic team's project a to say the least monotonous, also considering the small duration of the adventure.", "date": "2005-12-22", "grade": null}
