There were bloody battles for the domination of the earth, the forces of good came to a happy victory by sealing the evil in a parallel dimension, alive in a timeless prison. Months, years and centuries passed, people forgot their own history handing it down as a baseless legend, they forgot the smell of the sea and the ancient incarnations of evil, the continents detached definitively from the ground floating in the air, the new world era of the sky, inhabited by populations with wings. And it is precisely here that the story of Kalas begins, in a small forest near his lands, the pact with a spirit guide and the unawareness of a world to be saved. The game essentially starts from here, a short CG preamble introduces us to the story of this strange floating world, a boy who dreams and remembers, a series of flashbacks, the meeting and pact with the spirit, the death of his grandfather and of his little brother, dark and light again, the boy wakes up in a small medical clinic in the town of Cebelrai on the continent of Sadal Suud. Kalas - this is the boy's name - was found passed out in the forest, attacked by monsters far more powerful than him. From the dialogue with the doctor we learn that he comes from another continent, that he was born without a wing (replaced with a mechanic made by his grandfather), that his relatives are dead and that he is seeking revenge. It is precisely in this place that his adventure will begin by meeting Xelha, a girl in search of the End Magnus, magical cards that will help her preserve the world from a war that has been lurking for too long. The characters that can be used during the adventure will increase up to six, the two main ones will be joined by Gibari, Lyude, Mizuti and Savyna all committed to countering the armies of the evil emperor Geldoblame to prevent him from coming into possession of all five End magnus necessary to awaken the god of destruction: Malpercio. The world represented by Baten Kaitos cannot be visited completely but is represented by a series of fixed screen locations, the movement of the character from one place to another is schematized through a pre-established path from point A to point B without the possibility of random encounters with monsters along the way, the view is external to the continent with a series of detailed miniatures representing the different places that can be visited (every time a location is completed it will no longer be necessary to cross it in detail but it will be possible to simply pass over it from the general view of the continent). The movement between realms is possible thanks to large airships transported by bizarre flying animals that literally tow the rooms used for people. The first approach with each new continent will in fact be the naval port, the place from which our exploration of the place will always start again. [C] Awakening in the village of Cebelrai The navigation map on the continent The means of transport [/C] Draw your Magnus Card If until now Baten Kaitos could have seemed like a rather common role-playing game (fantasy setting, a boy's revenge, a world to save, ...) the judgment is literally reversed when you are preparing to face the first battle. The clashes are completely based on the use of magnus cards, of which there are more than a thousand different specimens and they represent everything we will need to defeat the enemies that appear in front of us. The battle phase represents perhaps the most beautiful and most complicated point of this game as it takes place on different tactical levels; first of all it must be said that there are basically four different categories of cards: elemental attack, physical attack, defense and item. Each character will have a deck of cards that can be equipped (whose capacity will increase as the level increases) with which you will have to get by during the fight, the cards visible and usable at the beginning of the game will be four per turn, the player will then have to establish in a fairly quick time the strategy to be used by choosing a series of cards for an attack or healing combo. In the opponent's turn you will not have to watch but you will have to fight back using one or more defense cards, the enemies will often attack with a series of blows (during the game you will also fight against bosses with 8-hit combos) and for each blow delivered we will be called to respond with a defensive card that will limit the damage. The combat system was previously called ~layered~ for a simple reason: if you want to do a lot of damage or defendrsi really well another couple of tactical tricks will be required of the player. First of all the elemental plots, if in carrying out a combo a fire card is chosen and then a water one, the comparative damage of the magic will tend to cancel out or be greatly diminished, giving a practical example: if in a combo with a card of fire you get a damage of 300 and with the next one of water one of 250 the final damage to the enemy will be only fifty points or the subtraction of the greater elemental damage with the lesser one. There are six elements in this couples game: water and fire, time and wind, light and darkness. A very interesting feature of the battle will be added to this first level of attention, on each card you will find numbers stamped on the upper corner, these numbers will be the main door of the greatest damage inflicted in battle, all you need to do is nothing else than putting the numbers of the cards in ascending or descending order while you are attacking or defending yourself, in this way at the end of the turn an extra percentage will be assigned which will either increase the value of the damage inflicted or decrease the one suffered. Another simplified version of this special ~filotto~ is the one that assigns smaller percentages in case of paired cards, the pairing of two or more cards with the same number. Proceeding with the levels, increasing your deck and your set of cards visible in combat, it will also be possible to find yourself making scalar combos from 1 to 9 with incredible damage to enemies. The third and final level of combat is represented by special combos. Before explaining what they consist of, it is good to make a small digression to explain the true nature of Magnus cards. To make it short and direct: the magnus cards represent the essence of objects, the soul of things and elements, there will be fish cards, plants, objects, weapons, books, all these things as ~alive~ will be the subject of evolutions and deteriorations, it may happen that the card depicting an unripe bunch of bananas can initially serve as an attack card and then change to a curative function as soon as the bananas ripen, the fresh and curative fish will become rotten and poisonous and so on . Having said this considering the representation of the card as real, by performing special combos it will be possible to modify the cards themselves or create new ones, from the union of a normal tuna fillet and fire you will get grilled fish, a card with a well curative value taller than its previous form. It will be at the total discretion of the player to try combos between the almost infinite Magnus cards that will be found during the adventure. One of the peculiarities of the game is represented by the only way to make money: by taking pictures. In the deck of basic cards that we will find equipped in Kalas there will also be a camera card, this card will be possible to use it without any constraints in the middle of an attack combo to be able to take a photo of the enemy and then go and sell it in the shop. The photos will need about ten real minutes to fully develop and acquire vivid colors. However, if you try to photograph a too fast enemy you will run the risk of seeing the photo faded and practically unsellable, for this reason there are three different types of camera-cards each with different characteristics and which will allow a better focus to transform the gamer in rich monster photographer. Strongly unrelated to battle but inevitably linked to the use of cards are the empty Magnus. These are normal Magnus cards that the player will be able to fill with the essence of some key objects scattered throughout the game, for many that will prove completely useless there will be some essential ones that will allow you to progress throughout the story, unlock sub-quests and to obtain special magnus cards. The world of clouds The graphic sector marks a strong dichotomy, however beautiful and inspired the locations of the game are, the character design seems so inadequate. The rendering of the worlds of Baten Kaitos has been studied down to the smallest details and it shows, tangible clouds that cross the cities, reflective pavements, festive cities, gingerbread houses and forgotten gardens, ordeals of colors and NPCs, given the illustrious participations in this game it will not be difficult for us to have deja-vu from Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy VIII, the settings are certainly among the most inspired of this generation. For character design the situation is slightly different, for some that seem to come straight out of a Miyazaki cartoon the others get lost in an aura of anonymity, toosomewhat baroque in their sumptuous and elaborate dresses (sometimes so sumptuous as to be even cut into the diagol-icon), some of the main characters seem more out of Soul Calibur than part of an RPG (Gibari above all). The sound sector suffers from the same dichotomy, the music is beautiful and inspired (that of the sadal suud forest with the female choirs simply giving goosebumps) the dubbing of the characters is bad. A few well-chosen voices, pathos that borders on earth, the voice actors read but don't live even a word and it's a shame because the game is really very talked about and could have been a weapon. If you hadn't understood it, it must be reiterated: Baten Kaitos is undoubtedly a good game. There has always been talk of the lack of role-playing games for the Nintendo console, but at this point it is necessary to dust off the concept of ~few but good~. One of the most interesting combat interfaces of recent years is grafted onto an intriguing story, which thus gives life to a long-lived, deep, tactical and difficult game. The only blemishes are the character making (someone will surely like them) and the poor voice acting. Ultimately the second RPG on the cube, and the second must-have for fans of the genre and not. Pros: Innovative combat system Engaging story with twists Dreamlike environments Cons: Inappropriate character design Almost amateurish voice acting Some fights are absolutely frustrating Whenever a new RPG for the Gamecube is announced, it is always seen as a small event. When the announcement of the rpg in question is accompanied by the name of a highly relevant software house, then the scope of the event increases until it leads to the most sinister and impatient expectation of a gamer. Taking the place of the category, after the excellent Tales of Symphonia, is another game produced by Namco and developed by Monolith (remembered by most for Xenogears, one of the best role-playing games of the last generation) called Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean.", "date": "2005-04-11", "grade": null}
