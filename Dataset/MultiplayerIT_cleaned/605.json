{"name": "Toca Race Driver 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toca-race-driver-9.html", "text": "Long live quantity As in past editions, the Codemasters programmers have decided not to skimp on the amount of cars and competitions, with the result of offering the player an impressive number of different specialties and usable vehicles. The latter in particular cover a wide range of categories, ranging from pure GT-style cars to sedans, from utility cars to Formula 1, from open wheels to rally cars and so on, even contemplating some Bigfoot; unless you are a convinced enthusiast of Jeep Gaucho or threshing machines, therefore, finding the kind of favorite car in Race Driver 3 is highly probable for anyone. The available modes are called ~World Tour~, ~Career~ and ~Simulation Mode~. As in past editions, World Tour is a sort of ~story mode~, a springboard that sees our digital alter-ego try his luck in the difficult world of racing. World Tour includes a large number of different specialties, which starting from a base of two (the Clio single-make championship and the lightweight Global GT championship) gradually expand, hand in hand with the player's progress in climbing the rankings. In support of the pilot, the coach is back more active than ever, a virtual character created from nothing that has the function of supporting the user during the World Tour adventure. World Tour is a sort of ~story mode~ that sees our digital alter-ego try his luck in the difficult world of racing Long live quantity From the first steps, through the numerous interlude scenes in full-motion video, the funny guy illustrates the progress made or the mistakes made, suggesting new strategies. Before each race it will be possible to adjust various car parameters (wings, transmission, anti-roll bars, brakes, vehicle height from the ground, suspensions, toe and camber, etc.) and even consult the track telemetry. The Career mode instead allows you to choose a particular race category and always compete in that, embarking on a real career. ~Career~ is particularly appreciated by those who consider World Tour too fragmentary and confusing (continuously changing the type of vehicle and driving style may not please everyone). ~Simulation Mode~ includes several sub-modes, namely ~Free Race~, ~Time Trial~, ~Multiplayer~ (split screen), and the various online modes which vary slightly from version to version (those for Xbox are the best). But come on, enough talk, let's get on the track. Livin' la vida TOCA When you want to package a product that boasts a sufficient dose of realism but which at the same time can be attractive to most users, the magic word is ~compromise~, and like other exponents of the genre (one above all any chapter of the GT series on Playstation 2) even Codemasters programmers have to compromise in order not to risk producing a title that is too complex and frustrating for the average player. The above can be summarized, in summary, by saying that in Toca Race Driver 3 we find a driving model that is quite fun and easy to learn but which at the same time shows a moderate hint of simulation once the appropriate options have been activated. In short, nothing that anyone who has not played the previous chapter cannot imagine: the behavior of the cars has in fact remained practically identical. The first victim of the compromises we have talked about is the realism in the physics of the cars, which lacks above all in collisions (sometimes it seems that the cars are made of plastic) and in the implementation of forces during curvilinear motion (ok, ok...~ cornering~, I stop posturing). On the other hand, the management of oversteer and understeer phenomena is more accurate, and together with other factors it gives a certain depth to a driving model that is still more arcade than simulation: learning how to make the most of every single car, understanding its strengths and weakness, it is arguably a more exciting challenge than racing against computer-controlled pilots. In Toca Race Driver 3 we find a driving model that is quite fun and easy to learn but at the same time shows a moderate hint of simulation Livin' la vida TOCA Artificial intelligence is a separate chapter, and while not exciting at all, it reserves some pleasant surprises. The first problem that immediately catches the eye is that, as in past episodes, in various cases the opponents behave in a rather complaisant way: it has happened to me several times that, if the goal was to finish at least third, all the rivals computer controlleder went rather slow until, in fact, I reached third position, to then begin to press on the accelerator and offer a more congenial challenge rate. Something like this, which makes the player feel inside a movie scene rather than in the middle of a car race, lowers the realism a lot and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Coming to the driving style, the pilots controlled by artificial intelligence always tend not to dare more than necessary and keep clean trajectories, but they can run into errors and therefore find themselves having to temporarily change their behaviour. Systematically annoying a particular opponent leads the AI to remember what happened and ignite a real rivalry, if not on the track at least during some amusing cutscenes in full motion video. The tournaments of the various modes, as already mentioned, are quite varied and exciting, and the possibility of instantly restarting each race without incurring any kind of penalty is certainly a positive factor, which greatly limits any frustrating experiences. Worth noting are some important features for adjustment maniacs, such as being able to set the accelerator or brake dead zone in the joypad. All three versions of the game support online, which unfortunately doesn't shine as a structural organization and seems to have some problems in terms of netcode, especially in the console versions. The disciplines are many, ranging from racing with 12 players to head-to-head duels. Graphics and sound Race Driver 3 is a title developed simultaneously on PC, PS2 and Xbox, and to the chagrin of some PC users, it shows. This does not mean that the game is bad to look at, but certainly with the current technology available to PCs, much better could have been done. The car models are good, and the amount of polygons on screen is more than decent (good for consoles). The effects of deformation or breakage of the vehicles are done quite well: nothing revolutionary compared to what has already been seen in the previous chapters, but it is always a pleasure to see bent bodywork, scratches of various entities, cracked windshields, sparks during a contact and so on ( the accidents are still less ~hangover~ and cinematic than in the past). The views available include two external, two 'internal' (but nothing to do with the sumptuous reproduction of all the cockpits seen in Project Gotham 3 for Xbox 360) and one that simulates a camera mounted on a side stand. Graphics and sound Race Driver 3 is a title developed simultaneously on PC, PS2 and Xbox, and to the chagrin of PC users, it is noticeable Graphics and sound In the console versions the frames per second don't seem to be more than thirty, but there are practically no drops or slowdowns. However, a non-optimal visual quality, speaking of PCs, brings its nice side to the coin: TOCA Race Driver 3 runs smoothly even on low-power PCs. Suffice it to say that to enjoy acceptable fluidity on a Sempron 2800+ with Ati 9600 at a resolution of 1280x1024, you just need to sacrifice a few small details (shadows in primis). Considering a newer video card, the problems approach zero. From the sound point of view, there is nothing particular to report: the noises of the engines fall within the average of what is heard in all games of the genre (that is, not particularly enthusiastic), and the music of the menus is pure ~TOCA style ~. Cross-platform The story is, for better or worse, always the same: the best version is naturally the PC one, which can boast more defined textures, higher resolutions and much more effective filters than its console counterparts. Limiting the discussion to the latter, Xbox wins the palm for the cleanest graphics as usual. With TOCA Race Driver 3 Codemasters has declared its intention to take a step further towards realism, but the purists of exaggerated simulations will find very little to rejoice. All the others, however, know that satisfaction is practically guaranteed and that this automotive title offers certainly noteworthy longevity and variety, as well as a fairly fun driving model. Some regrets of PC users regarding the multiplatform nature of the title, which inevitably levels the technical sector downwards. The only contraindication is that TOCA Race Driver 3 may not prove to be the best purchase for those who have already bought the prequel and are not a true fan of the series, since the substantial differences are not that many.Pros Good technical realization (console) Numerous specialties and cars Guaranteed longevity Cons Improvable technical realization (PC) Artificial intelligence to be reviewed Driving model that is fun but still perfectable In these times in which two wheels begin to seem scarce and suddenly everyone wants four, yet another chapter appears in one of the longest-running motoring sagas currently on the market. After some ups and downs recorded in some of the most recent editions, it seems that Codemasters has definitely found the main road with the ~Race Driver~ series, which has already proved to be quite valid since the second chapter released last year. And now comes Toca Race Driver 3, which is a candidate as one of the best titles in the crowded category of ~pseudo-simulations~. Let's see how it performs on the road.", "date": "2006-02-24", "grade": null}
