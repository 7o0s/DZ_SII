Right from the illustration on the cover, the Bulbware game has an unmistakable air, unique within the large indie panorama on the Nintendo console. And in fact the style is certainly the most characterizing element of the entire project, the one that gives a specific identity to an adventure that otherwise could easily go unnoticed. Bulb Boy tells the strange story of a family of rather out of the ordinary lightbulb-men, who suddenly find themselves with the house invaded by dark presences: the protagonist boy, waking up one night from a very restless sleep, sinks into another nightmare opened if possible even worse, when he discovers that his beloved grandfather has been hit hard and the house is invaded by mysterious and evil creatures. Not that normal daily life proceeded quite like that of a typical country family: the fact that the members (the boy, the grandfather and the dog, in this case) are able to detach their heads from their bodies and attach them to house to shed light in the rooms says a lot about the normality of this family, however a new level of horror is added to the pleasant macabre touch that normally characterizes domestic life, achieving almost disturbing results in the grotesque contrast between the pleasant and childish aspect of the protagonist and the situations between splatter and classic horror in which it is possible to find oneself in the new adventure that appears before us. All the charm of the game plays out precisely on this particular contrast, which recalls a fairytale and dreamy style but plays with this style but by inserting continuous disgusting and disturbing elements, however without ever losing sight of the black humor that frames everything. A boy of few words What appears on the screen is a kind of wordless graphic story, in which the objectives to be achieved are never very clear at first but are made explicit through comics and drawings, when they obviously don't have to be deduced using a minimum of intuition. The structure derives directly from the tradition of graphic adventures, with a sort of dynamic interface that can undergo some variations depending on the situation. Basically, the protagonist is controlled directly with the analog stick, while sensitive elements on the screen are highlighted with arrows when approached to indicate possible interactions. In some cases, the good old cursor even appears, in the sections where it is possible to have a closer view of the objects to be collected or of the sort of mini-games with assorted puzzles. The interactions with objects and elements of the scenario are contextual and often unpredictable, but always very funny, following the humorous-horror line that characterizes the entire production. Being a boy with a head / light bulb, his characteristic is to be able to illuminate the environment, and this brings some consequences in his journey against the looming darkness. In general, it is usually a question of combining objects with each other and these with elements of the scenario to obtain various effects and continue from one room to another of the large family mansion. Although the exploration is always enjoyable, thanks also to the splendid characterization, and the interactions of the protagonist with the scenario and characters are often very funny, the construction of the puzzles in most cases is not that brilliant, with the solution that is o somewhat evident, given the scarcity of variables to take into consideration, or somewhat fortuitous, to be found by mixing together the few elements available through some attempt. On the other hand, not being able to count on any type of text or dialogue, the immediacy and relative simplicity of the puzzle constructs is inevitable and indeed desirable in order not to make everything excessively cryptic. Creepy and sympathy We have already said it but we reiterate it once again: the aesthetics of Bulb Boy alone would be worth the price of the ticket, which is also quite cheap for 7.99 euros. It is clear that the entire design of the game, from the interactions with objects and scenarios to the construction of the puzzles, derives first of all from a remarkable consistency in the underlying artistic vision. The Polish team, made up of practically only two members, managed to put together a small game (also in terms of duration, given that it ends in about two hours) with a truly strong identity and great charm. Its consistency is also remarkable: the decision to eliminatecompletely any type of verbal communication is well supported by the extreme expressiveness of the characters, while the strong characterization of the settings is also worth by itself as an incentive to explore the mansion and continue in the game. As for technical solutions, Bulb Boy features extremely accurate 2D graphics from a stylistic point of view with some touches of great class, such as the particular lighting system that accompanies the movements of the protagonist, being a sort of human light bulb, and the strange chromatic choice centered on the shades of green, red and black, still able to release an expressive power of great impact. The contrast between the cartoonish characterization and the brutality of certain scenes is not new, and fans of various Cartoon Network and surrounding series (Ren & Stimpy, Leone il Cane Coward, Adventure Time) are well aware of the attraction that this can exercise, but the sense of mystery, anguish and tenderness that this strange world created by Bulbware manages to unleash all together, also thanks to the total absence of traditional communication, is truly something special.", "date": "2017-08-06", "grade": "7.8"}
