{"name": "Prince of Persia Classic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia-classic.html", "text": "It's been a while since young programmer Jordan Mechner filmed his brother running, jumping and using a sword. These weren't family movies, but the first experiments in motion capture, a digital animation technique that is taken almost for granted today but which at the time caused a real sensation and set new standards in terms of fluidity and quality of movements of the sprites. Equipped with an exotic setting and a truly classic incipit (~save the princess from the clutches of the villain~...), Prince of Persia put us in the shoes of a prince, in fact, imprisoned by order of a usurper of his throne, that he must find the path that will lead him towards confrontation with the enemy. The plot was certainly not the strong point of the game, but its particular structure: the character boasted an enormous number of actions, unthinkable for those times, which allowed him to climb, make spectacular jumps and fight using a sword. Made by Gameloft, Prince of Persia Classic follows the original game in a very faithful way, but making a series of changes to make it more current. The standard mode provides for the presence of a certain number of coins to collect in each level to aspire to the maximum degree of completion of the story, but it is also possible to try your hand with the ~Classic~ mode which is practically no different from the Prince of Persia from 1989. Also included are the ~Time Attack~ and ~Survival~ modes, which are unlocked after completing the game. The actions that our prince is able to perform have even been increased, so now we will be able to jump backwards (with a truly spectacular maneuver) and easily hook from one appendage to another to obtain faster movement. For the rest, things have remained unchanged: we have an hour to reach the princess before she is executed, and we will have to make our way through a series of levels full of traps, doors that open via switches, healing potions and guards ready to kill us . The control system favors the use of the numeric pad over the joystick: the four main directions are used to move, crouch and jump up, while the 1 and 3 keys allow us to jump left or right and the 7 and 9 keys to proceed with a soft step so as not to be skewered by the blades protruding from the ground. Finally, the hash key is called into question to use the healing potions. The moment we find an opponent, our character takes out his sword and the controls vary in some respects: the FIRE button (or the five key) translates into a blow, while with the 2 and 8 keys you can parry enemy blows . The graphics of the game have been completely redesigned, adapting them to the current look of the prince. We therefore have much more beautiful and detailed settings than the original ones, and animations that shine for variety and quality, but cannot match the fluidity obtained with the original motion capture. The results are still very good, also thanks to the presence of unedited and truly spectacular movements. The sound sector defends itself thanks to a series of short but highly atmospheric music, to which the developers have added some well-made effects. As far as the controls are concerned, the configuration chosen in a normal situation might seem cumbersome and uncomfortable, but with Prince of Persia it behaves very well: the game has its own way of proceeding, the action is not frenetic and therefore you are able to move, jump and fight smoothly. Pros: A classic that does not age Technically excellent Four game modes Against: Animations not as smooth as the original Sometimes frustrating Quality sound, but essential", "date": "2007-12-17", "grade": "7.2"}
