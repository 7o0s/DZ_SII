It is a huge videogame, endowed with an admirable (albeit not absolute) fidelity to the rules of pen & paper, complex like few others, and even supported by a high-level narrative; all things that stand out even more when you consider the few resources available to the team that created it. Yet despite such a cornucopia of quality to back it up, Owlcat Games' work was inundated with negative reviews from audiences, and garnered only moderate marks from the vast majority of launch sites, due to a long list of serious issues. resolved only partially with the passing of the months. The fault, alas, lies entirely in the inexperience of the team at the reins, which, despite managing to give life to its ~dream project~, was not able to make it available with the due level of cleaning. The original Kingmaker, therefore, was brutally penalized by a frightening number of bugs and oversights, which sealed its fate for a long time (or at least until the developers and community rolled up their sleeves to improve it by dint of updates and mods). But now the playing field has changed, because the Owlcats have seen fit to release a Definitive Edition of the game designed not only to fix the most serious problems left after the many patches, but also to add some goodies introduced by modders. We reviewed it on Playstation 4 Pro, and today we will reveal whether it is finally a flawless work, or just a negligible port. King not by chance Let's start from the basics: Kingmaker is a RPG that is based on an Adventure Path of the same name by Pathfinder, which in turn is a pen & paper RPG deriving from the 3.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons and later detached from the work of Wizards of the Coast. Anyone who has a minimum of familiarity with the Dungeons & Dragons system, therefore, will immediately find themselves at ease with the game, given that the rules followed are immediately recognizable, and the structure of the whole closely resembles the classics of Black Isle and Bioware from the good old days. However, don't be fooled by the proximity to the paper forms: Owlcat's work has a much more interesting story full of twists and turns than you might guess from the first bars - during which your alter ego is summoned by the ruler of Restov together with other heroes to defeat a brigand with the promise of becoming the king of the territory controlled by him. After passing the introductory phases, in fact, you will find yourself faced with a series of unexpected events, which will lead to the exploration of various parts of the world of Golarion, and will significantly increase the scale of the adventure. For heaven's sake, the game doesn't have an extraordinarily original narrative, but we are still facing a title clearly eager to offer a memorable epic, with sensitive care for the characters encountered (and they are not few at all), and a good number of peaks . More than most exponents of this difficult genre can boast. The presence of a ~ruler~ part, however, offers a sudden structural change, which allowed the Owlcats to add various interesting mechanics to the system, and keep the experience fresh for a long time despite the duration and not particularly innovative gameplay. In the title there is also a sort of internal encyclopedia, which can also be consulted through convenient words highlighted during the dialogues, practically indispensable for understanding the balance of a heterogeneous world like Golarion. Just keep in mind that if you're not a fan of games full of written text, Kingmaker will certainly not meet your tastes. What has changed The list of changes made in the Definitive Edition compared to the basic one is really long, and mainly composed of more or less serious bugs resolved (even if the worst crashes and flaws capable of breaking the game definitively have been fixed by the team over time). Between one fix and another, however, this edition has rebalanced skills and classes, improved the response of the artificial intelligence to certain situations (not by much, since indeed it is still possible to fool it in many ways that worked in the original) and decreased the duration of the atrocious uploads (which are still a bit too long and too long even on PS4 Pro). However, the most significant change to the system is closely linked to the world of modding, because the Owlcats have seen fit to include a useful turn-based mode in the definitive editionbilizable in battle, which replaces the original real-time system with tactical pause, and makes the fights more similar to those of the ~tabletop~ Pathfinder. The implementation of this gem, originally, was only available with a mod in the PC version - painstaking work, which allowed you to manage more or less everything without mess - but now it is possible to activate the alternative system at any time with a simple press of the lever left analog, and as far as we are concerned, once the shifts are activated, there is really no need to go back any further. Not only do these make it easier to calculate complex strategies, and take the necessary time to decide the course of action of your characters (which can go up to six in a team, let's not forget it), but when you activate them even the artificial intelligence enemy reacts better, attacking the crucial fighters of your team (including mages and clerics) with more precision, and avoiding occasionally wedging into areas where area spells or specific skills could quickly make them cannon fodder. Some inaccuracies in the mechanics exist, including the inability to follow up with multiple attacks after eliminating an enemy with the first attack, yet overall we are faced with an excellent ~review~ of the mod by the developers, whose presence we absolutely loved it. Not exactly definitive The Definitive Edition, that wasn't enough, also contains all the DLC of the game - Varnhold's Lot and Beneath the Stolen Lands are therefore playable - and the usual inordinate number of classes (with the addition of the powerful Kineticist added with The Wildcards). However, such a mass of specializations brings into play a dilemma that cannot be underestimated: the need to explain how each one works to the player properly, and Pathfinder Kingmaker ... tends to ignore it with a discreet grace. Pathfinder is, as already mentioned, a complex pen & paper, whose rules further expand the already elaborate 3.5 edition of D&D by adding classes and a myriad of non-negligible details. The Owlcats have been very respectful of the material, but have not particularly considered the need to explain it in detail to newbies, so even in this Definitive Edition you will find yourself grappling with a game with fairly narrow tutorials, where the functioning of each maneuver and action goes understood through the careful reading of every effect, possibility, and development option between tables and seas of text. For those who already have consolidated foundations in the genre, or simply know the set of rules of the old editions of Dungeons & Dragons there will be no problems as already mentioned, but for all the others we assure you that the approach will be far from natural, and that things get even more complicated when you become a ruler, and add a long series of timed quests, management elements, and various factors to complicate the player's life. If only this barrier to entry was the problem, we would conclude with a big smile on our faces, but unfortunately Kingmaker's stumbles don't end there. The Definitive Edition, at least on console, isn't literally definitive, and while many serious bugs have been ironed out, we encountered quite a few interface and system hiccups during our PS4 Pro run, faced a couple of crashes, and observed in general not exactly exceptional performance of the title from a technical point of view, with unjustifiable scatterelli during not particularly heavy scenes. On PC the situation should be more stable, but considering the continued support for the game from the development team, it was reasonable to expect a better state at the console launch. The same interface, although completely manageable, shows some limitations on the part of the designers, resulting in a bit convoluted for the completion of certain operations (although this is true for the vast majority of classic RPGs brought back to consoles).", "date": "2020-08-23", "grade": "8.0"}
