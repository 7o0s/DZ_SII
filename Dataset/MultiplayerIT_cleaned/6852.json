The result was a fluctuating title that failed to combine visual magnificence with a gameplay and a game structure up to par, necessary to involve the player by taking him by the hand in the dizzying succession of fights that would have brought him into contact with environments breathtaking views. After seeing it for the first time in Cologne at the last GamesCom, the time has finally come to express ourselves definitively on the PC version of the action developed by Crytek, the undisputed master for years when it comes to pure digital aesthetics. However, we are not so sure that a version of Ryse: Son of Rome including all four DLCs published so far and a series of technical implementations aimed at improving its already considerable visual impact are worth the ticket price. After stripping it thoroughly by putting our trusty PC station to the test, we came out with a satisfied eye, but we cannot deny that various aspects of the production have left us very perplexed. Will time and optimizations on PC have benefited Ryse after the tepid debut on Xbox One? Story of revenge The Rome of Nero in which Ryse is set is held in check by hordes of angry barbarians who desire nothing but the destruction of the despotic and oppressive Empire, which for too many years has been ravaging neighboring peoples to expand its borders . Once the streets of the capital have been invaded, it's up to Marius Titus, a young army general, to take care of safeguarding the Emperor in an attempt to keep his promise not to make Rome capitulate at any price, not even that of his own life. Marius's is in fact a story of revenge, marked by the massacre of his family by some mercenaries and by the oath to claim their death at any cost, flushing out the executioners even at the end of the world, if necessary. This trick allows the developers to vary environments, from imperial Rome to stormy coasts and lush, withered forests, connecting everything with a series of rather mundane cutscenes that form the weak glue of the campaign missions. There are intrigues, friendship, betrayals and a pinch of the supernatural in Ryse's narrative, although there are no twists worthy of the name as well as a greater characterization of the characters, to be remembered more for their technical realization rather than for the actual contribution narrative. The supporting actors are anonymous in their roles and dialogues, but it is expressions and animations that raise them from the role of simple extras, making their anger, hatred, fear and suffering transpire, giving substance to antagonists who, with their lascivious and contemptuous ways, make themselves hated more for how they appear than for what they express. The fights are brutal, quarterings and mutilations abound, as well as epic scenes of sieges and shipwrecks embellished by a game engine that gives such an engaging majesty, depth of field and detail that it arouses constant wonder in the player's eyes. It is precisely on this duality that the game of Ryse: Son of Rome is played: an engine so advanced and amazing as to stimulate the player's interest in proceeding in the main campaign, as opposed to an anonymous and easily forgettable narrative and game structure. The gladius of the gods Once the pad has been challenged, the title shows its side to a whole series of flaws that push in the opposite direction to the technical merits mentioned above. Ryse's combat system proves to be incomplete from many points of view, first of all a basic repetitiveness that completely undermines its depth. Attempting to imitate other exponents of the genre, Crytek offers a fluid and seamless combat system, with our centurion moving agile among the enemies by alternating slashing, dodging and shield parries. The pressure of the attack keys remains staid and never too frenetic, more focused on timing rather than on the player's ability to ring complex combos, returning the excellent sense of heaviness given by the bulky Roman armor. Once a certain number of shots have been scored, the executions are unlocked, which will start a short quick time event following which Marius will enjoy a more or less substantial increase in ddamage, experience, fury, or health, based on the perk selected using the arrow keys. The better the timing with which we press the correct keys, the greater the bonus received, with the only big problem that this is awarded even if we don't hit a single one right. Once the execution has started, the result will always be the same: enemy dead and bonus received, with the result of excessively facilitating battles by ensuring that you almost never remain in reserve of energy. The command mapping work done on the keyboard is excellent, but we confirm what was written in the preview phase: abandoning it for a pad in our view remains the preferable option. To alternate hand-to-hand combat, there are brief moments in which Marius is at the head of a handful of soldiers to make his way through specific sections of the levels, taking advantage of the tortoise formation to shelter from the rain of enemy incendiary arrows and throwing javelins together to his fellow soldiers towards the hostiles stationed on the heights. Again, everything turns out to be terribly banal and not very engaging, above all due to the absence of any strategic ambitions due to narrow and linear settings where the platoon moves firmly on rails. The multiplayer with the Gladiator mode takes care of varying the formula in an almost completely unexpected way, set inside the Colosseum in a succession of scenarios that change wave after wave. Before going down to the Arena it is necessary to ask the favor of one of the four available deities, who in exchange give only one of the four perks used in the campaign, forcing us to make a choice that will inevitably influence our fighting style. We can be more aggressive and focus on damage or more conservative by choosing vital regeneration, the fact is that the situation is bound to get complicated in a short time, whether you are alone or accompanied online by a friend. Similarly to the single player, you will need to earn experience points and credits to level up your character and buy weapons, equipment and healing potions with which to upgrade yourself to survive in the ten available settings. With five additional skins and more than ten new maps, it is precisely the multiplayer that enjoys the most this new edition of Ryse: Son of Rome, which is similar to the Xbox One version on the single player front, but decidedly richer in its declination multiplayer thanks to the presence of all four DLCs related to the Crytek production. Despite the new content, however, the defects of a shallow and engaging combat system re-emerge rather quickly, accompanied by the reduced variety of enemies who quickly tire the player forcing him to leave the pad after having feasted his eyes on such beauty visual. Something extra Ultimately, we just have to point out what you all surely already know: Crytek has polished its jewel in the splendor of 4K which, provided you have adequate components available, will give rise to a truly extraordinary visual spectacle. Taking advantage of the talent of its developers and the natural inclination towards the PC environment, the Teutonic software house has managed to put an extremely complex and high-performance CryEngine in the hands of the player, but no less optimized for this. Although the graphic assets are the same, the greater detail offered compared to the Xbox One version is palpable right from the start, with a cleaner image accompanied by light and volumetric effects that give greater involvement and realism to the game scenes. The rain during the storm, the fire that blazes, the lens flare of a sunset over the capital are a real feast for the eyes. With our test configuration we had no problems enjoying Ryse at maximum detail: with 16x anisotropic filtering and leaving out Supersampling, we played comfortably in Full HD without experiencing any drops in the graphics engine, always granite above 30 frames per second. It should be emphasized that the settings include two separate options for resolution management, one dedicated to rendering, and one instead to the number of actual pixels sent to the screen. In this way, keeping the resolution of the monitor fixed, we can ask the graphics engine to render the title at a lower resolution and then upscale the final image, in order to gain precious leeway to recover a few frames making the game experience smoother and more stable. If you want to aim for UltraHD, you need to go insteadon high-end hardware, with Crytek even recommending an Intel Core i7 2700K or AMD FX-8350 processor accompanied by an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 or Titan video card as an alternative to the AMD Radeon 290X.
