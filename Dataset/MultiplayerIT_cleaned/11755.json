The ~official~ mode of this game is based on the events of the first series of Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and the ZZ, while the ~original~ mode is enriched by the appearances of G Gundam and the prototype Wing. In the latter, the developers have taken some liberties and have created an unpublished story where all the Mobile Suits (this is the name of the mechs in the series) come together to fight united against a new enemy, in a sort of space-time cross-over very charming. the gameplay of Gundam follows the lines of the Dynasty Warriors series A magic that does not excite Also included for the occasion was the new Musha Gundam designed by the famous Mecha Designer Hajime Katoki, creator of the robots in Virtual On and Super Robot Wars, as well as a key figure in most of the Sunrise series. Those who love the gameplay of Dynasty Warriors and the Gundam universe will splash about like a fish in water; on the contrary, those who are not familiar with the series will certainly have some problems in understanding the plots, connections and relationships between the many characters who appear in the adventure. In fact, the Koei title explains almost nothing, does not introduce, does not present, in short, does not dictate the circumstances and details of the war that is raging in this hypothetical future. And in doing so, much of the magic vanishes even before it can excite. A camera far too free Once you have chosen the character and the Mobile Suit model to command, the missions begin and we find ourselves literally surrounded by enemy robots coming from every direction. The gameplay is the usual ~one against a thousand~ that sees us swing the sword, this time no longer made of steel but lasers, against hordes of enemies, bosses and guardians. The controls are very simple: there is a basic melee attack, a ranged one, jumping and the ~Super~, a combo that can only be used once a certain amount of energy has been accumulated. The camera is free, even too much. In fact, the view always remains nailed in one direction and does not follow our character's shoulders: we are the ones who have to constantly adjust the shot, making some situations even more difficult to manage, as to rotate the camera we have to momentarily leave the button dial of attack. The camera is free, even too much. Unfortunately, the view always remains nailed in one direction A camera far too free It is therefore impossible to manage both effectively, and during the clashes with the final bosses, much more demanding than the armies, one encounters some small frustration due to the fact of not feeling completely in control of the situation. At the beginning of each mission two conditions are given: that of victory and that of defeat. The maps are decidedly large and within them allied or antagonistic formations move continuously, conquering or losing certain areas of influence and bases of support. Our task is essentially to take possession of these areas, defeating a certain amount of enemy robots inside them and possibly some small bosses. Once at the end of the various missions we are rewarded with new equipment that improves the characteristics of our Mobile Suit, the purchase of new skills and possible level advancements, both for the robot and for the pilot. Dynasty Warriors Gundam is available for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 The tested version is the one for Xbox 360. Comment Dynasty Warriors Gundam is the perfect game for those who love Koei's action series and at the same time are passionate about the world of Mobile Suits. If you are missing even one of these peculiarities, rest assured that you will not appreciate this action game. It's a title that however manifests quite evident problems from the below average graphics sector, to the underdeveloped artificial intelligence up to a gameplay that hasn't been renewed for too many years now and that needs a decisive graft of creativity. Pros Many characters and numerous Gundam models Suitable for those who love Dynasty Warriors Cons Those unfamiliar with the series will have difficulty understanding the events Insufficient enemy AI Inadequate graphics Xbox 360 - Goals This game is not particularly generous with points. To see the first 25 you will even have to complete it with a character. To unlock the others you have to finish it again using different characters. The others will be seen much further, once you get to level 30 or after killing 50,000 enemies.More points in the co-op mode and unlocking all the Gundams and all the protagonists of the story. 1000 points to sweat, in short. The Clone Voyeur Army Continuing with the conquest of these areas, the story will unfold before us automatically, through the dialogues of the characters and the cut-scenes. The narration phases are well dubbed and convey a lot of emphasis: during the game there is a succession of requests for help, messages and commands. The game is entirely in English with Italian subtitles. It is a pity that the same care has not been placed also in the ~side dish~; for example, the characters are static images without any animation, with only the mouth that opens and closes: decidedly against the tide in the next-gen era. The whole game can be tackled in cooperative mode together with a friend of ours, using a split screen, but always on the subject of approximation, any type of online game via Xbox Live is missing, a real shame. From Dynasty Warriors Gundam we would certainly not expect a tactical artificial intelligence worthy of a Halo, but not even the one that the Japanese developers Omega Force have proposed to us. It's amazing how such a level of AI could have escaped the eyes of the testers, before the game entered its final production stage. The enemies who come to oppose us, or rather who should do so, simply position themselves in front of us and stand still, motionless, paralysed. in a few seconds we are surrounded by dozens and dozens of enemy Mechs that look at us all together a few meters away, without raising a weapon or moving The Clone Voyeur Army Graphics and Audio Even on the technical side, Dynasty Warriors Gundam turns out to be a decidedly counter-current game. Not because it exploits a brand new graphics engine properly, or because it becomes particularly innovative thanks to the use of special effects never seen before, but for the poverty and simplicity of its graphics, which remained on the standards of the series at its debut on the nextgen . And it must be emphasized that already at the time that title was backward, compared to the average of the productions. The robot models wouldn't even be evil, if the quality of the textures didn't make them look not so much like gigantic mechs but rather big colorful toys. There are so many enemies on the screen, but with that polygonal modeling the global effect fails to amaze. The environments are bare and simple: prairies alternate with the deepest and blackest space, with some excursions to planets and enemy bases, always the same and built with the same texture multiplied ad infinitum, with some pop-up and clipping problems. The music, on the other hand, is inspired and well orchestrated, and although it lacks variety, it adapts very well to the war scenes that Dynasty Warriors Gundam offers us. The effects, which are not too many, are still good: Koei has evidently made good use of the original sound libraries used for the creation of the animated series.", "date": "2007-12-07", "grade": null}
