{"name": "Prey: Mooncrash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prey-mooncrash-recensione-201454.html", "text": "If you have read the review of Prey published a little over a year ago on these same pages, you will remember that for us the latest effort from Arkane Studios was another gem after the first two Dishonored. In fact, in the guise of Morgan Yu we have experienced an engaging adventure like few others, anxiously crossing the corridors of the former Talos I space station to measure ourselves against the alien creatures known as Typhon. Old and new enemies now have the opportunity to return to work in Prey: Mooncrash, additional content made available a few days ago as an expansion of the basic version of Prey, which is therefore mandatory to immerse yourself in this new (mini) story. Among acquaintances already known as Mimic and Spectra, the developers have shown that they have a great desire to experiment: let's find out together what the Lyon team has prepared on our plate. The setting: everyone on the moon Having abandoned the protagonist of the main adventure, Prey: Mooncrash puts us in the shoes of such Peter, a hacker in charge of understanding what happened on the Pytheas base introduced to us with the presentation that took place at E3 2018. The place in question is a secret lunar station owned by TranStar, from which all communications have completely ceased. Taking advantage of a technology very similar to virtual reality, Peter must retrace the last moments on the Moon of five insiders in the Pytheas base, to complete his task and thus return home to his family. We therefore find ourselves living not a single story, but five parallel plots to deepen the events that led to the situation of Prey: Mooncrash, inevitably also following the epilogue dedicated to its protagonist. The characters to follow in the virtual reality in which Peter moves are equally five: each of them has its own characteristics, capable of influencing the style of play that the player must adopt in order to be able to move forward. Furthermore, each character has objectives dedicated to him, which therefore lead him to move within the Pytheas towards areas of interest different from those of the others. The enemies are largely old acquaintances of the basic version of Prey, including the ~nice~ Mimics increasingly committed to camouflaging themselves in the form of rocks or cups. The Typhon novelty is the Moon Shark, a very dangerous creature capable of moving under the hard surface of the earth's satellite, lethal for anyone who encounters it and for this reason to be avoided in every possible way. Playstation 4 trophies Prey: Mooncrash brings with it a total of ten new Trophies, of which three are Silver-type and seven Bronze. Unlocking and completing the escape with each of the five characters involved in the simulation is obviously the starting point to obtain them, but to complete the list of objectives you also have to deal with a Moon Shark. Roguelite game mechanics As anticipated on the occasion of our interview with Ricardo Bare, lead director of Prey: Mooncrash, the additional content brings with it all the ability to experiment that the guys at Arkane Studios have. In particular, the DLC was described to us talking about ~objectives to complete and different objects to recover in each game session~, leaving us with the curiosity to know in what form this could be possible. Now that we've got our hands on Prey: Mooncrash, we know it: a mini-prologue introduces us to Peter and his equipment, before putting us in the shoes of the first of the Pytheas employees, one Andrius Alekna, busy reaching the lifeboat that it is located on the map. A fairly simple objective, which can be completed in a few tens of minutes: on the one hand this serves to acquire (or reacquire) familiarity with the game dynamics of Prey, but above all Andrius's escape offers us the possibility of restarting the simulation with a second character, Joan Winslow, unlocked following the success of the previous simulation. Each new ~run~ within Prey: Mooncrash changes some details, for example by repositioning some enemies or by bringing magnetic cards and other objects to different places on the map, which for its part is destined to always remain the same and rather linear. As he manages to complete the simulations, the player can decide to start with an enhanced endowment compared to the initial one, which provides for example only a wrench as a weapon. Objects found and actions carried out during each session in fact contribute to giving the player a currency, who can thus buy silenced pistols and other gadgets (including the new GLOO grenades) to improve their quality of life withinPytheas. Any installed Neuromods are carried from one session to another, thus allowing us to use enhanced versions of the same characters to succeed in the escape. Gameplay, die without fear The completion of the story of Prey: Mooncrash occurs when Peter finds a way to escape alive from the structure in the same ~game~ by successfully alternating all five protagonists, without letting any of them die. However, should the worst happen, one must not despair, because death is an integral part of Prey: Mooncrash as a way to obtain one's progress. The Typhons present on the lunar station certainly do not do compliments in attacking, and where they do not arrive, the artificial intelligence of the game takes care of it which makes it increasingly difficult over time. In case things go wrong, we have two options: continue as one of the other unlocked and not yet escaped characters, or restart the simulation to start from its beginning. Between one attempt and another, we can improve the loadout as described above, thus returning stronger and angrier than before among the Typhons. It is good to know that with the arrival of Prey: Mooncrash, Arkane Studios has also introduced some types of damage related to very specific body parts of the protagonist, importing this modification also into the base game. A graphic with lights and shadows In terms of graphics Prey: Mooncrash behaves in a similar way to the basic version, thus confirming the goodness of what we saw in the game released in 2017. Moving between Pytheas' environments is pleasant and engaging, except when it comes to returning to the game after being dead or after restarting a session: like the old Prey, its DLC is in fact affected by too long loading, in some cases even divided into two parts, putting the player's patience to the test. The quality of the multiplayer mode of Prey: Mooncrash, promised by the developers for late summer, remains to be evaluated: by buying the package now, it will be possible to download Typhon Hunter when it arrives on the square. Even before that, Prey: Mooncrash allows you to enjoy about ten additional hours, different from those needed to complete the game released in 2017 but still appreciable for the way this DLC was made with the intention of experimenting.", "date": "2018-06-23", "grade": null}
