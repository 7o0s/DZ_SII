The team that wins does not change, and so Singstar '80s continues to evaluate the user's singing performance based solely on intonation, without dwelling on octaves or on the correct pronunciation of the words of the text (in all respects it is possible to sing a entire song using only one verse). Certainly a point in favor of the enjoyment of the SCEE title, which as always proves to be immediately accessible to everyone, this time perhaps even to a greater extent thanks to a musical selection that does not require golden nozzles to be tackled; an aspect that was one of the main reasons for criticism of other compilations, especially Singstar Party. Always remaining on the subject of tracklists, it must be said that the choices made by SCEE appear sufficiently spot on, drawing brazenly pop and commercial melodies but also songs of undoubted caliber: in short, while not representing a perfect cross-section of the music of that decade, Singstar '80s does its job quite well in this regard. Anyone who has lived or in any case knows the music scene of the time will therefore have no trouble finding bread for their teeth, trying their hand together with other players in the various multiplayer modes offered by the SCEE product (like the previous ones, in fact, even Singstar '80s has no substantially reason to exist outside of this perspective). Also in this case, little or nothing changes compared to the usual: the Battle option, in which two users challenge each other simultaneously on the same song, continues to be the most successful, while the Duet mode appears unconvincing, if only for the absence of songs actually sung in two voices. The picture is completed by the sections First to the Post (the first to reach a certain score wins), Keep It Up (in which it is necessary to keep the performance level above a certain limit) and Pass The Mic (where a maximum of eight players must sing a piece of song each), without forgetting the inclusion of some useful medleys to move the situation a bit. The Eye Toy then continues to be supported to film some excerpts of its own interpretation on video, while the inclusion of a bizarre version of Pong that can be controlled exclusively via the pitch of the voice definitely leaves the time it finds. Ultimately, therefore, Singstar '80s certainly does not distort the nature of the series, but thanks also to dutiful filings in the selection of the tracklist, it proves to be one of the most suitable party games on the market, at least for the over 20s. Comment Difficult to pass judgment on Singstar 80's without bringing up everyone's personal opinions towards both karaoke and a tracklist obviously confined to the limits of the synthesizer decade. And yes, because the latest born in the SCEE house differs from the previous ones substantially only in the musical offer, fortunately - this must be emphasized - made up of pieces that do not require professional singing skills, as too often happened in past editions. Considering Singstar 80's enduring quality as a party game and the good variety of the tracklist, the SCEE title remains a great choice for more mature users or 80's nostalgics looking for a genuine source of hilarity for their own evenings. Pros: Great as a party game Satisfying tracklist Good number of modes Cons: Reserved for fans of the annthe 80s Little more than a data disk Now in its fourth edition between ups and downs, Singstar has always tried to present a musical offer that oscillates as much as possible between classic and pop pieces, between old and new, between more elaborate songs and very rude hit-singles, and not always with results happy: an excessive dispersion of styles and genres, combined with a not exactly optimal choice of tracks, which ended up disappointing rather than satisfying everyone, forcing a large part of the user to limit their singing performances to a rather small percentage of songs compared to the total. Perhaps for this very reason, SCEE has decided to dedicate this latest Singstar exclusively to the roaring 80s.", "date": "2005-12-15", "grade": null}
