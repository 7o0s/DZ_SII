Nobody, probably, otherwise who pays the subscription for the servers anymore? The after bomb is always traumatic The Mutants are green humanoids (drink radioactive water for your whole life and you will become like them) who deeply hate Humans (accused of ~resisting~ the changes of the planet) and despise the Biomeks (who make them a little disgusted) . They have great regenerative abilities and can use contamination as a weapon. Characters of this race can be: Champions (fighters with special abilities gained by manipulating the Taint); some Shamans (they have great defensive and healing abilities in a fantasy role-playing game they would be the classic clerics); of the Archons (they are able to summon contaminated creatures and exploit the environment to strike enemies); or the Avengers (they are able to manipulate blood to obtain various special effects). The after bomb is always traumatic Finally, the Biomeks have chosen the technological path to oppose the unlivable conditions of the planet and have implemented biomechanical prostheses on their bodies to strengthen themselves. The characters of this race can be: Terminators (in the related films played by the current governor of California, what did the Terminators do? What the Terminators of Auto Assault also do: they slaughter everything that can be slaughtered); of the Builders (skilled manipulators of nanotechnologies with great repair skills); some MasterMinds (they are able to create armies of robots using scrap); or the Agents (the spies of the group). Who will succeed in gaining control of the planet? Nobody, probably, otherwise who pays the subscription for the servers anymore? Rapid lowering of blood pressure The first thing that amazes, once you start the game and create the first character, is the immediacy of the control system and the ease with which you get into the action. The basic keys needed to steer your vehicle are very few, the driving system is completely arcade and presents no difficulties even for newbies. The game interface is clear and immediate (if you find any problems, however, just consult the manual included in the package... come on, don't be lazy). Less comfortable is the walking system, in which you have to hold down a key to be able to use the mouse to orient yourself. Nothing dramatic really, also because most of the time you spend whizzing around in your vehicle. After a short tutorial (different depending on the race chosen for your alter ego) which allows you to familiarize yourself with almost all the actions that can be performed in the game (shoot, talk to non-player characters, obtain quests, interact with some objects , destroying buildings, participating in stage races, distributing experience points when you level up, plus various other things) you are introduced to a first area belonging to your own faction, in which to practice further and perhaps start interact with some humans. Non-player characters who have something to tell us (usually they will assign quests) are highlighted by a long column of light reaching up to the sky. The dialogues are very limited (they explain, we nod) and usually serve to illustrate what we have to do or to tell us about some details about the game world. the basic keys needed to govern your vehicle are very few, the driving system is completely arcade and presents no difficulties even for newbies Rapid lowering of blood pressure The quests are varied in nature but quite repetitive. The most frequent ones concern having to destroy a certain number of enemies belonging to a specific species or having to recover a certain number of objects of the same type. Initially interesting, but boring over time, are the solo stage races. Much more fun are those against other human opponents that turn Auto Assault into a kind of driving game (the most exciting part of the game, to be honest). All missions will be piloted from start to finish, with clearly visible arrows on the screen that will tell us where to go and messages that will tell us what to do. Often, one will have the impression of being helped too much. In fact, this system allows you to never get lost but also to quickly resolve any situation by milling mission after mission which, as a whole, loses importance quickly generating boredom. The best missions are those that form the so-called ~historical archives~. It is a series of linked missions that reveal details about your faction and require cooperation from multiple players (chand can form ~caravans~) since they tend to become progressively more difficult. Another world to explore The game world is quite large and divided into three territories (one per race) in which to roam. The main feeling is that of ~loneliness~, at least in the initial stages of the game which are the most disorganized. In reality, we soon realize that there aren't many things to do. The novelty (for MMORPGs) of the almost completely destructible world is interesting for the first few hours of the game, but soon becomes an irrelevant extra... also because by destroying entire villages you get almost nothing. Let's say that it is a good scenographic addition, which makes the fights spectacular, and nothing more. The local fauna is of various nature, ranging from monsters that live in the sand to humanoids armed in various ways (machine guns, flamethrowers, missile launchers, vehicles and all the other weapons in the game). Generally these are ~livestock~ deriving from the classic imagination of post-nuclear settings, with some interesting additions due to the introduction of the ~alien~ factor. The creatures (cannon fodder, to put it more clearly) allow us to talk about the combat system, the real core of Auto Assault. Well, actually there isn't much to say given its simplicity: with one key you can shoot, with another you can select a fixed target and with the fast keys you can use the different powers at your disposal (obviously different depending on faction and role). It is immediately clear that in such a game everything is focused on speed, spectacularity and the ability to juggle driving and assault at the same time (exploiting the various powers at our disposal). Each vehicle will have the possibility of mounting different more or less powerful weapons depending on its level. These can be bought in shops, obtained by completing missions or found by killing monsters (of course the best items are obtained by killing the most powerful enemies). Other objects that can be found always concern the enhancement of the vehicle (for example the armor) or the various specializations of the characters (objects useful for the manipulation of scrap or contamination). Obviously there is no shortage of ~consumable goods~ which provide short-term boosts or which repair the damage suffered without having to go to the appropriate repair stations. Hardware boxes The average requirements to run Auto Assault are a 2.0 GHz Pentium 4 (or equivalent), 512 GB of ram, a video card from the Radeon 8500 or GeForce 4 Ti generation (preferably from the next generation, anyway) and a 56k internet connection (with which the lag, however, is quite accentuated and with which it takes a long time to download the big update patches). Tested on a 3.4 GHz P4 with 2 GB of ram and a GeForce 7800GT, the game ran smoothly at the highest level of detail available. Final comment Auto Assault is an original and rather atypical MMORPG that just misses the mark, due to some structural problems that risk making it substantially boring and uninteresting in the long run. Soon one feels hungry for things to do other than the few provided by the game which seems to leave large spaces for intervention in future expansions. A little more variety would have done him good, above all by virtue of having chosen the extreme simplification of every aspect that composes it. Basically a good product that earns more credit by virtue of being the first to focus completely on vehicles. Pros Easy to master Very spectacular combat Good setting Cons Lack of things to do Some simplifications are too much Missing a few more races The after bomb is always traumatic Auto Assault is an MMORPG (by NCsoft) set in a post-nuclear and post-alien contamination future, in which three races collide to gain control of a planet reduced to an immense desert full of toxic substances and wild beasts (such as Er Underpants on the Isola dei Famosi, for example). Humans, mutants and biomeks, aboard armed and armored vehicles, roam the immense and desolate highways fighting each other. All three feel they are the races designated to dominate the planet, and will do everything to succeed (also because they fear, otherwise, extinction). Humans are basically humans, with some slight alterations in physical and mental characteristics. The characters of this race can be: Commandos (fighters); of the Engineers (the intellectuals of the group, with strong propensities for mechanics) of the Lieutenants (the stratsegos, capable of planning vast attacks and obtaining extra support for their troops) or Bounty Hunters (misanthropes with great infiltration skills).", "date": "2006-04-28", "grade": null}
