The game also introduces two different drones, one equipped with wheels but capable of making leaps and a flying one, which on the one hand emphasize the strategic aspect and encourage you to better plan your intervention, perhaps preparing the ground thanks to the triggering of traps environmental that can reduce the enemy ranks before our entry on the scene; on the other hand, they allow you to carry out operations of various kinds without being physically on site, but piloting these robots remotely and perhaps using advanced hacking skills to distract the guards as we pass. Many facets, therefore, which intertwine with each other in the name of freedom of action and which find a further outlet in the online missions, which were not available at launch due to some technical problem but which are now an integral part of the package; also from the point of view of downloadable content, such as Human Conditions, the DLC which includes three interesting single player missions, a new type of enemy equipped with a jammer and a series of rather demanding online challenges, the so-called elite missions. Human Conditions offers a pack of exciting new missions for Watch Dogs 2 The return of Jordi Chin Among the protagonists of the first Watch Dogs, Jordi Chin is a ~fixer~, that is to say a new Mister Wolf: skilled both in close combat and in that from a distance, he is that type of professional figure who is generally called to ~fix~ potentially explosive situations in exchange for adequate compensation. Do you have a stolen car to make disappear? Someone you need to get out of the way? Don't worry, Jordi will take care of it. We find the character in the Human Conditions DLC, during the ~Bad Care~ mission, intent on hunting down the same people that San Francisco's DedSEC is dealing with, i.e. a criminal group that has paralyzed hospital facilities by inserting ransomware into their systems and demanding a ransom to delete it. Initially Marcus and Jordi clash, not knowing they're practically on the same side, but then they decide to join forces to defeat the Russian hackers responsible for the attack. The phases that make up the mission often see us acting in first person while Jordi provides support from a distance, perhaps by taking up a sniper rifle and creating diversions that allow us to identify the objectives without having to constantly think about the guards. The grand finale on the huge yacht is a synthesis of the best elements of Watch Dogs 2: stealth action, hacking on the fly and a quick escape into the open sea, complete with a police chase. The script is also beautiful, with dialogues that finally elicit a few smiles and improve the not very successful narrative aspect of the basic campaign. Hot topicality The ~Automata~ mission draws once again among the contradictions of the most advanced technologies, when Doodle launches a car on the market that not only drives itself but knows everything about its driver. The reverse of the coin, which the multinational is careful not to specify, is that in this way the ctOS system carries out an economic and social evaluation of the life of those who get behind the wheel of the car, choosing on this basis who will have priority in the event of accident. To stop such a dastardly plan Marcus and Wrench decide to break into the house of the president of Doodle to get hold of his access data and then steal the car to reveal to the world how things are. It is broadly speaking a formula already seen in one of the first missions of the main campaign, and in fact the characters never fail to joke about it, but in practice the intelligent car will drive itself, giving us quite a few headaches. The third and final single-player mission of the package is ~Caustic Progress~, in which Marcus must team up against his will with the biohacker Lenni and investigate a pharmaceutical company that conducts illegal experiments on the homeless to develop new drugs. Also in this case all the valuable elements of the gameplay of Watch Dogs 2 are brought into play, with particular emphasis on the stealth phases, the use of drones and the puzzles that appear when a particularly complex system needs to be violated. As mentioned, the single player component is supported in Human Conditions by a series of elite cooperative online challenges, which however we can also face fromonly when there are no users available for a game. One in particular, ~Sgancio~, will see us steal a drive and immediately after a vehicle while we are dealing with armored guards that are anything but friendly. Playstation 4 trophies There are just four Trophies in Watch Dogs: Human Conditions, all of them silver: to obtain them, simply complete the three single-player missions and the cooperative mission ~Unhooking~. In conclusion Whether or not you are a fan of Watch Dogs 2's dynamic multiplayer, undoubtedly less populated now than at the launch of the game, Human Conditions stands as a fairly rich package, which guarantees five hours of gameplay considering only the single player missions (so much so we put to complete them, in fact) and the pleasant outline of an online that certainly has a lot to give to those who want to experience its facets. The design of the missions brings into play a synthesis of what the Ubisoft title has been able to express best, focusing strongly on stealth action and raid planning, with a certain degree of difficulty in the presence of new enemies equipped with jammers (which go inevitably deactivated, under penalty of malfunctioning of any electronic gadget, drones included) and the ability to finally address highly topical issues instead of remaining glued to the light-hearted and ~young~ atmospheres that characterize the original campaign, with a few brief exceptions. A DLC that is therefore worth buying, better if in view of the Season Pass, so as to make the relationship between hours of play and purchase price even more convenient.", "date": "2017-02-22", "grade": null}
