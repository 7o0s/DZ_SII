In fact, what could be simpler and more immediate than a game that can be controlled with just one finger? Sometimes the developers have managed to introduce elements of variation and a minimum of thickness in this formula, intrinsically limited, and this is precisely the case of Jetpack Joyride, which has recently reached the remarkable figure of fourteen million downloads and transformed in the meantime into a freemium product . The Halfbrick Studios title offers the classic ~survival~ formula of running games, or the ~one-off match~ in which we try to get as far as possible until we hit an obstacle, but enriching it with a scenario structure, capable of emphasizing the sense of progression, and with a series of nice upgrades that can allow us to proceed for a few tens of meters more without major difficulties and set new records. Blot, the action game developed by Majestic Software, tries to do the same things and obviously aims to achieve the same success, even though it can't count on the intuitions and the now very recognizable style of the authors of Jetpack Joyride and Monster Dash. The protagonist of the game is an inkblot that is ~launched~ by a brush at the beginning of the game and then proceeds towards the right of the screen, intending to go as far as possible without crashing into one of the numerous obstacles present. The controls, needless to say, are very simple: if we hold a finger on the touch screen, in any area of the screen, the character moves up; if we raise our finger, the character ~falls~ downwards, in an inertial context identical to the one we already know well. deBlob and his brothers In Blot the scenario basically doesn't change, there are no ~zones~ that affect the scrolling speed of the background and allow us to take a breather after a particularly demanding session. From this point of view, the game proves to be extremely traditionalist and renounces introducing substantial innovations, even if the presence of upgrades for the character can still represent a variation on the theme. While moving, our inkblot can in fact collect not only coins, but also bonuses that increase its size, until an ~explosion~ occurs and we are projected very quickly forward, in a boost that ~deflates~ us again and allows us to advance for a while without worrying about avoiding anything. Other elements of variation are made up of colored inks, which work like a magnet for the coins that are around. And speaking of coins, all those we have collected during the various games are ~stored~ and can be spent on the purchase of purely aesthetic upgrades or accessories. If you don't have the patience to collect the necessary number of coins, you can also buy them using real money (79 cents for 25,000 coins, 1.59 euros for 50,000 coins and so on). As far as the technical sector is concerned, it must be recognized that Blot's graphic style is truly particular and contrasts vivid and colored elements (ink blot, pencils, buttons, etc.) with scenarios drawn by hand with the chiaroscuro technique .", "date": "2012-03-06", "grade": "7.2"}
