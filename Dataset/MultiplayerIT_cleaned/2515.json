{"name": "Hostile Waters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hostile-waters.html", "text": "Rage Attack: Graphics Hostile Waters is the latest game released by the English software house Rage, responsible for well-known games such as the discrete Expendable and Incoming or the recent Off Road, a mediocre racing game analyzed by yours truly recently. One of the peculiarities of this English software house is that of pulling decidedly powerful graphics engines out of its cylinder, sometimes also used as a kind of real benchmarks to measure the potential of PCs and, first of all, of modern video cards, to which games from this software house have often been bundled (Expendable is a good example in this regard). As already said on the occasion of the preview of this Hostile Waters, the system requirements are not very huge (rightly or not) as happens too often in recent times and with my P3 500, 256 mb of ram and GeForce DDR there were there any issues at max detail at 1024x768x32 resolution. The minimum system requirements consist of a P2 266, 64 bm of ram and 8mb Agp video card which fully supports the Direct 3d protocol. Graphically, the game does not betray its birth: first of all, the vehicles are made in a decidedly excellent way, thanks to an excellent number of polygons and some really well-made textures! The backdrops are also well thought out and with those huge towers or those large warehouses they really make you want to take some screenshots just for the sake of making some wallpaper. The already excellent visual sector is completed by the atmospheric changes and the explosions: even if decidedly sudden (obviously, one might say), it is very suggestive to see a sunny sunny day transform into a blue night full of stars, subsequently detached from a harsh rain or see the sun rise. As far as explosions are concerned, we are in full Rage style: those who already know them cannot help but review the excellent particle effects studied by British coders, those who have never seen a Rage game in action well, at first a sigh of 'admiration will certainly peep out. ...and sound Not having the Italian language version at hand, the undersigned cannot help but congratulate you on the choice of the sixteen actors who dub the various characters included in the English video game package, for a good selection of sound effects and for the atmospheric music are well suited to what happens on the screen since, with extreme ease, you pass from silence to ~relaxing~ music (perhaps when you absorb energy from the surrounding wreckage) or epic, when you are in the middle of the success of a mission or during a briefing. Hostility in progress? Lately it seems that the strategic video game genre is changing its face, even if in part, given that alongside now consolidated game structures (such as Red Alert 2), there have also been alternative game styles titles (in a decidedly marked way or only for the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional graphics) such as Ground Control (and related expansion Dark Conspiracy), HomeWorld (add-on Catclysm attached) and the wonderful Sacrifice; Hostile Waters is a strategy game that, even if excessively, goes beyond the stereotypes of the genre, generating game situations worthy of an action game such as, just to name one, Incoming^_^, resulting in a well thought-out hybrid between the two genres videogames. This does not mean that a good tutorial section would not have hurt, above all if a neophyte who takes hold of a strategist who perhaps is looking for something different to the usual Quake and Unreal, given that the aids that are given before each mission do not seem worthily replace the practice sections inserted, just to mention a couple of famous names, in Sacrifice or Black & White. Therefore, if the rts rookie can find himself in a bit of difficulty at the beginning, the veterans will not have the slightest difficulty in managing the various means made available by the programssorry, by the adaptive ship ^_^: we start with the unarmored Pegasus helicopter (to then move on to the armed one, the Hornet) and with the Scarab, a land vehicle capable of absorbing the energy that is found in the areas we will visit but progressing, little by little, other vehicles will join such as the Vulture fighter-bander and the Sentinel platform (transportable by helicopter, being static). To give the gamer some time to get used to the game structure, Antaeus is initially damaged and until it is completely repaired the rebels will not be able to take full advantage of its power and abilities, leaving us users time to learn the basics. Unlike the US version (distributed byInterplay), still unreleased, the European version does not have a multiplayer game mode, thus ending up being placed on the shelf once the lodge is destroyed. What do we think? Hostile Waters is a good game, with an excellent technical realization, a good playability but it pays off a lot in longevity since once the lodge has been definitively destroyed and peace has been restored to the world, it will be difficult for you to take the game back, especially in this period thriving with good videogame productions (see Fallout Tactics, Desperados, Severance and, last but not least, Black & White); in addition to this, it must be said that there will certainly be some RTS fanatic who will resist the engaging narration and the originality of some sections since the present title Rage is not a strategic game in all respects, as has already happened for the wonderful Sacrifice (here however to a lesser extent, thanks to the captivating fantasy setting and excellent multiplayer section of the acclaimed Interplay title). As far as I'm concerned, as a fan of videogames made with care, without particular defects and, therefore, not a fan of a single videogame genre to the detriment of others, I recommend the purchase of Hostile Waters to everyone, perhaps with the dispassionate advice first of all to try the substantial demo of over 100mb residing in our vast files area to be sure of the purchase. Really good game, keep it up Rage! Background We are in the twenty-first century, more precisely in 2032; after centuries and centuries of bloodshed it seems that the moment of peace has finally come for planet Earth: no more barbarism, looting, bandaging, robberies, only a real open-eyed dream, realized thanks to the collaboration of the powerful of our planet, united under the banner of peace. Unfortunately proverbs always have a grain of truth and the one that speaks of ~the calm before the storm~ is no exception: some shady figures of the caliber of tycoons, politicians, violent men, ambassadors, heads of state give life to the Old War Cabal, a terrorist organization that intends to plunge the Earth into the darkest desperation precisely with everything that had finally been banned: coups d'tat, sabotage, colossal robberies, large-scale destruction that would definitively bury these moments, perhaps too utopian to last forever eternal. Obviously a minority of terrestrials has given rise to a form of resistance that seeks to blow up the plans of the Old War Cabal, but the huge round of capital behind this organization has meant that a real army was created made up of the most modern military means such as helicopters, tanks, fighter jets, highly efficient radars and so on. The lodge's decisive assault involves a massive attack that will start from 20 artificial islands in the Pacific, taking advantage of the fact that weapons on Earth are now a reminder of dark times and that no one, with the exception of members of the Old War Cabal, knows minimally how to use. Luck (or fate?) wanted the Antaeus to end up in the hands of the rebels, a gigantic warship that for unknown reasons rested on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. In addition to being huge and full of weapons, Antaeus (prototype number 00) has a peculiarity that distinguishes it from the other flagships: it is an adaptive cruiser (adaptive cruser), a term that indicates the possibility of creating, through some machinery capable to work on precious metals, military weapons such as helicopters, planes, jeeps and much more. Someone with a little wit will surely wonder who will use these means if civilization had by now forgotten the use of weapons ... the answer is that to pilot the various means of war produced by the Adaptive Cruiser Antaeus there are the brains of soldiers dead in the past!!! The secret is contained in the Soulcatcher chips, found in large quantities in the Antaeus: these chips were used by the crews of the adaptive ships (Antaeus obviously included) and upon their death the chips continued to live, with thoughts, emotions and, above all , the skills and peculiarities of each fighter.
