A few months ago it was The Seven Deadly Sins' turn, and now it's the turn of another perhaps less well-known but equally worthy of attention series: Little Witch Academia. The operation this time was perhaps made even a little more complex by the fragmented starting point: Little Witch Academia was born first as a couple of short films made by Trigger Inc, later revised to make two anime series available on Netflix since last summer, and then three manga series edited by the Japanese publishing house Sheisha. In any case, if you have already had the opportunity to enjoy the adventures of Akko and company at the New Moon Academy, it is really difficult that Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time fails to warm your heart at least a little. Wait a minute, this isn't Hogwarts Little Witch Academia tells the story of young Akko's adventures: after seeing the exploits of Lady Chariot, a beautiful and charming witch, she enrolls in turn at the Luna Nuova Academy to follow in the footsteps of her idol and become just as smart ; his dream, just to underline the moral ~we make beautiful things because it's beautiful to do them~, is to make people happy. But there is a basic problem: Akko has no predisposition for magic and however enthusiastic, exuberant and endowed with good will, she immediately reveals herself as clumsy, listless and unable to perform the simplest spells. During the two seasons of the anime series currently available, she still manages to make a lot of friends, to have fun in life at the academy and to survive a series of adventures that lead her to understand that she too can have a future as a witch: just have good will. This premise, devoid of any type of spoiler, will give you some idea of the context within which you will be immediately thrown by Bandai Namco: the story of Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time begins with the conclusion of the first school year at 'New Moon Academy, when Akko's first good dose of adventures have already ended. Taking all the previous events for granted can suggest a sense of confusion, especially for those who have found the video game in their hands without knowing anything about the brand, but don't worry because nothing has been left to chance: in the first hours of the game the title allows you to explore the past of the main characters, including obviously Akko, Sucy and Lotte, thus becoming aware of their character, their aspirations and their previous actions through short animated films. The retrospective narration takes place by Akko's voice, which makes it extremely nice, original and funny in this way; everything seemed well taken care of, as well as the idea of telling a completely unpublished story of Little Witch Academia, which revolves around the mysteries of the Academy and the discovery of the Horologium Room. When Akko, grounded for the umpteenth time, discovers this mysterious hidden room in the library of the Academy, things will no longer be the same for her and her friends: time has stopped, prompting everyone to relive (apparently for always) the last 24 hours. Will Akko be able to discover the origin of the Horologium and break the infinite loop in which he threw the New Moon? Playstation 4 trophies Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time presents a juicy list of trophies on PlayStation 4, including seven Gold Trophies and the coveted Platinum. For the moment there seem to be no missable objectives, and obtaining all the trophies should ~simply~ require the completion of all the dungeons, in addition to finding the various collectibles hidden here and there for the New Moon. A decidedly affordable challenge, where the only obstacle will be the amount of time required. Witches like scrolling beat 'em ups As already happened with The Seven Deadly Sins: Kinghts of Britannia, also in this second title Bandai Namco has tried as far as possible to invent something fresh and original, which in some way did not already know ~already seen elsewhere~ at the first impact. Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time has thus become a curious hybrid between the role-playing game, the generic adventure, and above all the scrolling fighting game: how these elements work together without burning the minestrone is not clear, all that that we can tell you is that Akko's adventures not only entertained us for several hours, but also put us in front of solutions from time to timenew and unexpected. Just like Akko, we find ourselves living the daily routine inside the New Moon Academy, slowly exploring every room, corridor and secret place: we will be able to stop and chat with classmates (all familiar faces from the anime of course), running around the classrooms with the funny gait of the protagonist, eavesdropping on the conversations of small groups of students, all while following the ~plot~ of Akko's new adventures. Not all the various buildings are naturally available from the start, and from time to time we will notice objects with which we cannot interact for the moment: we will first have to unlock the protagonist's spells, which are also useful for completing side missions assigned to us by non-player characters ( mainly teachers). Did our beloved Ursula break a bucket of water? We need a nice repair spell... one that even Akko can cast. If between one mission and another we find ourselves chatting, walking, running and reading many lines of conversation in the dialogues between the characters, from the moment we open the doors of the Clock Room we will activate the second game mode of Little Witch Academia : Chamber of Time: the scrolling fighting game. Bandai Namco teleports us, in a party of three players (two of whom are controlled by artificial intelligence) inside exotic and mysterious dungeons, where our goal will be to reach the end of the path unharmed by eliminating all the enemies in our path . If you are looking for a difficulty level that can challenge you, however, it is certainly not Little Witch Academia: Chambers of Time that you should watch: Bandai has thought of the title as a pleasant adventure even for the little ones, or in any case to play in family. We were never really in trouble against a particular boss or enemy, we never really got lost and in general any attack launched at the right time did its duty. From this point of view it should be emphasized that however colorful and different from each other, the dungeons certainly do not stand out from the point of view of level design: the path is always rather linear, the enemies weak, the attacks of our character more or less similar, although distinguished between light and loaded; obviously there are special spells to be activated with L1+R1 and a certain key combination, and fortunately the fighting style changes minimally depending on the selected character (a good number of Akko's friends prove to be playable in the fighting game phases) . Despite a practically absent difficulty and an extreme simplicity of the basic mechanics of each game mode proposed, the mix of proposals of Little Witch Academia is still interesting and valid, obviously considered for what the title wants to be: the opportunity to discover the adventures of the series from the point of view of the videogame medium, leaving its charisma and atmosphere intact, so that everything remains accessible to any type of player. Also know that there is a multiplayer mode both online and offline, but that it will be added with the day one patch: we have therefore not been able to try it for the moment, even if we are aware that it will allow you to face the dungeons not only in the expected classic mode from the main adventure, but also in that Infinite Dungeon with which to proceed gradually deeper and deeper and against more powerful creatures.", "date": "2018-05-15", "grade": "7.5"}
