{"name": "Forgotton Anne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forgotton-anne-recensione.html", "text": "Forgotton Anne undoubtedly stands as one of the most interesting dynamic adventures of recent years, as our first review of the game already anticipated. The experience cleverly packaged by ThroughLine Games projects us into an alternative and mysterious world, in which all the objects forgotten by people end up, finding ourselves with a conscience and possibly a role in the perspective of a society that is very reminiscent of the times of the industrial revolution. However, it is not a perfect place, and in fact the story starts from a real attack organized by Forgotten rebels, which cause several explosions in strategic areas and block the functioning of the city. The protagonist of the story, Anne, plays the role of Agent and her job is to maintain order, even at the cost of absorbing the vital energy of objects that have violated the rules. An ability that comes from the Ark, a special device that the girl wears like a bracelet and which plays a central role in the game's puzzle mechanics. Moving within a two-and-a-half-dimensional scenario with an approach very similar to that of the classic Flashback, including jumps and handholds, we will have to interact with various Forgotten Ones, identify the culprits of what happened and use the Ark to fix the things. But will everything really be that simple? Gameplay and structure Forgotton Anne strikes you right from the start thanks to a careful direction and a perfect anime-style narration, which obviously extends to the graphics, whether it be cutscenes or in-game action. The quality of the animations fluctuates and with a higher number of frames the production would have literally taken flight, but the developers and artists have been able to remedy these deficiencies with a series of very effective intuitions, which contribute together with the excellent orchestral soundtrack to create a solid, easily recognizable atmosphere, which substantially increases the degree of involvement in the adventure and pushes us to complete it almost all in one go, in a handful of sessions. It takes about seven hours to get to the end and the puzzles are well balanced in terms of challenge, which means that solving them will be tantalizing but will rarely see us stuck for more than a few minutes thinking about how to make a certain mechanism work. As mentioned, the Ark plays a central role in these mechanics: activating it, it is possible to scan the environment in search of switches and energy sources, modifying the flows of the pipelines, removing charge from one object and moving it to another, all while always paying pay attention to the available slots and make them enough in a context that sometimes also includes a minimum of backtracking. The formula works very well and is introduced effectively in the first few minutes of the iOS version: just enough to click without hesitation on the button that leads us to purchase the complete product for 9.99 euros. A figure that corresponds to half of what is required on consoles (but not on Steam, given the current promotion), although in this case we can count on more precise controls. The repositionable virtual sticks do their job discreetly, in fact, but there are situations in which a little speed is required and it is in this situation that things do not work at their best: a pity. However, this is a secondary aspect compared to the general quality of a product which is undoubtedly enjoyable and well made, with texts translated into Italian (and dialogues spoken in English) for even more immediate use.", "date": "2019-07-05", "grade": "8.5"}
