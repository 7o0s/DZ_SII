The reasons are simple. First of all, Final Fantasy Tactics has a PSP version released a few years ago and is therefore the first objective yardstick as a videogame genre and as a console. Furthermore, Final Fantasy Tactics is much more famous than Tactics Ogre, mainly due to the well-known franchise from which it takes its name. What not everyone knows, however, is that in the beginning it was Tactics Ogre, then Squaresoft saw that it was good and right and cloned it. Or rather, in 1995 Yasumi Matsuno, who had directed the Ogre Battle series, left the Quest company to join Squaresoft, for which he designed Final Fantasy Tactics, drawing extensive inspiration from his previous Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together for SNES. In short, this PSP version is nothing more than a remake of that Tactics Ogre dated 1995 (which had already been re-proposed on PlayStaton One years later) and bears the Square Enix signature since, in the meantime, the very famous Japanese company has absorbed Quest and the rights on the franchise. This is also a good and right thing, because now we can enjoy this milestone and hope for possible sequels of equally extraordinary quality. War and peace Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together shares with Final Fantasy Tactics in the first place an obsessive care for the story and its characters. This is not the typical JRPG in which a complicated protagonist discovers the meaning of friendship a moment before the final battle with the megalomaniac (equally complicated) on duty. Matsuno's narrative aims are a little higher. The political framework of the world in which the game is set is clearly delineated through the numerous dialogues between the characters and is a disheartening panorama made of endless wars, misery and corruption. Yet, Matsuno shows us how not everything is so obvious, so black or white. The protagonist Denam Pavel will find out the hard way, trying to fight for the just cause, whatever it is, in order to end the war and restore peace in the name of his loved ones and his country. But Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together is not a linear story and Denam, or the player in his shoes, will have to make choices, often moral, while keeping his finger suspended on the button reflecting on the implications of his decision. In essence, the plot of the game can take many different and unexpected turns, drastically altering the unfolding of events, even changing the title and theme of the four chapters that compose it. Some events will occur and some will not, only certain alliances or battles will be accessible, some characters will lose their lives and others will survive. Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together sets itself up for multiple matches if only to find out what would have happened if we had taken a different path. The story, full of twists and turns and dramatic moments, also has the advantage of being written in cultured, refined and absolutely wonderful English. The jokes of the characters seem to come directly from an epic tale of other times and, in general, it is difficult to find a story on the market at the moment that makes you think like the one developed by the brilliant Matsuno. Swords, Shields and Fantasy Those who have already played and digested Final Fantasy Tactics, on PlayStation One or PSP, will be perfectly at ease in the countless fights of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. The differences are very minimal and the game maintains the same, identical structure: the player controls a group of characters on an isometric grid, on which the conflict develops with enemy forces, often with an overwhelming numerical advantage. Orders are given to each unit when it is its turn to act, moving it within its field of action and using its weapons or abilities to interact with allies or opponents. Nothing new under the sun, therefore, and apart from the management of Magic Points, which in this case are not available from the start but are loaded from turn to turn, the differences from the typical gameplay that characterizes this genre are much more subtle and less showy. Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together certainly presents a truly complex and satisfying micromanagement of troops, objects and skills, supported by a rather innovative system that allows you to increase the experience level of each class rather than each character. At the end of each battle, Skill Points are also earned, this time linked to the specific unit that took part in the conflict, with which it is possible to purchase the specific skills of the various classes and then equip them, providing our characters with bonuses and additional tools. A live result resultsThe very high customization level, which allows you to create your own ad hoc army, even recruiting monsters and dragons, and changing the role of each character practically at will by choosing from one of the many classes available. From this point of view, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together proves to be a perfectly balanced product that allows players to choose the approach they prefer to face certain battles, without punishing them for their mistakes thanks also to the new Chariot System, the which allows you to rewind the game by going back to one of the last forty rounds and starting from there as if nothing had happened. Graphics & Sound From an aesthetic point of view Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together certainly does not cry out for a miracle, but offers an extremely similar aspect to the one proposed in 1995 but discreetly updated to the capabilities of the PSP. It is in particular the settings that show off a greater number of colors and details, while the sprites of the various characters have not equally enjoyed the same improvement, in fact quite essential both in terms of design and animations, especially when compared to those of Final Fantasy Tactics . The special effects of spells and abilities have instead received a complete restyling which sometimes uses particle effects or lens flare to make the final result more convincing. In general, the appearance of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together is rather simple but absolutely enjoyable, clean and free of smudges. This has also benefited the fluidity of the clashes since the loads are practically non-existent, especially after the optional installation, further improving the gaming experience. The graphic update work also involved the artwork and the map, which now more closely resemble the elegant style of Akihiko Yoshida, and the menus, streamlined and clean even if organized in a rather confusing way. The splendid remastered soundtrack by Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata closes the circle, once again reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics, on which the team worked for the original edition and the 2007 port, and at times even superior in variety and complexity of the tracks.", "date": "2011-03-10", "grade": "9.2"}
