Their fame quickly led them from the physical to the virtual world, resulting in dozens of videogame productions of more or less overwhelming success. If before the spotlights were focused on licensing agreements with various film production companies (and not only), in recent years LEGO seems to have understood that the strength of its brand does not lie so much in commercial ties (fundamental, for heaven's sake), but in the product itself, i.e. its iconic bricks. Thus, we got to witness what seems like a mix between a detour from the beaten track and a ~back to basics~. This has been demonstrated by video games such as the Minecraft-like LEGO Worlds or, more recently, LEGO Builder's Journey, a miniature adventure capable of showing how far one can technically push the use of famous constructions within a virtual world . The LEGO Bricktales review tells how this game is almost a cross between the two products just mentioned. A miniature adventure LEGO Bricktales: A new adventure, this time in pursuit of happiness Although LEGOs are much more than simple toys, when it comes to transposing them for the gaming market, we always try to keep a fairly large target, which winks at both adults and children. LEGO Bricktales is no exception. Indeed, perhaps the balance in this case points more towards the very young. You can already understand it from the first moments of the game: a scientist grandfather who tries to get his amusement park back on its feet, a talking robot who flutters around it, a journey through space and time in search of happiness (and we are not talking about something metaphorical or conceptually high, but just bricks of happiness, which will serve to feed the new grandfather's amusement park). All of this in a world (indeed, more than one) where evil does not exist and, if it exists, it is only given by a silly mistake, something unwanted. There is no meanness, there are no double meanings, there is no violence nor death. Bricktales is that video game that every parent would like their child to play; what the aunt gives to the birthday. But don't misunderstand, this does not indicate a qualitative deficiency. Maybe get a game like this from your aunt for your birthday! While using the entire narrative system as a mere pretext to pack an adventure between fantastic worlds, the peculiarity that distinguishes this from hundreds of other titles that aim to eliminate violence and frenetic action from their curriculum is the fact that there is actually something to do between one useless dialogue and another. And this is certainly all thanks to the very nature of LEGO, born to create. Building the world, one brick at a time LEGO Bricktales: a real ~building~ experience When you think of LEGO, the first thing that comes to mind is: building. And in Bricktales the core of the game is just that. To rebuild grandfather's park, we must embark on a space-time adventure together with the trusty robot Rusty, capable of opening multidimensional portals that allow us to travel in different thematic contexts (five in all), from the wildest jungle to the atolls of the pirates. Immersed in small maps, similar to dioramas with a square base, we must help the characteristic characters (stereotypes more than the stereotype itself) to solve their problems, so that they can reward us with a brick of Happiness, which will serve to feed the park and to bring Grandpa's rides back to life. So far it just seems like going back and forth like jockeys to please a bunch of NPCs. But it is precisely at this point that the trump card linked to the brand comes into play: the construction. The title, in fact, asks us to build bridges, roads and mechanisms that facilitate our movement within the explorable environments, as well as creating engineering and non-engineering works that meet the requirements of the characters who ask us for them. In these cases, the game moves to a sort of ~work table~ (something between a Kerbal Space Program and a Besiege, with all the simplifications of the case) where you can build from scratch and test your work, most of the time without a precise guide on how to proceed (at best, we are given a structure to copy or a more or less complex puzzle to assemble correctly). Here creativity and ingenuity come together, pushing the player to think outside the box, but taking into account the structural stability of his work. Just to give an example,if we are building a bridge, joining the two banks with a trivial and weak row of bricks will prove useless when simulating the effective effectiveness of the construction, given that the game offers a fairly realistic physics management, with single parts that separate in case there is even partial instability. he feels the desire to involve adults as well through a challenge rate that is often very high. You need to know how to make the most of every piece made available, even if not in the ~conventional~ way thought by the developers themselves. This does not mean that it is excessively difficult to proceed in some sections, but a certain amount of ingenuity is certainly required that anyone, big or small, is able to apply, even at the cost of perhaps spending an entire hour on the same construction. LEGO Bricktales: A World Without Evil What, on the other hand, will always remain a bit complex to translate into a virtual format is the construction itself. Although the authors of Bricktales are committed to proposing a positioning system that is as intuitive and varied as possible, that sensation of mechanicalness always remains which makes the process a little frustrating and not very immediate, often leading to an unclear reading of the actual placement of the pieces that wastes a lot of time understanding where the brick is actually fitting. The dilemma of duration LEGO Bricktales: the shop where you can buy clothing and special bricks How long does a game like LEGO Bricktales last? The answer is: it depends on who plays it. An engineer or even just an avid block fan, used to building entire cities, might be able to complete the game in a snap of his fingers. But the same also applies to a particularly creative child, who manages to find new and unexplored ways of thinking about an infrastructure precisely because of his still not too conditioned conception of the work of man. We, who unfortunately are neither, completed the main adventure in just over thirteen hours and the counter shows that we have only completed 52% of the game. But don't be fooled. There are no side quests with intricate story lines. What we are missing from the appeal are essentially the collectibles, to be recovered by retracing one's steps and exploring the different biomes with the new skills learned (five too, like the worlds). In addition to this, to add to the list of completeness we also find the clothes with which we can customize our alter ego (thematic ones to buy in the game shops with fictitious currency add to an already quite substantial number provided since the beginning of the adventure) and the special bricks with which we can go back to rethinking every single structure built, in a free mode that gives full rein to the player's imagination. During the adventure the heaviness of going back and forth several times, perhaps even just for useless interactions with characters who have practically nothing to say, made itself felt, so we let you imagine what it could be like to go hunting for collectibles that do not add basically nothing to the game except a few more hours in front of the screen. The visual quality of LEGOs LEGO Bricktales: A ~diorama~ of the game The appeal of LEGO in everyday life lies largely in their different textures and in the way they intertwine with each other when we fit the pieces together. This particular quality is something that has been absent for a long time within the Danish brand's video games, either due to the lack of adequate technologies, or due to the greater ease of creating a semi-realistic three-dimensional environment in which to then insert elements made of LEGO. However, first with Worlds, and then with Builder's Journey, the potential of a world made entirely of colored bricks demonstrated the importance of visual and stylistic coherence within products of this kind, so much so that the latter is a tip of technological diamond, perhaps more a technical demonstration than a real video game. With LEGO Bricktales the hope was to witness a continuation of the proud march holding the banner of the technical reference point in hand, but we settled instead , on a less daring middle ground. We have had the opportunity to try the game on PC at maximum graphic detail and it absolutely cannot be said that it is a technically unsatisfactory game. The quality is undoubted, gthanks mainly to a lighting system that does well more than half of the work, but we are far from the refinement and ~tactile ability~ that Builder's Journey returned. However, considering the reference target and the prospects for a similar game, the result is much more than satisfactory.", "date": "2022-10-11", "grade": "7.8"}
