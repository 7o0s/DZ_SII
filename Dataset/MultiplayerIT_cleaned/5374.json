{"name": "ABZ", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/171937-abzu-un-mare-di-emozioni.html", "text": "Considered by many to be Thatgamecompany's best work, Journey was undoubtedly a divisive title, capable of polarizing players into irremovable detractors and absolute worshipers of its essential, minimal and undoubtedly secondary gameplay compared to the extraordinary strength of the artistic component and the evocative atmosphere. It is certainly no coincidence that Matt Nava and Austin Wintory, respectively art director and composer of the game in question, have chosen for the debut of their new studio Giant Squid a setting - at least in appearance - at the opposite extreme from that of the previous work : from an arid and inhospitable desert to a very rich, colorful, teeming and luxuriant ocean. ABZ, this is the name of the game, puts you in the shoes of an anonymous underwater explorer, engaged in chasing relics and signs of a mysterious ancient civilization closely linked to the sea and discovering what her own role is within the story, her origin and the connection with the aquatic realm. All narrated through hieroglyphs (another dj-vu), which help to give some clues about a plot that remains, however, rather abstract until its conclusion. ABZ is a journey into the depths of the sea destined to leave an indelible mark on one's heart The underwater world ABZ does nothing to mask the similarities with Journey, to the point that it would not be wrong to consider it in all respects as a sequel, not only spiritual, of the Sony production: most of the mechanics have in fact been taken directly, despite the freedom of 360-degree movement guaranteed by the action of the swim brings with it some noticeable differences. With regard to this last component, the will of the development team was clear from the beginning: in ABZ there is no need to breathe, which is why the player can concentrate totally on the progression, in such a way as to be able to enjoy it in the way as close as possible to the one thought by the developers. Giant Squid's effort is destined to prove at least familiar to fans of the ~progenitor~, starting with the mode of interaction with the environment which passes almost exclusively through pressing the square button. In fact, this command produces a sound, thanks to which it is possible both to activate objects and switches, and to be followed for some time by marine creatures, and finally to ~dialogue~ with some drones that accompany the protagonist in the early stages of the story, in an almost identical way as happened in Journey when meeting other characters (although in this case there is no multiplayer mode). The control system then offers other functions, not strictly necessary in practice but contextualized within the very concept of the game mechanics, which seeks to untie the product from the classic dictates of video games, trying rather to offer an experience lived through emotions , colors, moments, sounds. Therefore, with X you can increase the speed (and get a short boost after 3 timed pressures), with the circle you perform a kind of pirouette, while with L2 you can cling to fish and large creatures and exploit their characteristics to swim with them. All this, together with the permissive management of inertia and fluid dynamics resistance, often makes the game phases of ABZ more similar to a dance, a very elegant and evocative ballet, in which different beings participate, each bearer of something unique and special. In a product of this type, it is clear that the creation of a captivating setting is an essential element, and it is precisely in this direction that Matt Nava and his companions have moved: much more than the heroine, which in fact is little more than a sketched and stylized avatar, the real protagonist of the game is the ocean itself, its inhabitants and its colors, the lush vegetation of some areas next to the cold and bare darkness of others: as you enter the abyss, more and more depth, one is overwhelmed by a succession of situations and emotions that outline the contours of a dreamlike and surreal journey, capable of remaining imprinted not only in the player's eyes, but also in the mind and heart. The artistic direction is in fact sublime, to the point of making ABZ beautiful to see despite the fact that the polygonal count and the effects are decidedly far from impressive. Colors, lights and shadows are used as if by a painter on a canvas, and we are absolutely certain that many will find themselves almost ~forced~ to often press the share button to save snapshots of the many significant moments. Musical triumph I wash itro of the team, in addition to being highly inspired, is also remarkable in some purely numerical aspects. For example, the reproduced species of fish, about a hundred: an effort that becomes tangible and concrete when you find yourself enjoying the discovery of the individual creatures, their unique behavior and participation in the food chain in which the most big eats the small one. The contemplative element proves to be enormously stronger than in Journey, thanks to this attention to detail which can transform ABZ, if the user wishes, into a kind of huge, very rich and colorful aquarium. Precisely to tickle the pleasure of these players, the team has inserted a series of special totems scattered among the backdrops, above which it is allowed to place one's own avatar in the meditation phase, and then ask the camera to follow the various single fish present in the area, moving your gaze from one to the other simply by moving the analog stick. In all this succession of positive adjectives, we do not think we are doing any of the artists who worked on ABZ an injustice by stating that the most important and incisive component of the entire product is the musical accompaniment by Austin Wintory, one of the most crystalline talents present on the global digital entertainment scene today. Playing ABZU with the sound muted is like ripping out its soul, stripping it of its essence. The orchestrated pieces composed by the American author in fact represent a main and essential ingredient of the adventure, contributing in a fundamental way to delineate every moment and to determine the changes of rhythm and atmosphere. A work like that of Giant Squid cannot be measured by the kilo, which is why it is almost demeaning to talk about durability. However, having to stick to the strict chronicle of our experience, it is enough to know that ABZ shares with Journey more or less also the time necessary to reach the end credits, which - proceeding in a rather rapid way - can be seen roughly after 3 hours. It is therefore probable that a large part of the user is destined to find himself concluding the adventure in a single, intoxicating and unforgettable session. Despite the absence of real and concrete stimuli for replayability in the strict sense, with the exception of trophies and the identification of all the statues for meditation, repeating the experience over again could be for many not only a desire but even a necessity, to be able to savor the atmosphere created by the Californian team and appreciate the infinite details that embellish every single feature with greater attention and calm.", "date": "2016-08-02", "grade": "9.0"}
