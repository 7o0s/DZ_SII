{"name": "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay.html", "text": "In jail! Escape From Butcher Bay is placed chronologically as an absolute prequel to the two films starring Vin Diesel, with the advantage of being able to boast a storyline placed at the service of the gameplay and not vice versa. The title thus opens with Riddick's arrival in Butcher Bay: after a ~dreamlike~ playable sequence and the usual introductions with the not very affable prison director Hoaxie, the introduction continues in full Half-Life style, with the user left free to look around as he is introduced inside the structure and the opening credits scroll cinematically on the screen. The initial impact with Escape From Butcher Bay truly leaves you breathless due to the exceptional quality of the audiovisual sector of the Starbreeze title: the massive use of normal mapping technology (the same used by the graphically superb Doom 3), combined with the excellent light and the extraordinary modeling of the characters on the screen cannot fail to leave you speechless, while the glimmer of the external hangar gives way to the gloomy darkness of the filthy corridors of Butcher Bay. In addition to a cosmetic that does not seem exaggerated to define as the best ever seen on Xbox so far, the Vivendi Universal product also amazes for the quality of the sound effects, the music and above all the dubbing reserved for the various characters, fortunately kept in its original language: and therefore not only the main protagonist, whose voice comes from Vin Diesel himself, but every single NPC in the game can count on interpretations provided by professional actors. In short, on a purely technical level, Escape From Butcher Bay proves to be absolutely devastating. And the exaltation caused by the galvanizing introductory sequence absolutely does not diminish once the actual game action begins, on the contrary, it even tends to increase. Mixing stealth, rpg, action and shooter elements framed from a first person perspective, the Starbreeze title fully succeeds in the enterprise of giving the user a playful experience as varied as it is incredibly rewarding, with the further advantage of being supported by a racial narrative structure. Continuing the game therefore becomes an impulse dictated not only by the exceptional pleasure of the gameplay, but also by the curiosity in discovering the developments of Riddick's intrepid escape from prison. Lots of (human) flesh on the fire As movie fans will certainly know, Riddick has a particular aptitude for darkness, dictated by the ability to be able to see perfectly in the dark. Although this power is not available from the beginning of the game, the user is still immediately urged to act in the shadows: like the best of Sam Fisher, Riddick can totally hide from the sight of enemies by crouching in dark areas, only to then come out at the moment just to take the guard on duty by surprise by snapping her neck or slitting her throat. There are even two types of rear assault, assigned to the back triggers, one slow and silent and the other faster but noisy and therefore susceptible to attracting the attention of nearby opponents. Also considering the possibility of dragging the corpses and hiding them in the shadows, of eliminating the light sources to one's advantage and of being able to lean out of the corners so as not to be seen, it is clear how Escape From Butcher Bay has all the requirements of a true stealth game is exactly. But the beauty of the Starbreeze title is precisely the fact that it is not a real stealth game. In fact, the game often alternates between these more ~silent~ sections and moments in which it is necessary to fight and set fire to the cannons. As for combat with bare hands or with white weapons (there are in fact various ranges of knives and clubs available), Escape From Butcher Bay contemplates four types of shots that can be carried out through combinations of the right trigger and the left stick, and a comfortable parry entrusted to the left trigger. The system, also complete with some counters with devastating effects, works great, making melee fights fun, challenging and extremely spectacular, thanks to the dynamic movements of the camera and the excellent polygonal models of the enemies, which they underline with hematomas and copious splashes the blows suffered were bloody. But one does not live on punches alone, and in fact Riddick does not at all disdain the use of pistols, shotguns and machine guns: and even in its role as FPS, the Vivendi Universal product manages to convince and excite the user, thanks to a sufficiently precise control and a satisfactory range of weapons and enemies to face, despite their not sublime level of AI. Obviously notsatisfied with having merged these three styles of play in an optimal way (despite some imbalances in certain points of the adventure), the programmers of Starbreeze have even decided to insert in their title some rpg elements useful to make the playful experience even more ~full . In fact, it is possible to interact with the numerous NPCs present within Butcher Bay, both to learn information and to buy objects or be assigned particular sub-quests. All this always leaving a certain freedom to the player, who for most of the adventure can decide how to face the enemies (attacking them directly or by surprise) as well as the behavior to adopt towards his fellow prisoners, both hostile or less. Vincent Gasolio In the absolute excellence of Escape From Butcher Bay cosmetics, the polygonal model of the protagonist Richard B. Riddick stands out for its quality, identical in all respects to its celluloid counterpart played by Vin Diesel. Miracles of normal mapping, thanks to which every single character in the game can boast extremely realistic and convincing features. Returning to our (anti) hero, in addition to his external characteristics, the Starbreeze programmers have also excellently implemented his peculiar ability to see in the dark, as effective in the game economy as refined in terms of graphics. Furthermore, thanks to the excellent dubbing of Vin himself, Riddick also retains the charisma and hilarious black humor that made him such a successful character. Is smoking good? During his adventure, Riddick will often come across a wide range of cigarette packs, which can be found and collected within the scenario or obtained as a reward from particular NPCs for completing certain objectives. In addition to representing small gems of black humor thanks to the improbable warnings printed on them, the cigarette packs serve to unlock a large series of extras including artwork, photos, trailers and even a couple of videos immortalizing a first, embryonic, version of the game. Comment Masterful from an audiovisual point of view, exciting and excellently constructed in terms of gameplay and compelling in terms of storyline, Escape From Butcher Bay is a title that surprises for its qualitative richness and for the substantial lack of major defects that could affect its global goodness. Part FPS, part stealth game, part rpg, the Starbreeze title is above all a genuinely fun video game, which boasts the great merit of having been able to merge different types of gameplay into a well-balanced and never frustrating or boring product. Precisely because it is so beautiful to see and play, it is a pity to note the relative brevity (10 hours are more than enough to complete it) and the lack of Live support of Escape From Butcher Bay, which in any case remains a title that no Xbox user should pass up Pros: Technically superb Excellent game structure Exciting storyline Great cinematic feel Cons: Uninspiring longevity Lack of Live mode No Italian subtitles Before finding himself fighting aliens on a planet immersed in darkness and facing the threat of the terrible Necromongers, the super-wanted Richerd B. Riddick was captured by the bounty hunter Johns and transported by them to the maximum security prison of Butcher Bay. A huge, gloomy stronghold located in a completely deserted wasteland, containing all the worst criminals in the galaxy and from which no one had ever escaped on their own legs.
