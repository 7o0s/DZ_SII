{"name": "Sega Rally", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-rally.html", "text": "Unfortunately, the answer to the introductory question can only be negative. In fact, this mobile version of the Sega franchise represents a dull and not at all convincing expression of a vein, that of rally games, which is becoming increasingly popular on mobile phones. In reality, the results have rarely been exciting, but specifically this attempt by Rockpool Games does not even deserve the attention of fans of the genre. A real pity, because the name is one of those capable of pricking up the ears, especially in those who lived through the golden age of arcades over 10 years ago. But beyond the high-sounding label, this Sega Rally really offers too little, detaching itself markedly from the more than pleasant edition that recently appeared on 360 and Ps3. The problems are practically on all levels, and only the aesthetic component manages to gain the sufficiency; the settings are in fact quite varied, and the 3d graphics engine guarantees an acceptable frame rate in every situation, while still allowing for an obvious pop-up of more complex structures, such as the mountains that appear a few meters from your car. Even the cars do not disappoint, thanks to a polygonal complexity that makes them recognizable and different from one model to another. Unfortunately the positive sides of the Glu production stop here; and so, if it is possible to turn a blind eye to the sound reduced to the bone, which requires you to choose between the unbearable noise of the engine or the very few effects, the same cannot be done for playability, dejected by a couple of truly deleterious choices . First of all the speed, simply soporific even with the best performing cars; the adrenaline and the sense of having to deal with hundreds of horsepower racing cars is completely absent here, and in this context the absence of a first-person view from the cockpit or from the bumper does not help at all. Secondly, the collisions with the 5 opponents are really too simplified, being reproduced with a simple and unrealistic bounce of your car. Certainly an arcade game is not synonymous with fidelity to reality, but in this case the programmers' choice is simply wrong and detrimental to the gameplay. But what's worse is the driving model, oversimplified and unable to convey the sensations of rally driving, starting with drifts with the handbrake on. Here, however, there is nothing left to do but steer left and right, since acceleration and shifting are automatic. The good amount of game modes, ranging from championship to time attack passing through the quick race, can therefore do little in the face of the shortcomings that this unfortunate Sega Rally brings with it.
