{"name": "Donkey Kong Country 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-country-3.html", "text": "The original platformer Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have disappeared. All that remains for Dixie is to start scouring the island in search of the missing with the help of Kiddy Kong, an ape still in diapers, but with a force not to be overlooked. While Dixie, thanks to her blond pigtail, can glide meekly from any height, Kiddy can break through some platforms, or rebound meekly on the surface of the water like a stone thrown grazing onto the mirror. The two will also be able to combine their moves to reach inaccessible points, or defeat the toughest enemies. Even the animal friends are back, ready to give their help for the good cause. In addition to the already known ~Enguarde~ the swordfish, ~Squitter~ (~Telino~ in Italian ...) the spider, and ~Squawks~ the parrot, the new ~Ellie~ is added, an elephant capable of sucking and shooting water, and interact with barrels. As per the platform manual, the various worlds that make up the game are divided by theme; their design this time does not fully convince, at least not in all levels. Perhaps more for the locations and styles chosen, than for the technical realization, which is always excellent. There will also be very suggestive scenarios, but considering the game as a whole we can say that the work done previously was not equal. The level design (understood as level structure, obstacle placement, etc) follows the classic mold of the series, sometimes with pleasant variations on the theme, but mostly the game does not go beyond what is expected. [C] The infamous Ghost Barrels... Appear at intervals and target enemies This impressive level also allows you to pass behind the waterfalls [/C] The conversion The GBA adaptation, as expected, has undergone the usual treatment which consists of a revision of the graphics sector to meet the display and resolution of the GBA, the addition of a few minigames scattered around the play area, and the revision of the 2D graphics, such as the various maps and menus. But what we didn't expect was the addition of an entire playable world (6 levels), and the total or almost total modification of the sound track. The latter had in fact not been as brilliant as the previous ones, although there were undoubtedly some very good tracks, such as the one that accompanied the levels set inside the tree trunks. However, the new compositions remain in line with the spirit of the series, they are adequate to the level, but equally they are not comparable to those of the first two works. The ~amarcord~ effect is certainly penalized by this choice, even if a couple of remixes from the first game peep out (small hints of a few notes more than anything else), those who have not tried the original will find in this GBA version a appreciable accompaniment. As usual headphones are recommended for best sound reproduction. Even the new levels integrate perfectly with the rest of the game, so much so that apart from a couple of levels that we didn't seem to remember, the rest felt completely familiar to us. With the appearance of a new boss we definitely realized the addition of the world. There are also some adjustments to the difficulty levels. Some steps have been simplified, and in general the game runs smoothly apart from a few levels. The last episode in this regard was much more challenging. The extras and bonuses As for the ~replayability~ factor, the game hides, as always, a large dose of secrets that push the player to retrace each level until every pixel has been explored. By means of the icons that will signal the end of the stage, you will be able to find out if you have collected all the bonus levels and if you have also collected the DK medallions jealously guarded by Koin. Your dedication will be rewarded with a rather tasty extra (the same as the SNES version). To completely finish the game you will have to collect every bonus and every DK coin in each level, without leaving anything out. Among the material added in this version we point out some missions to be tackled with Funky Kong's vehicles, training in Crunky's Dojo, and a sub-game made in Mode 7 similar to the bonus levels of Sonic 2 for Megadrive, where you have to collect the stars scattered throughout inside a tube. Obviously Sonic 2's levels were much more complex, unlike these which are perfectly straight, and definitely less fun. All extras that frankly we could do without. Donkey Kong Country3 closes a series that made history very well. Although it does not reach the heights of the first two episodes, the title still conquers the player until the end, and makes him want to replay all the stages nin the goal of finding the bonus levels. Frankly, we remembered it longer, we managed to complete everything within 10 hours, but it must be said that those who do not know the location of the bonuses will spend a lot of time sifting through every corner of the levels. Surely 8 worlds is not a few. If you liked the first episodes, you will also be satisfied with this new appointment, if, on the other hand, you are unrelated to the series, we advise you to recover the first episodes and then dedicate yourself to this final chapter. Pros: Good technical realization Tested and fun gameplay Added a new world Cons: On Snes and TV it's always better Less inspired than the previous ones No big news in the series Platformers were once one of the most successful genres. They came out galore: beautiful, ugly, strange, and unforgettable ones. The latter were usually Sega or Nintendo. The Donkey Kong Country series, developed by Rare then still an internal Nintendo team, is undoubtedly one of the unforgettable ones. The original title came out of nowhere, it began to be talked about in magazines (the internet was science fiction) that it was already ready, and it firmly established itself in the vast universe of platformers. The graphics were out of this world, the soundtrack creepy, while the game was fun, very well calibrated, full of levels, secrets and good gimmicks. With the second episode Rare managed to refine and create something even better and marked the maximum limit reached by this series. The third episode of facts is the most neglected of the three, perhaps due to a shorter development time (the Nintendo 64 had arrived) or perhaps because everything had already been done in the first episodes. While not reaching the balance of the first episodes, DKC3 is still a good game.", "date": "2005-11-21", "grade": null}
