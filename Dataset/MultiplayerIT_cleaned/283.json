{"name": "Killzone: Liberation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/killzone-liberation-2.html", "text": "Free me Killzone: Liberation, this is the title of the game in question, remains faithful to the shooter nature, however shifting the view towards a more suitable (for the characteristics of the console) raised isometric one. However, the chapter for PSP should not be understood as a simple re-edition of the original characterized by a different point of view; on the contrary, Liberation represents a solid original product with a good personality of its own. The story takes place immediately after the end of the episode for Ps2, thus going to constitute from this point of view a continuation of the events narrated previously; after blocking the invasion of the evil Helghast, the protagonist Templar this time has the task of going head-on to the attack in the territories still under their dominion to permanently eradicate the threat. Such a direct and dynamic plot could only find expression in an action game, and in fact Guerrilla's effort is basically this; the aim is to continue within the levels, with a pre-established and often well-defined path to cross, in order to achieve certain objectives. Often this is resolved only in an expedient to justify the need to cross the settings from one end to the other and thus face dozens of enemies, decidedly fierce and ready to put an early end to Templar's mission. Revolving around the fight, specifically with firearms, it is evident how the quality of this component is of fundamental importance for the overall evaluation of the title. Fortunately the programmers have found the right mix of arcade action with a pinch of tactics in order to prevent the premature flattening of the gaming experience; in particular, the good artificial intelligence of the opponents requires avoiding head-on attacks intended to lead to game over, but rather using elements of the environment to hide, evaluate the appropriate moments to attack and make the best use of the vast arsenal available . Yes, because the latter, which can count on classic shotguns and sniper rifles, pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers, bombs and so on, is suitably limited in its use by the possibility of carrying only one primary and one secondary weapon. Adding spice to everything is then a simple but fun interaction with your partner, in missions that involve the presence of an ally, thanks to the ability to issue orders with which to manage attacks in the best way. Also very interesting is the presence of vehicles, such as tanks, hovercrafts and jetpacks, which however would have been preferable to see implemented more often within the adventure; on the contrary, these are meetings reduced to a handful of occasions, which is a pity since they really represent a welcome added value. There is also an upgrade system, both through the collection of particular objects during the main mode and through the special tests included in the challenge mode, which gives an element of growth and development to your character and to the individual weapons, thus adding a further dose of depth. Helghast you will not have my scalp From a technical point of view, Killzone: Liberation is one of the most successful games on the PSP. By the term ~successful~ we therefore mean not only as regards the pure and simple polygonal complexity and the level of detail, however excellent, but in general for the style adopted by the Guerrilla artists. In fact, the settings, in addition to being distinguished by a good variety, represent in a realistic and very pleasant way a territory at war, desolate, with destroyed buildings, uprooted trees and landscapes distorted by the fury of weapons. A truly valuable result, which is a shame to see partially wasted in the face of poor development of the characters, the plot and the missions in general, all quite similar to each other. Indeed, after completing the Sony production, we could not be completely satisfied precisely because of the feeling that Liberation could have been truly something remarkable if the presentation had been more accurate and if the action had been better supported by a backbone, the plot, more robust and rewarding. And at the same time it is also a pity that the multiplayer mode, like most PSP games, is only available in an ad-hoc local version and not online, even if it must be said that the latter has been promised in the near future via additional download. What is available now is a rather basic multiplayer for up to 6 players, reduced to four modes such as deathmatch, team deathhmatch, assault and capture the flag. It goes without saying that the best is achieved with all 6 friends at the same time, and it is equally useless to consider this possibility extremely remote for the vast majority of users. The sound is very good, especially with regard to the really good value effects. Comment Killzone: Liberation is a game that deserves to be taken into consideration, even with its flaws. Fun, technically excellent, fairly deep and well programmed, the effort of the Guerrilla team is an action game capable of giving great satisfaction to every player who loves the genre. With a greater care in the diversification of the missions and a more intriguing development of characters and plot, Liberation could certainly have taken the plunge into the small circle of must have games. As it is, however, it remains a solid product that will certainly not make you regret the money spent to take it home. Pros Technically great Very entertaining Surprisingly deep Cons Lack of variety in missions Poor plot and character development Fluctuating difficulty After the debut with Killzone for Ps2, the Guerrilla team has decided to remain faithful to the brand in question, despite the critical and public response on that occasion has not been exactly exciting. A choice that can be shared in any case, given the effective goodness of the setting supported by an undoubtedly intriguing artistic direction. And so together with that Killzone 2 for Ps3, which appeared two years ago in a short trailer and then returned to the obscurity of its frenetic development, the Dutch boys have decided to create an original episode of the series for PSP too, this time detaching themselves from the genre of FPS in first person.", "date": "2006-11-10", "grade": null}
