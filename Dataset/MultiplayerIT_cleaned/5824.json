Even less if you are trying to conquer a throne and there is no way to recover the hard-earned upgrades up to that point. Yet this is exactly what happens in Nuclear Throne, the new roguelike developed by Vlambeer which, after a very long gestation in the early access limbo, has finally arrived at its definitive version. A roguelike that expertly doses the player's frustration: here is Nuclear Throne! No mercy Far from proposing the intricate plots of a very different game of thrones, Nuclear Throne takes as a pretext a barely sketched synopsis: a group of mutant creatures must shoot their way through the wastelands of a dangerous post-war world. apocalyptic, to gain more power and finally conquer the coveted nuclear throne. At the beginning of each game, you then decide to play one of the twelve available characters, to embark on a violent endless journey through desert areas, laboratories and mining quarries. At the beginning, the choice is limited to only two of these mutants, but continuing in the different areas, all the others are gradually unlocked. Each of them has particular characteristics and abilities, which ensure a great variety of approaches: Fish, for example, can roll and gets a bonus for weapons and ammo, while Crystal starts with more salute points and can transform into crystal to repel enemy attacks . But there are other mutants who can blow up corpses, use telekinesis, or summon allies by sacrificing some of their own energy. Collecting radiation also increases their level and allows you to choose one of four random upgrades at the end of the area you just completed. These, which are real mutations, affect the health points and the drop of weapons or medkits, or they can improve the aim or range of melee attacks. In fact, ammunition is not infinite in the wastelands and, although they are almost always sufficient, having a hammer or a screwdriver at hand can help you survive even in the most desperate situations. Choosing mutations is never easy, but a mistake can easily be corrected on the next attempt. Multiplayer The ascent to the throne can also be tackled in the company of a friend with the two-player local cooperative mode, but those who think they can make life easier in this way have miscalculated in Nuclear Throne. In fact, the presence of a companion increases the strategic variables to consider, reduces the weapons available and ensures certain death for those who decide to abandon their fellow soldier without reviving him within the time limit. Death without return While survival is a Nuclear Throne imperative, the death of the mutant alter ego should never be viewed as a tragedy. The high difficulty, together with the procedural creation of the areas and permanent death, which causes all the obtained upgrades to be lost and restarts the long journey to the throne, are in fact some of the key elements of roguelike titles. And in Vlambeer they took them damn seriously. The game always oscillates dangerously between frustration and a sense of challenge, making even the smallest progress suffer. Killing a new boss, uncovering a secret level or, apotheosis, reaching the throne for the first time, give a unique, almost mystical pleasure, but not before having made the player go through a path of spiritual purification made up of curses and levels that they shatter the normal difficulty scale of a video game. Because when you reach a hitherto unexplored area spitting blood and a Lil'Hunter appears out of nowhere accompanied by a procession of I.D.P.D. troops, in the middle of a battle that already saw dozens of enemies at work, you can't do anything but curse bad luck and go back to killing worms in the desert. Even in these desperate cases having the right weapon can still make the difference and in this sense Nuclear Throne really offers the embarrassment of choice: in addition to blunt objects such as screwdrivers, hammers or shovels, the arsenal of pistols, rifles, crossbows, energy weapons and grenade launcher is very impressive. You can also get your hands on devastating instruments of death such as bazookas, flamethrowers or a curious disc crossbow, whose rotating bolts hit everything in their path, ricochet off the walls and can be fatal even for those who used them. In short, there really is something for all tastes, but unfortunately once again we have to deal with the random generation of drops and theversification of ammunition, which leads to choosing the weapon considering how many bullets are available and not only based on the feeling with its destructive capabilities. Old style It's not enough to have pixel art graphics to be stylish and the Vlambeer guys did their homework well even on an artistic level. In fact, each Nuclear Throne setting has its own peculiarities and the design of the characters, enemies and above all the bosses is always accurate and original. The frantic pace of the battles might have deserved the possibility of bringing the game to sixty frames per second, but even with the block at 30 frames per second the action is almost always fluid and dynamic. The exceptions are occasional dips during more effects-intensive explosions, but overall the work done by the small team is truly remarkable. Kills are a veritable blast of radiation, with corpses being blasted far and damaging even nearby enemies. The sound design is also very accurate, with well-crafted sound effects that go perfectly with the tracks composed by Julio Kallio. The Finnish musician thus confirms the excellent work done in Luftrausers, offering a varied soundtrack that is always in line with the rhythm of the action. Finally, we should mention some technical problems that persist even after the update of December 15th, namely the difficulty of connecting to the leaderboards and the daily and weekly challenges, as well as the systematic block when closing the application on Windows 10. Before the last update, yes they also experience frequent crashes in co-op mode, which at the moment seem to have been resolved.", "date": "2015-12-16", "grade": "8.7"}
