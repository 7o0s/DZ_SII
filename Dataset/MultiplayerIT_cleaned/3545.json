The new Moon Kid game published by Devolver Digital is clearly built with considerable care and a certain attention to game design: despite the use of pixellated 2D graphics and certain atmospheres typical of the 80s and 90s, behind it there is a genuine dedication to building a game based on a particular concept. In this case, it is a sort of action puzzle that can recall the classic platformers (it is actually defined as ~platform adventure~ by the authors) but which would be a bit difficult to insert precisely in this definition, due to the characteristics of the ~protagonist~ and of its control system. In fact we find ourselves interpreting the eye of a witch, who evidently has found no other way than to transform herself into a flying bulb to chase a knight who, in the pay of a king with rather suspicious aspirations, has stolen a series of ingredients from spell and various gems. Therefore, instead of controlling a character capable of running, jumping and interacting in some way with the scenarios, as one would expect from a classic platformer, we find ourselves guiding this floating eyeball around the screen, with simple and quick taps on the touch screen to give directions to take, which are followed until you touch the screen again or give a new direction. The control system is intuitive but it cannot be said that it is exactly comfortable, given that the continuous inertia in the movement makes it difficult to change direction in the strait and to accurately calculate the trajectories, but all this can be ascribed to the general challenge offered by the game . Levels and bosses What derives perfectly from the classic tradition of the platform is the progression, which presents various worlds characterized by different settings divided into sub-levels, to be faced in sequence in an attempt to reach the exit and at the same time trying to collect diamonds and various objects hidden around . Given the free movement of the eye, the level design is generally based on obstacles scattered on the screen and enemies able to move in various directions and shoot, to be hit with the right timing by going towards them and being careful not to hit any shields and cuirasses. The latter are well designed to offer an engaging challenge, but the level design suffers a bit from the too free movement offered to the main sprite, which basically can bypass in most cases most of the threats present on the screen simply by fluttering away from danger . Not for nothing, the moments in which Witcheye really gives its best are the boss fights, which force us to fight within a well-defined arena and really offer excellent solutions in terms of gameplay. Some of these can easily be defined as brilliant and put together they would not have made the game look bad if it had been set as a simple boss run, even if obviously this would have significantly reduced content and duration. Set up like this, however, the apex of a somewhat watered-down gaming experience remains in its standard phases, which however also present several interesting moments. Witcheye manages to recover the typical atmospheres of 16-bit platformers thanks to the skill with which scenarios and enemies have been designed, so much so that the curiosity to see the new settings is an important driving force to continue, even beyond the interest that has arisen by the challenges offered in actually traversing the levels, often quite bland. From this point of view, the increase in the difficulty that can be unlocked later and the desire to collect all the diamonds within the schemes are fundamental elements to significantly raise the level of challenge and interest.", "date": "2019-08-18", "grade": "7.5"}
