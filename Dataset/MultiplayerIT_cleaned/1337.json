There was a long moment in which Junichi Masuda strongly rejected the idea of returning to this project, convinced that it would not have the same appeal it had twenty years ago, when the photography hobby was much less widespread. Then something changed. Nintendo has entrusted Bandai Namco with the task of developing New Pokmon Snap, a title for Switch that fits perfectly, we could say, in a period in which there is still a need for escapism, although the horizon is gradually getting brighter. But will it be a video game suitable for everyone, or only for the most ardent fans of the Nintendo franchise? Let's find out in the New Pokmon Snap review. A photographer in Lentil The first thing you need to understand about New Pokmon Snap is that the Bandai Namco game has little to do with the titles traditionally developed by Game Freak. Yes, of course, there are pokmon and yes, in a sense you have to catch them, but the rest changes completely: New Pokmon Snap is not an RPG, but a first-person simulation game on rails. There really isn't a more succinct way to define it, other than ~photographer simulator~, but even that would fit him tight. The premise is disarmingly simple. Your alter ego, a character created by choosing from a handful of options, which however affect at least the rare and short interlude cinematics, reaches Professor Speculux's laboratory in the Lentil region to help him catalog the pokmon who live in the archipelago. The best way to do this is to observe them in their habitat and immortalize them with a camera, trying to record their more unusual activities. New Pokmon Snap: A Pikachu. Speculux immediately provides us with a latest generation camera, the Ricercamera, which will improve during the game with various additional functions, and a means of transport called NEO-UNO: the latter moves automatically following a precise path that lasts about four minutes. thus leaving us the freedom to look around and take up to seventy photos per stage. The latter represent well-differentiated biomes: we start from the natural park of the island of Floreo, to then move on to the jungle of Ameneas and gradually unlock new paths also at the coral reef of Opuleo or on the scorching mountains of the island of Volcas. Each stage exists in multiple versions, not just day or night. Taking photos accumulates exploration points, just like experience points in an RPG, which are used to level up the courses. Although it is possible to choose the level of the path you are about to undertake, the difference lies precisely in the quantity and variety of pokmon that will appear. New Pokmon Snap: Exeggutor on the beach. In the same path, at the same time of day, completely different little monsters can appear depending on the level set, or environmental conditions and situations can occur that affect the behavior of the monsters, offering new scenes to immortalize. The interaction, at least initially, is very limited. You can at best turn around in the NEO-UNO to take pictures in any direction, and in this sense it can also be fun, if impractical, to activate the gyroscope in the options to control the camera lens by moving the console in three-dimensional space . If the very first minutes of the game are extremely passive, as you take pictures, accumulate points and discover new pokmon, the gameplay also changes significantly. Initially we will only be able to throw soft Apples at the pokmon around us, but this can already significantly affect the ecosystem. New Pokmon Snap: Opuleo's Reef. Some pokmon, for example, may decide to snack on the apples we've thrown. Others may get nervous or simply move: in some cases, we will have to throw apples at the pokmon that block the passage of NEO-UNO. The scenario is not 100% interactive and only in some cases it is possible to interact with the environment to get the attention of a pokmon. These interactions tend to become more complex in advanced courses; a bit as if you were trying to solve a puzzle with the gameplay, you will need to use the gadgets in the right order or combination to awaken the interest of pokmon or encourage them to behave in a particular way. By playing a nice melody, for example, we will make some pokmon start dancing for us, while the radar integrated in the camera will allow us to identify pointsof interest and crossroads that will alter the route in real time, leading us to new areas where we will find other subjects for our shots. The Photodex New Pokmon Snap: a Pichu and a Scorbunny. Speculux has also discovered a curious natural phenomenon that occurs only in the Lentil region and that affects pokmon, making them shine with a mysterious light that makes them even more flashy. Soon, the ingenious researcher will find a way to channel that light into so-called Lumina spheres. This gadget, which is launched exactly like the soft Apple, will make the pokmon or some elements of the scenario shine, multiplying the possibilities for interaction: most of the pokmon will tend to just shine, but in some cases the Lumina spheres will significantly change the scenario and the behavior of nearby monsters. The solution is to experiment. The game absolutely does not say what to do, how and when; at most, the mini-challenges on the appropriate page will sibyllinely suggest the conditions to be met in order to stage little shows that absolutely deserve a photo shoot. New Pokmon Snap: Torterra together. Some mini-challenges reward titles and other accolades, but in reality there are no real rewards, in terms of gameplay. The purpose of New Pokmon Snap is basically one: to take the most beautiful photos and try to improve them even more. In the Fotodex we will catalog the pokmon encountered with four shots for each of them, distinguished by a number of stars ranging from one to four: they represent the rarity of the immortalized scene, but nothing prevents us from replacing each photo already taken and recorded in the 'album with the more recent ones that maybe even seem clearer or more beautiful to us. The loop works like this: at the end of the path, Speculux will ask us to choose a photo, and only one, among all those we have taken for each species of pokmon. After that, the good professor will evaluate them, assigning a score that depends on some specific factors. Framing the pokmon from the front, centering it in the lens, in specific light conditions and perhaps in the company of other monsters, while it performs particular actions... all these factors will be evaluated and will contribute to the overall score of each photo. New Pokmon Snap: NEO-UNO. We have to admit that the evaluation didn't always seem very precise to us and sometimes we had the impression that Speculux was pulling the numbers at random, but in general the advice that the game gives us at the beginning of the adventure is very valuable. New Pokmon Snap is a title of disarming immediacy: literally anyone can hold the controllers and take pictures in the blink of an eye. Once the photos have been recorded in our album, we will also be able to modify them as we like in the Laboratory section of the main menu, perhaps by applying filters of various kinds, stickers, small comments and other visual effects. New Pokmon Snap: Behold a Blastoise. It's a fairly simple editor, actually, which doesn't allow who knows what artistic freedom, but which still allows you to give vent to your imagination. The most beautiful photos can then be uploaded to the Internet, in a social space where all New Pokmon Snap players can admire and evaluate them: in this sense, New Pokmon Snap takes on a vaguely competitive nuance that will have to be considered over time. In fact, the online mode takes on more the contours of a sharing corner to turn to when looking for inspiration for the next shots and routes, than a space in which to seriously compete for places in the rankings. Inside the game New Pokmon Snap: Dodrio loves fluffy Apples. However varied and numerous the pokmon, the paths and the conditions orchestrated by Bandai Namco are, it goes without saying that sooner or later a certain feeling of boredom and repetitiveness takes over, especially if you focus on the search for a specific rare shot: in these cases, you easily end up repeating the same path for all the minutes of its duration only and only for that very brief instant in which a certain pokmon appears on the screen, and it is not certain that you will then be able to take the photo you want. New Pokmon Snap: Squirtle riding Lapras. Taken like this, New Pokmon Snap ends up becoming an exercise in frustration, rather than a tool for escapism. We have found, however, that the game is at its best when approached in a relaxed, curious and experimental spirit. For this reason, the first hours are undoubtedly the best and most engaging, but it must be said that the Japanese developer has worked very well on the original concept, expanding and enriching it in a sensible and intelligent way. Switch, then, with its fashionThe portable unit that makes it particularly suitable for hit and run games, becomes the perfect console for this type of experience. New Pokmon Snap: Dancing Bellossom. It's a shame that the opening and cutscenes betray a certain superficiality in the attention to detail. The various characters that appear on the screen, such as Speculux or his assistant Rita, not to mention some old acquaintances, are only partially voiced in English or Japanese, while the appearance of the menus is very basic. But that's just the outline. Bandai Namco has clearly concentrated all efforts on the courses, which in fact are absolutely splendid to admire, both on the TV screen and in portable mode: in the second case, the image appears slightly dirtier only in some situations, for example if you look closely at the bodies of water, but in general the title does not lose fluidity or detail. The scenarios are complex, very rich in detail and often embellished with particle effects and surprising plays of light. New Pokmon Snap: A Wailord emerges to the surface. The pokmon, of course, are the protagonists in all respects: having abandoned any claim to realism in the Pokkn Tournament style, the Japanese developer has adopted a cartoonish and dry design that works very well in respect of tradition. For a fan of the series, seeing pokmon ~living~ in their habitat is certainly a memorable experience, but we must admit that we would have expected a little more elaborate behavioral routines. Although the code tends to change something every time a certain path is taken, for example by guaranteeing some pokmon a random movement so that they don't always follow the same patterns, it is clear that playing New Pokmon Snap, in the long run, is not very other than watching some kind of short film over and over again. New Pokmon Snap: Magikarp could not be missing. As we said above, however, it all depends on the approach you choose. For example, however pleasant and carefree the accompanying music is, we noticed that New Pokmon Snap takes on an almost documentary value if you reduce the volume of the soundtrack to zero in the options menu: keeping only the sound and environmental effects, perhaps forking a nice pair of headphones, each path becomes even more engaging and relaxing, a bit as if you were taking an excursion or a guided tour in the world of pokmon. At that point, some moments of the experience can become truly unforgettable: perhaps you are taking pictures of a Pelipper fluttering above your head, when suddenly a thunderous roar brings your gaze back to the surface of the water, broken by an immense Wailord who decided to emerge right along the path of the NEO-UNO. In these moments, New Pokmon Snap manages to be something more than a simulation game, but after the first time it no longer amazes in the same way and this, unfortunately, is an impossible limit to overcome.
