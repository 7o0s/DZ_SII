In this case, however, the game can also be purchased individually on the PlayStation Store, at the price of 24 .99 euros: an eloquent demonstration of how the publisher is well aware of the value of the fifth chapter. In fact, we are talking about the title that marked the return of the franchise to the West, and from which the substantial relaunch of a brand that absolutely deserved to carve out its own following also in Europe and the United States started. characters and scenarios Originally released in 2012 on PlayStation 3, but arrived here only at the end of 2015, Yakuza 5 proposes the formula that had worked so well in the previous episode, thus providing us with five different playable characters: the inevitable Kazuma Kiryu, historical protagonist of the series; the charismatic Shun Akiyama, whom we met in Yakuza 4; the rough and tough Taiga Saejima, legendary hitman of the Japanese mafia; newcomer Tatsuo Shinada, a former baseball star who makes a living writing adult shows; and finally the young aspiring idol Haruka Sawamura, protected by Kazuma. Each of these figures will have to face increasingly complex trials within a plot which, as per tradition, will gradually intertwine, revealing the links between one story and another. Kazuma and the others boast a peculiar fighting style, to be enriched through the unlocking of new moves and abilities, but in addition to physical clashes they will also find themselves involved in extra activities of various kinds, such as for example the unpublished minigames based on taxi driving and speed races, pleasant if not beautiful to look at, or hunting sessions and baseball games. Furthermore, in the case of Haruka, we will have to deal with the hard training linked to the idol career, in a sequence of rhythm games and situations capable of providing a different, fascinating and at times disturbing point of view on the world of Japanese entertainment. The settings are equally numerous, once again with attention to the smallest details and characterized by an incomparable atmosphere, which captures with great fidelity the reality of the places from which the scenarios are inspired: we have the Nagasugai district in Fukuoka, where Kazuma moved to lead a normal life and support the Morning Glory orphanage with the work of a taxi driver; the inevitable Kamurocho in Tokyo, in one of its more sophisticated versions; Kineicho in Nagoya, inspired by the Nishiki district; Tsukimino in Sapporo, based on the Susukino red light district and the return of Sotenbori to Osaka, with its beautiful three-dimensional signs. Each location features different businesses, ranging from convenience stores to restaurants, passing through places to hang out of time and the inevitable SEGA Clubs, where you can try your hand at the coin-ops of Virtua Fighter 2 and Taiko no Tatsujin. Playstation 4 trophies There are fifty-seven Trophies unlockable in Yakuza 5 Remastered. In addition to those that are obtained simply by completing the chapters of the campaign, there are several related to secondary activities, subquests and upgrades, which push you to dissect the experience in its entirety. Structure, gameplay and technical realization Yakuza 5 Remastered starts with a fairly slow pace, slowly immersing us in the new events and letting us discover how the scenario has evolved since the conclusion of the previous chapter. In this case all the dialogues, even those in-game, are spoken in Japanese ( with the traditional subtitles in English), to underline an attention to detail that borders on the pathological and is valued in particular during the cutscenes, really full of atmosphere and characterized by an impeccable direction. After the first few acts, however, the action takes a different turn and becomes more pressing, in particular due to the numerous clashes in the street with thugs and criminals of various kinds, which allow you to quickly unlock improvements and skills with which to enrich your repertoire, initially very limited. However, the gameplay remains the same as always, structurally very simple: you move towards the objectives indicated from time to time on the map, but it often happens to come across unforeseen situations along the way and thus get to know of new characters and activities, see for example the minigame in which Kazuma improvises a ramen maker. The extreme abundance of situations, main and side missions (there are over seventy-five) multiplies the duration of the experienceenza, which with its five chapters can entertain you for over a hundred hours. The remastering work carried out for the PS4 version is remarkable, as it not only increases the original resolution and doubles the frame rate, which goes from 30 to 60 fps, but also improves the quality of numerous assets, with a resample of the texture that makes the plots much clearer, in particular as regards signs and materials. Unfortunately, the changes fail to make the guide sections more pleasant, which were also a weak point of the original edition, but in any case we are talking about a quite rich and well-finished production, undoubtedly the best of the lot. It is therefore also worth expressing an overall judgment on The Yakuza Remastered Collection: we remain convinced that Yakuza 3 would also need a Kiwami-style remake, given how badly it has aged, with a production still linked to cross-gen logic for the debut on PS3. However, it is true that Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5 are perfectly enjoyable in the form of a simple remaster, being extraordinarily well-finished games from the outset. The problem, also underlined by the fact that Yakuza 5 Remastered can be purchased individually, lies in the excessive price of the collection, which will inevitably on the most loyal fans who bought it on day one and will certainly find it discounted in one of the next promotions on the PlayStation Store, now that it's finally complete.", "date": "2020-02-18", "grade": "8.0"}
