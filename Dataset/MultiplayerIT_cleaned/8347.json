Araki's manga has never been incredibly famous, yet it has generated a solid fan base who have supported it for eight sagas and what is now twenty-five years played. In 1998 Capcom took advantage of the moderate success of the first animated miniseries to launch a 2D fighting game designed not only for fans, but for all lovers of the genre: it is precisely that title that is now being revived in high definition and we would all have been happier if it were been treated better... Think of you! JoJo's Bizarre Adventures HD Ver. has the charm of vintage and 90s Capcom fighting games. After all, it is no coincidence that the entire structure is based on that of another Capcom super-hit from the same period, Street Fighter Alpha. The similarities abound between the two franchises, starting with the super move bar which can be accumulated up to five times and discharged at the right time by special moves that consume from one to three bars. Each of the twenty-two characters on the roster has a very personal set of attacks and special moves, all of which can be performed by making the classic half-moon and similar movements on the joypad. It would all seem even a little trivial, yet it is the very characteristics of the inspiring comic series that make the gameplay truly special. In the series, in fact, the various characters possess a paranormal power called Stand: it is a psychic emanation capable of assuming a form, endowed with the most disparate capacities. While many of the characters on the roster may seem quite useless - and some are, unfortunately - one must learn to use their Stands effectively to get the better of the opponent. This is the case of Mahrahia and her magnetizing Stand or Hol Horse with his gun-Stand with directional projectiles. Other characters immediately appear more intuitive: the Stand of the protagonist Jotaro is designed to take the enemy with papagni on the muzzle, as well as the fencer Stand of Jean-Pierre Polnareff. The Stand is associated with one of the four main buttons of the joypad, just like the weak, medium and powerful attack: it can only be issued during the execution of a special move or activated temporarily to increase the number of hits that our character can send to mark. It is even possible to perform a sort of super move that allows us to enter a string of commands that the Stand will execute autonomously a few seconds later: in this way it is a bit like controlling two characters, with the possibility of really tasty combos. Gameplay-wise, JoJo's Bizarre Adventures HD Ver. is full of goodies that fans will love, from button-mashing clashes of shots of the same intensity to the unique interaction of certain special shots, such as the ability to freeze time that has already stopped in case you face Dio Brando as Jotaro Kujo. In short, from this point of view, the Capcom port does not disappoint: it is still as damned fun and technical as it was fourteen years ago. Playstation 3 trophies There are only twelve Trophies obtainable in JoJo's Bizarre Adventures HD Ver.: 7 Bronze, 4 Silver and 1 Gold. Getting them all won't be too simple: in some cases you will have to defeat your opponent by meeting particular requirements, for example without using Super Combo or while you have been transformed into children. Traveling with the Joestars Unfortunately, the good news ends here, because unlike fourteen years ago this new console version does not include the excellent Super Story Mode present in the PlayStation One edition of the original game. The fact is that JoJo's Bizarre Adventures HD Ver. is a port of the arcade and Dreamcast edition, so it lacks single-player modes worthy of note, except for the traditional training mode and an Arcade mode where you have to face a certain number of fights to see a final concluding skit that differs from character to character. Capcom in this case seems to have focused entirely on the multiplayer mode, which in any case does not make you cry out for a miracle: it is obviously possible to face a friend locally, but also to challenge random players with the evaluation game system to which the players have accustomed us latest fighting games. By winning you geta certain score, which theoretically will allow you to face other opponents at your level. Finally, it is possible to create ~lobbies~ that can accommodate up to eight players: in that case each one plays a little and whoever loses gives way to another challenger of the current ~champion~. Even from a technical point of view, Capcom did not squeeze too much, limiting itself to applying an HD veil and enclosing the game screen between two colored bands with the names of the fighters to preserve the resolution. JoJo's Bizarre Adventures HD Ver. maintains the cosmetics of the original arcade unchanged, now embellished with greater definition, and this means that we are not faced with the terrible graphic cuts of the PlayStation One edition; on the other hand, despite the excellent animations and the spectacularity of the special shots, the ~vintage~ feeling is always around the corner and only the most ardent fans will be able to appreciate the care placed in the sprites and backgrounds, probably only ~nice~ in everyone else's eyes.", "date": "2012-09-03", "grade": "7.0"}
