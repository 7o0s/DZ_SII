{"name": "Animus - Harbinger", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/animus-harbinger-recensione.html", "text": "Animus - Harbinger is the new soulslike action RPG from 10Birds, the development team that already with its previous projects, Ire: Blood Memory and Animus - Stand Alone, had made it clear what their ambitions were. There was for a long time the belief that it was not possible to offer an experience of this type on mobile devices - primarily due to the systematic imprecision of touch controls - but apparently this does not correspond to the truth: by making the necessary adjustments and using a simple automatic targeting system, the series created by the Korean studio has shown that it can have its say in this particular vein, involving us in intense and demanding fights within short-term missions, therefore calibrated on a fruition extemporaneous and/or on the move. There isn't much to say about the plot of the game, but it too is clearly inspired by the Dark Souls saga: we wear the heavy armor of Forlorn, a knight who lives in the folds of time and who is summoned by the deceased king Cadmus to save his kingdom from the threat of Kerr the Destroyer, the summoner of nightmares. The confrontation will unfold through a total of twenty-two stages, within four different scenarios in which we will have to fight various types of enemies before crossing the ax with the boss on duty. The formula is therefore the same as in the previous episode: you explore a small map, clean it up and collect the loot necessary for the subsequent challenges. Although more attention has been paid to the creation of the scenarios (some, at least), also in this case the setting is limited to being a mere background to increasingly complex duels, which we will only be able to win by memorizing the movement patterns of our opponents and taking advantage of their moments of weakness to perform devastating combos. Just like the aforementioned Animus - Stand Alone, Harbinger is not a freemium title, and after completing the tutorial we will be able to choose whether to unlock the full game at the price of 4.49 euros. It must be recognized that this is a substantially lower sum than the 8.99 euros of the previous chapter, more or less with the same contents. Gameplay: between soulslike and action survival As mentioned, the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay of Animus - Harbinger are the same that we had already appreciated in the previous chapter of the series. We are therefore talking about a solid and convincing combat system, although still inconsistent in the yield of the impacts; which is based on timing and distances to be respected, rapid lateral discards and combinations that are suggested from time to time by the interface in order to take advantage of a bonus on damage. Even the arrangement of the icons has remained identical, after all it has proven to work very well. On the left side of the touch screen there is a repositionable virtual analog stick, very precise and responsive, while the view is controlled by touching the right side of the display. At the bottom right are the buttons: a red one for fast attack, a yellow one for heavy attack, a blue one for dodging and then three smaller ones, which are used to activate fury where available, drink a healing potion and switch from one target to another. Even with all the limitations of an approach that focuses solely on fighting, setting aside any exploratory ambitions, the final result is also in this case exciting for those looking for a production of this type on iOS and Android. However, there are a couple of aspects that led us to reward Animus - Harbinger in a less convinced way. The first is precisely the revival of the formula seen in Stand Alone with practically no evolution, beyond an appreciable finishing work as regards the mechanisms of the gameplay. The second is the use of a spartan and cumbersome interface between one mission and another, for inventory management but above all for upgrades: the abandonment of the previous solution, which included very easy to read graphic elements, is inexplicable. Finally, from a technical point of view, the game does not disappoint in terms of design, details and animations. The many adjustments allow for good performance even on mid-range devices, while on the iPhone X we were able to push everything to the maximum (quality, texture and frame rate) while encountering overheating problems which, however, could depend on our terminal. The sound is also good, with a great atmosphere and effective in the representation of the shots.", "date": "2018-10-03", "grade": "8.7"}
