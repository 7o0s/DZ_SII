You get up in the morning, stock up on magic pitch, go home and wait for it all to start again. That's what Roy does, at least until he runs into a little girl who ended up in the Underland by mistake. Instead of eating it, Roy becomes its guardian and goes on an adventure to find its mother. What follows is an adventure that tells of humanity, often hidden behind layers of ugliness, and friendship that crosses the boundaries of space and time. Developed by Odencat and coming to PC, Switch and Xbox on March 2, 2023, Meg's Monster is a narrative adventure with a turn-based RPG twist. To find out all the details, continue reading our review of Meg's Monster. Meg and her monster Meg, the little girl at the center of Meg's Monster The adventure, as mentioned, begins with Meg's arrival in the world of monsters. The Underworld is a small place, nothing more than a very deep abyss populated by a few deformed creatures, but it is nonetheless endowed with a culture and a government, which has made a peace agreement with humans: the monsters will not climb the walls of the chasm and humans will not try to eliminate those who live in the depths. However, the Underworld is also used as a dumping ground by humans, who sometimes eliminate uncomfortable people and make them disappear into the abyss. Meg is one of these and manages to survive, but alone she has no chance of finding her mother as she would be immediately devoured. Roy and his friend Golan, however, come across it and discover that its cry is able to unleash the apocalypse. What to do then? Find a way to get her back to the surface with her mother without her crying. This idea is the basis of the entire game and its combat system. Roy is a monster among monsters, huge and powerful. He has nothing to fear as no one can really harm him. Meg, however, is a sensitive child and immediately bonds with the energetic, so seeing him get hit while defending her makes her cry and leads us to Game Over. The idea behind the game is therefore having to control an almost immortal character, who however has to think of a small and weak girl with easy tears. In terms of gameplay unfortunately everything is rendered in a very trivial way. Meg has her own health bar, and every attack Roy takes does emotional damage to her. From a narrative point of view it works, but in practice Meg and Roy are a single entity and it is as if they have low life points, practically nullifying the idea of having control over such a powerful character. Meg's Monster's turn-based combat is very classic and mundane Another foundation of gameplay is the use of toys. By advancing with the plot, five objects are unlocked, such as a soccer ball, crayons and cards, which reassure Meg or perform the function of healing during combat. Some also activate bonuses to attack and defense, the only statistics in the game in addition to life points. However, their use is really basic, given that the balance of the clashes are always the same: after a couple of shots Meg is almost exhausted, an object is used, she attacks a couple of times and then repeats herself until victory. From start to finish it's pretty much always like this. Roy can also use attacks of increasing power, spending points that are charged in the rounds in which we use the basic hit or other moves, such as defense or healing. Again, however, this is a very trivial approach, as you simply load up a couple of points and then use the most powerful move, and then repeat. The only element that makes the clashes a little different from each other is the presence of mini-games, which are mostly in the form of QTEs. These are always very simple actions and not too interesting from a purely playful point of view, but they add depth on a narrative level. We also point out that there are no random encounters or secret battles, but each encounter is defined by the pace of the plot. In short, the RPG side of Meg's Monster is limited and quite repetitive: it's a pity that something more original and varied hasn't been created, for example like the Undertale system (which is clearly the main source of inspiration). A world of monsters and humans Meg's Monster's Underland council is made up of funny beings If on the gameplay side there is little of interest, at least Meg's Monster makes up for everything else. The adventure of the little girl and her guardian is sweet, pleasant and in some fragments even exciting. It is a training journey in which a defenseless little creature manages to breach the shell of a monster who until then had not been interested in anything else but himself. Roy not only opens up to Meg, butalso to the return of the monsters, from which he lived isolated. Together with him we meet the people of the Underworld, its funny Government Council managed by four strange individuals whose history we will slowly discover. The plot of Meg's Monster is broader than one might initially expect and when one thinks that the story is now over, it turns out that we were only just beginning. This is the whole Underland of Meg's Monster: small but cozy Meg's Monster makes us fight against destiny and teaches that the most important thing is the bond we create with others, no matter how bad or ugly they may seem on the outside. Over the five or six hours it took to roll to the end credits, we were enthralled by the characters Odencat came up with. A good job has also been done from a graphic point of view, especially for Roy, who reminds us that a few pixels are enough to express deep feelings. Meg's Monster is a small game, mind you, so don't expect dozens and dozens of areas, but what is present is well detailed, varied and useful for plot purposes, without a single second too long: each area is small, sometimes nothing more of a room, but that's all you need. There are some side events that can be ignored, but even then they are still relevant story components that delve into various characters, so we recommend playing through every event that is made available to you. In closing, we point out that the soundtrack is perhaps the component that has least impressed us. Music and effects are adequate, but after playing nothing particularly impressed. The game is also translated into Italian.", "date": "2023-02-28", "grade": "8.0"}
