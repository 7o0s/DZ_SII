The latest effort of Turn 10 stands as the perfect title to flex the muscles of Xbox One X, the new Microsoft console arriving on November 7, but those who own a PC with an adequate configuration can try this driving experience in advance at maximum of its capabilities, at real 4K and with effects probably superior to what we will see in action on the next platform of the Redmond house - except for antialiasing. And so, after playing the game for several hours on Xbox One S, we finally got our hands on the Windows 10 version. disruptive impact Forza Motorsport 6: Apex had given us a taste of the potential of the Universal Windows Platform when used with certain products and in an optimal way (because, let's remember, things didn't always go well at the debut), but we weren't prepared for a visual impact of the type. The graphics of Forza Motorsport 7, while very valid in the upscaled Ultra HD of Xbox One S, take on new life on PC thanks to the real 4K and the ultra settings that our configuration allowed us to use. The detachment is clear, the level of detail is absolute but above all it is the quality of the cars in the race beyond ours that is surprising, given that the traditional difference in terms of effects and sharpness between the vehicle we control and those entrusted to the artificial intelligence. In fact, we are talking about limitations that we could find on Xbox One X, after all somewhere the console will have to set aside the necessary resources to avoid frame rate drops in the most agitated situations. It's actually when all the cars are on the screen, it's pouring rain and we're rushing like mad towards a barrier that the engine struggles, losing a few frames; thing that on the new Microsoft console we imagine will not happen thanks to some renunciation, small or large. However, even here it is enough to lighten the GPU load by a minimum to eliminate the problem, settling on the convenience of the dynamic approach, which instantly changes the resolution or any of the presets to keep the reference frame rate steady (30 or 60 frames per second , in both cases with or without vertical synchrony), or by manually selecting the items that interest us. The options in this sense are extremely numerous and open to broad scalability even downwards, which some newspapers have already verified. First of all, it is possible to act on the resolution, from 720p to 2160p, set the general rendering quality up to ultra and modify the parameters relating to dynamic optimization. The latter include multisampling / downsampling (which if desired allows you to get up to real 8K), anisotropic filtering, the quality of motion blur and shadows, the resolution of particles, the procedural quality, of the liveries, of the mirror, of the cars in track and particle again, water reflections, anti-aliasing (only MSAA is available), lens and windshield reflections, track textures and general reflections. A note on the tire smoke under hard braking and drifting - there are noticeable artefacts that we missed on Xbox One S - perhaps due to the lower resolution - and hopefully the developers can fix this in an update. Having said that, we were able to set the resolution to real 4K and all parameters to the maximum as anticipated, enjoying an experience that maintains 60 frames per second without any problem, except for the extreme situations mentioned above or multiplayer races. although in the latter case the question probably depends on the netcode, not yet very stable according to our tests also in a Windows environment. Support for HDR is only the proverbial icing on the cake of an excellent technical sector, capable of greatly enhancing the panoramas and bright contrasts during the day. There has been a lot of talk about the Forza Motorsport 7 weather and the script that would seem to regulate its variations: pending a possible clarification from Turn 10, we reiterate how the lighting of this new episode gives new charm and personality to the tracks, even those reproposed several times during the series: no small achievement. The last technical issue to deal with are the uploads, which are also substantially improved compared to the Xbox One version: if on consoles it takes an average of forty seconds for the system to prepare a scenario forthe race, using an SSD on PC waiting times are reduced by a good 25-30%. Gameplay and structure Having concluded the discussion on the technical implementation on PC, the reality remains of an extremely solid driving game in its driving model, capable of balancing the accessibility and realism needs of fans of the genre in the best possible way, also scalable in terms of challenge thanks to to a large number of helps and assistances that you can of course deactivate. Compared to the previous chapter, which never arrived in its official guise on the Windows platform, the shifting of loads has improved and the sessions in the wet have now reached a level of excellence: when you run in the rain, with the gradients filling up of water gradually, the car's reactions are emphasized and this must be taken into account, especially when braking. Beyond this, each car tells a different story, which goes beyond the categories it belongs to, and considering the fleet of over seven hundred models we will have experiences to try. Invariably some vehicles are better represented than others, but the general level is very high and, in case of problems, you can always use the ~rewind~ function, which rewinds time if you have made a serious mistake, perhaps at a few meters from the finish line of a sweaty race. As also written in the review of the Xbox One version, we did not appreciate the homologation system, i.e. the automatic optimization of the cars so that they meet the requirements of each event, taking away from users the pleasure of tuning manually: it is still possible to do it , but the developers have made this practice counterintuitive and cumbersome, which is a real shame. On the other hand, nothing to say from a structural point of view: the career of Forza Motorsport 7 is enormous, it ranges within five different leagues that are gradually unlocked and offers very different events, thus guaranteeing a certain variety of situations. Each championship is made up of a variable and growing number of tournaments and single challenges, the completion of which grants the experience points necessary to level up and thus obtain credits, driver customizations or new cars. It is precisely the element of collecting that represents the fulcrum of the experience, so much so that it is regulated by a special indicator: the more vehicles we own, the better. To speed up the progression it is possible to use the Modifications, cards to be equipped during a race bearing particular conditions which, if satisfied, guarantee a multiplication of rewards. The fact that the Modifications are obtained through the purchase of Prize Boxes has made many people turn up their noses, but we underline once again how this practice is ancillary to the basic experience: it is an extra possibility, not a a limiting constraint for those who are not willing to spend more money. Speaking of limits, unfortunately some modes are not yet available (online leagues, Forzathon challenges, the marketplace), so the outline for the moment is limited to free races, selecting the car and one of the thirty-two available scenarios at will. with relative weather conditions (only some tracks, however, boast the possibility of choosing between day, night and rain), the aforementioned multiplayer and the Rivals mode, in which to compete with the ghost of users who have done better times than ours, in attempt to climb the global leaderboard. The right edition of Forza Motorsport 7 The physical version of Forza Motorsport 7 can be purchased in both a standard edition (62.99 euros) and Ultimate (96.92 euros). The second can count on some bonuses such as the Day One Car Pack, the Car Pass and the VIP Membership. It is clearly possible to buy the game also in digital version, with the Play Anywhere solution, on the Microsoft store in the three standard, Deluxe and Ultimate editions. For those looking for a racing wheel to play Forza Motorsport 7 there are obviously a large number of options. The Logitech G920 Driving Force, which can be used on both Xbox One and PC, is currently available at 223 euros instead of 409. Other options are the Thrustmaster TMX (176 euros), the Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 (265 euros instead of 399) and the expensive Fanatec CSL Elite (619 euros).", "date": "2017-10-07", "grade": "9.0"}
