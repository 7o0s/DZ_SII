{"name": "Rumble Roses", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rumble-roses.html", "text": "Let's start immediately by saying that the playability factor is rather disappointing. For those who have loved and appreciated the high realism of titles such as WWE, the impact with RR's gameplay leaves you somewhat astounded. Mind you, it's not that it's poor, far from it, but it fails to offer that level of challenge, of control over the PCs that one would expect from any decent fighting game. What appears clear from all this is that it was probably a choice of the programmers to make the playability of this title very simple, perhaps precisely to offer the gamer the possibility of concentrating on the ~spectacular~ event itself, that of the meeting of two curvaceous beauties in a ring. The fights between the girls are in fact easily manageable and elementary, including combos. The control system is consequently not very complex. Everything is done with a button: with the Circle, depending on the movements made simultaneously with the directional cross, you can carry out holds or you can attempt to pin the opponent, with the square you execute kicks and punches, and with the X button we run. With the R / L keys you can perform some devastating counter-moves or special shots after loading the appropriate bars divided into three categories: Killer Move, Lethal Move and Humiliation Move, whose name says it all... A feast for the eyes... With only ten selectable characters, and as many alter-egos, longevity is certainly not the strong point of the game, even if it must be said that the three difficulty levels available, combined with the various costumes and extras to unlock thanks to the Story Mode , they might suggest the opposite. If anything, the problem is figuring out who really wants to complete everything there is to complete just for a couple of alternative bikinis or for some galleries. In this context, the backbone of the Konami title inevitably becomes the graphics sector. The buxom girls are represented in an extremely accurate way: sinuous, sexy bodies, in some cases overflowing from the sensual clothes they wear and which vary from BDSM suits to the more traditional bikini or thong. The clothing items chosen by the graphic designers for the wrestlers clearly wink at the most extreme fetish. From cowgirl to sexy nurse and even oriental schoolgirl costume girl, there's something for everyone. Each of the girls is very well characterized physically, with rather large 3D models boasting the beauty of over 10,000 polygons for their realization. Everything is finally enhanced by an excellent choice of color palette. It goes without saying that all this translates into a visual spectacle for the eyes of us mere mortals. The sound stands at discrete levels of quality: the dubbing of the girls in English is discrete, the background effects during the matches are good (the buzz of the crowd and the various little screams of the wrestlers), the rocking music is beautiful (some are covers of songs by famous groups such as Van Halen) that accompany the entrance to the ring of the wrestlers, complete with winking curtains borrowed from the WWE Diva's. Conclusions Rumble Roses is to all intents and purposes considered Konami's (and Ps2) answer to Tecmo's Xbox-ian (SIGH) Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball: beautiful undressed girls who perform in a specious sport, in this case wrestling, only suitable for aim to show us in their aesthetic splendor with lots of zooms on the roundest parts of their bodies. A game conceived in fact more for the joy of the eyes than for that given by a valid and satisfying playability. An overall discreet title, nice to look at but a little less to play, therefore. Which, probably, as mentioned in the review phase, was also the goal of the programmers. Pros: Ok graphics, nice aesthetic characterization of the wrestlers. Fun, as long as you play it without excessive pretensions. Cons: In the end not very long-lived. Unsatisfactory gameplay. Longevity this unknown There are basically two modes available, Story Mode and Exhibition. The Story Mode is completely different from what one would expect from such a title. Too short (it is resolved within a dozen meetings interspersed with as many cut-scenes and dialogues that unravel the story) and with a somewhat senseless and out of place plot in a similar context. In fact, behind the fight tournament, we will soon discover that there is a perfidious plan aimed at discovering the perfect warrior and conquering the world ... Conversely, the Exhibition Mode is the one that is more varied and interesting. Although limited, as already mentioned for the Story Mode, by a small number of encounters, this is where the unusual offering ismind the possibility of fighting for the Rumble Roses title and the interesting variation to the usual matches of placing bets with the opponent on duty on what must be some rules of the match, such as not using weapons or not leaving the ring, for example example, or use or not special attacks, factors which in one way or another can subsequently increase the level of goodness or evil of the Pg. Influencing the progress of matches and unlocking the various ~alter egos~ of the female fighters. Once you have obtained 100% of one or the other level it will be possible to face the final match, which, once won, will award you the belt of the world champion of RR, a successful defense of which at least once after the final, will allow in order to unlock Gallery Mode. In this mode, which would perhaps be more appropriate to define ~Voyeaur~ as well as learning the statistics of the wrestler in question we will be able to admire her while she trains in the gym or while she sways in a swimsuit on the beach. They are called the ~Roses Unleashed~, and seeing them fight in the ring, one cannot but agree with this definition. The protagonists of the latest Konami title, Rumbe Roses, are really beautiful and ruthless. This title marks the debut of the Japanese softo in the field of ~in ring~ fighting games, a sector that strangely given the history of this giant that has been producing video games since the early 80s, had never been taken into consideration. The Ps2 already boasts several titles dedicated to wrestling and objectively all of a high level and it is perhaps for this reason that Konami has decided to try a slightly different approach to this sport. Rumble Roses, and this seems clear, is a game that pays homage to the WWE Diva's of which it amplifies some spectacular aspects, and to the acclaimed, at least by Xbox owners, Tecmo's Dead or Alive.", "date": "2005-06-06", "grade": null}
