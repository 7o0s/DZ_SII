These are Game Freak and SEGA, two of the names best known by video game lovers together with their successful creatures, Pokmon and Sonic the Hedgehog respectively, who have marked the adolescence of more than a generation of players. After dedicating itself for a quarter of a century to the Nintendo laptop, the Japanese software house arrives on PC and home console with a colorful and stylish platformer, putting Tembo: The Badass Elephant at the center of the scene, a pachyderm that is a mix between Dumbo and Rambo, an atypical, awkward and clumsy hero ready to throw himself headlong into his adventure between two-dimensional levels that are beautiful to look at, prisoners to save and an army of power-hungry rowdies. Not everything is as successful as it seems, however, given that, pad in hand, some imperfections in the gameplay and a not particularly sophisticated level design bring out the whole nature of a project with a highly experimental orientation, almost independent if it weren't for the blazon of the names involved. Game Freak amazed us with Tembo, but more for the style than for its actual pad quality in hand Ready for action Everything revolves around the liberation of Shell City, invaded by the Phantom army which, in addition to fully equipped men, also ranks a fair variety of heavy and technologically advanced vehicles among its ranks. The local law enforcement fails to stop the invasion and sees the city fall into the grip of flames and destruction, until the army colonel decides to recall one of the most decorated war heroes, Tembo, into service. while frolicking in retreat on the island of Zanneland. Without excessive surprise, this prelude presented in a series of static images will not evolve into a real plot, but will remain only an incipit to introduce the protagonist and the game world, leaving the most important task of capturing attention to the gameplay of the player. Red bandana, muzzle paint, trunk full of water and a belt full of peanut butter: here the warrior elephant is ready to free the city from the invaders, in a sequence of levels set in different locations from the old school structure. Without weapons or power ups of any kind, Tembo relies entirely on physical strength exactly as befits an animal of that size: jump, sprint, overwhelm enemies, break through walls and vehicles, leaving behind only dust and wreckage. In the four hours of play necessary to complete it, jumping from one platform to another is fun and satisfying, it forces you to stay focused, to learn the patterns of the more resistant enemies and above all to carefully study some passages and avoid running out of lives prematurely. disposition. These increase by collecting the peanuts scattered throughout the levels, but thanks to the increasing difficulty they will tend to go down rather quickly in the more advanced scenarios. Here the enemies become more difficult and resistant, they increase in number and moreover we will face more and more frequent situations of ~trial and error~ which rather quickly deviate in frustration, due to not very happy level design choices that force us to redo more and several times the same passages in order to free that last hostage who is missing from the count or kill all the invaders. Both requirements are in fact necessary to complete the level 100%, with the second binding for the continuation of the adventure, a ploy that forced us several times to replay already completed levels again to destroy enough enemies to allow us to unlock the next stages . Playstation 4 trophies Tembo The Badass Elephant rewards the player with 15 trophies, of which one is gold, one is silver and the rest are bronze. It starts from the simplest ones like completing the training or saving all the civilians in a level, to the longer and more challenging ones that require you to complete the levels multiple times to accumulate 99 peanut butter jars or annihilate all the enemies in the game . Elementary, Tembo Pad in hand, the sensation of being in command of an ungainly, awkward and heavy animal is best rendered by the inertia in the changes of direction, never too fluid and sudden, leaving the player with the obligation to get used to the timing and the response of the pachyderm before engaging in crazy speedruns to complete the level in the shortest possible time. In fact, the rhythm is certainly one of the greatest advantages of the title developed by the ragaszzi of Game Freak, who have managed to always keep the action tight and overwhelming, transforming each level into a mad race from left to right as commanded by the most solid tradition of the genre. However, in addition to the elimination of enemies and the search for citizens to save, once the first levels have been completed, one realizes that Tembo is damned short of breath, game mechanics and level design perfect for a sprint but unsustainable in the long term. In addition to jumps and slides seasoned with not always successful bosses, Tembo The Badass Elephant has nothing really personal to offer, reducing itself to a title that is fun, but interesting more for its technical sector than for the real play value. The Japanese production lacks that creative flair and that personality in game design that makes it something more than a good title. It tastes like a little homework useful for distracting yourself from the immense world of Pokmon that has engulfed the software house for so many years, which for this very reason could have been more daring, proposing a fresh approach and less superficial mechanics. All smoke and no fire then? Not really since Tembo lets himself be played and manages to entertain, captures with his cartoon graphics in super colorful cel shading and made us fall in love with the clumsy protagonist from the first meeting. Too bad only for some too dull settings, as well as the cheesy and in the long run repetitive soundtrack. All this does nothing but increase the recriminations on what with some original idea could have really aspired to better results, earning the spotlight to the delight of SEGA and gamers.", "date": "2015-07-22", "grade": "7.5"}
