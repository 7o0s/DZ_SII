For years, the master of techno-thriller has delighted all his fans with a long series of books, starting from The Great Escape of Red October to stop only with the unexpected disappearance of the writer, which occurred in 2013. And who knows how things would go in the world of video games, given that in addition to literature Tom Clancy was also a very important character in that of electronic entertainment. Not everyone knows, in fact, that the birth of Red Storm Entertainment, the historic team behind Politika but above all the Rainbow Six dated 1998, is owed to the writer originally from Baltimore, the first of a very long series which, for those who love action games, helped make Tom Clancy's signature a guarantee on a par with those who followed his written works. In almost twenty years, the video game franchise Tom Clancy's has led us to solve complicated situations by facing threats of all kinds, in the role of special teams or single heroes like Sam Fisher: despite this, until now nothing like The Division had ever been seen. The project carried out by Ubisoft Massive together with the aforementioned Red Storm Entertainment is certainly the most ambitious ever within the brand, which the French-Canadian publisher continues to pursue even after the death of Tom Clancy. A heavy legacy, which we can now finally evaluate with you: as promised in our last test a few days ago, the day of judgment has also come for The Division. After a week spent in New York with the JTF, here's our review of The Division! Black Friday Although in recent years Tom Clancy's direct involvement in the titles that bore his name was no longer as high as previously, in the various Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell the developers have always continued to introduce elements that recall conspiratorial atmospheres . Over time, the latter have become a trademark of the writer, who has arrived with his career to represent an entire genre made up of hyper-technological intrigue. The same type of approach also belongs to The Division, whose basic idea draws from real elements such as Operation Black Winter and the Bush administration's Directive 51, then flying with the imagination to tell us about a smallpox epidemic that broke out in suddenly in New York. A full-blown bioterrorist attack, the perpetrators of which are initially unknown. However, the methods are not: the occasion chosen to spread the virus is Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving, during which all of America pours into the shops to take advantage of the many discounts. Taking advantage of the enormous exchange of banknotes, a series infected with an enhanced version of smallpox is put into circulation, thanks to which in a very short time the symbolic city of the United States finds itself on its knees. As told in an excellent way by the filmed introduction, through a series of images assembled from real footage, it will be a matter of very little time before the heart of Manhattan becomes a no man's land where the law of the fittest is in force, forcing the poor citizens left in life to protect themselves from threats additional to the single disease. When the situation becomes desperate, agents belonging to the Division are sent into the field, a super secret organization designed to directly obey the President and intervene if the company is on the verge of collapse. During the first intervention of the Division, however, something goes wrong, forcing the leaders of the organization to set up a second wave of agents, among which our character also appears: in addition to restoring safety to the streets of New York, we will have to then investigate the facts that led to the failure of the first reconnaissance, discovering as a clich that all is not as it seemed at the beginning. In order not to spoil the pleasure of discovering the narrative component of The Division by yourself, we will not go further, limiting ourselves only to expressing a level of general sufficiency for a plot linked to situations that are now quite widespread within the catastrophic genre, already on its own one of the most inflated in recent years. Thanks to some gameplay elements, which we will discuss later, the story set up by the developers still manages to be followed in a fairly pleasant way, but the lack of characters with a certain depth is felt: as you know them, you will end up also to forget about the main ones. Similarly, the plot does not present particularly memorable situations. Multiple division Directly connected to the compoThe narrative entity of The Division is the part of the game that sees us committed to contributing to the reconstruction of the headquarters of the JTF, a task force that unites the remnants of the police and supervisory bodies of the city of New York. Since we will talk about the missions later, for the moment we limit ourselves to saying that our deeds around New York will allow us to strengthen the departments of the operational base, thus helping the JTF to regain control of the city, which ended up in the hands of groups that took advantage of the situation. The opponents, controlled by artificial intelligence, are divided into four types: the Cleaners, former New York hygiene workers convinced that the disease can only be eradicated by setting fire to anything; the Rikers, convicts who escaped from Rikers Island prison; the Rioters, ordinary people and criminals of various kinds who loot and kill to ensure their survival; the Last Man Battalion, a private military company hired by Wall Street companies to protect themselves before the situation escalates, and then leave the members of the LMB at the mercy of the epidemic. In the various clashes that we face, the game dynamics are presented in a hybrid guise, combining the single component with the multiplayer one in the most transparent way possible, passing in some phases from one to the other without loading. Playing The Division we were able to see that the gaming experience can actually be lived alone, but we soon realize how the online component is absolutely impossible to ignore. Not only for the Dark Zone and everything that can only be played via the Internet, but also to carry on what at first glance would seem to be the classic component in which you can advance alone. This is an aspect that rather clearly defines the philosophy behind The Division, which it is good to understand properly in order to be correctly aligned on what we should expect from this title, and what instead we cannot expect from it . Just to be clear, The Division joins Destiny on the market, drawing from the world of shooters and that of role-playing games, but finding the basis of its gaming system in massive online games. This setting will influence the player's experience in several points, starting from the main purpose which is to reach level 30, as happens precisely in the classic MMOs. This is also the reason why in this review you will only read marginally about the endgame, despite the fact that we had long questioned ourselves on this aspect when we talked about The Division. Unfortunately we will be forced to do it for a while longer, but we will return to the subject in the coming weeks: for the moment we will focus on the player's experience in terms of initial impact with the game, meaning as such a phase of leveling that still requires several hours of effort to be completed. Xbox One goals Unmissable are the 50 objectives for a total of 1000 points. Those of maximum value concern the completion of all departments (50), the completion of all missions on hard difficulty with a level 30 agent (50) and the achievement of the level cap (45). Then there are numerous achievements regarding collectibles and specific aspects of equipment and talents that offer between 25 and 30 points. Finally we find some minor objectives that concern specific basic activities to be performed in the game. How do you level up? Obviously the central node of the entire leveling experience in The Division is represented by the missions and the simple exploration of New York. With a style that seems to have gathered the best ideas of Assassin's Creed but above all the theme park-style design of the most famous MMORPGs on the market, World of Warcraft above all, the game divides the explorable portion of Manhattan into fifteen different neighborhoods, each with a precise range of levels ideal to be tackled. The player is then guided by the hand to reach the main shelter of the area where it is possible to accept a whole series of quests that will lead him to wander far and wide around the area, until he has exhausted all the available challenges and will be then ready to reach next shelter of higher level neighborhood. And so on until the level cap set at thirty is reached in this final release. Compared to the headquarters which is completely instanced (each player will only see his specific environment) and where it will be possible to enhance the three departments that determine the role-playing progress of your avatar, find all the vendor and crafting tables, in addition to the key characters for the advancement of the main plot, the shelters contain only the soldier and the board necessary for the collection of the quests, a single vendor to quickly empty the inventory but above all they act as a point of interest for fast travel. Going into the detail of the missions, The Division is structured on the basis of three different types. First there are the main quests, those that carry on the narrative of the game and that focus on the three departments that we will be able to enhance within the headquarters, once we have built them after having saved the three key figures in the story. There are about fifteen of them and they represent the greatest challenge that the title is able to offer, both in terms of complexity and variety and depth of gameplay. It will hardly take you less than half an hour to complete them and in these situations you will often be pleasantly surprised by the action created by Massive to keep the player's attention alive. Then there are the secondary missions, usually three per neighborhood and able to offer small challenges aimed above all at the exploration of Manhattan. For example, we will have to follow the traces of some missing people, climb roofs to reactivate antennas or deepen our knowledge of certain areas. Finally there are the encounters: these are quests completely dedicated to rapid and limited fights that will allow us to earn money, experience but above all the resources necessary for strengthening the departments. And then, invariably, there are dozens and dozens of collectibles scattered throughout Manhattan divided into survival manuals, tons of telephone recordings, small drones to shoot down and recover and so on. Needless to say, the developer's desire to stimulate players to explore every smallest corner of the Big Apple is grafted here. But is everything so wonderful and perfect? Actually not really. If on paper it may seem that Massive has set up a perfectly oiled and optimized leveling system for solo and group growth, also thanks to the double level of difficulty of the main missions, in reality in practice it will take very few hours to realize that, with very rare exceptions, the missions tend to look very similar. Not only the secondary ones and the meetings that are based on a few archetypes repeated to the bitter end, but also the main ones especially in their basic elements. The nature of a strongly action MMO has in fact forced the developer to rotate all the quests around the shootings. We will be constantly busy facing hordes of enemies: to empty rooms or outdoor areas, to free hostages, to defend devices, to reach inaccessible areas and so on. Everything is resolved, always and exclusively, in shooting behind cover. Not that this is a bad thing since it's a shooter anyway, but after a few hours you forget that each quest has its own little story and you just find yourself ready to run from one point to another before pulling the trigger. The Black Zone At the heart of the map and the final experience of The Division is the so-called Dark Zone. In narrative terms, this is the area of New York within which the authorities had initially confined most of the infected, and then left it to itself when the situation became unmanageable. The entire area is accessible from the first levels of your character, during which, however, you must pay attention to the area reached. In fact, the level of the enemies controlled by the CPU varies according to the latter: we thus pass from ZN1, recommended up to level 12, to ZN6, only suitable for those who have almost reached level 30. Once you get to the cap, the The entire Dark Zone will readjust to the achievement of the objective, offering the player appropriate challenges in all its areas. As mentioned on other occasions, the Dark Zone is also the only one where it is possible to enjoy PvP dynamics: in the role of renegade agents, players can kill their colleagues obtaining special bonuses, but gaining a wanted status which signals their presence on the map to all those who work in co-op instead. Although there are no missions in the Dark Zone but there are only clashes born ~by chance~, the gaming experience seemed fun enough to us, at least in the short term. However, to keep the interest alive over time, Ubisoft will necessarily have to plan something that goes beyond the recovery of objects from closed chests and random battles between players.
