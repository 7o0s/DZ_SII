{"name": "Una nuova tempesta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/128607-txk-una-nuova-tempesta.html", "text": "After the controversial Space Giraffe and the more conservative Gridrunner Revolution, Jeff Minter and Ivan ~Giles~ Zorzin decided to take a break from the old-school psychedelic shooters that have long represented Llamasoft's trademark. Discouraged above all by the enormous proliferation of Geometry Wars clones and games with neon graphics, the Welsh developer has in fact preferred to dedicate the last few years to the creation of those small mobile projects that fall within the so-called Minotaur Project. Titles such as Minotaur Rescue, GoatUp and Minotron 2112, which take up the styles and mechanics of some classics of the past, however, using traditional sprites instead of wireframes and vector graphics. Although they have ensured a few pleasant and original hours of entertainment for smartphone and tablet owners, the Minotaur Project games have kept a far cry from the audiovisual glory and gameplay refinement of the old Llamasoft titles, and it is therefore understandable the enthusiasm of the fans in the knowing that with TxK Minter restarts from what is undoubtedly the game for which the developer is most famous: Tempest 2000. Space is everything Developed exclusively for the Vita, TxK is pure Tempest. The same name refers to those Tempest 2000 (T2k) and Tempest 3000 (T3k) of which it is clearly the heir, and which in turn resumed and refined the concept created by Dave Theurer in the early 80s. The player moves his avatar along the edge of a surface that changes shape at each level: starting with a tube, then moving on to a heart, a letter or more and more complicated geometric shapes. Moving to the right or left, it is thus necessary to fire at the enemies that arrive from the opposite side of the surface, collecting power-ups, bringing the score to the stars and, possibly, avoiding leaving us pens in the meantime. It is not easy, since each opponent behaves differently, and the so-called Pinball machines (the most common) begin to persecute the player once they reach the edge. Those who played Tempest 2000 on the old Atari Jaguar will find various design elements: one of the power-ups allows you to make a short jump and get away for a few moments from the Pinball machines that reach the edge of the level; another summons an AI-controlled Droid, who helps clear away opponents for the duration of the level; there is also no shortage of special scenarios accessible after collecting rare triangles. Tempest's is a model that Minter has re-proposed so many times in the last twenty years that there would almost be no need to repeat it again. Yet it is surprising how with each iteration the author manages to highlight its thickness more and more and to enhance its psychedelic style: when the screen starts to get too crowded, the temptation to use the jump to get away from the edge is strong, but so by doing you do not earn points, which makes this technique an inadvisable resource if you want to aspire to climb the online rankings. On the contrary, the smart bomb allows you to double the score for each kill, and it is no coincidence that a good strategy is to accumulate a large number of enemies on the screen before exterminating them with a single touch on the touch screen (an idea that conceptually approaches the popular ~bulling~ technique of Space Giraffe). With a little practice and timing it's even possible to learn how to eliminate Flippers on the edge by simply touching them at the exact moment you fire. TxK is a trip that enchants both the eyes and the ears. PSVita trophies There are not many Trophies to unlock in TxK, but surely you have to roll up your sleeves to bring home the Platinum. Completing all the levels in Classic and Pure modes isn't too complex, but things get more interesting in the Survival option, in the absence of extra lives and bonus levels. Portable synesthesia Perhaps however, the real protagonists of TxK are its 100 levels, which gradually become more and more articulated and diabolical, proposing surfaces with an increasingly articulated and dynamic shape, which cross, bend and break up while the camera tilts and rotates on itself. The effect is disorienting and in many cases it takes a while to figure out how to move correctly to intercept incoming enemies. Obviously an ~8~ shaped level requires a completely different approach from a ~cross~ scenario, and adding further variety is the constant introduction of new types of opponents: the aforementioned Flippers are soon joined by enemies that electrify the surface, flowers that fire projectiles and bull heads that throw their horns when hit. Then the idea of introduce the Restart Best option already tested in some of Llamasoft's latest mobile games. In essence, each level is associated with the best performance in terms of score and available lives, thus allowing you to resume from the result obtained in one of the previous stages without the need to start from scratch every time you aim to set new records. What may seem like a minor addition actually speeds up the score attack exponentially and allows you to break up the experience into short and quick sessions, which is fundamental especially given the new portable nature of the game. TxK represents the sum of Minter's games and encompasses all the experience that the developer has accumulated over the last twenty years: this new Tempest heir moves away from the confusion and visual grime of Space Giraffe to shoot a pyrotechnic wireframe milkshake on the screen , neon and colors which, while remaining hypnotic and explosive as always, this time is much more readable, less tacky, almost elegant. Thanks also to the excellent screen of the Sony console. Not to mention that everything goes hand in hand with what is one of the best musical selections ever heard in a Llamasoft game, between electrifying techno accompaniments and crazy sound effects. TxK is a trip that enchants both the eyes and the ears.", "date": "2014-02-19", "grade": "8.8"}
