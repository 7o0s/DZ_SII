The first of these is coming to Xbox 360 and Xbox One and is called Super Time Force. The game in question is a horizontal scrolling shooter, born during an event dedicated to the development of new ideas, which is not satisfied with using some typical platform mechanics but enhances and reinterprets them by exploiting the time element. A sort of cross between Contra and Braid seasoned with an additional mechanic that in some ways recalls the power ups of the classic scrolling shooters with spaceships. But let's proceed in order. At the center of the story is the Super Time Force, a team of fighters, whose captain bears the significant surname Ramboise, who are charged with defeating an evil super villain commanding an army of fearsome robots. Each character of the team is differentiated by his arsenal but, in general, playing Super Time Force means hopping by pointing the weapon in various directions and making the most of the classic charged shot, which can be activated by holding down the X key, which in the case of Ramboise it is a burst capable of firing in three directions at once. Up to here everything normal, everything already seen or almost. But how does the time element we mentioned above intervene in the gameplay? Well, when we press the B key or the character we use in a given moment dies, the time-out is triggered, the main mechanic of Super Time Force. In fact, time can be rewound and in this phase it is possible to take control of another character while the previous one retraces all the moves we have made up to the activation of the time rewind. When the secondary character enters the game he can avoid the death of the previous one and by saving him, or waiting for him to reach the end of his sequence of actions, he can join his ~time shadow~ gaining the ability to use the skills of both fighters at the same time. Aimy, for example, is equipped with an anti-tank rifle that pierces the walls and the third member of the initial team is a little man all covered in tin that can reflect the shots and launch an energy shield capable of stopping any enemy attack for a few moments. But there are also other characters, obtainable during the adventure, which add further specialties, such as the rocket with which Jet Leppard causes massive damage to the bosses or the skateboard of an improbable dinosaur hero. Do you prefer double the volume of fire, shoot'em up style, or greater protection? The choice is up to the player who can also decide to give up the fusion and purposely sacrifice a character to overcome an obstacle more quickly. But that's not all. The temporal rewinding process can be performed several times in parallel and it is therefore possible to combine the action, in the same juncture of virtual time, of several fighters. Super Time Force is a contentrate of quotes, wild action and intriguing mechanics Xbox One goals There are 1000 points available, most of which are obtained by completing the title and using all the characters for a certain amount of time. Then there are a handful of encouragement achievements, such as the one awarded if you die within three seconds of taking action, and a hundred points, not particularly difficult to collect, linked to skill. Those who have time don't wait for time The time rewind mechanics are very versatile and grant the player a large number of options even in the most unlikely situations. We can define almost epic the possibility of launching an entire team, which can be made up of an army of all different characters, against a huge boss, in a real triumph of barrels, explosions and rivers of lead. But the guys at Capybara Games have introduced a limit to keep the difficulty balanced. The total number of time-outs that can be activated for each stage is 30 and although they seem to be many, and they are in the first levels, it is strongly recommended to save as many as possible in view of the increasing difficulty of the level being challenged. Sometimes, therefore, it is good to take it calmly, being careful to collect all the power ups which, by slowing down the timer, are essential to get to the end of the picture without sacrificing our soldiers unnecessarily. And this also applies to those who are gifted with talent in abundance since this alone is not enough. While the action is fast-paced and largely focused on player skill, Super Time Force's levels are big puzzles.mi hinged on the timer and must be solved by choosing and combining the right characters at the right time. Shieldy for example, a character who as the name indicates is equipped with a shield, is not very fast but can smoothly cross open areas full of enemies placed frontally. In some cases, however, it is better to move with circumspection, especially if the enemies are protected by walls, and in these cases the character indicated is certainly Aimy, the hawk-eyed damsel who can pierce walls and hit enemies before that they can even think of shooting at us. Also for the most spectacular action here comes Ramboise, fast and relentless action hero, capable of hitting several enemies at different heights at the same time. All these specialties, such as those of the extra characters that we find along the way, are the key to being able to save time and, once you get the hang of the formula, it is a pleasure to try the different combinations and experiment with new ways of overcoming the obstacles in the title which manages to offer a good level of challenge without being frustrating. Term, the latter, which we can instead use for the soundtrack, effective in evoking the atmosphere of 8-bit video games but not very inspired, too hard and too repetitive. Not that the tracks are unlistenable, apart from those fragments that we could call noise without making too many problems, but the sound sector is obviously lower than the graphic one. The new Capybara Games has specialized in art pixel art and Super Time Force is no exception. The characters are made in a very simple way but are well characterized and are embellished with delightful animations that make Super Time Force pleasing to the eye despite the style, excluding perhaps the medieval era, it cannot be said as inspired and suggestive as that Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery. Furthermore, the luminous effects are scarce, those small touches capable of giving pixel art a depth that otherwise is lacking by definition in this type of stylistic setting. But the result is still delicious between various and well-differentiated settings, running trains, huge bosses, flames in quantity and large explosions that threaten to finish off a land already brought to its knees by the harmful effects of a prodigious scientific discovery. The plot, mind you, is a pretext made up of simple dialogues and a few cutscenes. But there is no shortage of jokes, implausible scientific explanations and pleasant quotations that manage to adequately amalgamate the experience and which, to the great delight of the people of the boot, are translated into Italian.", "date": "2014-05-14", "grade": "8.5"}
