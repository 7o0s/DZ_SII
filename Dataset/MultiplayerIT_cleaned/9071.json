However, after the acquisition by EA, the time has come for Chillingo to get out of the narrow confines of a cardboard box, starting to create other IDs and thus trying to approach, if not repeat, the resounding success of his first great best seller. Fruit Roll therefore arrives on the App Store with a heavy burden already on their shoulders, a comparison as unfair as it is inevitable with the flagship title of the same software house, a bit the (sad) fate of ~famous brothers and sisters~ who, perhaps with the exclusion of dear Pippa Middleton (and her backsides), they are forced to live on reflected light. Vitamin rolling Fruit Roll can easily be defined as a puzzle game in which the main objective is to roll a nice fruit down from a floor, avoiding obstacles and pitfalls but at the same time accumulating points until the end of the various stages. However, the game concept in its simplicity contains a whole series of complications and variations, starting with the possibility of the fruit changing its nature. In fact, the little protagonist has the property of assimilating the substance of the fruit with which he comes into contact, being able to store up to three different types: it will therefore be enough to meet a red, a yellow and a purple fruit to have these three transformations available, which can be selected from the special menu/inventory always just a tap away. The reason for these variations is obvious: each color corresponds to a natural enemy that can be killed simply by running towards it, easily identifiable precisely by the chromatic tone: there will therefore be red frogs to hit by first ~tapping~ the same fruit, as well as brown monkeys , green worms and so on. The alternative is to skip the enemies in time, which will continue the game without accumulating the relevant points; the jump, also possible double, in fact mainly serves to reach the classic stars, always with the final aim of adding stratospheric scores. The difficulty of the game, initially quite low, grows exponentially as you progress through the levels, because the enemies increase but above all the inclination of the rolling plane; consequently, already starting from the fourth or fifth stage, the fruit will slide at very high speeds, forcing real lightning touches to engage the desired color or to simply jump over stars and obstacles. When you manage to find three fruits of the same color (it doesn't matter which one), a sort of ~destructive bonus~ is triggered, thanks to which the small vegetable transforms into an aggressive super fruit capable of dragging all enemies and stars with it possible, without suffering any damage; this sort of ~fury~ turns out to be a real breath of fresh air when the speed of the game becomes demanding, because it allows a few seconds of rest from the necessary eye / finger synchrony. Being substantially infinite, the longevity of Fruit Roll basically depends on the personal physical limit of endurance, thus pushing players to try to overcome their own record; for a more sensible comparison of scores and rankings there is of course both full support for Game Center and the rival social system Crystal. Finally, little to say about the technical sector, an absolutely secondary aspect as usually happens in this category of games: a lot of color (of necessity), fun and light style but fluidity always at the highest levels, even when the speed becomes unsustainable. Nice, even if a little repetitive, the tunes in the background. Tested version: 1.0 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2011-09-22", "grade": "6.7"}
