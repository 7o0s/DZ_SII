The first game is in fact a comet dated 2014 that hit video games with a partially unexpected force. The original has never been a masterpiece: not a bad game, that can't be said, but not even a strategic one that enters the history of the genre. The popularity of Evil Genius is closely linked to two factors: the undeniable charm of its setting, and its being basically a new Dungeon Keeper in a world still without mass ~Tower Defence~. A crude but extremely entertaining gem, and also the only one out there that promised, and delivered, to put you in the shoes of a James Bond-esque super villain with a super-secret base to run. He enters the myth through starvation, disappearing from the radar without followers or rivals worthy of attention. Evil charm Evil Genius 2: World Domination = The three headquarters in the game are really very nice, too bad that the attached casino has not been exploited better. It is thanks to the English Rebellion that Evil Genius is finally back in the limelight, and it is precisely with the sequel that we have had the pleasure of playing in the last week. Evil Genius 2: World Domination is perfectly in line with its predecessor, something has obviously changed but strengths and weaknesses have not yet found the right balance. With one substantial difference: unlike its predecessor, Evil Genius 2 is destined to grow, and good DLCs could really make it a much more interesting game than it already is, allowing it to take that extra step it deserves, like us. The best is once again in the setting, in the characters that will alternate on the screen, in the graphic and sound style. Here we are the villains, indeed the super villains: those with a base hidden on an island in the Pacific who carry out a destabilizing plan to conquer the world. Super villains yes, but also super caricatured: as you can see from the images, the style is lively and the humor far beats the sadism, totally out of place here. The purpose of the game? Survive economically until the perfecting of a mega evil weapon capable of keeping the whole world in check. To succeed, we will have to build our headquarters so that it is as functional as it is impenetrable, manage our men by dividing their tasks with precision, and of course spreading hatred and discontent around the globe through a special tactical map. Build and command Evil Genius 2: World Domination = Managing your own base is simple but extremely fun, especially when we start placing more advanced traps. The builder part is certainly the most successful, the most vivid one. Organizing your own fortress is pleasant from the start, and will become more and more intriguing as you go along. Organizing the spaces well, deciding where to build the different rooms, may seem unimportant in the first hours of the game, but with the arrival of problems, i.e. investigators, journalists, spies and invading forces to be rejected at the entrance, a good disposition will prove crucial. Logically essential are security measures such as well-arranged cameras, and of course the different traps that we will have at our disposal and that we will be able to unlock by investing in research: paralyzing rays, hatches, mega fists that come out of the walls and so on, chasing and exaggerating all the clichs of spy genre of the wonderful sixties. The management of your men starts from a good idea, the subdivision into roles is simple to understand and interesting to keep an eye on, but when things should get interesting, for example when we are under attack, it is more of a ~click click click~ what a fun logic, rewarding strategy. You have to highlight the enemies one by one, there's no drag & drop, and the use of your own units is automatic: choose the enemy, and then choose what happens to him, our subordinates will take care of the rest. Is this a ~is that all?~ which hurts particularly, partly made more acceptable by the different enemies that will be able to infiltrate the base, but one of the two biggest shortcomings of Evil Genius 2: World Domination. Sowing evil Evil Genius 2: World Domination - The tactical map almost looks like it's from another game. The style is similar, but the details and irony that distinguishes the management part are missing. The missions, fortunately, are more interesting and are also a good incentive for the replayability of Evil Genius 2: World Domination. Some quests change according to which evil genius we have chosen: there is Maximilian the megalomaniac rich man, Ivan the Russian known for being crazy and muscular, Zalika the great scientific minda and finally Emma, genius of espionage and master of poisons. After taking the first steps in the game, we will have to choose our right arm, also in this case there are four, each with its own storyline, and in this case our first choice was the son in need of affection in full Doctor Evil style by Austin Power. This intersection of story and missions, coupled with having three different secret bases to choose from, makes each playthrough sufficiently different from the last. The other portion of the game takes place entirely on the tactical map, which is a screen where you can observe the world divided into macro areas and where we can plan our next moves. Once a region has been conquered, we will be able to carry out different types of missions within it which, in addition to making us risk losing men, will also put tasty rewards on the plate, often in cash. However, this also tends to increase the alert level which can be lowered by waiting, for example by operating in other areas once we have gained control of them, or by completing missions in which the exact opposite occurs: money is not earned but spent and the alert consequently decreases. In addition there are other special missions that will appear from time to time and based on the storylines that we will have activated from the appropriate menu. However, everything concerning the tactical map is made with much less care than that reserved for the base and its management. The missions are less ironic if not even anonymous, while graphically the stylistic flashes that make the game so pleasant while dealing with the base are completely absent. Play and play again Evil Genius 2: World Domination = The game features some cut-scenes to introduce and end the different missions that we will be able to carry out. But don't expect anything special... The big problem of this Evil Genius 2: World Domination, the one that damages it the most, is precisely this lack of synergy between the management and the extremely weak strategic part. It's not just a matter of content, of how things are done, but also of timing, as a result you often find yourself forced to wait without having anything interesting to see or perfect. This could be a positive aspect for those looking for a game with which to approach the genre for the first time, if in addition to dampening the challenge it didn't affect the fun so much. In the end the minions don't do anything interesting, their hovering around the base doesn't seem to make much sense, and in the tactical screen the most thrilling thing is seeing the percentage of completion of the undertaken mission. Two of the three bases present and to choose from also have a cover: an abandoned casino that we can refurbish. We do not hide the great disappointment in discovering that this part does not seem to affect the trend of income and expenses if not marginally, but only helps to keep the presence of the base and its wickedness hidden from the prying eyes of visitors. Even as an economic simulation, Evil Genius 2: World Domination offers less than the bare minimum of a similar game.", "date": "2021-03-31", "grade": "7.3"}
