Usual shot to try to place a few more downloads or a real reflection of the quality of the product? The truth, as often happens in these cases, is decidedly in the middle... Shoot the Dragons brings home the result but without leaving its mark in a particular way The shooter that shoots big Wanting to synthesize to the extreme, Shoot the Dragons could be defined as the illegitimate child of the shooter sections that have been seen in the most recent Rayman chapters. The similarities begin above all in terms of graphics and design: very colorful and animated characters in a Sunday cartoon style therefore stand out against essential but brightly colored backgrounds, all inserted in a deliberately friendly and harmless context. In short, we are not dealing with a title capable of collecting the legacy of R-Type, also thanks to a gameplay that does its best to avoid any semblance of depth and complexity. Also in this sense, Shoot the Dragons is very reminiscent of Rayman's digressions into the genre, putting on the plate a very basic play structure in its mechanics. The main character - a sort of Tony Stark equipped with a jetpack - moves by dragging his finger across the screen and shoots automatically, while a virtual button allows you to release a special attack after appropriate loading. From time to time, power-up boxes appear that allow you to enjoy for a short period of time the help of a creature that joins the protagonist's side or temporarily takes his place. We continue like this by facing hordes of small enemies which are followed at short intervals by bigger and tougher opponents and real bosses complete with a (long) energy bar to squander. Faithful to the prevailing trend that has dominated the mobile sector for years, Shoot the Dragons does not present a succession of predefined levels, but a single scenario with the arrangement and type of enemies generated randomly, an element that is closely linked with the free nature to play of the product. Borrowing the typical dynamics of endless runners, the main purpose of the user is to resist the assaults of the opponents for as long as possible, and then spend the resources earned to enhance the attributes of the protagonist and the creatures that accompany him. As is typical in these cases, the progression without the purchase of paid content immediately appears rather slow and subject to a heavy grinding that extremes the repetitiveness of the game structure: an aspect that also heavily affects the longevity of the game. experience, theoretically infinite but which on balance immediately shows all its cards without finding much to say after just a few games. A gameplay that is only pleasant does not have the shoulders broad enough to carry on the shack alone, and the logical consequence is that Shoot the Dragons can get bored rather quickly. A possible margin of interest can be represented by the collectibles that are obtained during the various game sessions and by the different creatures that can be unlocked along the way, but these are still side elements that cannot reverse the situation in favor of the Weedo title .
