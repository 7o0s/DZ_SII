The Finnish developers have thus chosen to make a leap in time and space, abandoning any semblance of verisimilitude and scenographic contemporaneity to move into a future capable of justifying jumps, stunts and further hyperbolic situations. A scenario in which to find a place to also insert a trick system, the FMX, with which to try without too much success to add something to the basic formula. A setting explored at all latitudes and variations on the theme in the six DLCs included in the Season Pass, which have moved the action to post-apocalyptic ruins, in an even more synthetic and abstract future, resulting in pure sci-fi, in the depths of the sea and even higher, up to the sky. What could be the remaining option to give the right amount of personality to a new, great add-on? Pushing the accelerator further, beyond the dizzying limits already touched, towards the most blatant madness and nonsense. We reviewed Awesome Level MAX, the craziest DLC in Trials Fusion Once upon a time The most striking new feature of Awesome Level MAX is the Awesome Adventure, a series of tracks linked by a story featuring the Unicorn MK II, a ~motorcycle~ made up of a cat riding a unicorn. As if that weren't eccentric enough, the two are characterized in a winning way, with the jockey wearing an improbable Rambo headband and holding a golden gangster pistol, with a very evil air, except to accompany his deeds with very normal and sweet meows. The unicorn with its earrings, tribals and flames that flare up from its nose looks just as cool, but moves like a log of wood, almost as if it were a toy, arousing similar tenderness. Our people thus launch themselves at full speed into a truly crazy adventure, even by the standards of Trials, which mixes science fiction, fantasy and touches from The Twilight Zone without too much concern. Between paths that see them teleport in a syncopated way between one dimension and another, levels that attempt a non-linear approach (at least in the facade) and hybridizations with role-playing games (again...), a couple of fleeting but well thought boss fights and an FMX stage so exaggerated and definitive that it practically represents the Alpha and Omega of Fusion, you go through it all with extreme pleasure, spending half the time with a stupid smile on your face and the other half with an expression of genuine astonishment. Too bad that what is missing are the concentrated looks and the gnashing of teeth that can arise from a challenge up to it. Indeed, the Awesome Adventure flows all too easily, practically slipping away, with rare moments when things acquire a bit of bite or thickness. The unicorn itself does not impose a particular driving style, given that it is basically ridden like a motorcycle with physics that has been revised for a moment, resulting in slightly more plastered, to make it at least a moment different from the average. The MK II does not even contemplate the FMX, completely removed, which in the light of the bizarre couple from which it is formed could perhaps have given rise to some interesting ideas, even from the ~adventure~ perspective of the mode. Sin. When it's serious Of a completely different substance RedLynx VS All-Stars, a collection containing 11 tracks created from scratch by the Finnish developers and as many selected in the huge cauldron of material created by the community, which represents the real highlight of Awesome Level MAX. Here the inspiration on the aesthetic level and the scenic gimmicks goes hand in hand, in fact, with a level design and gameplay ideas capable of giving a lot of satisfaction. We go from a Departure to the Underworld that seems to come from God of War III to the horror of Ghost Town, from the cyberbunk that seems to have been born from the head-on collision between Deus Ex and the first two Red Factions of Seismic activity in Adelopia 9, set in a forest in which one could expect, at any moment, to see themselves cut off by hunters in pursuit of an Evolve Goliath. Without forgetting Short Circuit, which can be claustrophobic just like finding yourself inside a Personal Computer in a dense maze of motherboards, capacitors, GPUs and heatsinks could be or the extreme quotes from Citt di Latta, which transforms one of the classic levels ~ 2D~ already seen in the past in a cross between Limbo and Dead Light, with a splash of Super Meat Boy. ANDthen the most singular of all, Spazio Cubicolo, which declines the Trials formula in a simple but absolutely refreshing way, which had not yet been seen. All with a really well-calibrated progressive challenge rate, starting from the requirements for access to the different groups into which they are divided, which may require obtaining one of the base game licenses or having successfully passed the his last, ruthless internship. In short, there is something for every skill level, ranging from soft and flowing scenarios, which nevertheless make you want to face again and again, improving from attempt to attempt to fully savor the admirable construction, to real sources of damnation, requiring mastery of the high-profile game formula and even more extreme patience. Ultimately, inside Awesome Level MAX there is enough to potentially enjoy a massive amount of hours of Trials at its best, without being fooled by the shiny new golden item that heads the top right of the menu, relating to Acorns, a currency through which to buy aesthetic objects, supplied with a basic quantity (400 units) that is barely enough to buy one of the scarcest paid helmets.", "date": "2015-07-24", "grade": null}
