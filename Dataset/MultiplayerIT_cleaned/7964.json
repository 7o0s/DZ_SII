Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Experimentation made possible by a development environment such as the one that characterizes mobile platforms has led, in recent years, to the birth of truly innovative games with respect to the genre to which they belong. Let's think, for example, of the Infinity Blade-style gestural fighting games, or of fascinating adventures such as the recent Year Walk, capable of successfully exploiting the peculiarities of the devices on which they run, above all the touch screen. It's not a new phenomenon, see the Cooking Mama and Professor Layton franchises on Nintendo DS, but the implications are equally pleasant. Let's take for example the so-called ~escape games~: it is a simple mix between ~point and click~ adventure and puzzle, in which our goal is to open a door or a safe by acting on certain mechanisms that change from time to time . The Japanese team 58 Works had already delighted a large slice of the public with the first episode of DOOORS and its seventy-five puzzles, and is now back with a sequel that re-proposes the original formula without major changes, focusing a little more on object management collected but above all on the novelty of completely unpublished problems. The control system also remains unchanged, truly essential and completely based on the touch screen but without interface artifices inserted in order to highlight the interactable areas of the scenario. It will be up to us to understand what is possible to touch and what is not, going first without fail and then perhaps proceeding with attempts, which will not make the solution of the puzzle less satisfying. Light my fire The forty levels of DOOORS 2 are represented, as already mentioned, by closed doors that you have to find a way to open. In the early stages, the operation is very simple: maybe just touch the knob or slide it, if the mechanism requires it. After this ~introduction~, however, the first puzzles begin to appear and you have to pay attention to the elements of the scenario. If there are buttons on the wall that can be turned on, going from red to green, and at the same time there is a pattern that tells us the order in which they are turned on, then we have to reproduce it for the door to open. Or maybe there are boxes that contain objects to be used to unlock the lock. At this juncture, the game reveals itself in some ways more multifaceted than the previous episode, offering us various ~layers~ within a single puzzle: a panel that must be unscrewed, an object that must be repositioned and so on, in the meantime keeping the screwdriver , diving goggles, fire extinguisher, gems and everything that we will collect and which is intended to be used later. The absurdity of certain scenes characterizes the product, see for example the skeleton of a dinosaur clenching something between its teeth while there is a lit fire in front of the door, or the white statue, with an ~angelic~ appearance, juxtaposed to the black, demonic one, with a crucifix to solve the puzzle and release the lock. In short, the things that the developers have managed to invent are really weird and fascinating, even though they cannot count on a high-level technical realization. The graphics of the game are in fact really simple and in the same way the sound is essential.", "date": "2013-03-09", "grade": "7.0"}
