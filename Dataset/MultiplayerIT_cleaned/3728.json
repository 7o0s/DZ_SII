{"name": "Eastshade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eastshade-recensione.html", "text": "Eastshade is a first-person adventure built with great intelligence, which offers an alternative way of interacting with video games, almost completely excluding violence, as we will see in the course of the review. Thinking about video games, many underestimate the sheer aesthetic pleasure that can be experienced by playing them and which in many cases is an integral, if not fundamental, part of the gameplay itself. We are not talking about that form of satisfaction that derives from the exposure of the brute technical power implemented by many titles, which has more to do with the sexual sphere than with the intellectual one, but with a form of enjoyment that arises from the contemplation of beauty in its higher and deeper meaning and which involves a certain part of the human soul, not necessarily developed in everyone. Eastshade first of all asks the player to observe, offering him a different perspective on the beauty that can be encountered in a 3D world: that of a painter who visits the island from which the game takes its name, looking for inspiration for his works. The adventure begins with a shipwreck, which makes us wake up in a beautiful cave on the seashore and inhabited by a strange character who gives us some general indications. Our main goal, if we want to call it that, is as vague and poetic as it gets: we have to paint four places dear to our mother, who had visited Eastshade in the past. Leaving the cave and following a short path we find ourselves in the small coastal village of Lyndow, where we meet the inhabitants, all quite friendly and willing to help us. Here we learn some of the fundamental mechanics of the game, namely how to build canvases, with a simple crafting system that we will talk about later, and how to paint. PAINT Painting in Eastshade is really very simple: having built a canvas, just extract it, frame the subject you want to reproduce, deciding the appropriate size of the frame, and then press the action button. The canvas is automatically placed on an easel and the image appears as if by magic, however created in pictorial form. In order not to make it a simple photographic modality, i.e. to give it a broader sense within the gameplay, the developers have imposed two limits on painting: the first is the amount of material that is found to build the canvases, quite small (especially at 'start); the second are the inspiration points necessary to create a painting, which are obtained by visiting new places, making experiences, talking to people, carrying out some tasks and drinking certain drinks. With no inspiration points, no diamonds. If they seem stringent limits to you, you're right, but in fact in the game they take on a precise function, which is to make the choice of subjects to paint more thoughtful, consequently increasing attention to the beauties of the island. Not being able to paint everything, one proceeds more slowly, looks at the landscapes more carefully and is more inclined to explore and interact with everything, enjoying what the authors have created: for example, reading the books scattered around the houses yields inspiration points, therefore we tend to open them all. There may also be impromptu situations that become pleasant diversions, such as a solitary musician in search of inspiration who offers us to listen to one of his songs, or couples having a picnic in the most romantic and picturesque places on the island . Eastshade is not a very large island, but it is composed with great care and with a remarkable pictorial taste: stone bridges cross large ravines, cities with peculiar architectures rise on rock spurs, ruins of ancient buildings stand out against the Moon, and natural beauties of all kinds populate the whole island. In short, there is really a lot to see and, when you decide that you want to paint something, you naturally find yourself carefully choosing the angle from which to paint, in order to obtain the most beautiful result possible (to our taste ). In short, after having painted it is important to feel that a precious inspiration point has not been wasted. Classic mechanics Eastshade is not just painting and contemplation, but also offers other more traditional mechanics, which in hindsight are the weakest part of the entire production. In particular we think of crafting, which requires you to search and collect raw materials for the entire island, even in the houses of the inhabitants. Fortunately, the latter do not complain about us entering their homes and stealing objects such as candles, canvases and wooden boxes ... of course, an alternative solution would have been welcome. For example, the art dealer could have been introduced since subito, allowing us to buy some things instead of stealing them. In addition to the canvases, fortunately there are not many objects to produce, with the latter however being linked to the progression, i.e. they give access to otherwise unreachable areas of Eastshade: creating a bonfire allows you to wander around the island at night without the risk of freezing, while a raft made with strange flowers allows you to cross the deepest bodies of water without difficulty. On the other hand, the interaction with the inhabitants who give us advice, indications and, above all, provide us with missions is better. The latter are usually pictorial commissions or the request for some objects. For example, to obtain the map of the island it will be necessary to find four mushrooms that contain ink, while some characters will ask us to create particular paintings to hang at home. Some quests require even a minimum of investigation, but in general they never end up overlapping too much free exploration, leaving the player with ample leeway. In general we would have liked not having to spend time collecting sticks, shrubs, eggs and whatnot, but we also understand the need to equip the gameplay with more traditional elements in order not to alienate some players, who would otherwise have complained about the lack of things to do. In general, however, the contrast between the Eastshade concept and these mechanics is strong enough, not so much to ruin the whole experience, but enough to create more than a few jarring notes. In short, Eastshade could have been a masterpiece, if only he had given up on what does not suit him. It looks like one of those paintings whose core is beautiful, but ruined by the addition of superfluous elements.", "date": "2019-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
