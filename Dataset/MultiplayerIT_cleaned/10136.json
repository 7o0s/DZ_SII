In the case of Milestone, an Italian team that has been successfully dedicated to the racing game genre for years, the choice was above all to acquire the license of the Italian Superstars Championship and to offer players the opportunity to get on the track using drivers and cars real. The cars are nothing more than the sports version of models produced by BMW, Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, Cadillac, Chrysler, Chevrolet, Maserati and Porsche; in short, real supercars, but not so distant from the regular series. Far from docile, however: we are talking about engines of over 5,000 cubic centimeters that reach 450 horsepower, a factor which, combined with rear-wheel drive, makes the driving experience suitable for an audience of only experts, or nearly so. And it is precisely on these ~elitist~ aspects that Superstars V8 Racing aimed most of all, positioning itself as a product capable of fascinating precisely because it is ~niche~, designed for the most skilled players. A goal that is far from easy to achieve, let's face it, which in practice has seen us collide with a steep and daunting learning curve, as well as with a general lack of ideas regarding the available methods. The new challenge Superstars V8 Next Challenge features a much friendlier and more open-to-interpretation driving model than the first episode of the series. The game starts by default with the opponents' AI at an ~easy~ level and all the aids enabled, showing us different speed, acceleration and handling values for each of the nineteen cars, peculiarities which then stand out clearly on the track, right from the first corner . Thanks to the possibility of tackling the races more calmly and without the fear of making even the slightest mistake, the experience is objectively better, more engaging, and leads us first by the hand to disabling the aids (automatic gearbox, ABS, traction and stability) and then to the selection of a higher level of challenge. We had tested Superstars V8 Racing on PlayStation 3 and noticed an annoying dead zone in the movement of the left analog stick, but the problem does not seem to affect this new episode, which we played on PC using an Xbox 360 controller. moreover, it assimilates quickly to the input. There are a total of eleven tracks available (three of which can be unlocked by winning a championship and completing the various sections of the ~driving school~) and boast an innovative system called the ~Evolving Track~ which changes the environmental conditions dynamically. In practice it happens that during our laps the weather changes even suddenly and with obvious repercussions on our driving style, especially when cornering. Before each race session (free laps, qualifying, race 1 and race 2) we are presented with the weather situation and we can make changes to the set-up accordingly, drawing from the many ~pre-packaged~ configurations or adjusting the various parameters individually according to the our tastes, to then save the profile. Considering the presence of almost twenty cars on the track at the same time, we felt comfortable moving the incidence of the brakes forward (after all, braking on bends with a rear-wheel drive car is almost never a brilliant idea), using soft tires dry, adjusting the suspension to maximum stiffness and making some changes to the ratios to get a better starting point but at the same time a decent extension. Playing with the default AI level (~easy~, as already mentioned), this is generally enough to reach the lead of the race after just one lap (at most two, for the more complicated circuits) and lead to the end of the race. competition. Raising the level of challenge translates into even more unscrupulous behavior from the opponents than usual: they don't have any problem throwing us out and easily distance themselves on the straight, but they always remain quite slow in the corners and tend to anticipate braking too much. Points of view The game offers us a good number of different views: two placed behind the car (close or far) and four in first person, two of which with the dashboard visible. Unfortunately these last solutions, although very fascinating and technically well done, prove to be very complicated to use due to the viewing angle: the portion of the track that we can see beyond the windshield is decidedly modest, and even cIt seems that on the climbs the road is not visible at all. A nice cushion under the pilot's butt would perhaps have improved the situation. The external views, usually little considered by the purists of the genre, prove to be the best as usual for identifying the trajectories and making effective cuts when cornering. They also allow us to notice the work that the developers have done to enhance the damage system: we are not at the level of Codemasters products, but the dents and scratches are convincing both from an aesthetic point of view and from a practical point of view, with obvious repercussions on the control of the car when the impact involves tires and suspensions. The tracks once again have ups and downs, but the presence of dynamic variability sometimes manages to transform them in a spectacular way as we make the various laps. The management of the lights, in particular, appears truly realistic and gives certain landscapes a particular charm: the Mugello circuit, for example, is striking for the extraordinary colors that enrich its features when the clouds create a particular refraction of sunlight. Some rich and well-represented scenarios alternate with other less brilliant and somewhat desolate ones, but the balance is all in all positive. What unfortunately disappoints is the repeated absence of particular solutions regarding the game modes: fast race, race weekend, championship, driving school and multiplayer. The game is full of achievements which, however, return very little (are you interested in furnishing your ~relax corner~?), the ~rewards~ system to unlock the three extra circuits wears out its charm too quickly and longevity is entrusted for the more to a well-made but not very multifaceted multiplayer and to the (possible) desire to master all the cars: it's a bit little, you have to invent something else, perhaps investing in some brazenly arcade element (upgrades?) with a special mode. The technical sector shrinks in the face of the spectacularity of DiRT 2, but can have its say as regards the polygonal count (the cars on the screen are objectively many) and the excellent dynamic lighting system, capable of making the tracks always different. Superstars V8 Next Challenge doesn't expect super pumped hardware, moreover: by disabling vsync (there's no shadow of tearing after all) we played quietly at 1680 x 1050 pixels getting 40-50 fps with some annoying drop during the curves. The roar of the engines is realistic and the ~muffled~ effect found with the views from inside the car is appreciable, but the side effects are a bit lacking.", "date": "2010-03-18", "grade": "7.6"}
