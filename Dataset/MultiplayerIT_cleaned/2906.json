As we will see in the course of the review of The Outer Worlds: Peril on Gorgon, it does not upset the basic formula of the Obsidian title in any way, but merely tells a secondary story linked to one of the dark secrets of Alcione, the star system in which carry out the adventure. In thematic terms it adds a large piece to the mythology already well outlined by the main campaign, reinforcing a certain critical vision of the hyper-capitalist system, which is in any case already well established. The DLC begins with a package delivered to the historic captain of the Unreliable, the spaceship we use to move from planet to planet. An old friend of his sent him a message, accompanied by his severed arm, inviting him to carry out a mission that will make him a fortune. Too bad the recipient died at the beginning of The Outer Worlds and we're in his place now! Intrigued by the thing, we decide to take the job and we go to a small asteroid, orbiting around the gigantic Gorgon cluster, where the Ambrose family mansion stands. It is a creepy place where only the last Ambrose lives together with his robot minions. After a brief chat we return to the Unreliable with the task of going to Gorgon to find a diary and find out what happened to a large research center, closed in a hurry due to unspecified problems. Of course, all is not as it seems and soon what was supposed to be a simple recovery mission turns into a journey of discovery of one of Alcyone's darkest secrets, which will lead us to meet new characters who are often over the top, full of senses of guilt and the desire to leave their old life behind. Countryside The campaign of Peril on Gorgon takes place almost entirely on a new map, where different structures arise. Following the trail in the diary, as soon as we arrive on site we go to the most classic of role-playing game bars, to look for information and some secondary missions. We get a handful, of which, however, only one longer and vaguely interesting. To carry them out we still have to visit some buildings where the main story will lead us, so we don't rush. Once out in the open we begin to wander through the desolate streets of the asteroid, where we meet some high-level marauders with whom we get to dance. The pure gameplay has remained identical to that of the base game: around there are objects at will, crammed into containers scattered everywhere. There are so many of them, so much so that we have never had a shortage of ammunition or new weapons. There are also plenty of vending machines and workbenches, so you never risk running out of upgrades or not being able to repair your equipment. By killing enemies, we soon realized that the level cap also grew, both that of the character and that of weapons and skills. To play we used our saves with a thirtieth-level character: in a few hours we brought him to thirty-third, the new maximum level. Gorgon's creatures are all high-ranking and give a lot of experience, as well as quests. Despite this, they do not offer any particular challenges, in the sense that they all have very predictable and already seen attack patterns. Even the new recruits, such as disturbing laboratory guinea pigs and large robots, attack directly and without following precise tactics. In this sense, the DLC inherits a deeply felt problem of the base game: the general ease that makes the use of many of our character's skills superfluous, so much so that sometimes it seems to be playing a pure FPS. Better to immediately select the maximum difficulty level if you are among those who do not like to take health walks and who want to take advantage of the different combat systems available. Strengths and problems Unfortunately Obsidian with Peril on Gorgon hasn't done much to rebalance the game, whose structural defects emerge quite clearly during the adventure, precisely because it was designed for high-level characters. As already mentioned, a lot of time is spent collecting junk that has the sole purpose of being exchangeable for money at vending machines, or killing minor enemies. Since the only really intriguing element is the story, you often end up running from one placeholder to another, jumping over buildings and enemies, aware that in most cases, stopping to fight or explore would only give you equipment of little use . That said, overall iadditional contents are not evil. In particular, some of the new dungeons (mostly abandoned buildings of the research center) are intelligently designed and have different approaches depending on the skills possessed. Too bad for the scarcity of secondary missions, some with not exactly exciting qualities (does the idea of looking for phonographs scattered throughout Gorgon excite you?) Graphics Graphically, Peril on Gorgon is perfectly in line with the base game. Some of the new locations are particularly spectacular, in particular the villa degli Ambrose, but in principle there is no departure from what has already been seen on Alcione. The Gorgon map itself is designed more functionally than scenic, so much so that it lacks interesting landscapes (after all, it is an asteroid that houses a large research center, not a tourist site). Some of the interiors are better, richer in details, even if not very organic. It matters little, however, because even if it were more beautiful graphically, the substance would not change one iota: Peril on Gorgon is a DLC designed simply for those who want more The Outer Worlds. Those who are satisfied with the adventure already experienced will not have great incentives to install it, since it does not add anything really significant to the experience as a whole. Obsidian underlines how it can be replayed several times depending on the choices made, but honestly only once was enough for us and we didn't find great incentives to return to Gorgon after seeing the ending.", "date": "2020-09-09", "grade": "7.0"}
