Yet something went wrong during development. What we have in our hands cannot be the finished game. It was supposed to be the sunny brother of Hotline Miami in three dimensions, instead it's an immature shooter abandoned on the street. Adding salt to the disappointment is the fact that, despite the flaws, the underlying concept remains brilliant and full of potential: two policemen who have each other's backs as they raid hideouts full of criminals. Rivers of blood, rain of bullets, modus operandi ~shoot first then ask~; in short, the dream of every virtual gunslinger with a 70s mustache. All useless, mission failed, starting with the police office. In fact, there are six agents to choose from, but it doesn't matter which ones you decide to take with you, since the progression of statistics through the assignment of experience points makes them all the same. Indeed, woe to play with more than two different agents, because every experience point is needed to give them the minimum margin that allows them to survive long enough to finish a mission. In fact, the game is too unbalanced, and to make matters worse it encourages the player to follow a bankruptcy approach: if you want to survive in LA Cops you have to do exactly the opposite of what the game suggests. But enough with the chatter, let's take a gun and a badge and see how things actually stand on the field. LA Cops shoots a lot of bullets but rarely hits the target Beware of enemies but even more of friends The key to the game system is the cooperation between the two field agents. We can decide at any time which of the two to control with the simple push of a button. An immediate, fast system, but which sends everything upside down when we expect the second agent to cover our backs by shooting anyone who enters his visual space. Sometimes it shoots, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it can happen that he shoots at those who are behind him or simply does not have time to pull the trigger. If we don't trust his reaction capabilities, we can point him to a point on the map and he will reach it by raiding every room he finds in his path. In theory we should storm enemies from another entrance and coordinate great, but again the execution falls short of the planning. In fact, usually to get to a second entrance we have to clean up entire rooms, with a very high percentage of dying unjustly, or of seeing our partner get killed like a rookie in the meantime. LA Cops offers a super simplified game system but does not offer adequate reaction times or even reliable artificial intelligence. Let's take enemies, for example. They go round and round in the rooms and don't notice if we open a door, as long as their backs are turned. If we want we can then arrest them by surprise, but we risk misjudging their unpredictable field of vision and blam! we're dead. We raid, kill two but a third comes at lightning speed and blam!, we're dead. We fire a shot to lure an enemy out of the room and hide in the opposite corner. But he doesn't go to the point where we fired but points without fail to where we are and blam!, we're dead. We don't need a policeman here, we need Robocop. The only solution is to rely as much as possible on automatic aiming, hoping to be quick to pull the trigger and immediately frame the next enemy. But more often than not well, you get the idea. Unfortunately the lack of solid rules takes away any taste in redoing the missions because there is no way to learn from your mistakes. It can always happen to be killed dishonestly, and that is the end of any possible satisfaction. The partner, you say? You quickly end up using him as a backup life or job boy tasked with retrieving the med-kit when the lead agent ends up knocked over. The missions are usually quite long and complex and result in the liberation of a hostage, the destruction of shipments of drugs or other simple tasks. Eventually we have to kill all the enemies anyway, so it doesn't make a big difference. If nothing else, with three difficulty levels and a few alternate assignments there's enough to keep us busy for several hours, albeit at the price of considerable frustration. The story that punctuates the missions is instead an unfinished hint of narration and is immediately forgotten. Only the artistic direction manages to bring smiles back to our drawn faces. A great pity indeed, because there are times when theThe game finds its rhythm and the gunfights begin to ensue, but then flaws in the game system break the illusion at the speed of a bullet fired at point-blank range.", "date": "2015-03-31", "grade": "5.9"}
