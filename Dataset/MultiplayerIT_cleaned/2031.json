{"name": "RedCard Soccer 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/redcard-soccer-2003_a.html", "text": "Options The first screen includes: friendly, advanced game, customize team, options, load/save. The ~Options~ section includes: game, stage, controller, visual, audio. In the ~Game~ screen you can choose the language (Italian, German, French, English and Spanish), the pc skill (amateur, semi-professional, professional and worldwide), the length of the game times, the vibration of the controller, the offside, referee severity (can be completely excluded with the consequences that you can imagine or place at the maximum) In the ~Stadium~ screen you can choose the standard stadium in which to play friendlies, the climate of the matches (clear, rain or snow ) The Controller screen is needless to explain, as it allows for the usual controller key changes. In the ~Visual options~ screen you can choose the camera with which to view the match (7 types of cameras, including one right on the ball carrier up to the isometric one very distant from the field and which takes in a vast playing area); autoplay after goals, radar, selected player name, playing time, match score. In the ~Audio~ screen you can choose the language of the commentary (Italian, Spanish, French, German and English) and set the volumes of the commentary, music and sound effects on the field. The comments are by Stefano Tacconi and another commentator. The commentary is funny, funny and realistic enough. The only flaw concerns Tacconi's audio: too low and sometimes it is difficult to understand what he is saying. The ~Team management~ section is the only corner of football strategy that we Italians are so fond of in the game. You will be able to access the management of each team in the game (52 national teams). In the aforementioned management it will be possible to change the names of the players, their goal number and set the physical characteristics: you have 37 points available for each player and you can increase or decrease the attack, defense, power, speed and morale. The national teams featured in the game are made up of real players for the most part; only the Brazilian players do not have real names, but only acronyms, while Italy, Germany, France and other national teams are made up of real players. Even in this section, however, the management of the team ends like this. You can not decide defensive strategies, game schemes ... .. Nothing at all. The game is totally arcade and remains in all respects. The only way to change the game pattern is during the game, but without any unnecessary frills in a game like this. Friendly Let's move on to the friendly. First of all, you choose whether to play at home or away from home (by positioning the controllers, up to 2); at this point you are asked if you want to load the profile you have created and which keeps track of the various tournaments, games played and options. Then the teams divided into continents are selected. Of course you can view the statistics of the comparison between the teams relating to attack, defense, speed, power, morale. Before starting the game it is possible to change the climate, the stadium and the various options in this regard. Finally it begins. View of the stadium with a small window that indicates the location of the match and the continent it belongs to (almost always Asia, they are the stadiums of the World Cup). The stadiums are well built and architecturally exciting. A notable flaw concerns the fans, really insignificant, just a splash of color, some flags of the teams in the match and that's it. Then the usual fireworks and confetti, perhaps a little exaggerated. The turf is satisfactory, although not the best of the best. Areas without grass can be glimpsed (often due to the fire slides that footballers make or bomb shots). The players enter the field, the referee and the game begins. The movements of the players are fluid and sufficiently real and the same goes for passes, lobs or shots without notes on the special effects that we will see in a bit. All the same the special movements, the falls are very realistic and well built. At first glance, therefore, the game would seem normal, until the tackles begin. All special moves begin with the left trigger pressed. Without the use of the left trigger, shots, passes, slides, although a little arcadey, are all in all normal and almost real. Pressing the left trigger and the button for the shot on goal, the slide, the less aggressive tackle .... you will have new moves that are much, much more arcadey. Calin the mouth, impressive slides, uncatchable fiery shots, headers and anything else will magically become your favorite moves. There are no real injuries during the game and players cannot be substituted. In the event of a too strong slide, the player will remain on the ground for a few moments in pain and then get back up. Unfortunately there is always a ~but~. In fact, you won't be able to make as many special moves as you want, but you will be limited in some way. In fact, at the bottom left and right of the telescreen there will be a small window with the data of the player selected at that moment. His name, shirt number, turbo bar, scheme that the team is using (available only and without modifications: 442, 433, 532, 343) and finally a bar made up of 4 notches will be indicated. Each special move that is performed burns one, two, three or all four notches (for example the bomb shot) and therefore it is necessary, in order to redo the move again, to wait a certain period for the energy bar to become full again. This is also to limit exaggerations and make the game a little more difficult. The referee (if you have left the severity bar in the middle between lack of severity and absolute severity) will intervene a few times and especially near the penalty area. Let's say that in a game a two will intervene three times at the most. When he intervenes he can warn or expel, but precisely, he intervenes so rarely that there is nothing to worry about. Furthermore, it is sufficient to make a foul against the referee to knock him down and therefore make him unable to whistle for a certain period. Small graphic flaw: when the referee only takes out the notebook to write down the foul, he moves to take it from his pocket, but nothing comes out and so he writes on the hand. It also whistles even without having been equipped with a whistle. By pausing the game, you have the following options: resume play, camera, game statistics (possession, goals, shots, saves, fouls, cards, tackles, injuries, ball loss, star players; these statistics appear at the end of the first half and at the end of the game), restart the game, quit. At the end of the match, if it ends in a draw, it goes to the golden goal and then to penalties. At the end of the game, after the statistics, the (wrong) wording ~victories~ will appear with the flag of the team that won and the usual winners and losers drama. After a goal the player cheers, confetti falls from the stands, a window appears with the player's name, shirt number, minute of play and the number of goals scored. Then the replay starts. Another flaw of the game is the total lack of replays, apart from the one after a goal which in any case cannot be reviewed or modified. A real shame for a game that absolutely requires the replay option to be able to review all the fouls committed and the spectacular goals scored. The weather doesn't affect the game at all. In the case of snow, you don't even see snow on the ground, just flakes falling from the sky and players' breath turning into normal winter ~smoke~. With the rain, puddles can be seen on the ground, the ball creates concentric circles on the ground as if it were falling into the water, but without affecting playability. Advanced game The ~Advanced Game~ section includes the ~Conquest~, ~Finals~ and ~Tournament~ modes. ~Conquest~ allows you to choose a team and play against all the teams in the game plus the hidden ones, divided by continents (Antarctic, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia, Africa). After defeating the teams of an entire continent, you will have to face the hidden ones of that continent. The hidden ones are really fun and above all strong teams: there are dolphins, penguins, special forces of police (SWAT), Seals, gorillas, samurai. And each with its own stadium (for example an aircraft carrier for the Seals or an ice stadium for the penguins). Of course, once unlocked, they can also be used like other national teams. The ~Finals~ mode, possible only after passing the ~Conquest~ mode, represents the classic World Cup final. The ~Tournament~ mode allows up to four players to compete in a tournament of 16 teams. Four players who, however, will not be able to play together, as a maximum of 1 against 1 is allowed. Unfortunately, the possibility of two players playing on the same team is not contemplated. However, in this mode you can only choose your own teams (up to 4), the other teams will be chosen by the computer.In conclusion In conclusion, the game is really fun, very arcadey but still realistic enough (not from a football point of view, but only from a physical point of view) from the point of view of the movements, even if they result in footballing inconceivable tackles and missile shots. Alone is a game that gets tired after a while. At first it is exciting, but then it gets boring, as real strategies cannot be implemented and therefore it becomes monotonous. The ideal is multiplayer (not xbox live, but the classic console multiplayer) where the game really gives its best. So let's repeat the introduction, not suitable for those who want a football simulation, but ideal for those looking for a game that is different from the usual and really fun with friends.PROS: Plenty of special moves No referee severity Hilarious hidden teams Pleasant graphics Ideal in multiplayer CONS: Lack of strategy Monotonous in the long run in single player Only 1 vs 1 Materials: Cheats Introduction First of all, let's specify an essential aspect of the game: what is it? It's not a soccer simulation! Anyone who wants to play a ~football game~ shouldn't buy this game. Here is a soccer game, a fighting game and lots of fun. Let's start with the signature. After the due titles of the software houses there is an overview of a stadium, two teams playing (one of the two is probably England). After various fouls, shots, passes, the goal is reached. You immediately move on to another stadium where another game is being played. Here too you can see the characteristics of the game, that is, endless fouls, karate blows, impossible shots and improbable shots with trails of fire burning the grass. Also in this case, the overhead kick arrives and ends the game. Last change of stage, much more important than the previous two. The two winning teams of the probable previous ~semi-finals~ enter the field, i.e. England and another team (perhaps France???). The referee places the ball in the center and  go, Beckam leaps forward and the opposing captain does the same. At the moment of physical confrontation, the title of the game appears: ~Red Card Soccer~.", "date": "2002-08-20", "grade": null}
