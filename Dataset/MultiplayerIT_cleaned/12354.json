{"name": "Ford Street Racing L.A. Duel - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ford-street-racing-la-duel-recensione.html", "text": "Drunk driving So far, everything seems to be fine. And instead, unfortunately, once you get on the track to compete, the sad reality comes out, and FSR shows all the most negative aspects of the game, starting with an imperfect gameplay. In fact, once the race has begun, the car's controls are imprecise and it often becomes difficult to keep on the road consistently more due to these than to errors in the driving phase due to poor practice or to the ~pressure~ exerted by the opponents on the car. The latter in turn have a ridiculous AI, to the point that they often seem drunk and blind as they pounce on you for no apparent reason, as if they didn't see you. When they notice the presence of the gamer, the pilots managed by the CPU begin to take him at the counter. Not bad, ~we reciprocate them~ you say. And instead no. Ironically, while the blows of your opponents have a certain harmful effect on your car, those inflicted against them do not, and indeed sometimes they end up damaging the car you are driving even more. In a similar context, where in fact the only wise thing left for the player to do is to try to stay on track with the bodywork semi-intact, it becomes almost impossible to plan any strategy or try to exploit one's ability to the fullest. steering wheel. Luckily, at least visually the game is saved. From a graphic point of view, Ford Racing stands out positively for a good general detail, evident in the construction of the tracks, the surrounding landscapes, and the vehicles. The latter are well cared for, similar to their real counterparts and easily identifiable, at least for fans, from model to model. It should be noted that the damage suffered for cars is present in the game, which is why visually, even if not too realistically, you will be able to see your vehicle reduced to a wreck full of dents if you crash into opponents or parts of the track. The speech is different as regards the sound: apart from the roar of the engines which is discretely differentiated in relation to the various vehicle classes, the rest appears rather repetitive, from the general effects down. We can't say anything positive about the soundtrack: in fact it doesn't exist. Music is only present in the menus. The collector... In ~Challenges~, however, the types of competitions can be of various types, with different things to do and objectives to achieve. For example, it may happen that you try your hand at races called ~Overtaking~, in which the main aim is to overtake a certain number of cars to win the race, or ~Elimination~, where you have to avoid finishing a lap in the last two positions, given that at the end of each of them whoever is last or penultimate is eliminated. And so on. It should be noted that this mode can be played in two different ways, i.e. alone or as a member of a team. In this case, the player controls two cars during the race, with the aim of placing them both in the best positions. To switch from one car to another, just switch by pressing the appropriate key (the CPU manages the other car). In ~Career~ mode there are a total of twenty-four unlockable cars, divided into three main categories: Classic, Sports and High Performance. As the term suggests, the first category includes vintage cars from the American car manufacturer (variable production year from 1962 to 1971), the second category includes relatively more recent cars, such as the 2002 Focus RS or the 2005 Mustang GT, while in the last category you can choose prototypes of Ford cars, characterized by fairly high parameters which are then felt, within the limits of the allowed (later we'll see why  Ed) on the road. The other available modes are ~Quick Race~, which, as the title suggests, allows the user to immediately try their hand at the track without paying too much attention to options and the like, ~Arcade~, about which there is little to say, and ~Multiplayer~: the latter is none other than the same ~Arcade~ mode extended to a local connection only. In fact, you can create or host a game and you can choose whether to face the race alone or in a team, exactly as in the mode just mentioned. Conclusions Other than improved porting... Ford Street Racing L.A. Duel is the exact photocopy of the other console and PC versions. If aesthetically the game settles on discrete levels, the same thing cannot be said from the point of view of playability, a key element of every video game, where we really are not there: the title does not differ much from the mediocrity it has up to to now characterized the saga. Too bad, because some ideas, such as double driving in the race, weren't bad. Withrecommended only to Ford fans and to those looking for just a few hours of fun without excessive pretensions. Pros: Good graphics. Some interesting ideas. Fair number of cars available. Cons: Gameplay to review. Poor longevity. Boring. The Ford Street Racing series has never enjoyed much acclaim among the huge audience of driving game enthusiasts. In fact, to be honest he probably didn't have any in general. Due to a not excellent playability and a certain overall monotony, the Razorworks saga has negatively ~distinguished~ itself over the last few years both on PC, Ps2 and Xbox. Now, as mentioned in the introductory hat, the team in question tries again this time on PSP with what can easily be defined as a porting of the almost homonymous Ford Street Racing released some time ago on other platforms, but, according to its creators, with news that in terms of gameplay should have improved the product. The game begins with the classic request to create your own personal driver profile and save. Immediately afterwards you are projected into the main menu which offers the four modes offered by the title, among which the most important is certainly the one called ~Career~. The purpose of this mode is to challenge dozens of opponents on various tracks (in the game there are a total of eighteen plus their respective inverse counterparts) in fourteen events scattered throughout the streets of the city of Los Angeles, each of which will contain within it a ~Competition~ and two ~Challenges~, to become, victory after victory, the best driver and car collector in the city. The ~Competition~ is structured in three rounds, at the end of each of which a score is awarded to the driver managed by the video gamer according to the position obtained in the race. Upon completion of the set of challenges, a definitive ranking is drawn up on the basis of which a certain number of credits can be obtained for the purchase of new cars in the showroom, in relation to the position reached.", "date": "2007-04-16", "grade": null}
