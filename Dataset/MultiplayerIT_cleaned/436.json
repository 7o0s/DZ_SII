{"name": "Railroad Ink Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/railroad-ink-challenge-recensione.html", "text": "The trend of board games transposed into digital version has been taking hold for several years now: Carcassone, Ticket to Ride, Sagrada and Wingspan are just a few of the many and to these we add Railroad Ink Challenge, created by Hjalmar Hach and Lorenzo Silva for Horrible Guild and distributed in Italy in tabletop version by Ghenos Games under the name Le Strade d'Inchiostro. We're talking about a roll and write game for one to six players aged 8 and up, where the aim of the game is to draw a system of roads and railways on your board using the solutions offered by the data faces. A light and very pleasant title that in the PC version does not look bad in the face of its table version: we talk about it in our review of Railroad Ink Challenge. Game rules The game menu In Railroad Ink Challenge the game action takes place on a board divided into seven rows by as many columns and three exits are arranged on each side of the square: roads and railways. The aim of the game, as we said, is to build your own transport network using the different types of roads and railways shown on the dice; the connections must be made consecutively, it is therefore not possible to place a road or tracks at a random point on the map, and it is not possible to connect roads and tracks together. In fact, to do this, a station is needed. Graphically, the tracks are represented with a straight line intersected by a dotted line while the roads with two continuous parallel lines and a dotted line in the middle, to simulate the traffic divider; the stations are black squares. Round 1 of the game The game consists of seven rounds in each of which four virtual dice will be rolled, the sides of which will represent the solutions to be used in that round: all sections of road and tracks must be placed, with the possibility of adding a special fifth, but only three times per game: in fact, in each match the player is granted six special pieces that can be used during the rounds to create numerous intersections. The player's goal is therefore to win the most points by adding up each connected exit, the longest road, the longest railway and each occupied square among the central nine that guarantee extra points. This result must be subtracted as many points as there are unfinished roads. Villages, universities and industries The sum of the score at the end of the game This is the basic functioning of both the board and digital game, to which are added interesting news regarding the latter. First of all we will be asked which mode to play in, whether in My Challenge or Score Attack: the first is entirely dedicated to challenges, i.e. tasks that the game will ask us to fulfill within a maximum number of rounds and which we can always see in the menu at the top on the left above the game board. Before starting the game, we will have the possibility to customize it by choosing which challenges we want to face: a minimum of three, all or three random. Score Attack is instead focused exclusively on scoring. There are currently four different editions of Le Strade d'Inchiostro on the market; the blue that adds the expansion of rivers and lakes, the red with lava and meteors (these two available in Italy), the green with mountains and forests and the yellow with deserts and canyons, plus seven other mini expansion packs. These expansions, some expected to arrive also for the digital version, add extra rules, just like the videogame counterpart does. the active University and Industry skill on the board Because even Railroad Ink Challenge on PC and mobile integrates a new game mechanic, represented by buildings: villages, universities and industries. When a stretch of road or railway is placed on one of these three special squares, the construction bonus is activated. If occupied by a station, villages provide two extra points, while by occupying an industry space one can immediately clone one of the four sides of the dice available for that round, thus having five available. The university bonus, on the other hand, is triggered after having occupied three university squares and allows the player, in the turn in which the third space is occupied, to use a special piece, which however will not be counted among the three available by default. Game feedback The Lush Green Edition Compared to Similo and Pozioni Explosive, two games also by Horrible Guild released first in a tabletop and then digital version, Railroad Ink Challenge aroused some perplexity in the writer. The beauty of Le Strade d'Inchiostro, in our opinion, is the platform on which you can draw with a felt-tip pen: no tokens, no cartand, just a felt tip on a smooth surface, to the delight of all graphomaniacs, which also gives the game its name. Removing the ~ink variable~, the experience seemed potentially very partial to us but we strongly had to change our mind because, in its simplicity, Railroad Ink Challenge works very well even in the digital version. We greatly appreciated the clean and minimal game interface which however does not betray the graphic style already used for the board game. The splendid illustrations by Marta Tranquilli come to life with pleasant and essential animations, accompanied by a relaxing musical carpet. The animation of the dice roll The game's feedback is extremely satisfying, especially thanks to the sound effects - the placement of roads and railways and the noise they subsequently make once they are built at the end of the turn are really nice and help compensate for the lack of graphical and tactile element of the game . Obviously the biggest gain of the PC transposition is the automatic counting of points, a game phase that you either love or hate: count every single box, subtract points, add bonus points... played from the app you won't have this nuisance (if the perceived as such) and you will have the certainty of a democratic count and without the usual magic that happens around the table! Also appreciated was the choice to use asynchronous multiplayer instead of real-time challenges with other players; after all, it is true that Le Strade d'Inchiostro can be played simultaneously by up to six players but it is equally true that we are talking about a ~collective solitaire~, i.e. a title where everyone plays their game and then compares the score with the other participants at the table. In this sense, the idea of putting a score ranking and weekly and monthly challenges to encourage players to try their hand at personal challenges and against others is excellent.", "date": "2021-06-17", "grade": "8.0"}
