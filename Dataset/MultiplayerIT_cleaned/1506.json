{"name": "Voodoo Vince", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/voodoo-vince_a.html", "text": "Stop that doll! As in the old platformers, even in Voodoo Vince it is possible to obtain bonuses, for example, by collecting one hundred bottles, your energy bar will increase by one level. In addition to the ~energy booster flasks~, you can find various items, including extra lives (represented by hearts) and voodoo spells. You got it right, voodoo spells. Following the story line you will be given several, but by exploring the levels thoroughly you will come to find new ones. Your enemies, despite having intentions that are anything but friendly, when they die under your incessant blows, they will leave you objects in the form of a sphere. These precious gifts are extremely useful, as they will fill both the life energy bar and the magic energy bar. Well yes, in order to use Vince's voodoo powers it is necessary that the magic bar is full, and at that point it will be possible to unleash all the magical power of the evil doll. Seeing voodoo evocations is hilarious and even if the effectiveness is the same, each spell differs from another in the animation with which it is evoked. Let's move on from the basic spell that sees Vince pierced by needles, to real skits depicting the doll overwhelmed by an enormous weight, devoured by a shark, drilled on the head and many others really crazy. Laughter is guaranteed. Adventure and platforms What makes Voodoo Vince a platformer different from the others is the fact that in some cases you will be faced with real puzzles. Obviously not difficult, but which in any case will make you think a lot about the type of game to which this title belongs. Just to give a small example, in a level you'll have to move time back and forth to be able to do some things that, of course, I won't be here to reveal. As you look at the different elements of the stage, you'll need to figure out when and how much to move the tempo forward or backward. Although the levels are decidedly large, it will hardly happen to get lost inside, since there will always be a main road to go, a road that will take you to your destination in any case. A pleasant aspect of this game is the freedom of action, no fight against time, we can stroll carefree through the level without anyone running after us. Scattered around the level you will find small train stations, useful in case you want to momentarily interrupt the main story to return to previous levels to retrieve bonus items. Overall the game is not difficult, the only note that must be made is that, in some platform sections, the platforms on which you will have to jump are extremely small and difficult to reach. If we add that Vince, due to his cloth conformation, dies on first contact with water, all this makes jumping operations slightly frustrating. It would have been better if Vince, in contact with the water, had gradually lost energy, this would have given him the opportunity to get to safety and not have to start the whole operation all over again. As mentioned at the beginning of the review, the bosses are too easy to defeat, it is enough to repeat the same operation three times to see your enemy succumb. Voodoo Vince is completely in English, including dialogues and subtitles, since Italian is unfortunately missing. If on the one hand this choice helps to maintain the atmosphere and spirit of the jokes, on the other it prevents the complete understanding of the dialogues which, although easy, could put those who are not too familiar with the British language in difficulty. Technical realization Xbox is a console that has now made it clear what it's made of from a graphic point of view. Voodoo Vince, graphics-wise, is a little gem. The graphics engine handles the vast levels without problems, the frame rate is very stable and does not present the slightest uncertainty. The polygonal models of the characters are made very well, detailed down to the smallest detail. Vince's, especially, is pretty awesome. Thanks to the Nvidia GPU, the developers were able to recreate a rough effect on Vince's ~skin~, making everything decidedly realistic and pleasant. The colors are bright and bright, in some levels that require it, however, they turn dark and shaded to recreate the right atmosphere. The animations are made with extreme care, Vince's gait is very nice, this is due to his little legs, which make himI'm downright funny. The textures are overall very good, as just mentioned, more attention has been paid to the creation of those of the characters, but the surrounding environments also have respectable surfaces. Technical realization The camera performs its duty admirably in almost all situations, always ready as it is to follow Vince. The only problems arise if you get too close to a wall, at this moment the view presents some difficulties, framing your stuffed friend from the front. Nothing serious however, given that thanks to the right stick you can move the shot at your leisure. The feeling with the controls is excellent from the very first games and the Xbox pad seems created especially for playing Voodoo Vince. The front keys will be useful for carrying out the primary actions, with the ~A~ it is possible to jump, with the ~X~ Vince will feel Rocky Balboa, since thanks to this key he is able to throw punches, while with ~B  will perform a deadly spin capable of hitting enemies at 360 . To summon your voodoo powers, you will need to jump and pull both rear triggers simultaneously. Voodoo Vince is able to give you several hours of gameplay. In case you play it to finish it, so without finding all the bonuses and all the spells, you will reach the end in less than ten hours. In case you want to finish it 100%, get ready to play a lot more, as the game really offers you a lot of extras to unlock. The soundtrack that accompanies Voodoo Vince is one of the most apt aspects of the game, the tunes that will keep you company during the levels are very catchy and pleasant to listen to. The melodies adapt perfectly to the situation in which you find yourself, ranging from rhythmic motifs to calmer and more harmonious melodies, which succeed perfectly in lowering the player into the atmosphere of the game. As if that weren't enough, the sounds and noises of the environments in which the levels take place are superbly realized, everything has been recreated in minute detail. Really great job. Technical realization Comment Voodoo Vince marks the return of Microsoft in the world of platform adventures. This game, presented at the last E3, satisfies all aspects, entertaining and exciting the player. Full of humor and fun, Voodoo Vince brings a breath of fresh air to the Xbox gaming scene, thanks to the excellent graphics and the perfectly fitting gameplay that this title has. The purchase is recommended for those who want to have fun with a cheerful and carefree title, Voodoo Vince will entertain you like few other games have done. The only negative note is the lack of the Italian language, an obstacle that could intimidate those who do not know English. Pros: Fun and exciting Graphically excellent Cons: Game completely in English End-of-level bosses too easy to defeat Stop that doll! Voodoo Vince is one of those games that, once you try it, stay in your head for a long time. Presented at the last E3, this Microsoft title enters the market with the intention of making us forget the half misstep of Blinx, which did not enjoy the success expected. The protagonist of this bizarre platform is Vince, a tender voodoo doll who awakens thanks to a spell cast by his mistress, Madam Charmaine, who unfortunately is kidnapped by shady guys commanded by the sorcerer Kosmo. As you can well guess, your main purpose will be to find your poor ~mother~. One of the most interesting and innovative aspects of Voodoo Vince is, of course, that of being able to use the voodoo powers of the protagonist and hurl them against one's enemies. All this adds to the very high level of irony and light-heartedness present in the game, which make this experience truly fun and enjoyable. Our little doll will have to face several levels before finding her creator, decidedly large and well-made levels and set in a New Orleans inhabited by very special creatures. The game structure is extremely simple and immediate, as previously mentioned, it is possible to neutralize enemies thanks to voodoo powers, but our Vince is also able to fight with his bare hands. The enemies present in Voodoo Vince are nice and combative at the same time, and differ in shape and behavior depending on the level in which you are, for example, in city levels, there are many flying enemies, while in natural environments such as meadows and swamps, we will find ourselves faced with giant moles that emerge from the ground. As if to wink at the old giochi, at the end of certain levels you will find yourself faced with a boss to face, but if you think that these will be ferocious and ruthless you are wrong, as even the monsters at the end of the level are decidedly funny. However, it is fair to point out that, at times, they are too simple to defeat.", "date": "2003-11-04", "grade": null}
