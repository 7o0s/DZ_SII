After all, the elements to arouse curiosity are all there: a simple but successful trailer, especially skilful in comparing this game to a sacred monster of point-and-click adventures like The Dig, interesting retro graphics that bring it even closer to the title LucasArts, and the provenance from the independent market, which has by now become a forge of ideas of all kinds capable of giving birth to real gems, sometimes even small, but still precious. If we also add to all this that to start the download of Stranded it is necessary to face the cost of what is practically the same amount as a beer in the pub or restaurant, the game is done: taken by curiosity, we made the purchase of Stranded from the Humble Store and we launched into this title, to see what its developer has achieved together with the rest of the (few) insiders involved. Adventure? Graphic Novels? Video game short? Here's what we think of the curious Stranded! Life or death The protagonist of Stranded is an astronaut, although it would be more correct to say the protagonist. Although he never shows his face throughout the course of the adventure, the human being we find ourselves driving is in fact presented as a female entity, who crashed her ship on an unknown planet, where she is therefore forced to stay after having awakened from a cryogenic sleep. Of course, the woman doesn't have the slightest idea of what might have happened, and she will soon realize that due to the conditions of her spacecraft there is no possibility of restarting, but above all that the oxygen reserve that can keep her alive is now tragically winding down: at this point the player takes over, committed to finding a way to survive in a completely unknown place. The strange alien beings that populate the planet seem to suggest something, without offering particular indications: it will be up to the woman to be able to find a way towards her own salvation. If in terms of setting we can certainly be there, in terms of gameplay the comparison with graphic adventures seems quite risky: in fact, there are no dialogues, nor any other form of interaction, either with the other ~characters~ , both with the surrounding environment. The entire Stranded experience can be summed up in the exploratory phases through the various environments that make up the game, with the only possibility of resorting to a minimap as an aid, in case you need a guide. Something quite difficult actually, given that - if we want to make a comparison with the world of cinema - Stranded could fit perfectly into the category of short films: just like the purchase cost, the duration of this game is in fact comparable to that of a beer in a pub, with which it also shares the need to be savored slowly. The player can obviously decide to finish everything in one quick sip, but in this case he ends up losing all the flavor put as a side dish by the team of Peter Moorhead, the person who conceived Stranded. 16-bit aliens Continuing on the same path as the cinematographic comparison made a little while ago, we can say that like many short films, Stranded is also beautiful to see. The graphic style of this title is naturally inspired by that of the golden age graphic adventures, through which the game represents its settings between open and closed places, also playing with effects linked to the particular diurnal or nocturnal phase of the day that is the backdrop to this adventure. Although in the end there are few settings, what amazes about Stranded is above all the ability to be able to define a decidedly convincing general setting, also thanks to a soundtrack that perfectly manages to paint the double meaning to which the film is subjected 'protagonist astronaut: strangeness, in finding himself in a completely unknown world without knowing what happened, and urgently, in having to find a way to survive at all costs. The ending was acceptable, even if perhaps better could have been done to grant the player a reward that was at least a little more substantial: but, as you will have understood, this is Stranded, so take it or leave it.", "date": "2014-04-09", "grade": "7.0"}
