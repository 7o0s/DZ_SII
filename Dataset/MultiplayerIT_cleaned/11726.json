{"name": "Sonic Rivals 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-rivals-2-recensione.html", "text": "After numerous successful video games and some less important parentheses, Sonic has been relaunched on all platforms with a series of more or less valid titles, even in the portable field: on Nintendo DS we have been able to see a reinterpretation of the classic mechanics of the series with Sonic Rush and a ~deepening~ of the same with Sonic Rush Adventure, while on PSP we can try our hand at Sonic Rivals, which has just reached its second episode with a great desire to improve. The game is based on a precise idea: each level must be faced in competition with an opponent, and to move on to the next location we will necessarily have to cross the finish line first or in any case beat the rival in any of the stipulations provided. Full speed The start screen of Sonic Rivals 2 gives us the possibility to access the single player or multiplayer modes (for two players), as well as check the game completion statistics with the various characters, and finally take a look at the many collectible cards that we have earned and that to be unlocked require the achievement of certain objectives. The single player contains an obvious story mode, but also the revival of single events, unpublished cups (to be unlocked by completing the game several times) and a free mode in which we can explore the stages without necessarily having to run, collecting rings and Chao (which have nothing to do with the famous Chaos Emeralds, as they are strange little animals...). In fact, the free mode is very close to the spirit of the ~classic~ Sonic, in which there are certain sections where you go very fast but also several moments dedicated to exploration and fighting enemies. Facing the story, in fact, we will be faced with something completely different: choosing a couple among those available (Sonic and Tails, Shadow and Metal Sonic, Knuckles and Rouge or Silver and Espio), we will have to face a continuous challenge from level to level to proceed to each of the stages that make up the six settings. In some cases we will be assigned ~ex officio~ one of the characters of the team, in other occasions we will be the ones to choose one or the other (with consequences on the completion of the story for each one), but in principle the structure will be the same, with a mad race to see who arrives first despite the pitfalls of the track. Obstacle course In fact, the track is our main opponent in the game, not the character we have to defeat from time to time. Since the final speed of the various Sonics, Tails etc. is identical, the developers of Sonic Rivals 2 had to come up with ways for one to distance the other, and therefore they made the locations a real mine of crossroads, multi-level paths, traps and mechanisms to be activated to continue . So being able to win a race at the first attempt becomes really difficult, because you don't know what you're getting into and you have to count only on luck to catch a shortcut instead of an abyss. This element makes itself felt more and more as you progress, until it becomes a predominant factor, which determines the outcome of each race to the detriment of fun. The lowest point, however, is reached in the alternative sections, in this case when we have to KO our opponent a certain number of times by hitting him (Circle button) while he has no rings, and during the boss fights. In the first case, the game is reduced to a simple test of reflexes: just press the button at the right moment to win a round, trying to come to terms with truly disastrous locations as they were conceived. The clash with the bosses is another emblematic case, because competition is in force there too and therefore the one who first manages to deal a certain number of blows to the monster on duty wins; but our rival will hinder us in an absurd way, making it really frustrating. Technical realization Everything can be said about this sequel to Sonic Rivals, except that it is not colored. The bright colors are the masters, in fact, with chromatic choices that characterize the various stages, always bright and cheerful. The game always runs at a locked 30fps, with little glitch, and the characters are well drawn. The speeds that are sometimes reached are truly monstrous and the scenario does not ~disassemble~ even on such occasions, revealing a really solid and well-programmed graphics engine. It's a shame that the level design is sometimes disastrous, with a number of really poorly thought-out 'architectural barriers', producing episodes of great frustration. The sound sector is average for Sonic titles: usual certainly not unforgettable electronic music, accompanied by average effects and a moderateto the amount of speech. The structure of the game is in 2D and the control system always proves to be up to the situation, thanks moreover to a truly immediate setting: the d-pad or the analog stick to move the character and the main buttons to jump, use a weapon, activate a special power or strike the opponent. Sonic boom! In Sonic Rivals 2 we will not simply have to run fast and catch the right path to beat our opponent on duty, but we will also be able to help ourselves with a series of objects that are collected in the stages and which can hinder the antagonist in several ways. To this possibility is added a special power, different for each character, which can be activated after collecting a certain number of rings: for Sonic it is an ultra-fast sprint, for Tails the ability to fly, etc. Comment Sonic Rivals is probably the ~weakest~ series in which Sonic is the protagonist, unfortunately, and it is not for a series of secondary elements, but precisely for the basic idea, which perhaps on paper could have seemed valid but which in practice does not it works properly. The developers have done everything possible to make this sequel worthwhile, inserting a ~rewards~ structure that gives away new cards and new modes as you complete the game with all eight characters, and doing a great job from a technical point of view . But the level design has not been managed with all the trappings: the chasms that have so far distinguished the Sonic games have almost completely disappeared, but only to make way for a long series of obstacles that make the experience often frustrating and which in some phases are really unbearable. Sonic Rivals 2 boasts some substance and certainly could appeal to fans of the blue hedgehog, but it is far from being a product of great quality from the point of view of pure and simple fun. Pros: Fast and very colorful graphics ~Reward~ structure, with many extras Potentially long-lived Cons: Questionable choices for level design Often frustrating Collisions not always perfect", "date": "2007-12-17", "grade": null}
