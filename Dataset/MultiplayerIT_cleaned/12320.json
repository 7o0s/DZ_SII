{"name": "Ultimate Street Football", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-street-football.html", "text": "It is evident that Ultimate Street Football takes inspiration from that Fifa Street of Electronic Arts which has had good success on consoles. Despite the lack of originality, fortunately, very few criticisms can be raised against Gameloft production. The theme is therefore that of road matches, without rules and referees; the only thing to do is try to throw the ball into the back of the net, without worrying about throw-ins, fouls, penalties or offsides. It is therefore easy to understand how the pace that characterizes Ultimate Street Football is decidedly high, without interruptions of any kind; once the game starts, everything is allowed until time runs out. The programmers therefore had to create a product that was decidedly distant from, for example, that best-selling Real Football which, on the contrary, provided a ~classic~ interpretation of football. In this case the watchword is not tactics and strategy, but above all spectacularity. And so here is that by pressing the asterisk key it is possible to perform a large series of ~tricks~, or rather evolutions and moves to disorient the opponent and exalt the spectators; the function is also another, however, since making these tricks allows you to fill a special bar, with which to then perform (using the hash key) super-shots a bit ~holly and benji~ with lots of effects special accessories. Too bad only for an artificial intelligence that is anything but refined, but given the philosophy of the product, it is a defect that can be forgiven. The game modes, in addition to offering classic single games for their own sake, also allow you to follow a real career; in fact, it is possible to create your own team, choose the colors and the flag, and create the players thanks to a limited editor with which to modify a couple of somatic traits and 4 technical characteristics, to then improve game after game. There is also a mode called challenge, in which you find yourself doing tricks against an opponent by pressing the keys that appear on the screen at the right time. An interesting idea but which in reality becomes marginal to say the least given the limited number of evolutions and levels available, allowing it to be completed in about ten minutes. From a graphic point of view, Ultima Street Football is a really pleasant product, with an excellent level of detail and well-finished and rather numerous animations; the 8 available courts also offer enough variety of settings in which to bring your matches to life. The sound is appreciable, while we want to continue putting our finger on the completely absent multiplayer problem, which would certainly have raised the overall value of the game. PRO Really fun Good graphics AGAINST Poor artificial intelligence Total absence of multiplayer", "date": "2007-05-01", "grade": "S.V."}
