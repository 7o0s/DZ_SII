The plot of Ratchet & Clank 3 is built on the typical foundations of the previous episodes. We have a planet to save, Veldin, and a tyrant to defeat, Nefarious. The rest is all an excuse to amuse the player with amusing gags, decidedly bizarre dialogues and a plethora of hilarious characters like few others. In addition to our protagonists, we will find many old acquaintances, such as the absurd Captain Qwark, mixed with absolutely noteworthy new recruits. The desire to make fun of Insomniac Games seems to have it in their blood, and they do nothing to hide it. The result is a set of jokes and interludes worthy of a film by the famous Mel Brooks to obscure the basic banality of a monotonous plot.

The result is a set of jokes and interludes worthy of a film by the famous Mel Brooks to obscure the basic banality of a monotonous plot. My name is Clank, or rather Ratchet...or rather...I have a headache... The game structure jolts the wacky duo from one planet to another with missions that are always quite varied, which combine multiple genres in order to give the player continuous stimuli. A mixture of platform, action and shooter sessions is not found every day in a video game, especially if mixed with the wealth and experience of the softco located in Burbank. We will leave every time on board our interstellar boat, and then project ourselves to the desired destination being able to choose between those already visited and those still unexplored. In this sense, backtracking is very useful for purely economic purposes, as each completed mission will give the player further tests to pass, which will be, as well as profitable, also exciting and satisfying. The money is mostly used to access new weapons and armor, which have their own specific weight for the success of the game. Using one weapon over another could really make a difference in the world of Veldin, so it is almost essential to have the necessary finances to purchase equipment. The level design adapts quite well to the styles of play present in Ratchet & Clank 3, ranging with a certain ease from the rather large environments typical of shooters to the more classic platforms on which to bob happily. In addition to this harmonious symphony dedicated to vivacity, some assorted goodies are added. During the adventure, for example, we will find the various chapters of a video game entirely dedicated to Qwark, a sort of well-finished and fun two-dimensional platform / shooter with which to amuse ourselves between one mission and another. Finally the most substantial novelty: the long-awaited multiplayer with which to massacre both off and online in a kind of capture the flag very suitable for FPS. There are! My name is Ratchet, or rather Clankor rathercan someone please call me a doctor? Ratchet is a being very similar to a feline, which moves like a feline. Its agility in performing all sorts of evolutions certainly facilitates the task of saving a galaxy, but as we all know it alone cannot be enough. The control system implemented by Insomniac Games works well, however complex it may seem at first. Like a chameleon, it blends with every style of play present with a certain ease, presenting effective solutions for every situation. The weapon selection interface could have just been improved to make it less cumbersome, perhaps by allocating the D-Pad to equipment rather than relegating it to the uselessness of controlling the character, logically used for the more performing analog stick. Unfortunately, the real problems occur in the most chaotic situations, with a lock on present only for certain weapons and, in this case, not always reliable. Furthermore, the lack of a key used for 180-degree rotation on the axis is felt on more than one occasion. The fights, as well as the various evolutions in the baggage of the protagonist, are still pleasant to carry out and on rare occasions frustrating. Ratchet is able to run and jump sideways just like in more traditional shooters, or move with all the freedom of the case to explore the game environments. The double jump also interposes the possibility of making a much longer one, logically assisted by the propellers of the good Clank. A targeted use of the potential of the furry-eared hero will be more necessary than ever to pass the many obstacles placed in the game. The biggest obstacle, however, is in all respects a rather convoluted and imprecise framing system. In normal situations the roomit works well, following the character's path without having to be adjusted, only to then ostracize itself into a pile of rather unnerving inaccuracies in combat situations. A swing, in short, which if on one side flies towards the stars, on the other sinks into the underworld. The work done by the coders on the graphics engine is instead of an incredible delicacy. The polygonal settings, as well as the models of the numerous enemies that appear on the screen, are well built and equally well designed. All while moving with a fluidity that in rare cases displays the white flag. Good animations and textures in general, equally effective is the choice of colors. Note of merit for the dubbing entirely in our language, which almost overshadows a soundtrack always in keeping with the situations and in some cases decidedly driving. The weapon selection interface could have just been improved to make it less cumbersome, perhaps by allocating the D-Pad to equipment rather than relegating it to the uselessness of controlling the character, logically used for the more performing analog stick. Ratchet & Clank 3 can easily be considered the best exponent of the series. It is an immense and long-lived game, varied in situations and styles of play. In addition to the abundant 20 hours of main game, it manages to offer mini-games and an excellent multiplayer section also online with three other players, which allows the vote to be increased by half a point for those who can enjoy this particular mode. Unfortunately he stumbles over some trunk located in his path, but the goodness of the Insomniac Games product is indisputable. Those who enjoyed the previous chapters of the saga will also fall in love with this third parenthesis dedicated to the ephemeral and eccentric space world of Ratchet & Clank; those who have never digested the series will hardly start to do so with this third chapter. Pros: Varied and long-lived. Plot full of clichs, but funny as few. Off and online multiplayer mode very fun. Good control system Cons: although still to be perfected. Room sometimes inadequate. It will not appeal to those who have never enjoyed the series. The porcelain pig. It's this ominous pun that puts any player on the ropes like a boxer in the throes. Similar to a tax that cannot be exempted from, sooner or later the time comes to pay a bill, to get all the knots to comb out and to reap the fruits of one's sowing. This commonplace festival is indicated precisely at this time of the year, where in just one month all the majors in the videogame scene fire the biggest shots in an attempt to grab as many buyers as possible. Once the circle is reunited, we return to the starting point: that little porcelain pig that feeds only on rustling paper and sturdy money. A bit like the story of the ant and the grasshopper, another heavy clich, those who have saved their money will now be able to gorge themselves in this thriving November context, vice versa, those who have never cared about saving will have to deal with a fasting ever so inconvenient. It's a wonderful time for the industry and consequently for us users, who will have to carefully weigh every single choice. In this overflowing scenario, a certain Ratchet & Clank 3 appears, who quietly builds on past experiences to fight against authentic giants of playful entertainment. All the best cards available to Insomniac Games will be needed to attempt the feat, cards that, apparently, seem to have been thrown on the game table", "date": "2004-11-26", "grade": null}
