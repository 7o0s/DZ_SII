So let's find out what these new features are and see if they can convince even those who had already played the title in its original versions to retrace their steps. Play but don't touch Let's immediately clear the field of any doubts (or rather, hopes): Bayonetta on Wii U has not been enriched with new levels, revealing itself from this point of view exactly identical to the 2009 original of which you can read our review here. Even from a purely visual point of view, things have remained fundamentally the same, for a product that - fortunately - takes its cue from the Xbox 360 version, inheriting its 60 frames per second and leaving only a faded memory of the flaws of the unfortunate PlayStation 3 edition. Instead, what changes is the control system, and not only due to the different conformation of the GamePad compared to the peripherals of the other consoles: in fact, here there is both a classic configuration, which uses the normal controller keys, and a mode that allows you to play using only the touch screen. By choosing this option, the protagonist moves by swiping on the display, while the quick attack is carried out with quick taps and the heavy one by pressing on the circle that appears around the hooked target. However, a few minutes of testing with this type of control are enough to understand that it is a fundamentally impracticable model if you want to play seriously: beyond the imprecision of the inputs compared to the physical keys, the touch screen system proves to be extremely unsuitable to manage the most complex moves, ultimately proving to be really out of place for a fast and technical title like Bayonetta. In short, as much as we can appreciate the commitment of Platinum Games, this aspect appears more like a rather clumsy attempt to exploit the characteristics of the GamePad, also because it is not accompanied by other concrete initiatives: the controller screen is therefore only used to reproduce the game action instead of acting as a complement to it, and even those situations in which the gyroscope of the peripheral could have been exploited (one above all the Angel Attack target shooting minigame) were not captured by the developers, evidently not too sure of GamePad performance with your product's gameplay. On the news front, it must be said that at any time it is possible to press the icon dedicated to Miiverse at the top right of the touch screen to share game progress with friends in real time, but this is certainly not a feature capable of revolutionize the gaming experience with Bayonetta. Time passes but the charm of Bayonetta remains unchanged in this new version for Wii U Bayonetta the cosplayer Even if the game is the same as it was five years ago and although the GamePad has not been exploited in a particularly intensive way, Bayonetta on Wii U still presents an element capable of making both novices of the series happy and above all those who already had got to complete the first chapter. Indeed, to tell the truth, the reasons for jubilation of Nintendo users can be even four, such as the alternative costumes for the protagonist that are available from the beginning of the game: before each mission it is therefore possible to access a special menu from which to select the desired outfit, each inspired by a historical character of the big N and bringing some pleasant - and sometimes even bizarre - changes to the on-screen action. Let's start with the Princess Peach costume that we had already noticed in the GamesCom demo in Cologne: in addition to making Bayonetta much pinker, this dress changes the graphic element that accompanies the most powerful blows, replacing the protagonist's hair bundles with gigantic Bowser's paws. Again, the halos released by defeated enemies are replaced by the classic coins of the Super Mario franchise, complete with the characteristic sound effect when collected. Then there is the Link costume, complete with green tunic, sword and shield, with the latter two that can be actively exploited in combat: also in this case there are some modificationsthan to the scenario, with rupees instead of halos and sounds taken directly from A Link to the Past, with for example the classic Zelda theme that accompanies the moment in which Bayonetta opens a chest. The third is the Samus costume, which follows the design of the armor of the first Metroid, and whose visor can be raised or lowered at any time by holding down the down key on the directional cross: in addition, equipping it allows you to use the 'iconic cannon mounted on the suit's arm instead of the protagonist's conventional pistols. The roundup is closed by the Princess Daisy costume, different from Peach's only for a purely aesthetic connotation. In short, as is evident, we are not talking about elements capable of upsetting the gaming experience, but it is still very pleased to note that a ~simple~ port has been the subject of this kind of attention from the development team.", "date": "2014-09-19", "grade": "9.5"}
