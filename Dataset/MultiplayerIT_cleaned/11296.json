{"name": "Guitar Hero 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-hero-3_a.html", "text": "Have you always dreamed of being able to perform on stage, in front of a huge crowd, with the guitar playing phrases and suns to no end? Well, the Guitar Hero series tries to fulfill just that wish. Armed with a decidedly out of the ordinary controller, you will in fact have to accompany a lineup made up of old and new songs with the notes, covering the role of lead guitarist. An extremely simple mechanics: the neck of the instrument is represented on the screen, with the notes of the song flowing and which must be ~played~ at the right time, i.e. when they are within reach of the plectrum. A mix of rhythm (above all) and dexterity, which in the mobile sector has already inspired the work of a prolific software house like Gameloft for Guitar Legend: Get on Stage!, with discrete results. Armed with the official Guitar Hero 3 license in hand, will the developers of Hands-On Mobile be able to do better? From the game's start screen, we can choose whether to try our hand at a quick game or tackle the career mode. The latter first asks us to choose our character from the two available, then to take up one of the guitars kindly offered by Gibson, finally to face a lineup made up of a total of fifteen songs, taken from the console versions of Guitar Hero. If you have tried Guitar Legend: Get on Stage!, you will already know what to expect from the mechanics of this GH3 mobile reduction: while in the background your polygonal alter-ego fidgets on stage, you will have to pay attention to the view on the guitar neck, with the notes that flow in time to the music until they reach the pick-up area, i.e. where the fingers of the right hand should be. Each note must be played following the rhythm of the song, but only when it reaches the bottom of the screen, and the lesser or greater precision of the ~pick~ translates into different visual effects. As in the original game, ringing a sequence of perfect shots makes us enter a sort of state of grace, complete with multiplied scores. The goal is to complete each piece with the highest degree of accuracy possible, in order to unlock the next stage. The developers have also added as many as fifty ~achievements~ to reach, which adds a certain depth to the experience. As far as the technical realization is concerned, unfortunately it must be said that the level reached is still well below what it would take to get a good rhythm game on mobile phones, especially in terms of audio. The music is in MIDI format, and this was already known, but their quality leaves much to be desired. In any case, this is the least of Guitar Hero 3's problems, since depending on the terminal used you could experience numerous episodes of ~latency~ that make the songs ~unplayable~, in the sense that music and graphics are not synchronized and you end up to press the keys when the notes reach the picking zone, but without following the rhythm. The graphics show a three-dimensional stage and musicians, even if made on the basis of rather crude and not very detailed models. PRO It's Guitar Hero, and it matters Simple and immediate Fifteen songs available...
