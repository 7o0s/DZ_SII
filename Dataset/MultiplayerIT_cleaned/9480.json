On the front of the original titles it fared only slightly better; see the controversial Maxplosion, which didn't make its mark anyway. Devil May Cry 4 Refrain therefore stood as a new beginning for the Osaka house on Apple devices, a show of strength that would have made everyone think again about the commitment made by the developers of the mobile division, at this point determined to make a name for itself even in a difficult market like that of the App Store. Unfortunately, things didn't go exactly like this, and Devil May Cry 4 Refrain presented itself to the test as a discreet but very limited action game, which has little to do with the versions of the game for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC . The story told by this portable reduction does not change one iota compared to the original, only that instead of the splendid animated sequences we have static images accompanied by subtitles (by the way, the game is completely in English). So let's take on the role of Nero, Dante's younger brother (no one is shocked by the spoiler: it really was Pulcinella's secret...) who, despite possessing extraordinary powers, is not yet aware of his own demonic nature. One day Dante breaks into the Casa dell'Opera, a church built in honor of Sparda, and kills His Holiness for no apparent reason. Nero is therefore tasked with capturing Dante, but his mission will lead him to discover that his brother's actions were aimed at revealing the evil within the church. Slow down babe! The order in which the chapters follow one another is the same as in the original version of Devil May Cry 4, however the connotation of each stage is much simplified compared to what was seen on consoles and PC: Nero moves within small-sized locations , too often almost identical to each other except for the shades of color used, which moreover, due to the close-up view, create big problems in understanding where we came from and where we are heading. A practical example: the typical situation proposed by Devil May Cry 4 Refrain sees the protagonist enter a room, then face enemies and then possibly continue on his way to the next room. The problem is that the two doors, the entry and exit doors, are almost always identical, just as the portions of the scenario that host them are sometimes identical. In short, we often end up returning to the door we came from, only to realize the mistake and go back, finding the same enemies to kill. The exploratory element is therefore not the strong point of this reduction for iPhone and iPod Touch, and in the same way the numerous puzzles present in the original version have been simplified, completely losing their charm. The only exception is perhaps constituted by the ~pointed dice~ that Black must roll for a statue to slide on a ~game of the goose~ style board which, depending on the chosen square, can give energy or put the player in difficulty through the arrival of some evil creature to deal with. The control system offers us two variants: the first, simplified, sees a single button for the attack and therefore the character who shoots the firearm or strikes with the sword depending on the distance from the target; the second, advanced, has a button for using the pistol and one for the sword, with all the rest of the actions unchanged. During fights, Nero can perform combos and special moves but not in large numbers, which makes the fights rather repetitive. Furthermore, the use of a virtual analog stick instead of a virtual d-pad makes the execution of some maneuvers complicated and cumbersome, from the lateral swerve (almost useless, given the low level of difficulty) to the lunge while running. The huge end-of-level bosses are also not very incisive, with simplified behavioral routines compared to the original title, and the presence of infinite continues does not improve things: if we lose a life, just continue to resume the fight immediately, with the opponent already tested by our previous attacks. A solution that perhaps protects from episodes of frustration, but which further demeans the experience, condemning it to a very rapid end. Finally, as far as the technical sector is concerned, it is necessary to distinguish the graphics from the sound: while the latter makes use of some pressing musical pieces and good effects, the former suffers from an evident ~thinning~ to the detriment of the polygonal models, the settings andespecially the animations, which in too many cases are missing several frames.
