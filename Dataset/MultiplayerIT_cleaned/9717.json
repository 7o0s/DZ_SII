{"name": "Gears of War in salsa asiatica?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81383-quantum-theory-gears-of-war-in-salsa-asiatica.html", "text": "Version tested: PlayStation 3The Gears of War saga from Epic for Xbox 360 has become the touchstone for all third-person shooters in the gaming arena. With its unique style, with the dynamism of the action and with the implementation of the cover system that have meant an authentic evolution of the genre, it constitutes a precious source for any software house wishing to try their hand at creating a product of the same type of inspiration. But at the same time also a cumbersome presence as always happens in these cases. The perfect model to which everyone, players and insiders, will inevitably refer when they have to analyze a new stylistically similar title. All this must have tormented the dreams of the developers of Tecmo Koei a lot in recent years, or at least since they began to design their futuristic third-person shooter, the alleged oriental answer to the Epic masterpiece. To the point that to cut the bull's head off, as they say, they thought of almost completely imitating the two games of the aforementioned series, ending up creating a work that in many situations even borders on plagiarism, as we will see in a few lines. Quantum Theory is set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been decimated by a terrible atomic war. If the consequences of this bloody conflict were not enough, the few survivors of the holocaust, now exhausted, are threatened by a black material called Erosion, a sort of sentient slime that can take shape in various forms and corrupt existing ones, resulting from a mysterious tower popped out of the ground in the Cocoon community. The human colonies then decide to form special militias to destroy the Erosion and bring down the living tower by sending super soldier Syd and his team to storm the building. Gears of War emulator That Quantum Theory rather than being inspired by Gears of War has cloned it almost in everything immediately catches the eye once you start playing. The protagonist and his companions look like copies of the various Marcus, Dom, Augustus ~Cole Train~ Cole, Baird and the other members of Delta Squad in terms of looks, weapons (with some aesthetic variations) and ways of doing. Ditto the settings in which the latter move, gloomy, gray and post-apocalyptic even if they lack that aesthetic quality, as we will see later, which characterized the Epic production. Even the enemies that populate the various areas into which the adventure is divided are monsters that in many respects resemble locusts. The game, needless to underline it at this point, is a third-person shooter in which the primary aim is to make your way through hordes of enemies from level to level, using an arsenal of futuristic weapons and a cover system whose mechanics are given great emphasis. The dynamics of this feature take place exactly as in Gears of War: every fragment of rock, every corner, every element of the scenario can be used by the main character (and in theory also by the others) as shelter by simply pressing a special button. From behind the makeshift shelter Syd can then lean, aim and fire at enemies while avoiding their shots. But this is where the flaws begin. Although these elements are all in all well implemented in the game mechanics, however, they appear a bit too slow and awkward, just as the movement and cover are woody, with an advancement between the various shelters mentioned above dictated only in certain cases by the appearance of new enemies on the horizon and not from real defensive or tactical needs. In short, that feeling of siege, of vital combat, of extreme survival is missing in which the barricade becomes the last obstacle between life and death. And therefore the action consequently fragments, slows down and loses that initial thrust of a bloody and death-defying firefight. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-one Trophies available in Quantum Theory, distributed both in single player and in multiplayer mode. Most of them are obtained with the progression in the single-player campaign, eliminating a certain number of enemies or completing certain scenarios, others, some very particular, are obtained through multiplayer games. Head-on fights But unfortunately this is not the only problem encountered during the battles. Even the weapon targeting system is quite difficult to control and therefore creates many difficulties when trying to aim and hit an enemy. Not to mention the fact that the search for originality at all costs has prompted the developers to produce a sortof artistic short circuit, from which weapons with such imaginative models have arisen that they do not give clarity on what they are in the switch between them until they are equipped and used. Further slowing down the action. Not that this is a big deal on balance, given the inherent stupidity of adversaries that only in rare cases will create real threats to the user. Their artificial intelligence is in fact quite limited to wanting to be kind, and this is not so much due to the nature of violent creatures but rather due to incorrect programming on the part of the developers. Too many gaps highlighted by the enemies with their behavior to be able to justify everything with the simple definition of ~mindless monsters~: they carry out incoherent attacks with their heads down without worrying in the least about exploiting the terrain, a position or sketching at least a minimum of tactics . At most, some of them limit themselves to going up and down from some shelter and little else, but only because they are positioned behind a particular scenic element rather than for logic and instinct for protection. The only novelties in the gameplay of this product lie in the possibility of interacting with Filena, the protagonist's partner controlled by artificial intelligence, and in the implementation of platform-style sessions. In the first case it is a question of using one's partner as a sort of throwing weapon, to be thrown at the enemies so that she can hit them with her sword, or distract them while the main character moves to a new position useful for attacking with blows rifle or with a charge. Human slingshot In the latter case, considering that in melee the maximum obtainable from a mountain of muscles like Syd is only a sort of push incapable of inflicting great damage on anyone, it is better to aim for couple moves to always be performed with Filena. In fact, the combos of the two characters put together are much more effective than the single-player physical attacks we mentioned earlier and consist of a string of punches with an explosive effect for Syd and the usual slashing for the partner. But be careful: if Filena is mortally wounded and not treated in time by her partner, there will be trouble. In fact, the death of one of the two members corresponds to game over. Something far from impossible to avoid in some cases, just as it is equally impossible, in ninety percent of cases, to survive the leaps imposed by the platform component proposed by the developers in certain situations. Since the living tower in which the game is set is characterized by living environments, by elements capable of moving and modifying their morphology so as to make whole blocks appear or disappear, sometimes you have to move from one platform to another: pity that all this corresponds most of the time to a leap into the void due to the difficulty in measuring the timing and direction of the jump. At this point you are undoubtedly wondering if this Quantum Theory is all to be thrown away or if it has at least something worth playing for, a minimum of quality, something that can be saved. In our opinion, in addition to the very strong abstinence from Gears of War, the kind that make fans close both eyes in order to find a palliative, it could be the multiplayer sector that entices someone to play with the Tecmo Koei title. Techno world Even with all its flaws, the lack of originality and some slight lag despite the uncrowded servers, it is still this option that is the most discreet among those present in the product, at least when compared to the entire context to which it belongs. The mode is available for a maximum number of eight players and provides for a series of game situations: there is the one called Guardian, whose development is identical to that of the aforementioned Epic title with two teams facing each other led by a leader who up to until he kicks the bucket, he grants unlimited regeneration of his companions. Then we have the classic deathmatch called for the occasion Executioner, with all players against all, or in teams (Dead or Alive), and Controlled Chaos, a mode in which it is possible for the host to customize the parameters that will regulate the clash and the objectives of the same. In a context that is certainly not perfect like the one described up to now, there is also a graphic sector that offers, as mentioned at the beginning of the article, scenarios with a rather dull design, with poor textures and a color palette with opaque shades always tending towards dull gray and light green. The environments dotted with fixed roofs and others that appear out of nowhere like plants that grow rapidly from the ground, to simulate the influence of the materialhe tower and its effects on things seem equally bare and almost all the same, with large rooms alternating with narrow corridors, in a continuous repetition of visual glimpses that are too similar to each other. It doesn't go better with the animations of the characters, in some rather woody and poorly finished situations. The sound sector is a little better with an English dubbing without infamy and without praise, apart from the voice of the protagonist, too monotonous, and a very soft sound accompaniment in which only the screams and the effect of the weapons stand out a little.", "date": "2010-10-20", "grade": "5.0"}
