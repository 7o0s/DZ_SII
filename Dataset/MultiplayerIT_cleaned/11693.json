{"name": "Undertow - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/undertow-recensione.html", "text": "Deep in the abyss... Undertow is a side-scrolling shooter, costing 800 points, which at the very first approach can recall Geometry Wars in gameplay and the many derivatives that have adopted the dual analog control system, in which the left is delegated to the movements and the right to the I shoot. The setting is underwater, with evocative locations of that submerged world that has become, in the apocalyptic vision of the developers, our Earth. So here it is possible to play the role of three different factions fighting each other, respectively called Humans, Nemo and Atlantis. The aim of the game is to occupy and maintain control of the bases scattered throughout the levels, thus making the enemies lose points until they reach zero and thus giving victory to your group. A very simple and immediate concept, as is the control system which, in addition to the aforementioned analog sticks, relies only on the triggers for other functions, specifically the quick release and the release of bombs. But simple does not mean simplistic, and in fact the guys from Chair Entertainment have added a strategic element, which in fact allows Undertow to take that extra step capable of making it a quality product. We are referring to the ability to choose between 4 different units, which differ fundamentally in the values of speed in movement, agility and (inversely proportional) firepower. The choice between one or the other can be made at the time of respawn or by going to one's own base. A situation of this type, already intriguing on paper, is then enhanced by the level design devised by skilled programmers which, in perfect cohesion with the game mechanics, allows you to exploit the abilities of the different units, create traps and develop attack and of defense. The breadth of the settings and the presence of tunnels and shortcuts also provides a marked exploratory component to the whole, which does not taste good at all. Faced with this description, it is clear that Undertow is a product basically aimed at online multiplayer; up to 16 players can in fact participate in battles to the death, favored by an intelligent organization of the lobbies and by a brilliant netcode that limits the presence of lag to a minimum. Even in single player there is some meat on the fire, specifically represented by a campaign organized in 15 missions that can also be tackled in co-op, which allows you to improve your familiarity with the gameplay. Too bad it's really very short, thus proving to be little more than a parenthesis within the great multiplayer roast. With rifle fins and goggles Undertow is therefore an immediate, fun product with a fairly gentle learning curve, a factor that is anything but secondary in the case of online multiplayer games. Furthermore, the good depth and the possibility of discovering new elements within the levels to be used to one's advantage makes the effort of Chair Entertainment undoubtedly worthy of attention. That said, it would be an exaggeration to say that Undertow is a flawless little masterpiece; the action during battles, especially when you approach the limit of 16 players at the same time, becomes dangerously chaotic and confusing, with the risk of alienating the least patient. On the other hand, with few users, one touches solitude within the large gaming arenas; in this sense, a good ten people are the ideal number. Furthermore, the graphic component, although extremely accurate and particularly valid especially considering the 50 Mb that make up the product, relies slightly too much on black and dark tones; this involves the side effect of sometimes losing sight of one's character (especially on TVs that are not abundant in terms of inches), condemning in most cases to certain death. Lastly, a defect unfortunately not attributable to the game itself should be mentioned, but which in fact represents a major limitation of Undertow; we are referring to the low diffusion within the community, also due to the launch that took place without any advertising push and in a decidedly crowded period. And if in a predominantly multiplayer game it is difficult to find users to challenge online, unfortunately the situation is not the most rosy... Xbox 360 - Goals Getting all the points will be a far from simple undertaking, we tell you right away. It starts from the need to complete the campaign with all 3 factions, even at ultra level, up to the request to collect 1000 kills with bombs, or even 10,000 overall. Comment Undertow is an interesting, if a little overrated, yet another exponent of thecategory of two analog stick shooters. There is an effort to make the game worthy of attention, and it is evident from all points of view; a well-finished level design, solid and enjoyable mechanics, more than pleasant graphics and a very valid netcode. The questionable decision to have been launched during a more than crowded period as regards the games available on Xbox 360 has unfortunately rowed against the effort of Chair Entertainment, which at the moment can rest on a community that is far too small to be able to guarantee success and the spread of what is above all a multiplayer title. Pros Nice and solid gameplay Good netcode Good graphics Cons Sometimes too confusing Small online community Some problems with dark tints", "date": "2008-01-03", "grade": null}
