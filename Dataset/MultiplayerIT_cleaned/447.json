The Dead Island 2 review that you are about to read finally puts a stop to a troubled and, we imagine, exhausting development for all parties involved. Before starting to gut this new game, regardless of how the final product will be evaluated, Dambuster Studios deserves no small credit for having brought the so-called ship to port. So welcome to Dead Island 2, it was still nice to meet you. Biting and biting Dead Island 2: also thanks to various tricks, graphically the Dambuster game turned out to be very beautiful Dead Island 2 is a chat game. Yes, really: you take two friends and start playing it, but it's like being on the phone. We talk, what did you do tonight and what did you do, and he will disturb you the right; but when the volume increases, it's better to ban the chatter and concentrate because it will mean that problems are coming, many problems. Dead Island 2, let's be clear, can be played alone without any kind of problem, and for about ten hours it also keeps you hooked because in the end things work, the graphics are really very nice and then, let's face it, spreading zombies is always a satisfaction. Except that without friends something is missing, the gossip, and the gossip is missing because the adventure lacks bite. In Dead Island 2 you essentially do two things: kill zombies 90% of the time and look for new items to kill other zombies in the remaining 10%. And so far that would be fine too, right? Furthermore, the fact of using these small but super detailed levels instead of the latest dripping open worlds is not a small advantage: you always do something and never waste time. However, a progression is missing, an exponential growth, the change of cards on the table that displaces the players as Ravenholm of Half-Life 2 did in its time, or the most recent skyscraper of The Last of Us Part II where the infected come out of the walls and you can go shotgun heavy. It's not nice to put such important productions in front of them, but we also find this sensitivity in managing emotions in many games that for one reason or another have not made history. Few surprises around here, and that's a shame. Blows and scalps Dead Island 2: The wonderful Venice Beach, here much quieter than the original version Dead Island 2, on the other hand, goes straight from start to finish, adding new elements, such as new powers and new crafting mechanics, but basically nothing that gives you the idea of being ever closer to danger. Indeed, thanks to the ability to increase our power by recycling pieces of zombies that will be unlocked about halfway through the game, we will become so strong that the danger to others will be us, already immune to this new extravagant zombie epidemic. From a certain point on, Dead Island 2 encourages you to abuse the zombie threat rather than fear it, and it is a choice made perhaps also to hide the limits of the entire technical and playful infrastructure. There are some end-of-level bosses that are different from all the others, galvanizing moments in which the music goes blaring and zombies come out everywhere, but it is still a matter of fighting and not through a complex or interesting system but a rather elementary one. Suggestions... Dead Island 2: it will not be easy to get out of Hell-A's sewers unscathed Dead Island 2 does a lot with little, this is true and so is the fact that many of these problems were already present in the very first game which also sported a technical and graphic performance far from the standards of the time. At least Dead Island 2 from this point of view is decidedly modern, very clean and with a pleasant and constant fluidity, with some drops in the coop mode. However, in terms of gameplay we are stuck in 2006. For example, being able to play with elements such as electricity and fire is now a constant that is no longer surprising if implemented as in Dead Island 2. In the Dambuster game you can open the tap on the pipe to flood the surrounding area and finally using a modified weapon or electrical source, such as a car battery, to burn the dearly departed quickly to more or less safety. Barrels of water like petrol cans can be used to create trap pools, where to attract zombies with the appropriate bait and then make them explode in a single bang with a pipe bomb built for the purpose. The biggest limitation of implementing such a system is that it never really leaves room for creative improvisation. You don't feel like doing it because you're an evil genius; you feel like doing it because the game prompted you to. Weapons and Cards Dead Islandnd 2: the game is very enjoyable even alone, but in the company of two other friends it is quite another thing Nor are the modified weapons surprising, more or less the same as those already seen and used in the first game or in the two Dying Lights from Techland. The idea and style of the weapons was born with Dead Island, so it's also right to find them here, but the repetition after what from a certain point of view are three games makes itself felt. The different abilities that will be applied to our character through the discovery and selection of particular cards are yet another demonstration that the developers have found a square, a precarious balance, and were then afraid to damage him with more radical abilities, in able to distort more clearly a gameplay that remains, also for this reason, always too docile and harnessed. Better a double flying kick or a single but less powerful kick, or better an explosion that drives away the zombies while we use the medikit or the explosion while we reload? Yes, skill cards allow you to build your own build, but always a bit boring. Not even the number of zombies on screen, about a dozen, helps in this sense even if the game will use different gimmicks to give us the idea of being overwhelmed. I may be crazy but if I were to direct a game about zombies, the first thing I would do is make sure there are enough zombies to give me the idea of a horde. In Dead Island 2 you either dodge, or even Dead Island 2: make way for the pulper! The fight takes place by aiming at the part of the body of the zombies that we would like to damage first, for a choice also dictated by the type of weapon wielded. With a cutting weapon it is preferable to aim at the limbs, in order to perform targeted amputations; with a blunt instrument, however, it is usually better to aim for the body or the head. By modifying the weapons on the work tables that we will find scattered around, we will still be able to perfect them in order to adapt them to the use we want to make of them, increasing their strength and speed, for example, to the detriment of durability and speed. After several hours of play, firearms such as pistols and machine guns will also make their appearance, also with different upgrades available and a good number of dedicated skill cards. Then new powers will take over, including a fury mode that will give us the opportunity to tear apart the surrounding zombies only with the help of our hands. There are also cards for dodging and parrying, but they cannot be used at the same time; performing one of these two actions just before being hit activates a finishing move which, depending on the weapon, will start an almost always lethal execution. Layers of pain Dead Island 2: the characters are a bit over the top but capable of unexpected tragic moments Like many first-person games, especially those that don't want too much complexity in the controls, hand-to-hand combat doesn't convey great feedback. Our character's arm and weapon will never stop against a zombie's body, but will continue to slash based on the characteristics of the weapon and completing the animation of each lunge. What will make us understand the intensity of our blows will be the animations of the zombies, and how these are built in Dead Island 2. The enemies of this game are composed of layers: they have clothes that break, skin that tears, flesh that tear and finally muscles and bones that will try to respond realistically to the blows they will receive. The system works and is undoubtedly one of the strong points of this game: seeing a limb hanging by a few flaps of skin, dangling while the zombie advances towards us, after having battered it with an ax, is a dream for those who love splatter and Grand Guignol shows. Drinking in Hell-A Dead Island 2: even now that we know how to handle them, these beasts are always intimidating Another strong point of the game is this infernal Los Angeles renamed Hell-A. As already mentioned, a great job has been done graphically, but more than a matter of dirty polygons, the secret of Dead Island 2 is that it has perfectly captured the atmosphere, the mood, of the Californian city. The colours, the light, the buildings and the symbolic attractions are all or almost all there, and when they aren't there, at least the idea is there and that's enough. This helps a lot to return without boredom to already visited maps, which will practically always happen if you also want to face the secondary missions that the game offers along the obligatory path. Some of these aren't even that obvious: for example, there's a treasure hunt related to a Bel-Air pool cleaner from the facility that we really wouldn't have expected in a similar game, and that prompted us to explore more methodical, rrested. The actors! Dead Island 2: it is possible to carry around a large number of weapons, so it is unlikely that you will run out The narration is entrusted to characters that are over the top, but not like, for example, the latest Far Cry by Ubisoft where even crocodiles in T-shirts now find space. The cast of Dead Island 2 can become terribly serious and a light-hearted character up to a few moments before can throw you off guard with a great cinematic joke weighed to perfection a moment later. The narrative canvas like the dialogues don't shine for originality, but they work really well. Among other things, the game offers six different characters to impersonate, each with particular memories of a place or a moment, a background from which they will draw jokes, a different way of reacting to events and this, you will agree, is a great nice detail. The six different characters also have unique physical characteristics: they can be more or less fast or strong, have more or less stamina, but these differences are not perceived much once the game starts. The various unique cards that these six characters will be able to activate, and which will more concretely determine their approach, count for much more.", "date": "2023-04-18", "grade": "7.0"}
