{"name": "One Punch Man - The Strongest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/one-punch-man-the-strongest-recensione.html", "text": "The review of One Punch Man - The Strongest catapults us once again into the streets of City Z, the city that the very powerful Saitama has sworn to protect using his devastating punch. The manga created by One, also particularly known in Italy thanks to the animated series, therefore returns to iOS and Android devices with a new tie-in. Of course, the formula used by the Chinese development team FingerFun for the game is not exactly the most original and exciting: we are faced with the usual strategic RPG with turn-based combat and a bang of gacha elements, capable of discreetly exploiting the rich lore of the original work, but putting in place monetization mechanisms that already after the first few hours reveal limitations. History One Punch Man - The Strongest traces the events of the anime There's not much to say: the story of One Punch Man - The Strongest refers to the events narrated in the animated series of One-Punch Man, also including the nightmare that Saitama makes in the first episode and using it as a tutorial to illustrate the mechanics basis of this experience. However, the powerful character will not be at our disposal, as it was easy to imagine and we will therefore have to fall back on the many supporting characters to form our team. In general, the narrative aspect is certainly not central to the title of FingerFun, which beyond a couple of engaging introductory sequences does not make too much effort to recall the atmospheres of the cartoon, considering it sufficient to bring over sixty characters including heroes, outlaws and monsters to the screen, all equipped with spectacular special abilities capable of overturning the tide of a battle. Gameplay One Punch Man - The Strongest, a special attack by Genos As mentioned at the beginning, the gameplay of One Punch Man - The Strongest neither surprises nor impresses that much, given that it refers to a genre that is now decidedly inflated on mobile, that of strategic RPGs with gacha elements. By exploring a virtual map, we will be able to access various scenarios and face enemies after having composed a team that can accommodate up to six fighters. The clashes take place in the context of a turn-based system which fortunately leaves us something to do, without completely falling back on the increasingly frequent automatisms. We will therefore be able to select the target of our attacks and choose whether to hit it with a standard combination or with a special move, mixing the skills in order to inflict the greatest possible damage. It is obvious that the formula does not provide for particular depth and indeed lends itself very evidently to the inevitable dynamics of the freemium model for which the easy victories and the many rewards of the first few hours at a certain point give way to opponents too strong to be beaten without whether you make your team grow further or, alternatively, put your hand in your wallet to speed up progression. In general, these productions unfortunately tend to resemble each other more and more, even in structural terms. Here we have the inevitable overflowing interface, a thousand notifications for rewards and upgrades, alternative modes that allow you to challenge the most famous One-Punch Man villains or other users in an asynchronous multiplayer, as well as the inevitable events: all side material that comes in handy when it comes time to do some grinding. Technical realization One Punch Man - The Strongest, a fight sequence At least on the technical front, a discreet job has been done, with a very well-maintained initial part, which, as already mentioned, also includes exciting animated sequences, and in-game graphics that stylistically refer to the chibi genre: the final result is pleasant and the animations are smooth, even if it's all pretty generic. The interface, on the other hand, remains chaotic, as per the Chinese tradition. The sound can count on some dialogues in Japanese with the original actors, subtitled in English, and on a couple of rock songs that chase the user during the fights, but the themes that you will hear the most, in the main menu, lack bite and will hardly stick in your mind. Ah, the demented little song of the very bad One Punch Man - The Strongest commercial is missing.", "date": "2022-10-09", "grade": "6.0"}
