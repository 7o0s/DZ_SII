{"name": "Kenshi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kenshi-recensione.html", "text": "To be honest, reviewing Kenshi is nonsense. Since it is an ultra-specialized and shaped title for those who have followed it since its first stirrings, now issued a decade ago, supporting it with money and feedback, it is they who should be asked if they are satisfied or not with how it came. All the others should just knock politely to try to figure out if there's some space left, then decide whether or not it's worth facing the rough edges that lead to understanding the game and all its dynamics. Dynamic world After many hours of play we decide to take our party for a ride to a territory that we have not yet explored. Kenshi's world is vast, vast (870 square kilometers), and we struggled enormously to have a close-knit and well-equipped group that could face all kinds of dangers. Now we can face situations that only a few hours before would have swept us away in a few moments, but at the same time we know we have to keep our guard up if we don't want to frustrate most of the efforts made, because there really is no one who is invincible . Kenshi is a rough and tough RPG, like its development. It arrived in Steam Early Access in 2013, already at version 0.40 and now, after literally hundreds of updates, the final version has finally been released, which does not conclude its epic but which at least allows us to evaluate it. Describing it is quite simple, given that it is an RPG with a strong survival component that leaves the player free to act as he wishes, in the sense that it does not impose objectives and is not held together by a narrative campaign. The character or party is controlled via mouse, clicking on destinations and interactive objects (people to talk to, containers to open, material to collect, and so on). Once you have chosen one of five playstyles (note that to simplify your life you can decide to have a party right away) and created the main character (or characters in the case of a party) using the very complete editor included, you find yourself having to study the complex game world, which offers a number of possibilities denied by many other RPGs. Let's take factions for example: they are usually groups that we can join after completing various tasks. In Kenshi, on the other hand, they are much more, that is, centers of power that actually act in a certain territory, influencing its economy and relations with other factions. In short, a faction is not a static element of the scenario that must be chosen to have certain bonuses, but contributes to shaping the scenario itself. Okay, you're saying, it all sounds great on paper, but what does it mean in practice? Basically, Kenshi's world appears much more alive than the average video game on the market, even those much more demanding in technical terms, because it evolves continuously, well beyond the player's actions, helping to make each game truly unique. In short, when playing, we do not encounter events that are activated as we pass, but we are the ones who slip into events that exist regardless of our presence. Hardcore RPG We return to our party, waiting hopefully to do something. We leave our citadel, which we have built with great effort by looking for materials up and down hills. At first we were alone and unarmed: any marauder could kill us mercilessly and our only weapon was to escape. Then we made do, we began to better understand the complex game system, we found the raw materials, we armed ourselves, we were killed by other raiders who didn't let our crude equipment intimidate us, we continued to persevere, we broke into some houses using the stealth system to steal valuables, increased strength by overloading our inventory, practiced fighting with dummies, started hoarding some resources, went back to wandering around looking for other raw materials and we realized that in addition to gaining experience to improve and become stronger, we could use the game world itself to our advantage. For example, at the umpteenth ambush suffered while we were on our own, we attracted the attackers towards a group of guards, who confronted them, killing them all. Unfortunately the guards raided the corpses for us, leaving us only a few objects of little value. Not bad: we took what we could, we sold it and we continued to grow, meeting increasingly important personalities with whom we began todevelop mutual assistance and commercial relationships. Slowly we built our first outpost, bought houses, got richer and hired some travel companions, the ones we were just about to go on an adventure with. Enemies no longer scare us, whether criminals or wild animals, but we must be careful, because it is not easy to heal wounds and being overwhelmed is always a matter of a few moments, especially if the wrong group is attacked. The combat system is very simple: you click on the enemies and the character hits with the weapon in his hand. To be complex is all it took to make the attacks effective. However, being an adventurer is just one of the many ways to play Kenshi. Do you want to be a solitary thief? You can. Do you want to become powerful merchants by being protected by mercenaries? You can do this too. Do you want to play it as if it were some kind of RTS? There are options and skills dedicated to the purpose. The important thing is to grow the right characteristics and not underestimate all those aspects that seem secondary, but in reality are not. No compromises For those who were wondering, our party made a very poor impression. We reached a land filled with cannibals, attacked one, and found ourselves surrounded by his companions within moments. Our men were overwhelmed, captured, tied to stakes and then eaten. Maybe next time. As already pointed out, Kenshi is so vast and complex that it can be confusing at first. To find a game that resembles it in terms of amount of dynamics, you have to look at Mount & Blade. The learning curve is very steep and the first few hours of the game are dizzying, especially if you take it the wrong way. There are so many things to engage in that some might not even find anything to do, such is the freedom afforded. In fact it can be strange not to have a predetermined direction to follow, but this is precisely its strength, what has made it loved by a community of few but faithful enthusiasts. In short, the real-time combat system can be a bit wooden, technically there can be nothing exciting to see, apart from some rare landscapes, the game system can be one of the least friendly ever made, the soundtrack can be almost non-existent, but it doesn't matter because Kenshi players ask the game to be anything but. They ask him that they can be killed at any moment if they act recklessly, they ask him to spend hours building an outpost or to train their character to see him die in the first fight, so they have the satisfaction of training him again. They want an experience beyond hardcore, in short, and would not have welcomed any compromise made to make life easier for a different audience.", "date": "2018-12-05", "grade": "8.0"}
