The problems began with the third chapter: released months ahead of schedule and with the developer Piranha Bytes it is not known to what extent convinced by the choice, Gothic III was distinguished by a myriad of bugs, both in terms of gameplay and stability of the game engine, able to obscure the goodness of the work done by the developers who in terms of variety of situations, environments, characters, crossroads of the plot and importance of the minor quests really had no equal. The mediocre and little-known Forsaken Gods expansion hasn't solved any of the numerous defects, which have instead been corrected by the still large group of enthusiasts with excellent amateur work. A last non-exciting release that marked the beginning of a long fast, ready to end with the release of this Arcania: Gothic 4. Simplification or denaturalization? Pirahna Bytes has therefore definitively passed to Spellbound - famous for the Desperados and Robin Hood - the burden of developing the fourth episode of its most important production. The problem is that Arcania: Gothic 4 of the series bears only the name, indeed, the subtitle: first of all the character of the first three episodes, renamed by most ~the hero without a name~, has not only acquired one, that of King Rhobar III, but he has also become a power-hungry madman who had nothing better to do than invade the island of Feshyr, inhabited by a handful of shepherds of which the only survivor is precisely the protagonist of the subject of this review, with physical features slightly resembling the prince of Persia and with swordsmanship worthy of Zorro. Determined to avenge the deaths of his companions as well as of his young girlfriend, the ~shepherd~ - who is not even given a name in this case - abandons what remains of his home and leaves for the land of Arcania, a completely new continent detached from those that appeared in the previous episodes, Khorinis and Myrtana, but which still maintains the Central European characterization that has always distinguished the series. In Gothic there were mainly two excellent ideas inherent in the gameplay: the first a coherent cycle of day and night, to which the non-player characters adapted and followed its evolution, getting up, working, stopping for lunch, working again and finally going to bed, giving the idea of a real and living frame around the protagonist, which could have continued to exist without him. Even the reactions of the characters to the player's presence, from ignoring him to reacting if he armed himself in front of them or entered houses without permission, up to greeting him once he became a famous character, gave an idea of identification and interaction with the world that they had rarely been seen in other exponents of the genre. The second winning feature was instead given by the perfect character growth system to which, contrary to most role-playing games, it was not enough to scrape together experience points to enhance characteristics and abilities, but which also had to find a teacher willing to instruct him: you wanted to increase strength? We needed a wrestler who could explain how to do it. Better swordplay? We needed a warrior. Learn magic? And where is a magician looking for disciples? Well, in Arcania: Gothic 4 all this is not there. Or rather, the day-night cycle exists, as do atmospheric changes, but their influence on non-player characters is much less marked than in the past, as for the interaction between them and the protagonist has simply been canceled. The environments appear less alive and inhabited than in the past, but above all no one will say anything if you show up at an inn brandishing a broadsword, there will even be no reaction if you start slashing the air or casting spells around. Worst of all, most of the characters are unassailable: if once upon a time it was possible to react violently to impositions and therefore pass the checkpoints ~simply~ by defeating their guardians, in this case one is instead forced to follow the way decided by the developers to solve the many requests that make up the quests. This decision betweenmore, it made it possible to transform the title into a very linear game: if in Gothic it was in fact possible to reach the entire map right from the start - you usually died trying, but it was possible - here each area is delineated by a border, be it natural or imposed by characters. As for the growth of the character, forget all that has been, even the altars scattered here and there to ask for a miracle in exchange for a libation: growth is limited to a single screen in which the acquired points can be assigned - 3 per level - to the various skills (ardor, discipline, vigor) without any need for teachers, as in any role-playing game; indeed, one could say, more trivially than any role-playing game, since these skills are rather small in number - 3 for hand-to-hand combat, 2 for ranged attacks and 3 for spells. Another heavily changed aspect is the combat: loved and hated in the previous chapters and in Risen, in which it seemed too complicated to some but which still maintained its uniqueness and above all its basic difficulty, which made it different from a frenzied random click mouse buttons. In Arcania: Gothic 4 it was limited to a single left button for attacks, which vary in power based on how long the pressure is held, and the right button for parrying, which can be combined with dodges if you press the arrow keys while holding it turned on - it's a bit unrealistic to see armored men dodging swings with Max Payne leaps, to be honest. The numerical bar to assign spells, armaments and potions remains unchanged, as does the attack with the bow. Not that we expected a Mount and Blade system (although it would have been appreciated) but the risk of reducing everything to a hack & slash with continuous pressing of a key is quite high. Take everything away from me, but not the atmosphere Although the continued simplification operation has also affected the plot - only one ending available this time, no choice between different factions and decidedly few crossroads limited to rather marginal situations - what is left of Gothic is partly the atmosphere: from the discovery of the reasons for the madness of the new king to the revenge of the nameless hero, up to the return of almost all the old glories of the saga, Milten and Diego to name two, and the exhausting searches for a high number of artifacts, these elements give hope that there is still some good out there. Even the objects, however small, remain in a decidedly high number, a pity only for the herbs, mushrooms and leather which, practically infinite in the past few episodes, have been drastically reduced in number here. However, what helps most to maintain the remarkable atmosphere of the old Gothic is the graphic aspect, especially in the picturesque environments it manages to reproduce: between caves, beaches, citadels, swamps and mountains, the details seem to never end on the PC version we tested , especially in long shots, sometimes worthy of a postcard; therefore it is a pity that the interaction is reduced to a minimum, but the quantity of decorative frills in the interiors and the quality of the exteriors can give real joys for the eyes, not to mention the excellent realization of atmospheric events, in particular thunderstorms . In so much panoramic beauty, however, the mediocre human models are out of place: while wanting to forget that they have very little variety - apart from the main characters, the remaining ones are mainly formed by five different skins, while the female models differ mainly in the face - the real problem is the granite animations, bordering on surrealism, culminating in a barely hinted lip. No problem however with regard to the details and the particularity of the armor and weapons: they remain numerous and solve the problem of the lack of skins quite well, covering them. Absurdly, the monster models appear much more impressive and pleasant, as usual in a rather large number and with numerous minor variations (goblins, brigands, undead, trolls and never forgotten monstrous beasts such as spider diggers and other horrors) compared to those humans. It is a pity therefore that their artificial intelligence has been extremely reduced, eliminating scenes such as wolves hunting moose and reducing their tactic to a direct charge, and finally removing the interaction between the inhabitants and the world around them: one of the typical tactics from the series was bringing herds of ferocious animals towards someone in order to commit/make him tear him to pieces; now however, in the presence of monsters, the non-player characters will not do anything, and at the same time the beasts will not attack them, canceling, in fact,the umpteenth peculiarity that had made the name of the series important. Also noteworthy is the heaviness of the graphics engine, which forced, on the test configuration, to scale the graphic detail and the visual distance to obtain a good relationship between visual quality and game performance.", "date": "2010-10-18", "grade": "5.5"}
