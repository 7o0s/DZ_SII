The passage of time risked fading the memory of the sword that offends Fantozzi because he can't pronounce its name, but fortunately now there is a video game character, the warrior Maruto, who proudly holds his Eskizzibur with which he mows down thousands of enemies. How to use it to give undying glory to the accountant Fantozzi and peel the unfortunates like apples? We explain it to you immediately in the review of Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari, the new expansion of the cult game of poncle, which is also driving Phil Spencer crazy. The contents Some of the new weapons are very tasty Let's say right away that Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari is in line with the previous expansion, Legacy of the Moonspell, in terms of amount of new content and price. For 1.99, you take home a lot of extras. Meanwhile there is a new map, Lake Foscari, which owes its name to the prestigious Ca' Foscari University of Venice, which we will discuss in detail later. Then there are eight new playable characters, which in addition to the aforementioned Maruto, a burly warrior who is not very fast but very resistant, include the sorceress Eleanor, witty and shy, the thief Keitha, armed with a bow and arrows and the powerful witch Luminaria, the guardian of Lake Foscari also called the Lady of the Lake or the Lady Arborea. We know that we have mentioned only four, but the others are hidden and we don't want to ruin the surprise and pleasure of finding them yourself. Also added thirteen weapons, including some spells, the aforementioned Eskizzibur sword, as well as new combinations for the same with the usual flood of special effects when raised to maximum level. Also added new audio tracks, linked to characters and scenario and many new enemies. From a purely quantitative point of view we are talking about ten more hours of gameplay to get to unlock everything (something more depending on the skill demonstrated). Not a little, considering the very low price. If you are a fan of Vampire Survivors this meager list may have already convinced you to buy the expansion. After all, from the point of view of mechanics, the game remains the same as always: having chosen a hero, you have to massacre waves of thousands of enemies, trying to survive for thirty minutes, leveling up the character, weapons and objects available , in a growing kaleidoscope of sounds and special effects. Lake Foscari Did you really want to walk around Lake Foscari in peace? The most interesting part of the expansion is certainly Lake Foscari, in our opinion better as a map than Mount Moonspell, introduced with the previous expansion. The reason is that it seems to us that Poncle has found the right compromise between the desire to propose a more structured and varied design than that of the original maps, all very repetitive in their morphology, and the problems deriving from the creation of narrower and more tortuous, unnatural passages compared to the main loop of the game. So, although Lake Foscari is also full of unique areas and more complex passages than the old maps, including some labyrinths, there are no longer the funnels of Mount Moonspell and there is much less retracing your steps in search of alternative routes or to reach this or that object. The new enemies are also spot on, all of which seem to come from a classic fantasy universe, with an evident splash of Harry Potter, especially in some bosses (killing a Patronus Charm isn't bad, let's face it). So expect to face endless hordes of strange elves, armored knights, trolls, giant worms and whatnot. After all, the new heroes are practically a D&D party, so in theory they should be able to get away with it. Chaos always rules over everything In short, Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari does what it has to and does it without squeezing the player too much, proposing itself as a very valid way to expand the gaming experience. Sure, don't expect revolutions, but we imagine you took this for granted since it was a simple DLC, albeit a major one. What are you waiting for? It's time to go back to slaughtering thousands of enemies.", "date": "2023-04-13", "grade": null}
