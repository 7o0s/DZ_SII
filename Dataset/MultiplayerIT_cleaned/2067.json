{"name": "Cultures 2 - Gates of Askard", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cultures-2-gates-of-askard.html", "text": "Thor & Sons Building Company. Starting to play Cultures 2 without reading the game manual is likely to prove traumatic. Fortunately, the Tutorial is mandatory, in the sense that the first game mission is, in the end, the usual pre-packaged level to force us to become familiar with the game mechanics. And we assure you that the topic ~Cultures 2~ is really broad and complex, after a few moments we will have to acculturate immediately about the economic/productive logics that underlie this title (calling it a production chain seemed too simplistic to me). There are really many buildings available: divided mainly into three categories, productive, livelihood and military, we will have to carefully plan our resources (human and otherwise) to ensure that the construction of one does not steal precious resources from those of the other. Obviously, each construction created must be assigned some worker capable of exploiting its production characteristics, you didn't think that, like in a very normal other RTS, it was enough to create a structure to make it operational, right? Instead, to make sure that fragrant and fragrant loaves of delicious bread come out of the Bakery, you will have to choose one of the different villagers and tell him to start being a baker. Simple enough, don't you think? And in fact it is not quite so. This is because our chosen one must be able to make bread (read, in full RPG style, have the ~Bakery~ skill), and to be in these conditions he must first have worked in a mill for a certain period of time. In short, in addition to the tree of ~technologies~, we will also have to pay attention to that of the numerous professions. Scout, miner, carpenter, lumberjack, fisherman, hunter, farmer, courier ... are just some of the activities that we can make our brave subjects undertake and each of them has its own importance, more or less crucial, for the success of the our missions. As already anticipated, not all professions will be available immediately and not all of our workers will be good in the same way, in fact our characters acquire experience points based on the time dedicated to a certain activity and, sooner or later, they will gain experience needed to learn new techniques or improve on old ones. And when do we need more workforce? Simple: we have to build houses and have them inhabited by a newly wed couple who we will then ~force~ to procreate with gay obedience. A little Nazi as a method perhaps, but still very effective. Cape and axe. During our research it will be inevitable, sooner or later, to encounter hostile populations. This is when our first military structures will become necessary and we will begin to make the first acquaintances with the combat system which, unfortunately without hitting the target, tries to propose something new by implementing troop management at the single unit level. By ~at the single unit level~ we mean the possibility of being able to decide, for each individual soldier (as well as any other worker for that matter), the battle equipment and the tactical attitude to adopt during battles. Too bad that, on balance, during the clashes all these ~niceties~ struggle to get noticed when, instead, the most significant tactical devices are resolved in using the right siege weapons at the right time (ah yes, we were forgetting, obviously it will always be possible to build new and terrifying ~war machines~) and little more, obviously never forgetting that ~numbers make strength~. But our command skills should not be used only during clashes with opposing tribes, often in fact, during the unfolding of the game scenarios we will have to face quests that RPG players will by now be all too accustomed to.Escort princesses, find treasures and thwart large and small threats will be some of the numerous submissions that we will have to face (if we want to), in first person, while our workers are working on construction sites.This is perhaps the weakest part of the game and, more than once, we wondered why the developers chose to include game sections worthy of Rages of Mages (and there we assure you that it was not meant to be a compliment). Of course, it must be said that the inclusion of these missions guarantees a certain non-linearity of the game and also helps break the pace of the game, however more than once we smiled at the paucity of the proposed ~plots~ and the lack of variety in the proposed objectives . Did the developers want to overdo it?Miscellaneous and possible. The game modes are basically three: Campaign Mode, Single Scenario and Multiplayer Mode. Of course, nothing to say about the first and second except the fact that, at least for the moment, there is no customized Scenario Editor. For the third we point out the fact that, instead of relying on the usual Netwok GameSpy, the developers of Funatics have implemented the TinCat Internet Lobby system and that it is possible to play up to 6 players simultaneously. Fortunately, given the slow dynamics of the game, it is possible to save a game even during a multi-user session and then resume it later. The audiovisual impact of the title is certainly nothing striking. Still anchored to the two dimensions (not that this is a defect!) the graphic style has remained the vaguely cartoony and very colorful one used since the first chapter. The Zoom level can be selected from three different levels of magnification but, it is difficult, you will exploit the more detailed one due to excessive pixellation (also called image graininess or ~cuby graphics that vaguely recall games developed for the Atari 2600 platform~) and more less the broader level due to the fact that, scrolling dared to snap on an Athlon XP. However, the recreated world appears alive to our eyes thanks to the numerous animations that surround all the game situations. The music is nice but will soon lead to boredom, some might say: ~fortunately there is the luxurious CD-Bonus with audio tracks~. Too bad that the music, except for the mere audiophile quality, always seems to be the same and that the game will invariably stop every few minutes to reposition itself on the only track provided for the current scenario. And we assure you that a scenario can last hours. The Audio effects are decidedly well done in terms of sonic cleanliness and their characterization, a pity that, like the music, they are not very varied. A nice treat, which cannot fail to please all the Vikings tuned into our frequencies, is the fact that, directly during the game phases, it will be possible to consult at any time a rich and in-depth Multimedia encyclopaedia on Nordic history and traditions that act as a BackGround to the events of the game. My name is Guybrusk Trelegni and when I grow up I want to be a Viking! The game is decidedly cared for however, although dotted with a myriad of small great details, the title does not prove to be particularly original and innovative (after all, the four chapters of ~The Settlers~ are there to watch us). However, it must be recognized that those looking for a Strategic title (reminding you, once again, that with Strategic I do not mean only Strategic) with a complex and deep gameplay does not have many alternatives currently on the market and that, therefore, this title could really do at the his case. For all the others, however, I can't fail to point out that Cultures 2 risks disappointing RTS fans due to the rather approximate (if not chaotic) management of armed clashes and the complexity of all the other game mechanics. And it risks leaving even managerial enthusiasts dumbfounded, who will find themselves having to manage a war section that proves to be, in any case, fundamental for the achievement of our objectives. The technical aspect of the title unfortunately does not prove to be in step with the times but, in works of this kind, this is still the lesser of evils. Certainly more significant is the fact that the control interface needs a lot of training to be fully understood and appreciated. The icons on the screen are few and not always understandable at first glance, moreover the designers have relied heavily on the use of keyboard shortcuts worthy of a flight simulator in number and complexity. However, it must be said that the game proved to be, at least on the test system, extremely stable and for this we must applaud the programmers, in a period in which many titles, even before coming out on the shelves, already have a Patch ready on their website download ... Paradoxically, therefore, we can say that while including elements of many of the genres most loved by PC owners, ~Cultures 2: Gates of Asgard~ risks turning out to be a niche title by not offering, among other things, anything significantly innovative. By the way of Asgard. After the emergence of the newhe current of thought that wants to revive the RTS genre leaving the management of resources and their exploitation in the background, instead focusing most of the player's attention on the strategy of the clashes, Funatics seeks a return to the origins by proposing a new chapter of Cultures, a series that since the first episode, subtitled ~The Discovery of Vinland~, made it clear how the game developers had in mind a game concept developed even years earlier by the German UbiSoft with the now famous ~The Settlers~. Not a real real-time strategy therefore, but more a ~God Game~ that winks at three other genres: that of RTS (obviously), that of strategic management and, albeit in a fairly light and unpretentious that of role-playing games. If at first glance it might seem that from such a mix of genres a complex and convoluted gameplay could be born, know that you are not very wrong. On the contrary. The introduction of Cultures 2 tells of the Viking Bjarni who, once back in his native lands, has a kind of premonitory dream: three foreigners help him fight a ferocious snake (does the name Midgard mean anything to you?) with, in the background, the menacing shadow of an imposing door. However, from the dream, it is not possible to understand if this formidable enemy will be definitively defeated and, above all, it is not possible to understand who these mysterious foreigners are. Troubled by this premonition, our Bjarni thus decides to ask the village shaman for clarifications and, from this moment on, our adventures begin in this sort of Wagnerian Europe, starting from Greenland and reaching the lands of the Middle East in search of our comrades first and, perhaps, a definitive answer to the doubts arising from the vision ...", "date": "2002-07-01", "grade": null}
