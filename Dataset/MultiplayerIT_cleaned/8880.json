However, there have been a disproportionate number of people who have loved the famous Mojang sandbox in the last two years, and it is therefore understandable the excitement of the fans at the news that a mobile version would have made it possible to always carry with you what is the most great phenomenon never born from the indie scene. Too bad that the recent Minecraft: Pocket Edition for iPhone and iPad has proved to be a burning disappointment, offering iOS users an edition so inferior in terms of content and possibilities as to completely distort what is the very spirit of the game. However, for the happiness of those who can't do without crafting and mines to discover, the Pixbits team has recently released Junk Jack, an excellent 2D sandbox born almost as a tribute to Mojang's goose that lays golden eggs, but which end has become the best building game on mobile devices, surpassing even its muse on this platform. Born to craft The developer duo behind the Pixbits team has never hidden that they drew heavily from Minecraft, and in fact Junk Jack compresses almost everything a fan of the game would expect into two dimensions. Thrown into a procedurally generated world that expands in depth, the player finds the first and biggest obstacle in the sense of confusion. Having no well-defined purpose or other characters to interact with, the only thing he can do is start digging, breaking logs and collecting all the collected resources and minerals. But it's enough to get lost for the first time in a dark mine or be attacked by the creatures of the night to understand that you have to roll up your sleeves and act differently. And this is where the articulated crafting system takes over, an unforgivable lack in the Pocket Edition of Minecraft and the central fulcrum of the experience offered by Junk Jack. Taking advantage of a 3x3 grid, the player can separate materials at his disposal or combine some elements collected to build other objects and tools: and here two pieces of wood can be obtained from a block of wood, which in turn are useful for creating torches if combined together to some coal; in the same way you can get spades, shovels and hammers to help you mine, swords to fight creatures, or anvils, work tables and a forge to work other tools. Continuing to collect materials, to cut down trees and dig, you can find many secret ~recipes~ to build new tools and objects, and although the 2D structure significantly limits the player's creativity, with the right dedication and a little originality you can take great satisfaction. Obviously provided you have a lot of patience and a lot of free time, as the collection of resources and the construction of objects soon becomes a routine that is not at all suitable for those looking for instant gratification, although the list of objectives on Game Center may represent a tiny short-term incentive. Then night falls, and things go badly: a series of creatures begin to appear in the darkest places on the map, forcing the player to place a series of torches and take shelter in the brightest areas, at least until he has been able to build a house. However, it must be said that, although they can be annoying, these little monsters are neither original nor dangerous like a Creeper, and even if new mobs will be introduced with the next updates, for now you can be sure that no one will blow you up together with the two-room apartment with terrace that you had just built. ...and now? Junk Jack is certainly not the first experiment aimed at re-producing the mechanics of Minecraft in 2D, but compared to the better known Terraria it demonstrates a decidedly superior aesthetic care and coherence, despite being compressed on the small screen of a mobile device. With his cigarette and yellow hard hat, Jack has a lot of personality, and it's a pleasure to see him bouncing around a plain drawn with great pixel art. The lighting effects of the fire are also extremely successful, as is the gradual darkening of the scenario as the sun goes down and the first stars of the night appear, while the catchy chiptune theme created by Bright Primate pleasantly accompanies your adventure. In short, the game looks really good, and the only real initial shock is the total lack of direction to take, someone or something to take you by the hand and tell you what to do. Minecraft manages to overcome this sense of disorientation once you start sharing a persistent worldyou with other people online. Players begin to interact, collaborate, give themselves rules and create their own adventure, all possibilities that in Junk Jack are precluded by the total lack of any multiplayer component. The developers have already stated that the next updates will introduce a whole series of innovations related to breeding, cooking and quests, but until then Junk Jack remains a sandbox recommended especially for those who feel the lack of a deep crafting experience on their own iPhones. Let's hope that between one update and another Pixbits doesn't forget to make the game compatible also for iPad: as it's easy to imagine, in a Minecraft-like game you find yourself tapping on the touchscreen all the time to dig the ground and break blocks , but the small size of the screen ends up irreparably weighing on the usability of the interface, so much so that too often you hit your character instead of the block behind him, or you encounter difficulties in dragging objects within the inventory. Paradoxically, the game is much more enjoyable when played in full screen on the iPad, although at the moment there is no possibility of sharing the same world between one device and another. However, those who find a single game world too limiting can create up to three different ones and carry them forward in parallel by sharing the same inventory.
