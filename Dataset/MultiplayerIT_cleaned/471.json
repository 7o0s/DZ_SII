{"name": "Super Princess Peach", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-princess-peach-2.html", "text": "Emotional women Here are the four emotions that Peach can use to continue in the game.Joy: with this emotion the protagonist can perform a vortex to sweep away any mists or able to literally make her fly.Anger: like any self-respecting woman, even Peach becomes fearsome and dangerous when she gets angry. With this emotion it is possible to burn wooden bridges or melt ice.Sadness: this emotion allows us to put out fires and make plants grow, but also to run at double speed.Calm: triggering this last state, the life of our damsel will recharge over time. For the power of the push-up!!! Well gentlemen, here we are. For once Nintendo reverses the roles of its protagonists, relegating the good Mario to the appearance part and raising the beautiful princess Peach to the role of heroine, who will have to jump far and wide across Emotionland in order to save the mustachioed plumber and his gang. The regal blonde soon finds help in a talking umbrella with mysterious powers, capable of protecting the beautiful Peach as well as giving her a series of varied attacks with which to hit enemies, or else she ends up collecting them and then absorbing them. Sucking in the unfortunate person on duty will only recharge the emotion meter, nothing more than the bar that the princess will draw on whenever she wants to vent her emotions. Four emotions to be precise, which can be activated at any time via the touch screen and with decidedly distinct peculiarities. With these skills the player can juggle by interacting with certain points of the level, or by enhancing certain characteristics of our alter ego, such as running and jumping, or, again, by recharging the lost life. Here you can hear the first crunches of a game artfully packaged to relax the player. Nintendo has built for Peach a whole series of moves and skills capable of making the blonde damsel almost immortal. The princess will be able to hit the enemy from afar, correct each jump with more than one skill, recover life using emotions and recharge the emotion meter by gobbling enemies. If the Kyoto colossus had equipped the blonde not only with the aforementioned arsenal, but also with a katana, this would have seemed more like the Kill Bill tie-in than the game dedicated to Peach.

Women du du du, looking for trouble It is logical that certain skills also damage the level design itself, which is still able to give some truly significant pearls. The possibility granted to Peach to fly, albeit for a certain time, in our opinion invalidates the experience, as it puts the player in the position to correct every wrong jump rather than going to find secrets in Emotionland. Technically, the Nintendo game dresses the two screens of the precious laptop in a finely finished 2D, with bright colors that intertwine and exchange with decidedly softer shades depending on the setting and situation. In fact, during each level there will be many reasons to sift through, from mini-games and puzzle pieces, from members of the Toad family to unlockable music tracks. The mini-games manage to dust the touch screen of the Nintendo portable console, otherwise relegated to the modest use of emotions or to act as a driving force for the encounter of each of the bosses present in the game. Finally, there is a shop in which to buy new skills for Peach as well as a whole series of power ups.

In this regard, a little more had to be done to shake off the various game levels of that feeling of deja vu that permeates the whole experience. Many, too many clichs dusted off to assemble this platform which, apparently, struggles to offer something really new. Comment Super Princess Peach is a decent platformer, unfortunately nothing more. The little princess jumps, moves by wiggling her voluminous skirt, waving her umbrella like a rolling pin without fully convincing. And to say that the basics would not be lacking, as well as attempts to implement new ideas to give life to a game that otherwise tends to be flat. Too bad that the final result is a title that is not able to generate a challenge, especially if played by those who, with platformers, don't like itzze. Therefore dedicated to those who want to approach this difficult genre without having to suffer too much to be able to progress in the game and without the nightmare of getting stuck in a certain level. Crystal clear that the honor of being Nintendo also brings burdens, burdens that especially in a platform generate a certain type of expectations. Unfortunately this time they were not all respected. Pros Technically neat. Lots of things to unlock. Suitable for newcomers to the genre. Cons Too easy. Underutilized touch screen. Feeling of deja vu almost always present. Let's make a collective effort. Let's try to go back in time. Let's say, in spans, about thirty years old. Here we are? Okay. Now let's shed light on a possible individual, just like in the theatre. Wrinkled jacket, crumpled shirt and a file that, guess what, should weigh more than the individual himself. Messy, reckless and awkward, the little man makes us sharers in his enlightenment. This man has an idea, he has a video game in mind. A video game, what would that be? This man has in mind a game with, as the protagonist, a common plumber, with a common air and a commonly Italian name. This man has in mind a game with a plumber who passes through pipes, jumping over turtles and eating mushrooms. Wouldn't you like to call this individual crazy? Of course, in hindsight it comes to calling the writer crazy, but thinking about it, the idea that has always driven the most famous game ever is so crazy as to be, on balance, brilliant. Nintendo has thought of putting its platform bomber on the bench for once, leaving its better half the burden of jumping on turtles, passing through pipes and eating mushrooms", "date": "2006-06-07", "grade": null}
