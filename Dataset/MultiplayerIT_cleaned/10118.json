The new Capcom work has been programmed and designed with a technological barrier calibrated to 8 bit, with the same graphic and sound capabilities of the dear old NES titles of the time. A bit like what happened with the last chapter of Mega Man appreciated on Wii Ware, Dark Void Zero proposes a bitmap graphics with extraordinarily large pixels, a color palette limited to a few tens of nuances and a soundtrack made up of midi we were no longer used to: poetry and nostalgia. Who but Capcom could develop such a game? Underneath this science-fiction adventure hides a platform at times similar to the old Metroids, with a sprinkling of Castlevania and the alien atmospheres of the beautiful Journey to Silius. Dark Void Zero is a prequel to what will happen later in the events narrated in the chapter released on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, in which William Augustus Grey, flying over the Bermuda triangle with his plane, will be sucked into the parallel dimension of the ~Void~ and put in charge of the human resistance against the ~Guardians~. The Aliens are ready to invade the earth through dimensional portals: so far unstable, one has finally been created that will allow them to invade, the X portal. The leader of the resistance Nikola Tesla has called Rusty, the protagonist of this chapter born in Void, on a suicidal mission to penetrate the X Portal and annihilate it before alien forces can use it to their advantage. Messages and directions from Tesla constantly appear on the screen to provide us with directions, information and new missions. The game screen is the lower one, while the one above is used to view the huge map that develops in every direction, just like any good Castlevania teaches us. Our task is to find the three command codes necessary to close the portal forever, a difficult mission because the devices have been separated and scattered in as many desolate valleys full of sentinels and Guardians. Kid Icarus put on the Jet Pack The gameplay of Dark Void Zero incorporates the best classics of the 8 Bit era: Kid Icarus for the platform action, Metroid for the settings and Castlevania for the ~open~ structure of the levels, developed both horizontally and vertically. Just like in the original Dark Void for home consoles, also in the DSi Zero we can wear a Jet Pack to fly and reach otherwise inaccessible points. Backtracking is present but challenging, never frustrating. Through the Jet Pack and more powerful weapons we can access entire areas hidden by walls or natural obstacles too high to be overcome simply with one's own legs. The real challenge, more than anything else, is to keep the power-ups as we can lose them by passing through some electrified areas. There are no saves that allow you to resume the game at a later time (unless you close the Nintendo DS chassis to put it on standby, of course!) and consequently the game must be completed in one go. Dark Void Zero is designed to be played and finished in one go: the obviously limited budget for its development and the low selling price (500 points) did not allow the creation of a deep and complex title like some titles of the same genre on cartridge (the legendary Metroids for Game Boy Advance above all). In the open world of Dark Void Zero there are numerous regeneration chambers that function as checkpoints from which you can restart, obviously with the penalty of losing a life every time the energy meter drops to zero. Just like the older platform-action titles from the NES era, this one too relies heavily on memorizing enemies and their movement and fire ~patterns~. Once you learn all of the Guardian locations, collectable orbs, cards to open doors, and weapon upgrades needed to break down barriers and proceed, the game will be completed with ease. The plot and the world of Dark Void are terribly attractive and well characterized on paper and above all in the main console adventure to which this chapter is linked, but on the DSi it is a secondary element that is not well developed: hints, cross-references and very few explanations on the nature, origin and development of theVoid and human resistance. Those expecting a title with the depth of a Castlevania or the breadth of Metroid will inevitably be disappointed, but those looking for an excellent challenge that is very reminiscent of the aforementioned games but with its own marked originality and gameplay will consider those 500 points as the best spent so far on DSi Ware.", "date": "2010-03-25", "grade": "8.2"}
