{"name": "Nioh 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nioh-2-recensione.html", "text": "Writing the Nioh 2 review should appear to be an easy task. On the other hand, we've talked a lot about it in the past few months, thanks both to the demos made available on the PlayStation Store and following the many hands-on sessions we've had the opportunity to do behind closed doors. When we started playing Nioh 2 about ten days ago, we were therefore quite convinced that we knew broadly what awaited us. However, reality has turned out to be much more bitter and punitive, putting us on more than one occasion in front of the doubt of having to do with a ~wrong~ game from the point of view of wickedness. After about sixty hours and an indefinable number of deaths (most during the very first missions), however, we have ~grown~ to the point of understanding which direction the title has taken and what future it can possibly give to itself and to the genre of reference . If it is true that for months we have told you about a game similar to the progenitor only in appearance, in reality Nioh 2 returns to the fold over time, remembers who it was and avoids getting lost, finding the right path one step away from eternal damnation. a bit like the feudal Japan it tries to tell. An unnecessarily important story The narrative aspect has never been the basis of Nioh. Even the first chapter, omitting references to the real history of Japan, staged a totally revisited world, in which a story invented from scratch and which developed over the course of a few years took hold. The second chapter begins fifty years earlier than the original and develops over an extremely long period of time, putting on the plate a country devastated by the presence of Yokai demons. More or less set aside William, Nioh 2 gives the player the possibility to create your own character with a vast editor full of options, which in some cases reminded us of MMOs along the lines of Black Desert Online. Once we have chosen the gender and appearance of our alter ego, we are automatically catapulted into the middle of a war already underway, within which we will be able to move the bar of victory. After discovering that we are half-bloods, born of a human father and a yokai mother, we decide to join forces with Tokichiro: a merchant of soul stones. From this moment on, a very long campaign opens which, for veterans of the series, it will remind too much of that of the original. The story is divided into missions that you can choose from the general map of the country, which is itself divided into regions. We can't (and we don't want to) reveal the number of regions or the main missions, but we are confident that the Nioh campaign alone can easily take you away thirty-five to forty hours of gameplay, without getting lost in too many frills. This estimate obviously does not take into account the ability of the players, the time spent managing their build or at the conclusion of the infinite number of side missions present. This is why, although already aware of the many contents, Nioh 2 even manages to surpass its predecessor and, from the point of view of the endgame, we reserve the right to be able to talk about it again in a few days. We reiterate how it is useless and specious to expect a plot with excellent writing and inspired direction. Net of some certainly interesting scenes, one cannot deny a fairly evident detachment of some events, with the particular lack of justification in various areas, both strictly logical and even just for reading the passage of time on the faces of some protagonists. Despite this, the campaign remains pleasant and inspired and overall remains one of the points in favor of this Nioh 2 compared to its past. Finally, it is difficult to try to think about its future, also aware of its prequel nature and of how the upcoming DLCs will in turn precede the game's plot. Different but same gameplay In the past months we have focused several times on how much the feeling of Nioh 2 appeared different from the original. Despite being its carbon copy in terms of structure and interface, pad in hand, the experience felt profoundly different, with a heavy emphasis on the technicality of counterattack and timing. After many hours of gameplay we are ready to review what was said above and to assume the responsibility of stating that it is not exactly so. Let's start from an awareness: Nioh 2 is brutal, more than the first and more than the average of games of its genre. Although this assumption is the one on which the judgment was based even three years ago, this time the statement reaches previously unexplored peaks. The ten days in the company of Nioh 2 led us to confront cNot many colleagues, especially during the first hours, all doubtful about the nature of the game balance, apparently incomprehensible. We would like it to be as clear as possible to anyone who approaches the title, that the first region of Nioh 2 is also absolutely the most insidious. This is due to several aspects, which then represent the core of the game and also some of its major strengths and weaknesses. As we know Nioh chooses to put the player in front of several separate missions, rather than a single open world. It is possible to choose which one to face, between main and secondary ones, from a handy map of the country. Each adventure responds to a specific objective and the developers have well thought out to include a recommended level for each of them. In the early stages of the game this advice seems totally unlikely, leading even the most experienced player to believe that he has totally forgotten how to deal with a title of this genre. The historical location of the campaign has prompted the Ninja Team to disseminate the game world of yokai demons, placed here and there as if they were normal human beings, forgetting however to facilitate the player with a series of tools that are unlocked during the game, when moreover, one now has the right experience to try to get by at best. As absurd as our statement seems, what is really incomprehensible is the wall of difficulty that the game presents in its first phase. To be honest, it is as if the team had forgotten to balance the game based on the player's experience and that the classic increase in difficulty also in relation to experience and the greater amount of objects available has been totally forgotten, leading to believe you are facing an impossible game. We are very keen to clarify this aspect because we would not want many to feel dejected to the point of abandoning the boat, although we understand that in some situations we will really wonder if the frustration is not reaching that lack of fun that transforms the challenge from satisfying to unjustified . Once this big limit has been overcome, what remains is instead a title profoundly similar to its predecessor, which blends the system so dear to souls-like with a loot finding dynamics approachable to Diablo-like action RPGs. Running around Japan means killing a disproportionate amount of samurai and demons, collecting an immoderate amount of equipment and objects, giving life to a loop capable of creating addiction, which collides only and exclusively with the same problem of the original: the balancing of experience. In fact, growth in Nioh 2 takes place according to two main criteria: the first is linked to finding amrita, which is useful for leveling up at the various shrines scattered throughout the maps. Each of the characteristics that can be increased corresponds to a parameter of the statistics of our alter ego, as well as the improvement in the use of a certain type of weapon or skill. If it is true that this aspect remains unchanged, the same cannot be said for what concerns the use of weapons, ninjutsu and magic. In this second chapter you will accumulate points to spend in the different categories only and only by using those same objects. This means that, if during your adventure you have decided to dedicate yourself to the Kusarigama, you will promptly unlock points relating to that specific category of weapon, leaving the others totally aside. Once a point has been obtained, it will be possible to open a screen very similar to the spherography of the old Final Fantasy X or, better to say, to the simplified one of the fifteenth chapter and assign the point learned to a specific skill. This choice has convinced us as far as specialization is concerned, leading us to avoid waste and to channel our forces in the most suitable direction, but it has left us deeply dumbfounded in other respects. One of all is the total lack of a visual indicator that gives an idea of the approaching or not of the unlocking of a new point to spend. This is especially a problem given the amount of skills available. To give you an idea, we spent a good 90% of experience using a single weapon category, acquiring perhaps half of the available skills. This aspect is amplified even more when it comes to magic and ninjutsu, which tend to have skills on which to spend further points to increase in rank. Lots of irons on the fire and an amount of hours to grow to the maximum that we can't even quantify. Just about the weapons it is right to make it clear that the impressionsreceived in the previous months were confirmed to be correct. Despite the many different categories, there is no doubt that kusarigama on the one hand - for those who prefer a fast and magical build - and odachi on the other - for those who want to go with brute power - still remain the two most congenial solutions today. These are accompanied only by the classic katana, which allows you to find a fair balance between the two. For the rest, it seems almost superfluous to point out the usual classic characteristics of the genre, as well as of the first Nioh. On the one hand the possibility of dying and returning to life at the nearest shrine - keeping the accumulated equipment but losing amrita and demonic power; on the other hand, the possibility of summoning both NPCs built ad hoc by the development team and switching from the menu dedicated to the sanctuary, thus being able to get organized with one's friends. Expeditions are also back, or rather real missions launched in a cooperative which, if on the one hand they allow you to rest and use the sanctuaries without resetting the enemies in the area, on the other hand they require the management of an assistance bar. This is emptied as players die during the mission, up to the total gameover which will always require you to start the expedition over. By killing the strongest enemies or performing specific actions it will be possible to fill the bar again, thus increasing one's chances of survival. Although this mechanic, already tested in the original, finds a logic in the desire to avoid lowering the degree of challenge too much, it tends to put psychological pressure on the players which does not always result in fun. This happens especially when it comes to tackling the so-called twilight missions: modified versions of the normal tasks that become even more difficult when it comes to the endgame and the entire progression is totally modified, essentially restarting the entire game. As mentioned, we will return to this aspect later. Mudblood and explosive counterattack A separate paragraph requires the new mechanics which is, without a doubt, the only big change compared to the past. Being born from the union of a human being and a demon has given us the double possibility of coming into contact with both positive spirits and our own demonic side. The initial choice of the spirit will determine - until you decide to change it with one of the many available - the nature of the demon connected to it and therefore the form into which you will transform once activated. Brute, ferocious and ghost: these are the three main types, each managed with a different aesthetic, mobility and attitude. Although this aspect already seems important enough, however, it is the cores of soul and the explosive counterattack that really make the difference. The former are nothing more than technical specifications copied from the yokai that we will meet in the course of the adventure and which can be applied to the spirit to increase its parameters and to be used as attacks in battle. Each of these will require a specific number of attunement points, which will be deducted from the total that the equipped spirit is able to sustain. Furthermore, each attack will require a cost to be used, which will download the third of the bars in play: the soul. Hitting and killing opponents, as well as performing final blows, will recharge the soul bar, allowing you to reuse demonic abilities Each of these skills is called up by combining the R2 key with one of the four front keys of the dualshock. The only exception concerns the circle, which is instead entrusted to the explosive counterattack. The latter represents the main companion of every Nioh 2 player and is also the technique that enters rightfully among the first things to master, alongside the already known ki rhythm. For those who have not played the first Nioh and have no idea what this last mentioned feature is, it can simply be enclosed in the concept of stamina recovery. Each time you land a series of hits, a shimmer on the protagonist and a bright coloration will briefly fill a portion of the stamina bar used to attack. By pressing R1 at the right time it will therefore be possible to recover some of the effort spent, allowing you to inflict more consecutive blows before being forced to fall back to recover from the effort. The explosive counterattack is instead a demonic technique also totally based on timing and useful to turn the tide of battles against a large number of opponents, especially yokai.
