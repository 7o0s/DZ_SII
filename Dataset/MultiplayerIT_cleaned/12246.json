{"name": "Wild Life 2: Crazy Zoo - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wild-life-2-crazy-zoo-recensione.html", "text": "Sharing Spending millions on animals is nice, but we are not philanthropists and we don't have Bill Gates' patrimony... the money runs out and we need to be able to get more. This is why it is important to learn how to manage the coffers of our little earthly paradise with electric fences, but without Bonolis and Laurenti, to avoid seeing everything sink. We need to open the park to the public and hope for a large turnout! Depending on the finances available, it will be necessary to choose how to advertise and, therefore, open the doors to children and their parents. Is everything okay? These useless little creatures are here to spend all their money. And who are we to stop them? It's important to create a path through the park so that guests can follow it and then distribute the various buildable shops to entice them to shop. The prices of the individual shops can be increased or decreased if necessary, as well as those of all the lucrative activities of the park (from the entrance ticket to that of the toilet). The more people we have managed to reach with marketing, the more visitors there will be; the more visitors there will be, the more needs we will have to welcome and satisfy. In short, the park will be embellished with statues, bridges, binoculars to observe the panorama or to see the animals more closely, internal paths to the enclosures of the more docile animals and, above all, with baskets. It's from Theme Park that we fill parks with bins because guests are pigs who love to throw everything on the ground. Is the bin 10cm from the kiosk? Secured ground charter. Maybe the lions' cage could be opened and some visitors fed to them. But let's not digress. Unfortunately the developers have decided not to make this option available and we adapt. Coupling From a technical point of view, Wildlife Park 2: Crazy Zoo is quite poor, with models poor in detail and textures that are rather washed out and stretched. The buildings are the best part of the production, but the animals and especially their animations are unwatchable. It's not easy to animate so many species convincingly, but the humans here also leave a lot to be desired and smell of wood in every animation frame. Well, at least all these limits guarantee perfect fluidity even on low-end computers, even if, when you try to explore a park assuming the role of visitor, the show isn't the best and you don't get any satisfaction from observing the various attractions. The soundtrack is better, made up of tunes with a vague African flavor and the reproduction of the sounds of all the animals. Nothing transcendental, but manages to guarantee a minimum of atmosphere. Wildlife Park 2: Crazy Zoo isn't a bad game, but it's just plain bland. The mechanics that regulate it are quite elementary and satisfying all the objectives is just a matter of money and building the right structure at the right time. Needs do not intertwine with each other and, once fulfilled, they tend to become secondary, making everything all too easy. Expanding a park is only a matter of time rather than commitment and management skills and, once the superficiality of the mechanism is understood, there will be no reasons capable of making you try the enterprise again. The missions, thirty in all, allow you to slightly extend the longevity of the title. These do not shine for originality (save the animal A, heal the animal B and so on) and scroll rather quickly. Let's say that we finished the twenty of the base game in an afternoon of play, while the ten more demanding ones of the expansion required an additional afternoon. Fortunately, the expansion adds several ingredients to the soup, giving it a better flavor than that of the base game: new infrastructure, new animals, some interesting objectives and a campaign as long as the main one. In short, not bad for a simple extra pack. Apathy Something more could have been done in all sectors, in order to make the various subsections of which the game is composed more interesting. In short, taking more care of the visual aspect would certainly have made the virtual tours of the park more interesting; more than animals, those in the enclosures look like articulated plush puppets and actually this mode immediately loses interest because it offers nothing to do. The same goes for the management side: why not think of different levels of difficulty to make the product challenging even for the most expert players? Everything seems to have been designed to guarantee full control of the situation even for a child, but some simplifications are excessive even for lovers of ~easy at all costs~. After all, management software is a genre that, when theredeprived of the depth that should be his own, he easily flows into mediocrity, suddenly losing interest within a few games. Yet it is enough to look at games from a few years ago (think of the various Bullfrog masterpieces such as Theme Park or Theme Hospital) to realize that it is possible to create gameplay accessible to everyone, without sacrificing oneself on the altar of flattening. It's bad to finish a game and uninstall it without trying anything. System requirements Nothing relevant to report except that both products (the base game plus the expansion) are protected with the Starforce system. It hasn't given us any problems, but we warn you because we are aware that many of you do not like some of its possible harmful effects. Minimum Requirements: Processor: Intel Pentium 4 2 GHz or equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card compatible with DirectX 8.1 and with Pixel-Shader 1.1 support Disk Space: 1,5 GB DirectX 8.1 DVD Player Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment In reality there is little to say. We recommend it if you have young children, who will surely find it fun. If you are an experienced player forget it, it is not for you and look elsewhere. But perhaps you are passionate about ethology and then you might as well take a look at it. But be careful, because it leaves substantially indifferent. Pros The initial feeling is good Building a park is fun The expansion included in the offer is excellent Cons The graphics engine is ugly Elementary game mechanics It gets boring quickly Wildlife Park 2: Crazy Zoo is a zoo-themed management game in which we will have to learn everything about biological parks and the needs of animals, as well as those of the ever-present visitors. We will be able to take part in the classic free mode, or face the twenty missions, plus the ten of the Crazy Zoo expansion, which make up the two campaigns. However, these are unrelated missions that do not follow a narrative thread and, therefore, it is possible to speak of a campaign only because the previous ones must be completed to unlock the advanced missions. But what needs do virtual pets have? Well, first of all they must be placed in a pleasant habitat that favors their mood (yes, there is a mood meter of animals, plants and people complete with different ~smiles~ that indicate different moods), then they must be fed properly and, finally, they must be entertained so as not to leave them starved. Everything translates into building a more or less large enclosure depending on the species to be looked after, in making the land suitable for the animal's requests, requests visible by clicking on the animal itself, in placing bowls of favorite food and, finally, in building structures of entertainment such as stones, platforms, poles, swimming pools. To better manage everything, it is necessary to equip the park with suitable personnel, so workers will have to be hired for the maintenance of the fences and structures, caretakers who fill the bowls of food and water, doctors who take care of the dear little animals and so on. Street. To ensure that all animals are always fed and fit, facilities will need to be built to produce food and water. All of this costs money, and the running costs aren't forgiving. But what wouldn't you do to see an ostracized protorabbit from Asia Minor smile? Once you have a certain balance with animals and their management, you need to start thinking seriously about business.", "date": "2007-05-29", "grade": null}
