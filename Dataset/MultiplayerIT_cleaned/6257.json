While the first news on the next chapter arrived just in the days leading up to E3, according to Konami there was further news for football: the arrival of PES Club Manager on Android and iOS, a new attempt by the Japanese publisher to exploit the importance of its famous brand also within this market. It should be noted that the title we are dealing with today was also one of the first to arrive after the company's announcement that it wanted to concentrate its activities in the field of games for smartphones and tablets, defined as ~main platforms~ by the new CEO Hideki Hayakawa. One more reason to look at this game with some interest, to understand if Konami will already be able to give us a valid pastime to take care of football even when we are on the bus or on the subway: even if there is certainly no shortage of alternatives, let's find out Together. Let's build the team of our dreams on mobile too, thanks to PES Club Manager! Start from scratch If the PES Master League is one of your favorite game modes, in PES Club Manager you will find yourself faced with something similar. After choosing things such as the name of the team, its symbol and the shirts with which our players will take the field, we are in fact asked to select a single player among some fairly famous names, to be included in our team together with others who instead they come from smaller teams and leagues. Once Lorenzo Insigne was chosen as a ~star~, for example, we found a squad in which the Napoli striker appeared in attack together with Nicola Pozzi, with Sampdoria's Alberto Frison instead busy defending goal. Once the first choice has been made, the actual game starts, with a welcome tutorial that shows us some of the components of PES Club Manager, for which Konami has thought of the typical structure of mobile free-to-play: everyone can access the contents without paying one euro, but by spending real money you can instead get game items faster. At the center of this mechanism we find the PES Coins, a currency with which we can ask our scouts to report players of a certain level to us through a mechanism similar to that of the ~bags~, eventually engaging the players with the fantamillions available to our company. The latter can also be spent on the market, by participating in auctions that are opened cyclically to avoid touching PES Coins: contrary to expectations, it is not possible to sell one's redundant players in the same way. Together with the purchasing campaign, the management of the company also includes a part dedicated to sponsors and television rights, thanks to which you can get money by hitting certain goals. But the real heart of the company is the headquarters, where we can build various buildings with which to obtain increasing bonuses according to the levels, for example by earning points to spend to improve the form or motivation of the players, or by creating a network of observers who can show us best players to invest in in the transfer market. The various buildings are set up by investing the company's money, possibly using the PES Coins to speed up their completion, which otherwise is achieved after playing a certain number of games. A Fox as a friend After the management phase comes the one dedicated to matches, for which according to Konami an optimized version of the Fox Engine used for PES 2015. What we can tell you is that from the latter PES Club Manager inherits some very nice matches to watch, with convincing animations that give life to always different actions. The most famous footballers can enjoy their ~real~ face, which we also find when choosing training in a few fairly simple steps. In case you get tired of the 3D engine, you can also resort to the 2D simulation, with the classic dots representing the players on the field, or a mixed mode that activates the three dimensions only in key actions. As regards the possibilities offered to us coaches, PES Club Manager allows you to establish some game indications before the match, then moving on to the real-time phase in which to continue talking to our eleven, asking for example to look for the attacking flanks rather than than the central lanes, or to adopt a different level of aggression in defending: from what we have seen, the team seems to react quite correctly to the indications. The audio componentof the match stops at the sound effects of the stadium only, without therefore proposing a commentary, while an inevitable soundtrack is present in the menus.", "date": "2015-06-15", "grade": "6.5"}
