This time it was poor Koji Igarashi who paid the price, the father of one of the most popular action series ever, and so the development of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow was entrusted to the Madrid-based Mercury Steam team under the supervision of Kojima Production, for a new experiment in three dimensions of a saga that has never had success or flattering votes in this configuration and which precisely with Lords of Shadow represents a reboot, from different points of view. Werewolves in three dimensions The elements that recall the historical chapters of the saga can be found in the initial Mercury Steam logo, in the typology of some enemies, in references to the story and in the game ending. This is to say that the points of contact or familiarity with the brand that everyone knows are relatively few, and the title in its three-dimensional transposition has become an action/adventure that offers a high mix of factors that perhaps individually we have been able to appreciate in the various God of War and Darksiders, but also in Uncharted and if we want Shadow of the Colossus. The view is obviously in third person with the semi-fixed camera managed entirely by artificial intelligence while the protagonist of this episode is Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light who is in search of the Lords of Shadow in an attempt to take revenge and reunite with his beloved Marie, brutally killed in his sleep. The adventure then unfolds through twelve chapters divided in turn into sections at the end of which an evaluation of all the objects and experience points acquired is given. Precisely the latter represent the main way to increase Gabriel's skills: in fact, they are obtained by having the better of enemies and can be spent to buy new skills through a special menu that can be reached using the select key. The main protagonist does not have levels in any case, but for more than half of the adventure he continues to acquire new items and upgrades that allow him to access new abilities or have access to unreachable locations, such as the arm of the shadow rather than boots to cover distances faster. The combination of the above elements allows for a rather interesting combat system, where alongside the classic light and powerful blows of the Gabriel's cross we have the magic of light and that of shadow, which represent the elements of greater distinction. Activated respectively using the L1 and R1 keys, these spells envelop Gabriel in a blue or red light: in the first case the protagonist can gain vital energy after each hit scored, in the second case the power of the blows is greater than normal. To replenish the appropriate energy bars there are particular fountains and moreover each enemy releases the so-called neutral spheres after each killing in normal configuration; at this point it is possible to absorb them using the L3 and R3 keys, even simultaneously. The alternation in the use of these two types of spells therefore represents the most interesting element of the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow combat system, because you have to alternate them often and willingly to avoid dying and at the same time get the better of enemies faster . There are also some bosses capable of being more or less sensitive to one or the other, a pity that they are sporadic and confined to the final stages. Beyond the fights Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a title that offers a very varied structure to support the great longevity it has. In fact, the 18/22 hours necessary to complete it offer different platform and puzzle sections, which break the rhythm properly. The former work because the control system responds well and the choices made by the developers on the keys to press are spot on, reminiscent of those of Uncharted when you often find yourself moving from one ledge to another in a harmonious way, perhaps climbing large structures or jumping from one cliff to another. The camera in this case plays in our favor by always giving wide and beautiful views to see, which increase the atmosphere and are very reminiscent of the now famous ones of the Naughty Dog jewel. The same camera instead creates some problems in other passages, because some fixed shots sometimes return ~blind~ spots that can deceive and in fact on sporadic occasions abbe wandered around empty before figuring out where to go, precisely because the camera itself was not positioned in the best way. The puzzle sections are predominant especially in the central and final part of the adventure, they usually offer environmental-type puzzles and some are decidedly interesting to solve, such as that of the music box with different gears to unlock to continue. Their variety is appreciable, but some puzzles seem to be a bit forced and we would have liked their more homogeneous distribution, especially those that necessarily require time to be solved even if the final solution is clearly known. Playstation 3 trophies Completing Castlevania: Lords of Shadow on a normal level allows you to get only 25% of the 43 available trophies, getting them all will be a real nightmare in terms of hours to spend, between finding all the available gems (including the secret ones), finishing the game at all difficulty levels and so on. The toughest trophy in terms of time involves 100% completion of each section of each chapter, a job made especially for the most hardened platinum hunters. A long and difficult adventure... Returning to the fights and after having praised some design choices, we must recognize how unfortunately the balance that made great titles such as God of War is missing, in the end even if the moves available to Gabriel Belmont are many, it is often advisable to use a very limited set . This also translates into a certain repetitiveness when for large stretches you find yourself fighting the same types of enemies, which if they are certainly not few in absolute terms, in particular they are much less. In reality, the sensation mentioned above occurs when the same practice has to be repeated too many times, such as for example that of stun a giant werewolf or a generously sized spider to get on its back and then break down a door or create a bridge with the burr of cobwebs. Having said that, there is no shortage of more fun and interesting combat sections, especially those with bosses, present in generous numbers and which allow you to alternate between different tactics and make more use of the powers at your disposal. Then there are those to the ~Shadow of the Colossus~, or giant creatures to hook and climb to find and hit the weak points. We have said that the game needs quite a few hours to be completed, it is also very replayable because each completed section can be faced again at any time together with the tests inside it to be completed, not to mention that some minor upgrades can only be achieved with the powers and items acquired in later levels of the adventure. In reality, replaying entire sections solely to find a chest that allows for example to increase the number of daggers that can be carried is not particularly exciting, better the search for gems to increase the maximum limit of the energy bar or that of spells, without count the possibility of playing the title at more advanced difficulty levels, including the one that is unlocked once it is completed. In this sense, among the extras we have the classic illustrations, which are very beautiful, a mini game that paraphrases chess and a couple of gadgets, the Solid Eye and Solid Snake's bandana, to be applied as a skin to the main protagonist. Speaking of Kojima Production we would have expected a greater collaboration under the scenic and directorial plan. For most of the adventure, on the other hand, dialogues and characters are rather frayed with each other, with some interesting insights but a little too disconnected from the rest. A pity because instead in the end the narrative part explodes from every point of view, becomes long, pleasant and opens the space to an inevitable sequel with exciting assumptions. We have not forgotten the technical sector: the artistic and technical level of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow are definitely above average; in fact, the game starts ~peacefully~ in the first sections but becomes more and more pleasant as the adventure continues, thanks to an excellent variety of settings and above all to beautiful views to see, where the artistic side and the camera help to give extremely suggestive passages and satisfying and where even from a purely technical point of view the use of colors and textures give an excellent overall impact. We then have the best things in the advanced stages of the game, with gothic castles under snow storms or structures immersed in a hot almost desert sun, in a crescendo that from certain points of view places the game among the best in the category. However, there is a ~but~ revoltto the solidity of the graphics engine, which unfortunately fails to guarantee a granite frame rate anchored to 30 frames per second, and to the absence of anti-aliasing. In fact, the programmers have chosen to enable v-sync to ensure the complete absence of tearing, on the other hand on several occasions the fluidity drops to levels that point out small jerks in more complex situations or in interlude sequences created with the game engine, without count some bugs scattered around and also related to the camera. The sound sector fails to rival the sensational one that has always accompanied the Castlevania saga, however it defends itself quite well especially in some orchestrated themes and in the dubbing (English, with the texts in Italian), while the sound effects are functional to the gameplay but without a memorable accomplishment.", "date": "2010-10-13", "grade": "8.4"}
