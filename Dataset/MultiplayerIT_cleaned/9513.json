Instead, we are faced with a title developed by the small Access Games studios completed with a modest budget and without being able to count on the boost of the thundering trumpets of large marketing campaigns, what is then the cause of this singular media case? Welcome to Twin Peaks David Lynch has already fully explained it to us: if you want to tell a compelling investigative thriller, set it in the wooded American province and season it all with a splash of paranormal. The formula made famous by the Twin Peaks series has since been extensively exploited with success and the last of these examples is precisely that Alan Wake who made his fortune from a certain use of supernatural imagery. Deadly Premonition follows even more closely the teachings of the early 90s series by exploiting its iconography with such fidelity as to make the developers' work at times a tribute to the television work. Impersonating the eccentric FBI agent Francis York Morgan (call him York) we arrived from the city to investigate a gruesome murder of a young woman that took place near a quiet American town surrounded by nature. Here York immediately comes into contact with the locals, greeted by a predictable distrust of his metropolitan attitude, but, in addition to this not exciting welcome, it immediately becomes clear that there are anomalies in that environment that seem to have a dealing only with our protagonist, while the native population appears to ignore any paranormal manifestation. During the investigation the supernatural component becomes progressively more predominant in a game of chasing each other between the real work in search of evidence and an exhausting psychological struggle that engages York in trying to unravel the most surreal mysteries behind the murder. To reach the resolution of the case it is necessary to make a commitment to devote oneself to the search for evidence, analyze suspicious scenes and find information and interrogate the locals, all activities distributed on the vast freely explorable map also rich in secondary missions and objects to collect. The area that encompasses the entire town of Greenvale and its surroundings boasts a respectable extension, so much so that it is even too dispersive when (and it often happens) we are called to cross it by car to go to the next meeting place. Not even the map of the menu comes up against this which does not offer a zoom out wide enough to offer an adequate overview and above all the driving system of the police cars which respond in a very wooden way to the commands and do not give a smooth and satisfying drive despite interesting features have been implemented such as fuel consumption and vehicle wear to always keep an eye on. Earn a (survive) living. During his stay in Greenvale, York does not only have to think about the investigation, as Deadly Premonition offers the player numerous actions not always related to the work activity of the FBI special agent. In addition to about sixty secondary missions scattered along the entire area of the map, there are places where you can fish, pick flowers, clubs and shops where you can buy food, clothing, weapons or anything else that could be useful during the adventure. There are also more ancillary activities, but which still offer a pleasant diversion from the police action such as the need to clean the clothes worn or shave to have a more presentable appearance. Each of these possibilities obviously requires an outlay of money, even if the methods to pocket easy dollars are not lacking, indeed practically every action in the game offers a monetary reward that is added to the amount of our salary that is paid to us regularly. In addition to the health of our personal finances, it is essential to keep York's health under control, represented by the canonical health bar which in turn is influenced by three other parameters, the first is the heart rate that rises when we are running, when we hold our breath in order not to be identified by enemies and when we use the car siren to go faster (?), the other two are the more canonical indicators of hunger and tiredness that are maintained respectively by eating and sleeping (or drinking coffee), it comes naturally that this differentiation in the statistics of our avatar also involves a more accurate management of the equipment from porstay close to have the necessary objects with you for every need. The investigation sessions alternate with action phases where the gameplay seems borrowed from the latest episodes of Resident Evil with York facing shooter phases, following the now archaic mechanics of aiming from a standstill against figures that closely resemble the shibito from the Siren series, also here originality does not seem to dominate too much given the repetitiveness of the enemies' appearance but in any case everything remains functional to the sick and decadent atmosphere of these sessions in stark contrast to the order and peace that the setting shows off in the phases diurnal. More frustrating is the aiming system that shows the side of too many indecisions and a tendency to the abundance of ammunition which combined with the choice to provide the player (at a normal level) with a pistol with infinite shots undermine the sense of danger and precariousness that certain situations they would like to convey. Xbox 360 goals Deadly Premonition comes with only twelve achievements to unlock...all secret! At this point, in order not to spoil the surprise, we just have to wish you a good investigation. A well written story Where Deadly Premonition gives its best is certainly in the narrative, managing to tell the mysteries that lie behind the murder case in a compelling way, offering the player called to investigate an interweaving of connections and realities behind each character. Each of the inhabitants of Greenvale has distinct physical and behavioral characteristics that are accentuated if we have to relate to them during our work, often this characterization leads to real stereotypes so as to give somewhat grotesque hues to the native population. The same thing can be said of the protagonist York who is not slow to show his eccentricity right from the start, presenting himself as an avid smoker who loves cooking and caffeine addict, in addition to the fact that throughout the adventure he has the habit of talking to himself by speaking with an (apparently) imaginary friend of his almost as if they were exchanges of views with the player himself in front of the screen. Eccentricity aside what is certain is how all these subjects have to offer important information to the investigations, some even behind their personal secrets, often hidden by over the top attitudes, can hide a fundamental contribution to the development of the story, which will gradually acquire increasingly surreal connotations up to involving the old legends of the place and also the personal story of York who, like everyone else, will have something important to tell himself. The evolution of the investigations becomes so compelling alternating between the daytime hours spent searching for and analyzing evidence and testimony and the night sessions where the special agent is forced to carry on his job facing hostiles in a dirty and sick of the symbolic places of the city (the latter sessions that can be replayed in search of clues that have previously escaped us) up to a crescendo of truly stunning twists at the end of the game. Final that comes after about twenty-five hours of play if you had to focus almost exclusively on the main missions even if we would like to advise you to take the time to deepen your knowledge of the peculiar reality of Greenvale which with its numerous anecdotes and skeletons inside the wardrobes it has a lot to offer in terms of involvement and atmosphere, your investigations will also surely benefit from it. Rural style So what is it that sparked the scandal and embarrassment of many of our colleagues when they found themselves summing up in judging Deadly Premonition? The most controversial aspect, indeed the clearly insufficient one, is precisely the visual and sound aspect. We have already mentioned how Access Games has developed this work using a modest budget, but it is undeniable from the first minutes that the aesthetics of the game are really too poor to be justified by the investment issues in the project. Deadly Premonition looks nothing more or less like a product coming out of the PS2 era with abundant aliasing on all surfaces, continuous popups and a crude and awkward polygonal modeling, as well as the animations that tend to repeat themselves too obsessively in particular in the behavior of the protagonists so to undermine the acting of the subjects on stage by inadvertently giving a sense of grotesque irony in moments that perhaps the script would require more seriousness. We need to make an effort to filter all the events lived through that artificial image of graphic decay to do justice to a story that, thatyes, it denotes a great commitment because sometimes it is not possible to understand where the citations for 80s trash movies come from and where instead the sometimes naive limits of programming lie. Everything is also aggravated by the approximate work done with the audio sector which sends the characters' lips out of sync and leaves some doubts about the choice of songs in certain particularly delicate moments. Let's be clear we are not going to do in-depth analyzes in search of the proverbial hair in the egg, here we are faced with a real technical debacle that reaches its maximum in the (long repetitive) parts of QTE seasoned chase where the developers have chosen the use of a spectacular picture in picture that lowers the video resolution and burdens the image with slowdowns, we could also do without such a poorly implemented expedient. A positive aspect lies in the highly competitive price with which the game is distributed, which at least partially lightens the weight of certain production gaps.", "date": "2011-01-21", "grade": "7.5"}
