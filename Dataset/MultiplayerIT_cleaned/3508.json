Basically it is a turn-based wargame with maps divided into hexagonal boxes. Each tile has different characteristics that affect the movement and battlefield surrender of units on it. The game consists of two campaigns, one very long and the other shorter, which put you in command of vast armies made up of fantasy troops, which include humans of various ethnic groups, monsters, mythological creatures, undead, dragons and animals. In total, between heroes and generic creatures, there are dozens of units to control or fight. The objective of the longer campaign, which is also the main one, is initially to restore luster to the clans of barbarians defeated in the battle of Wyrm Pass (for more details on the plot, read our old preview). Speaking of the background of the game, Fantasy General 2: Invasion is the direct sequel to a strategy game from the 90s, which has become a cult among fans of the genre, from which it incorporates various ideas and mechanics, while not renouncing to completely rejuvenate the interface and add something new. To move the troops, just select them and press the right mouse button on the destination box, while to attack, all you have to do is click on the enemies. The simplicity of the controls does not deceive you, because the Owned by Gravity game is much more complex than it seems. But let's proceed in order. Game structure Fantasy General 2: Invasion is divided into two sections: the general map, where you select the missions to face and spend the resources accumulated on the battlefield to improve your army, buying new troops or growing those already available, and the real missions, usually equipped with specific objectives related to our mission. At the beginning you have very few units and the first challenges are really simple: usually you have to conquer some small outpost or reach a certain point on the map to achieve victory. Things get complicated in advanced missions, when dozens of units are involved in combat (the number of deployable ones varies from mission to mission) and the objectives become more important: conquer entire cities, defend an ally in difficulty from an attack, defeat a whole enemy army and so on. al As told in a recent trial, whose contents are still valid given that the game has undergone very few changes since then, the individual units move according to the movement points they have, the terrain they are on and their intrinsic characteristics . The complexity of Fantasy General 2 is all in the multitude of parameters to be taken into consideration before each move, which greatly influence the performance of the troops on the battlefield: from morale, to the proximity of other units, to the type of terrain from which the attack and the type of terrain the unit being attacked is on. Before each conflict, the interface anticipates whether or not we will have the upper hand in combat, giving us the possibility to choose whether to proceed or to change strategy. The basic missions are all played out in a similar way: after placing the units, you have to move them one at a time per turn looking for enemies, outposts, villages, cities or places of interest, always keeping an eye on the main objectives and the counter that indicates after how many turns we will no longer get loot by raiding villages, exploring caves or performing any other action. In this way the developers have ensured that the player avoids the tactic of combing the maps and concentrates on his choices. This is a radical mechanic that greatly affects the gameplay, because it adds a lot of pressure on the first turns. It must be said that it actually works in encouraging the player not to get lost along the way. Gameplay Now imagine a game map full of troops, some stationed behind a large wall, some fighting in the open field and still others firing from the rear. A dragon burns a row of archers throwing the troops into panic in the adjacent squares, some harpies threaten druids on horseback, the heroes battle each other under the walls to conquer the area, each with its own special powers and equipment. There are several open fronts to manage at the same time, each with its own specificities to consider. Each turn you have to move all the units, trying to anticipate each time which is the best moveadvantageous. Fantasy General 2 is ruthless from this point of view and it must be said that there are no omnipotent units, although obviously there are more and less strong ones and the basic ones can be specialized by investing resources (hours, swords, armor). Hiding in the woods to ambush enemies, risking isolating the front row, trying to win by attacking head-on like rams or trying a different tactic, perhaps reloading the game in case of failure? The game system of the Owned by Gravity title is extremely versatile from the point of view of the possibilities offered to the player, which differ according to the available units, the choices made during the campaign missions, the selection of the missions themselves: don't worry about a request for help, for example, can affect relations with a certain faction which could even stop supporting us if it is too neglected. Even the plot becomes richer as you progress in the campaign, while never becoming exceptional (basically it serves to justify the battles) with the thickening of the interests at stake that lead new players to intervene in the war to try to stop the Rise of the Barbarians. To support all a good artificial intelligence that seems to know how to exploit the characteristics of the maps well and applies interesting tactics, when possible. While we cannot list all the mechanics and facets of Fantasy General 2 for purely practical reasons, we hope you understand that it is a complex title, designed for an audience of strategy lovers. Defects Unfortunately, the title of Owned by Gravity also has some flaws. The biggest one we found in Fantasy General 2 is the lack of actual briefing phases between missions, which help to understand what we will have to deal with during the task. At first you don't pay much attention, but in the later stages, when the armies become more substantial and the events more elaborate, not having even a vague idea of what the enemy forces will be can become a big headache, both in game and in the planning stage. Several times we found ourselves having to repeat missions because they were completely displaced by the enemies. On other occasions we came out alive, but at the price of huge losses that had repercussions on subsequent missions, where we didn't have enough units to survive. The solution we found was to play and replay each mission aiming for the perfect result, so as not to lose precious units, using the first attempts as if they were a kind of briefing. Another side effect of the initial blindness in battle is that it becomes almost counterproductive to conserve the resources accumulated during missions. Indeed, sometimes it is advisable to replay the latter even if only to obtain something that has been lost along the way, which can then be spent to upgrade the units owned or hire new ones. The logic of Owned by Gravity's choice not to give too much information before battles is clear: in this way the progression is slower and more reasoned, as well as global, in the sense that the army must be carefully looked after since you only have few units, with the large-scale battles of the final missions becoming the culmination of the entire campaign and not just the pleasant events unrelated to everything else. However, it is true that in some situations this choice proves frustrating, because one ends up either making mistakes unknowingly, or proceeding very slowly, with the gameplay being a bit distorted. Not that we were asking for the rhythms of an action game, but scanning the maps box by box to avoid mistakes, at the risk of losing loot, isn't exactly the best. For the rest it is easy to see that Fantasy General 2 is not a pharaonic production. The graphics engine does its job, the variety of troops is there, the special effects are good, but the fighting animations aren't exceptional, while all the side elements are spared. After all, it is certainly not from this that a strategic game of this kind is judged, so we imagine that enthusiasts will not even notice it, taken as they will be to move their immense armies.", "date": "2019-09-05", "grade": "8.3"}
