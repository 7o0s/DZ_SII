The visual impact with Alexander is noteworthy; details, right from the first game menus, are extremely accurate. The game modes present suggest the desire to give the title a good longevity. Nothing is missing, from the more classic single player modes that include campaigns, skirmishes and single games on maps chosen by the player, to multiplayer modes on official servers and connected on private servers. Once the optimal configuration is set compatibly with the hardware of the machine, you can dive into the heart of the action in no time at all. The player who wants to fully experience the game will be tempted by the campaign, divided into chapters, which proposes to relive the story of the Great Alexander by playing the role of the young Greek hero. Greater Greece The actual game appears after a short loading and here are the bright colors that reproduce the magnificence of the ancient Greek civilization. It is easy to understand that the game before us belongs to the genre of the classic old school strategy, in which the construction and management of cities are the masters, real headquarters of the armies, whose sole purpose is to produce units and upgrades. Everything revolves around the figure of the hero (Alessandro in the first campaign) who represents the first and constant objective of each mission as he cannot in any way perish under the blows of the enemies. The presence of the hero on the battlefield therefore represents a factor of danger, on the other hand it is indispensable for the purposes of victory as without him the armies lose morale and consequently power in the battle. It is also very simple to constantly identify the hero's position as a column of ~divine~ light constantly illuminates his figure. The structure of the game involves the construction of buildings, starting from the classic Town Hall through which it is possible to create workers to be distributed near the city for the collection of resources, ending with the buildings used for the recruitment of the various types of units to be used in battles. Particular is the choice made by the developers for the management of the production of the units, in fact it is possible to churn out units continuously (production times are very low) to build truly impressive armies. Resources, on the other hand, are unlimited and therefore the presence of the various elements in the city's warehouses depends solely on the number of workers available. One of the strengths of this title is precisely the grandeur of the manageable armies, being able to manage battles of up to 64,000 units, eight times higher than the maximum that can be contained by a single screen. Conquer the world As is known, Alexander conquered almost all of the known world at the time and touched the major civilizations present in those areas, for this reason in the game it will be possible to interact and control the armies of four populations, Greeks, Persians, Indians and Egyptians. ...in the game it will be possible to interact and control the armies of four populations, Greeks, Persians, Indians and Egyptians Conquer the world Hence the obligation to best represent the differentiation between the various civilizations not only through the buildings of the cities (there are 120 different types in the game), but also through the representation of the different really well reconstructed units and the introduction of special related to the characteristics of the people in question. The management of battles sometimes risks turning into a real chaos, having to control thousands of land units in hand-to-hand combat, or with modest range throwing weapons. The possibility of seeing in such a game the units flying to the ground in disorder following the blows inflicted by the enemy, and getting up a few meters away having to engage in battle with a new opponent, is original. The result of these tricks is to give the battles a very pleasant touch of realism. The control interface also allows the player to maintain control of all units deployed on the field, also managing their deployment on the field. Limits and potential From a technical point of view, Alexander suffers from the limitations of perspective graphics that do not allow you to enjoy particularly exciting shots, a choice which, moreover, can be justified by the desire to leave room for the impressive number of battles, with a truly impressive that would have required, with a fully 3D engine, prohibitive hardware requirements. In essence it is a title that aims at the general public by taking advantage of a license and publicity paseries of a film that is very likely to turn out to be a blockbuster as has already happened to the epic films that preceded it this season. Even the price with which it is presented to the public, which is really below average, highlights the desire to hit the largest number of users. The music that accompanies the game phases is taken from the film and performed by Vangelis, a well-known composer, coincidentally of Greek origins, already very famous all over the world for having composed the soundtracks for films such as Moments of Glory and Blade Runner, and having gave birth to the jingle most hated by pianists from all over the world, i.e. the jingle from the Barilla commercial of the 80s, which anyone who has ever found himself in front of a keyboard will have tried to reproduce at least once. Comment Driven by the favorable wind of a film production that bears the name of Oliver Stone as director and the face of Colin Farrel in the role of Alexander the Great, this title already enjoys all the advantages that many ~colleagues~ cannot even remotely hope to receive. Technically it is a rather stable product, which while not bringing any innovation to the RTS genre, is capable of attracting a good number of players. The dual possibility of enjoying single player campaigns and multiplayer battles as always gives increased longevity. The value for money of this product is therefore more than acceptable, as well as the target it aims for, which involves players of any age group who share an insane passion for strategy and battle on an open field. Pros: Ability to manage up to 64000 units Up to 120 buildings availability Good sound department, music from the film composed by Vangelis Cons: Not stunning graphics Chaotic battle management It is now a consolidated habit to release films from major productions and related electronic tie-ins at the same time or nearly so, with the aim of increasing bilateral curiosity about a series of products that make up the vast merchandise department of the great Hollywood films. In recent times we have witnessed striking examples, such as Enter The Matrix, which not only linked its title to a very successful trilogy (quadrilogy if we take into account the DVD Animatrix) but was totally inserted into the plot of the films, completing some scenes not represented on the big screen. Alexander's intentions are certainly not of these proportions but they suggest that he wants to penetrate the homes of thousands of gamers with an already tested recipe.", "date": "2004-11-29", "grade": null}
