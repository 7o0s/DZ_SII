{"name": "Cosa sono diventato?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82166-call-of-duty-black-ops-cosa-sono-diventato.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360The task awaiting Treyarch was certainly not the easiest, to be able to fill the void left by Infinity Ward in Activision, shaking off the stock software house label, that of odd episodes and spin offs, ready to take the field as a good gregarious when the owners have to rest while waiting for the next big match. The American guys therefore found themselves in a very dangerous position, there are many expectations, both on the part of the users and obviously on the part of the publisher, burned by the Infinity Ward affair. Without fear of contradiction it is possible to say that the Treyarch / Activision bet has been won on all fronts, both in single and in multiplayer; the interesting thing is that the developers have not limited themselves to making ~only~ an excellent title, going to work with chisel on what the series has offered us so far, but rather have created an original title full of ideas, consistent with the promises done, but decidedly unsettling and inventive, full-bodied and exciting: the true test of the maturity of the American software house. Trust no one The story behind the single player can hardly be summarized without falling into spoilers or burning revelations. This is to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops is not a simple ~special operations simulator~ set in the middle of the Cold War as some have tried to believe, but melee without fear of style falls, without the fear of ending up in a minefield from the B series caciarona full of barrels and explosions, both the cold chronicle of infiltration and sabotage missions, and themes more similar to the real spy thriller, with derivations from conspiracy theory, weapons of mass destruction, complete with Nazi scientists and mind control. What comes out is an exciting story, narrated through flashbacks, changes of perspective and protagonist, and which mission after mission leaves us more and more intrigued until the surprising ending. We are not only near Platoon or Apocalypse Now, Black Ops also brings Bourne-like atmospheres into play, on the other hand, the SOG operators of the special forces worked in the CIA environment, and it ribbons everything with memorable moments halfway between dream and reality that alone they are worth the ticket price. The protagonist is Alex Mason, a former marine, now a member of the aforementioned SOG, forerunners of the current special forces, the true fathers of the Tier 1 that we learned about in Medal of Honor, tied up and locked up in an interrogation room surrounded by numerous monitors on which numbers run incessantly, who is tortured precisely to know what those numbers are and what he has become. The harsh interrogation is therefore the means to know the truth, which is staged as a re-enactment of numerous missions around the world, over a period of time between 1961 and 1968 and which begins suddenly during the failed attempt to invasion of Cuba, on the sandy beaches of the Bay of Pigs. The mission, well it's one that anyone can imagine, to kill Castro. One of the strengths of the game is precisely that of showing historical figures who really existed (McNamara, Kennedy), or as in this case, existing ones and insert them in a political fictional context, making what is pure science fiction, absolutely real and plausible . The suspension of disbelief is never put to the test, the plot succeeds perfectly in rethinking and giving shape to certainly not very original themes, the internet in this sense is full of sites concerning certain topics, but everything is handled with extreme skill and placed at the service of missions that for average quality easily surpass the best exponents of the genre. Xbox 360 goals Call of Duty: Black Ops rewards the player with 50 objectives for a total of 1000 points. The objectives are not simply linked to the progression in the campaign, but they ask us to satisfy particular requests such as using a particular type of weapon in a certain situation, completing a level within certain minutes and so on. Instead, no goal is linked to multiplayer (apart from a couple dedicated to training and betting games) and on the contrary, some achievements are obtained in zombie mode and in the secret Dead Ops Arcade. Beyond the Iron Curtain First of all, Call of Duty: Black Ops, although not very long in an absolute sense, is certainly longer lasting than the competition: playing at a normal level, the title is completed between six and seven hours, with moments in which one really sweats the proverbial seven shirts to get to the checkpoint. The third level of difficulty, expert, is reached around eight o'clock, including obviouslynte the many times in which, as in the mission set during the siege of Khe Sanh, one dies riddled by the blows of the hundreds of Viet Cong who attack the base. Here, however, a consideration must be made, as an expert, not to mention a veteran, one comes across passages in which the bugbear of every FPS, the frustration caused by excessive respawn problems peeps over and over again. Luckily for us, however, the game invites us to vary our approach to the action, not to rush headlong towards the next trigger, making us move with caution, moving from cover to cover, using when necessary, or very often, the smoke grenades to blind the enemies. Difficult and tough, sometimes bordering on throwing the pad, but one always gets the impression of having everything under control, and of being able to move forward by sharpening one's wits, taking advantage of level design and our paraphernalia. All in all, a more than sufficient number of hours, they do not lack pace and indeed, they start immediately with a bang, and which remain electrifying and intense until the end. Scripting and linearity are the basis of Treyarch's recipe and thanks to the variety of situations faced during the fifteen missions that make up the game, there is little room to complain about the fact that one advances following the script written by the developers. Black Ops does not miss anything, throws many different situations into the fray, managing, as written above, to renew hackneyed elements. We have night fights in urban environments, gigantic sieges, infiltration of well-equipped cosmodromes, battles on rivers and in the air, racing at breakneck speed on the roofs of Kowloon in Hong Kong, secret bases and since Vietnam is king, endless jungle and tunnels to clean armed with flashlight and revolver. Each of these missions is punctuated by memorable moments, sudden turns in events and changes of setting, the pace is always frenetic and tight, both in tight spaces and in the not rare phases where the level design widens the environments giving us the possibility of try a different approach than the usual run towards the checkpoint. Treyarch has succeeded in the difficult task of creating a perfect balance between the captivating and complex global storytelling plan of the game and the one inside the missions, something that had not succeeded in the second chapter of Modern Warfare, in which a lame plot was built on missions not always high quality. From this point of view, the students have surpassed the masters by creating a powerful and passionate title, which expresses the desire of the ~eternal seconds~ to do something extremely personal, as if they had finally been able to make the title they have always dreamed of, without however distorting the canons such. An attention to the staging that transcends the reference target of the game, full of cinematographic references: in addition to Platoon and Apocalypse Now we find clear and strong references to Hamburger Hill and The Great Escape and more that cause spoilers it is not possible to mention, but there is also Lost, and all the interrogation scenes and the beautiful opening sequences of each mission literally take the game to the next level. In this sense, the identification with Mason has an easy game in taking us and accompanying us by hand until the end, making us literally jump in our chair at every shock received during the interrogation. The phases with the vehicles that we will encounter in the game are also pleasant and enjoyable, as they are not used for simple ~on-rail~ sessions but are driven in the first person. In one mission we will fly a helicopter and once a valley has been set on fire, the following battle with enemy helicopters is played as if we were faced with a series of end-of-level bosses. In short, there is really everything and when we can't guide them directly we can always count on their support by directing the fire of the weapons towards the targets to be hit. Let it bet? On the multiplayer side, Call of Duty: Black Ops moves at the same pace as the single player, that is, not resting on the laurels of the franchise, but rather using them as a starting point for building something new. There are basically two new features, the inclusion of CoD Points, through which the way in which all the ~unlockables~ of our character are unlocked changes, and the so-called betting games, four new ways in which points are raffled off earned by raising or lowering the stakes. Contrary to the classic setting in competitive FPS in which the various objects to customize your soldier were made available gradually following a linear progression, now depending on the performance in the matches, hereso by winning or obtaining noteworthy performances, you will earn money that can be spent to acquire upgrades for weapons and other gadgets, being able to move freely, buying only what you want. In addition, challenges, called Contracts, have been implemented to earn more money. These commit us to carrying out objectives related to the exploitation of a weapon, particular kills and so on; the interesting thing is that they must be purchased and completed in a given period of time, otherwise the prize will be cancelled, therefore wasting time with a freshly bought weapon is not advisable if a contract has been activated with another one. This new way to decide how to fight seemed decidedly functional and well thought out; if the weapons however become available upon leveling up, everything else can be bought freely immediately, such as equipment, grenades or optics, provided you have the necessary funds. In this sense, you can also be rewarded with the first weapons available, if you get your ~load out~ right, and the perks to activate (three to choose from a total of seventeen). In addition to the various classic game modes, the betting ones are a very welcome inclusion, and after testing them thoroughly it is possible to say that they are not simple pastimes between a team death match or a capture the flag, but manage to live a life of their own , with a defined identity, and it is plausible to assume that they will steal several players from the ~classic~ multiplayer. Among the four available, the most challenging, electrifying and to be played with the heart in one's throat is ~A shot in the barrel~ in which we all start with a bullet in the gun and two lives. For each kill you earn an extra bullet, the winner who stays alive last obviously. Even ~Stone Age~ can be played with great pleasure: this time you have the crossbow with explosive bolts and the ballistic dagger at your disposal. The game becomes a barrage of explosions, however played with a pinch of tactics since the arrows do not explode on contact, but only a few seconds after being fired, consequently you can kill your opponents by shooting at them (be careful not to be too close though!) so much creating a sort of minefield around them. Very fun and frantic, and as previously written less ~stupid~ than one might think. The ~Game of Arms~ and ~Shotsman~ bet modes conclude, in the first everyone starts with the same weapon and with each killing you get the next one trying to get to the last one, for a total of twenty levels, while in the second all they have the same weapon, which changes every thirty seconds. These are also very interesting and fun, but they seem to hold up less in the long run than ~A shot in the barrel~ and ~Stone Age~. Numbers Speaking of numbers, fourteen maps are available, all on average large, with the exception of Nuke Town, taken from the city for nuclear tests seen in Indiana Jones IV, and all graced by a very inspired, never banal level design that alternates large spaces and narrow corridors, several elevated points and ~secret passages~; the Jungle map is exemplary in this sense, an entire valley at our disposal, among huts, hills, rivers, narrow paths and wooden bridges. The impression is that the maps, despite having been created keeping in mind a certain type of approach rather than another, are perfect and designed not to limit anyone, both those who prefer clashes from a distance and close-ups, making them all pleasant and always usable. The weapons are then many, and those who fear that the setting can only bring into play old technologically poorly performing irons can rest assured; the optics, more or less actually existing at the time, make them all like new today, and in any case (even in the single player) decidedly modern rifles such as Steyr Aug and Famas appear to keep company with a plethora of weapons from the 60s present in different configurations, just to flesh out an already very high number. Similarly high is the number of killstreaks obtainable after a minimum of three kills in a row, starting from the spy plane up to eleven which reward the player with the deadly guard dogs and the gunship. Some really effective rewards in between: if the playful aspect of the killstreak is enhanced with the radio-controlled car, truly remarkable tactical results are obtained by activating the SAM station or the automatic turret. If we then drop tons of high-potential bombs, mortars or better still napalm on our opponents, well let's get comfortable and enjoy the kill counter going up rather", "date": "2010-11-09", "grade": "9.4"}
