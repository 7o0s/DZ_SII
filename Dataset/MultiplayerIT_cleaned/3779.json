{"name": "Valiant Hearts: Coming Home", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valiant-hearts-coming-home-recensione.html", "text": "It is rather unexpected that we are faced with the review of Valiant Hearts: Coming Home, following that pearl released in 2014 and remained in the heart of anyone who played it at the time. The first chapter emerged from a particular grace period of Ubisoft, which in a short time launched the fascinating Child of Light and then Valiant Hearts: The Great War on the market, demonstrating a remarkable openness towards projects of almost indie dimensions but characterized by splendid ideas and executions. To tell the truth, the original experience was so intense, well packaged and self-contained that the release of a sequel was even strange, moreover almost ten years later, but the prospect of a new emotional immersion at the levels of the first it was still tempting. And in fact it was pleasant to find Freddie, Karl and Anna, returning to their remnants of life between trenches, bombings, hospitals and moments of precarious but precious serenity in the madness of the Great War. Everything has remained practically unchanged from the first chapter: the comic book graphic style, with the caricatured but also expressive 2D drawing, the narration intertwined between the different protagonists, the documentary grafts and also the structure of many of the puzzles present. From a stylistic and structural point of view, it is a precise continuation of the story that Ubisoft began almost ten years ago and which, to tell the truth, had already received a worthy and moving conclusion at the time. However, the formula found is so effective, in its balanced tone between drama, humour, melancholy and hope, that we would gladly return even more often to the stories of Valiant Hearts, also considering how such an incisive denunciation of the horrors of war is more relevant than ever , here also accompanied by an in-depth analysis of racial issues. In this sense, it is still an important video game, which could be used for its educational value thanks also to the use of various historiographical documents. Its strongly narrative approach also makes it a perfect title for distribution via Netflix, given the proximity, even conceptual, to the contents of the distribution platform, also prompting us to set aside the classic balances on value based on the price or the duration of the experience (actually quite short). Lives in war Valiant Hearts: Coming Home also delves into the history of the Harlem Hellfighters through the new character of James The story resumes some of the characters of The Great War such as Freddie, Karl and Anna and introduces new ones, including James, enlisted in the infantry of the US army and George, an English aviator specialized in aerial photography. Also in this case the events unfold along the three years of fire of the First World War, between 1915 and 1918, but telling different glimpses and from other points of view compared to the first chapter. In particular, the in-depth analysis on the Harlem Hellfighters stands out, the first African-American infantry unit belonging to the ~Old 15th~ of the American army, which fought in the Great War and helped to break down some racial barriers both in the USA and elsewhere, an element which is inserted as a further theme touched by the story. But beyond this, Valiant Hearts: Coming Home is another story that talks about the impact war has on people, staging different lives grappling with atrocities and moments of relative normality, heroism, survival and friendship, basically trying to hold on to his own humanity amidst the chaos. The story is the main element of Valiant Hearts: Coming Home and permeates every aspect of the experience, although during the game phases there are practically no spoken dialogues. The narration develops through different channels: the narrator introduces each piece of gameplay illustrating the background that lead to the various game situations, but during these the story takes place above all in visual form, like a sort of illustrated book in animation centered on the Great War. In Valiant Hearts: Coming Home the narrative is pervasive, even if often ~mute~ In support we then find the usual documents with real photos and texts that tell, with historiographical precision, various aspects of the time through the description of characteristic objects, characters, places and events. The stylized and hand-drawn 2D graphics are particularly expressive and able to tell the horrors of war, always mediating between dark moments and other more serene or melancholy ones, while the audio accompaniment with piano music and jazz grafts contributes perfectly to completing the 'atmosphere (there are godsreal rhythm game-style mini-games related to Harlem Hellfighters concerts). Puzzles and mini-games Valiant Hearts: Coming Home offers puzzles to solve, generally not very complex The gameplay looks like a direct continuation of Valiant Hearts: The Great War, with some minor changes especially regarding the mini-games, appropriately linked to the use of the touch screen given the reference platforms. On the game front there is therefore almost nothing new and, indeed, it seems that the team has proceeded to a certain further simplification of the puzzles, perhaps in search of greater narrative compactness and in line with a duration that perhaps seems a little ' smaller than the original. In the standard phases, we find ourselves controlling one of the characters on a two-dimensional plane, solving simple environmental puzzles that usually require the search and combination of some objects around the scenario. Different situations can be connected to these such as the activation of switches, the control of various machinery and the fact of having to throw stones or other weights to interact from a distance with otherwise unreachable elements. The dog Walt also returns, also an indispensable tool for the solution of some puzzles, to remark how all the ideas related to the gameplay are substantially repeated from the first to this new chapter. A narrative moment from Valiant Hearts: Coming Home Some novelty is instead found in the mini-games that break the standard action with some different situations and which have obviously been designed to work best with the touch screen, although even these may prove to be simpler than previously seen. It's about flying with the plane avoiding enemies and flak, extracting shrapnel and treating the wounded or even touching notes to the rhythm of music in some cases, just to name a few. They are small grafts that are quite simple but which contribute to characterize the experience a little, particularly suitable for use via smartphones and tablets.", "date": "2023-01-31", "grade": "7.5"}
