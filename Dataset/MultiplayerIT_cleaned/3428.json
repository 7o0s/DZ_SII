Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville for PlayStation 4, it is because you have appreciated the shooter drift of the PopCap Games production. It has happened in recent years, transforming the 2009 strategy into an extremely original and charismatic online (and offline) multiplayer title, which after two official interactions changes its name, while keeping its substance fundamentally unchanged. Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville is to all intents and purposes a Garder Warfare 3, but suitable for modern times, invaded by social networks and live events at all costs (see the Fortnite phenomenon, to get an idea). In any case, zombies and plants have convinced us once again, net of some aspects on which it would be advisable to intervene as soon as possible. The contents: Funland and story mode If you have already played Garden Warfare 1 and 2 in recent years, you will more or less already know the genre of Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville, to which we will return later. So let's first analyze the main contents of the new chapter, which is the biggest ever. EA and PopCap Games have resumed Garden Warfare 2 by acting on two specific aspects: quantity and variety. This time you will immediately have a whole series of different game modes available: a main campaign, which can be tackled both alone in single player and in multiplayer mode (online or offline). The story mode coincides with the main campaign, and the latter is actually divided into as many sub-campaigns, some of which are dedicated to plants, and the others to zombies. In this way, new players can get to know the funny characters of the series, or discover them for the first time: the individual main missions offer considerable rewards, both in terms of coins and experience; furthermore, completing them unlocks alternative skins that can also be equipped by moving to online multiplayer. The game plot is accompanied by the new management of the main HUB. The initial super square, known as Divertilandia, connects all the offers of the title to each other, in an essential hub. From Divertilandia the player can change faction at any time, going from plants to zombies and vice versa, meet other players online or set the ~private~ mode by replacing bots with real opponents. But the most important thing is that, in fact, from the Divertilandia hub you can access all the rest of the contents: there is a portal to go and play online, there are dressing rooms where you can customize and change your characters, the little shop where you can buy new items, a place to exchange coins for experience points (thus leveling up faster), and then again means of transport for other game maps dedicated to storytelling (single player campaign). From Divertilandia, therefore, you will be able to access the Bislack Wood, helping the zombies to free their companions and to regain ground on the plants, or go to the city center of Neighborville, giving a hand to the plants in saving the brains of the town and so on. The main campaign of Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville is not essential to be able to play online, but it is offered as a parallel mode, still able to entertain for several hours and with a sufficiently large and varied number of secondary missions. Gameplay and live events Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville is once again a third-person shooter, but woe to take it too seriously in the gameplay: the light-hearted and nice address of the series has fortunately remained perfect as we remembered it, net of some aspects which, however, needed to be perfected, and in three years there was plenty of time to do it. For example, the movements of the individual characters, yes responsive but in certain situations ~clumsy~ in the feedback, or the trajectory and impact of the individual shots, which do not always seem to repay a good aim. These details make it unlikely that Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville will ever become a title with which to organize official eSports events, even net of obvious imbalances between the heroes present (especially on the zombie faction side). Beyond this, customization has been greatly enhanced in Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville and now also affects the ability aspect of individual heroes. The player can equip well-defined skills, thus modifying the style of play and the character's unit itself on the battlefield. Take for example the small acorn (new entryof the series), capable of transforming into the most resistant Oak: if you notice that in the early stages of the game you suffer too many defeats in a row, you can set up an ability that grants more health at the time of regeneration, or there are other power-ups that improve speed of movement, but only when a shot is not already being taken. Small tricks of this kind, varied in a remarkable series of different abilities, make the approach to Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville extremely heterogeneous: there will never be two truly identical characters on the battlefield, even if the players have selected the exact same plant or the exact same zombie. Live events help to make Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville an extremely current product: forget about DLC and paid packages, because now the seasonal limited-time events, or more properly monthly in this case, are taking the field. For example, the initiative linked to Halloween will remain active until the end of October 2019: by completing the daily missions you will get a whole series of skins and themed objects, which will hardly be available again in the immediate future; even the square of Divertilandia has been decorated with pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons, but the artistic direction of Plants against Zombies is always present in a whole series of funny and immediately recognizable details. It's worth pointing out that some online modes also ~rotate~ on a weekly basis, so that on balance there is always something new to see in your play sessions. Playstation 4 trophies Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville has its own impressive trophy list on PlayStation 4, with the Platinum Trophy included. It will take a long time, however, to obtain it: you will have to complete all the various campaigns in the story mode, play many online games using all the characters present, as well as level up the latter and upgrade them. It is, however, a matter of time rather than skill. Game modes and characters EA has confirmed that Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville in the near future will receive constant updates, both from the point of view of the game modes and from that of the actual playable characters; at the time of writing, however, it seems to us that the title is already provided more than enough. The online multiplayer clearly offers matches in line with what you might expect from the many other similar titles on the market, with some that are true throwbacks from the Modern Warfare series. Arena di Battaglia, for example, is a 4 VS 4 deat match, where at each elimination it is no longer possible to select the same character; it is therefore necessary to know how to adequately master the entire game roaster. In Grassy Supremacy, on the other hand, you fight for control points, but within a progressively expanding map: usually plants defend small gardens attacked by zombies, or the latter defend rockets and other strange contraptions from floral enemies. There is no shortage of hordes, which always culminate with the devastating clash against a random boss, and team matches in which the highest number of overall eliminations must be achieved. Among the aspects of the title that must certainly be praised, in addition to the excellent graphic, technical and sound sectors, there is certainly that of the characters and their new management. Currently you will find a total of ten different heroes for plants, and as many for zombies, divided into three game classes: attackers, defenders and support. Of course there are unforgettable faces from the series, like the Peashooter and the carnivorous plant, as well as notable returns like the corn cob; also good for the introduction of new ideas, and here too the reference to the acorn, a character capable of transforming by combining with other players, is perfectly fitting. Zombies, however, are stronger and it is useless to get around them: the new additions (zombie archer, zombie skater) are simply devastating, a ruthless mix between offensive capabilities and speed on the battlefield. Surely in the near future there will be balances to reshuffle the cards on the table.", "date": "2019-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
