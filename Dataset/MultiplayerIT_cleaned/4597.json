The first Spelunker dates back to 1983, released on Atari, Commodore 64, MSX and NES, and was a sort of platform with adventure elements set inside various caves. The nice thing is that, after 34 years, Spelunker Party keeps the link with its origins rather intact, starting from the framing used to get to some structural and even aesthetic elements, given the due proportions. The addition of ~Party~ in the name indicates the most relevant feature of this new chapter, or its decisive tendency towards the multiplayer approach, available here both offline and online. To be honest, it's not exactly a completely new chapter, given that this Party takes most of the features of the previous Spelunker World with both hands, released a couple of years ago on PlayStation 4 and PC as a free-to-play game with online features and micro-transactions. The action plays pretty much the same, the gameplay options are similar and the structure is essentially the same, but the micro-transactions have obviously been removed and some other changes have been applied to freshen everything up as well as justify the new price from 29.99 euros slapped on the cover, which compared to the prices that run on the Switch eShop is a figure of a certain thickness. Unfortunately, it also tends to be hardly justifiable given the offer and above all considering the scarce differences that separate this Party from the previous World. Indeed, curiously, some regressions are rather noticeable, such as the multiplayer that reaches a maximum of four players instead of six and the absence of the special events that frequently animated Spelunker World. Applied speleology Spelunker Party plays like a classic side-scrolling platformer with some fairly basic puzzle elements, but they manage to vary the action well within the more than 100 levels present in the explorable world. Being a title focused on the exploration of caves, the possible settings all develop around the same main theme but there is a considerable diversity of situations that the developers have managed to put together to stimulate exploration even after numerous missions around for tunnels. One of the main driving forces is represented by the search for loot: the caves are full of treasures and collectibles that can be used to modify the character's appearance and abilities, as well as precious materials and money to always spend to fully customize the own adventurer. The system clearly derives from the old free-to-play setting with micro-transactions, but fortunately now it is based exclusively on the conquest of in-game treasures, without any money-grabbing traps (apart from the price of the game itself, of course). The numbers in this case are also impressive, with hundreds of objects and equipment capable of modifying the capabilities of the speleologist, which can in turn be increased in level. Basically, the game is an old-fashioned platformer, in which it is essential to perfectly calculate the jumps and the timing of the movements to avoid traps, cling to vines and jump over obstacles, at the same time getting rid of enemies of various types using the provided equipment. Just like in the old Spelunker, it takes very little to lose a life, between millimeter errors in the jumps and to be honest even a certain difficulty in distinguishing precisely the dangerous elements on the screen, which can create a bit of confusion. A group game It is clear that the experience improves significantly by tackling the game in multiplayer, even if the underlying mechanics remain unchanged. Both offline and online, it is possible to take part in sessions with up to three other players by taking part in real group explorations which, in addition to increasing the general fun, also open the way to further areas of the maps, thanks to mechanisms and situations of game in which collaboration between various players is required to access otherwise unreachable areas. With a rather particular solution, even when playing online multiplayer the action is displayed in split-screen with the possibility of returning to full screen at any time. Split screen is great for having an accurate idea of where others are and being able to reach them if necessary, but in portable mode it is also problematic because the screen format forces you to view the game in very tiny windows, which is quite annoyingespecially in offline multiplayer, since it is not solvable in any way. In any case, multiplayer certainly remains the best way to deal with Spelunker Party, as is evident from the title, also because the sense of belonging to a community of players clearly shines through in the mechanics of the upgrades and personalization of the protagonist, beyond the need to work together to discover all the secrets present within the levels. The general aspect of Spelunker Party manifests a production of rather modest dimensions, with a generally simple graphic system but there is no lack of touches of class such as the dynamic lighting effects of the torches and a general cuteness that closely recalls the classic style of certain productions Japanese of yesteryear.", "date": "2017-10-24", "grade": "6.5"}
