{"name": "NBA Live 10", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71454-nba-live-10-il-basket-di-ea-e-sugli-scaffali.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 In recent years we have witnessed a clear trend reversal as regards the quality of the two major basketball games on the market: where the 2K series grew over time, Electronic Arts Live sank slowly into the abyss, with a very unrealistic playability, a graphics sector that didn't take off and various problems with the general gameplay. By inserting NBA Live 10 in the Xbox 360 tray, however, the initial feeling is that something has changed, that perhaps the developers wanted to change that trend once again. And playing we have the confirmation: NBA Live 10 is definitely a great game. The King wants his crown back The talented boys of EA Canada have really given their all this year, going to file the imperfections of the game that the fans had shown in previous years, exponentially improving the graphics and making the game leaner and faster with the joypad. The first ~different~ sensation we have is the one concerning the defense: the game mechanics have been changed in favor of a general spectacularization of the whole game, but in particular of the defensive phase. Now stealing the ball, blocking or intercepting has become much easier. Not simple, but more ~human~. This is also reflected during our attack phase, during which the CPU doesn't struggle to take possession of the ball if we go too far into the area with reckless dribbling, or face-to-face shots from the field: the result will always be the usual, stolen ball. The change is certainly positive because it gives matches more technicality: long gone are the days where we threw ourselves into the fray hoping for an easy dunk, today we have to set up the maneuver with the right passes and the right feints. To shoot for a basket, in NBA Live 10 all you need is good timing on the dedicated key: the player takes flight and at the moment of release the ball detaches from his hands to begin the ascending trajectory. It's a question of reflexes (cit). By pressing the triggers you can combine different dunks or shots with fade-out (falling backwards, like the great Michael Jordan did). Passing the ball has been made even easier: in addition to its function key, we can also immediately identify teammates on the screen to better decide who to throw at. By pressing the backbone, icons appear on the heads of the companions and we can choose faster who to give it to with an immediate pass. With the trigger pressed, however, the various possible schemes for that action appear at the bottom. The passes are much more comfortable and precise than last year, and it is possible to set up very spectacular and fast actions in a natural and immediate way. The work done by the programmers on the ~fundamentals~ is evident and the general impression is that everything is aimed at making NBA Live 10 the most fun and engaging game, regardless of reality and simulation. The excellent ~Pick and Roll~ is back again this year, the function that allows (by pressing the RT button) control of a second player without the ball. The implementations are numerous and all important: unmarking a man in the area, blocking, Halley oop, counter-attack actions. Pick and Roll allows you not to leave full control of the players to the AI and try to set up actions entirely controlled by us. Curiosity Electronic Arts has always used us well with its soundtracks. Thanks to ~EA Trax~ also NBA Live 10 this year can enjoy a tracklist of the highest quality: 25 songs from the most diverse and disparate artists, but all united by a single denominator: the Hip Hop genre. Xzbit, De La Soul, Wyclef Jean, Mos Def, David Banner, Beasty Boys but above all Snoop Dogg are absolute protagonists of that musical genre. There are perhaps too many hits from the past to the detriment of novelties or successes from the present, but the quality is still very high. A few small problems remained in the framework of the game. For example, it often happens that players leave the line of play inadvertently, or that a defense foul is called for no apparent valid reason. These small imperfections, perhaps inevitable in a complex game like a basketball simulation, are however absolutely minor compared to the enormous improvements made to the general structure of the game. NBA Live 10 is extremely fun and fast, spectacular and intuitive controls, perhaps the most important factor. Each team now has its own ~DNA~. This genetic imprint is made up of alterable values that concern all aspects of the team: defense, attack, strength, 3-point shots, dunks and so on. During the season this DNA changes dynamicallybased on our performance and how we set up the game: offensive, defensive, under the basket, shots from outside and so on. There is one option in particular, the ~Dynamic Season~, which roughly follows the Live Season of FIFA 10: in practice we can follow the real NBA season step by step by choosing our favorite team and following in its footsteps game after game. Unlike FIFA 10, this option is free because all NBA Live 10 buyers will find an activation code inside the box. We can also do a player DNA download while the season is running to adjust the play characteristics of each roster. All together passionately Great importance and emphasis has obviously been given to the entire multiplayer sector of NBA Live 10. With the Adidas Live Run option you can connect together with nine other friends of ours and play games in which the artificial intelligence of the CPU is only related to the 'referee. A very interesting option, especially for our basketball fans, is the possibility of playing an entire FIBA tournament with national teams from all over the world. Including our beloved Italy. We can therefore venture into the world competition with Galanda, Belinelli, Soragna, Bargnani and all the others, including a fairly long bench with Bulleri, Basile, Rocca and Marconato. While greatly appreciating the possibility of commanding Italian players, the place where you will spend most of your time is certainly in the ~Career~ mode. Starting to play, you have to recruit staff members, form the team and start training for the pre-season. In ~Career~, NBA Live 10 becomes a slightly more tactical and mental game, as it is necessary to follow the many statistical parameters that help us improve the performance of individual players and the team in general. It's a pity that there are no street and ~RPG-like~ modes in which we impersonate a single player who has to make a career, the general experience would certainly have been more complete and even more captivating. Xbox 360 goals NBA Live 10 provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock through 33 goals. Some are very simple and are obtained in the first games: make a three-point shot, a dunk, share a character with a friend online or download it directly. Other objectives are decidedly more difficult to obtain and will certainly make you sweat: one of the major ones (100 points) is the one that sees us busy signing 100 points with a single player. All others are related to super performance of specific players, or in particular matches. There hasn't been much emphasis on online competitions, luckily for those who don't have Xbox Live. Outside and inside the parquet The graphic sector of NBA Live 10 has undergone the best attention of the programmers of EA Canada: the improvements are evident in all sectors. The athletes on the field are clearly more beautiful than those seen in NBA2K, with more polygons and effects, better facial expressions, sweat, moving clothes. The ~plastic~ effect to which we are now accustomed has unfortunately not been eliminated (perhaps it will take the next generation of consoles), but certainly the faces of the protagonists of NBA Live 10 are not so unpleasant. The ~outline~, which is outside the game parquet, is full of details, polygonal elements, people waving, dancers, screens, the public, and what amazes us most is the absolutely nailed and without hesitation framerate. The game flows away with a naturalness and fluency that we have not noticed in other sports series. There is some frame drop during close-ups and frequent zooms, but during gameplay everything is absolutely smooth and beautiful. However, some uncertainty can be seen in the animations, which, although beautiful and very fluid, are badly linked between one and the other. This happens especially during the execution of some dunks, where we can see that the CPU artificially ~adjusts~ the position of the player's body to fit the animation on the basket. It's not a particularly annoying defect, but in other basketball games these features have been well masked and the human eye can't perceive them. The sound is very good, and in addition to the numerous HipHop songs present in the tracklist it can boast of an infinite number of effects, voices and a first-rate commentary. The public reacts in a very realistic way to game actions depending on whether we are at home or away: we can hear applause, shouts or whistles.", "date": "2009-10-22", "grade": "8.5"}
