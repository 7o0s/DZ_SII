However, this phenomenon has led at the same time to a rapid saturation of the market and, consequently, to the exhaustion of all the possibilities offered by this type of product. It must be admitted, however, that so far few or no one had attempted the ~reverse~ path, i.e. developing an endless run in which the player does not control the character who runs endlessly, fleeing who knows what threat, but the environment that surrounds, in order to ~feed~ the protagonist's sprint and prevent him from being caught. This is precisely the case of Le Vamp, the new mobile game by High Voltage Software, the team behind The Conduit. Using a simple and nice approach, the game is based on the escape of a little vampire from a horde of French villagers who chase him with torches and pitchforks, referring to a scene that is part of the collective imagination and which sees the monsters give it to legs when they find themselves against an angry mob. The new Dracula therefore runs towards safety, but his energies are limited and our goal is to replenish them, as well as free him from increasingly numerous and insidious obstacles, using the touch screen to move objects and characters as needed. Brave little pigs The ~fuel~ that the protagonist needs to keep running and outdistance his pursuers is blood, specifically that of plump little pigs who unfortunately find themselves in his way and which we can throw at the vampire's jaws with a simple gesture. However, the gameplay of Le Vamp is not limited to this and so, as the distances get longer, enemies and obstacles appear in the scenario that we must promptly eliminate: little monsters to ~crush~ downwards or to pull out of the ground before the our character hovers over them, pumpkins to explode quickly before jumping from a hill, sunbeams to block with your fingers, tree trunks to knock down to create improvised points on the water and even garlic pigs, which instead of feed harm our little undead. Scattered within the scenario there are also many coins that we can collect with a touch and which will prove useful for buying traditional upgrades. The strength of the game undoubtedly lies in the technical sector, with graphics with a very pleasant, colorful and friendly style, which doesn't even forget to fill the background with elements to give an idea of depth. Unfortunately, however, the other aspects of the High Voltage Software title are not convincing. The touch controls, first of all, are not reliable enough and this translates into game over as soon as the speed of the action increases beyond a certain limit. Le Vamp is the typical mobile game to be played with the index finger instead of the thumbs, but nevertheless it happens far too often that the taps go astray. Secondly, the situations that we find ourselves facing during the race are fairly numerous but tend to repeat themselves in an unpleasant way, resulting in a very limited experience.", "date": "2013-04-02", "grade": "6.2"}
