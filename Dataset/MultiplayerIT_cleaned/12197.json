{"name": "Streets of Rage 2 (Virtual Console) - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/streets-of-rage-2-virtual-console-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Streets of Rage 2 represented Sega's effort to maximize the experimentation of its predecessor Streets of Rage, a title that, despite the excellent inspirations, had failed to distinguish itself from the crowd of Double Dragon and Final Fight clones that crowded the arcades since the mid-eighties. Before the genre declined, supplanted by match-based fighting games, Streets of Rage 2 became the symbol of the questioning of the industrial arcade-home console synergy to the advantage of Sega: developed exclusively for Megadrive, it quickly became a killer application for that console, showing that an excellent and original game was worth much more than a couple of poor conversions of Final Fight for the Super NES. Streets of Rage 2 was the sum of the experiments made in the genre, a perfect balance between complexity, accessibility and immediacy. Instead of simply offering endless repetitions of hits plus a couple of projections, typical of the average genre product, Sega's effort presented itself with a new conception of the clashes. The flying kicks and the basic combo are present, but by holding down and then releasing the button it is possible to directly start the final blow, useful for medium-ranged enemies. What was it yesterday The existence of a blow to defend against attacks from behind can be combined with this combo and offers front and back squabbles against enemies. On these it is possible to rage with two different types of projections, selectable by turning the unfortunate person once in his clutches, or with a series of special shots that are not limited to the circular ~smart hit~ to get air but include two other types of very harmful frontal attacks to be used strategically and in combination with the rest. The characters, extremely different in appearance and fighting styles, had access to a vast amount of weapons, and confronted enemies who were not clones against clones, but real characters themselves, equipped with attack patterns and a degree of often remarkable characterization and personality, whose mass attacks required active collaboration in multiplayer. All this was presented with a high level of production, characterized by a remarkable graphic quality and an exceptional audio sector, with the music of Yuzo Koshiro and the accompaniment of digitized sentences and verses. What is it today In spite of the technological improvements of the hardware, or perhaps precisely as a consequence of the evolution and transformation of languages, the genre of scrolling fighting games is now the prerogative of the historical recovery of the enthusiasts and totally defunct, replaced by other genres and approaches in the first places in the productive agendas. At best, this genre is the subject of re-edition operations or pathetic revival attempts which, in transposing the mechanics into 3D environments, are unable to translate the strong point of games such as Streets of Rage 2 into new productions: the precision, frenzy and the feeling of unrealistic yet enthralling mob violence. Streets of Rage 2 represents for many an all-time peak of scrolling beat 'em up. The peculiar mechanics and multiplayer fun have never been achieved again, even in more technologically advanced productions by Capcom or in the same disappointing third installment of the Sega series. What is it today It is therefore not only a death effect of the genre if Streets of Rage 2 has aged really well, and if we feel like recommending it to all players who love multiplayer experiences and classic game mechanics which, unjustly abandoned, can and must maintain a their space alongside the new expressive and interactive research of the videogame medium. The many levels, the many and original enemies, the combinations of shots and the multiplayer cooperative element continue to be very valid reasons for always having Streets of Rage 2 available in your soft library, virtual or otherwise, with all due respect to those who simply prefer the polygons to bitmaps and not good games to bad ones. For historical reasons (effective death of the genre) and intrinsic to the game (excellence in mechanics, multiplayer satisfaction), Streets of Rage 2 is still considered one of the best scrolling fighting games ever, if not the best. Sega's masterpiece remained for fifteen years one of the evergreen classics most loved by most fans who knew it and today, at 800 Wii Points, it effortlessly enters the category of games that need no recommendation.", "date": "2007-06-15", "grade": null}
