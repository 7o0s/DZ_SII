{"name": "Aux armes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/74714-napoleon-total-war-aux-armes-citoyens.html", "text": "After the discussed Empire, certainly worthy as regards the concept and the mechanics related to diplomacy, the idea of scientific / cultural research and the wonderful naval battles, but at the same time undermined by some unprecedented problems for a Total War product, such as a poor squad of available units and factions or the not exactly ~enlightened~ AI, Creative Assembly initially tried to correct some problems through the release of patches and DLCs, including the controversial Warpath Campaign, dedicated to Native Americans, which however resulted in a sometimes the opposite effect to that hoped for, as many users did not like to pay (however little) for features that they expected already implemented in the basic product. Fortunately, while these DLCs were coming out, a stand-alone expansion was being developed in record time that was supposed to rebalance and diversify the factions, and restore that air of epicness that had been lost in the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In Empire stood the 1700s, today, in 1796, a small French contingent is preparing to cross the Alps to invade Austria's Italian allies: a young man named Napoleon commands it, and it's time for total war again. The birth of an emperor Napoleon: Total War, as the name suggests, focuses all attention on that relatively short period in which Europe but not only was shocked by the earthquake following the French Revolution, by the diffusion of the ideas it brought as well as by the megalomania and the ambition of a single man who, in the name of democracy, attempted to bring his dictatorship to the whole continent. Compared to the other products in the series, in which there was indeed the historical element but where it was also possible to witness various anachronisms (The search for the Social Contract in Empire anticipated the effective diffusion of Rosseaux's ideas by decades) or actual evolutions alternatives (the Republic of Venice conquered the Holy Land and Europe under my enlightened guidance), in Napoleon reconstruction takes over through a series of targeted campaigns that lead the player almost by the hand through the most important stages of the Napoleonic epic. A first attempt was made with Empire, thanks to the campaign dedicated to the American War of Independence, but never in the history of the series had historical reconstruction been sought with the aim of increasing player involvement, making him feel part of certain events that helped make history as we read it in books. Perhaps more exciting than having the opportunity to rewrite it. It begins right in Italy: a few possessions, armies formed by peasants armed with rifles and militiamen, a few knights and cannons against the Austrian giant to be weakened by annexing its Piedmontese allies and invading Austria, passing through the Po valley and annexing the Republic of Venice to then go up again along Friuli. In 1798 we arrive at the invasion of Egypt, the clash against the English fleet, the fall of the Mamluk kingdoms and the defeat of the Janissaries at the Battle of the Pyramids, to return, in 1804, emperor, in Europe, to conquer Russia, and finally, in 1815, go all out at Waterloo. And he rethought the furniture/curtains, and the beaten valleys Making the most of such a short period of time has forced the developers to radically change some of the bases of the game, primarily the duration of the rounds which drops from the canonical six months to two weeks, thus making it possible to create short campaigns while giving them a set of choices that can be made. And precisely the pace of the action is the second important factor in this expansion: for the first time the player cannot wait, cannot retreat into years and decades of defense and trade to rebuild his armies. He must attack and quickly, because especially in Italy and Africa there are very few shifts and there are many things to do, lands to conquer and enemies to defeat. Even the approximately 170 rounds of the European campaign seem few compared to the objectives to be carried out. Finally, the third big change is the objectives. Already present in the predecessors but often simple additions - moreover trivial or absolutely unjustified - in Napoleon: Total War they become fundamental requirements for victory. Even the rare optional missions, such as annexing Piedmont for example, are instead practically mandatory to have the upper hand especially at higher difficulty levels, guiding the player through those actions that Napoleon had to perform in order to be able to win with such small forces against the opponents. There are of course several minor improvements to the mapstrategy, new diplomatic and conquest options (looting returns for one), historical characters at the helm of armies, possibility of recruiting generals as well as soldiers, some balancing in the behavior of citizens, finally new military units that appear campaign by campaign , from Revolutionary Infantry to Old Guard to Mamluk Auxiliaries, new agent options and more. Novelties that, while not changing the gaming experience much, make a good impression, especially when compared to the bugs in the campaigns of the original Empire versions. For the record, it is also possible to face the European campaign with any dominant nation, but again nothing done for the minor factions, still not very usable until some mods are released, as it was for the predecessor. Was it true glory? Posterity will judge. Even the battles, both naval and terrestrial, have undergone heavy improvements: starting from the graphic aspect, which sees the increase of special effects, of smoke and particles, of detail in the soldiers and in the battlefield (the units have finally disappeared of clones), new atmospheric effects, a new option that opens a small window on the screen when something important happens (broken unit or general killed for example) on which to click to immediately move the camera in order to take action and, again , much more. Naval battles see a greater spread of huge sailing ships and steamships, a fair balance of damage suffered from cannon shots and greater maneuverability, especially the smaller ones, maintaining their appearance and their depth which were the greatest pride for Empire . Always with a view to historical reconstruction and also to signal a greater emphasis on pitched battles, a campaign is presented exclusively made up of battles (with a lot of imagination called ~Napoleon's Battles~) which retraces the most important stages of the Napoleonic war epic (Austerlitz , Moscow, Pyramids up to obviously Waterloo). Although the difficulty, both on the strategic map and on the battlefield, turns out to be quite high, this is more due to the limited time available for the objectives than to the AI of enemies and allies, still to be perfected. The computer always tends to attack, even when it would be convenient for him to stay in defense, and moreover he always does it with the same tactic, sending the cavalry to slaughter first and then charging with the infantry - and to say that it was Napoleon himself who taught that there could be no cavalry charge without infantry input - and sometimes holding units in reserve for no real reason; moreover, he often tends to abandon the cannons to their fate, which are invariably reached and destroyed by the player's light cavalry. By increasing the level of difficulty, unfortunately, it is not so much the AI that improves tactics, but rather the soldiers who transform into supermen, without ever fleeing and making dozens of deaths in a single discharge, contrary to your soldiers who suddenly become weaker. Together The proposals for multiplayer are also interesting: during the single player campaign, the fun possibility of searching for an opponent on the net to play a battle against a human instead of against the PC's AI, instead of finding someone waiting for a game fast, but even more interesting is finally the possibility of playing the campaigns on the internet in the company of a friend. Both Italy and Africa and Europe are now in fact open to the conquests of players on the big network, which will make it difficult not to find someone willing to play: set the duration of the rounds and the frequency of the saves, put on the tricorn and good clash at all.", "date": "2010-02-18", "grade": "8.6"}
