Unfortunately, despite the good premises, the realization is, as they say, deficient in many aspects. However, let's start by illustrating the merits of this small independent production, created by a solitary developer. The protagonist wakes up on the beach of an Irish island in the throes of a strong amnesia. Why is it there? What has he forgotten about his past that oppresses him so much? The grainy effect makes some texts unintelligible, but fortunately it can be deactivated The whole story will revolve around these simple questions and will take the player to explore the island in search of the truth. The environment is fascinating and, despite the presence of buildings of various types, is in a total state of abandonment. It's night; darkness, wind and rain oppress our wanderings in an environment made up of beaches, ruined buildings and a large number of objects scattered everywhere, almost all of which can be examined. In some cases, the exploration is interrupted by short narrative sequences, which will compose the puzzle that divides us from the ... disappointing ending. Without revealing anything about the plot, it is undeniable that we expected much more from a title almost completely focused on the narrative side and on the atmosphere, the latter well built. We understand that we are only at the end of the first episode, but with such a conclusion the interest in continuing to follow the events is really close to zero. The puzzles are typical of a graphic adventure, with items to collect and use with other elements of the scenario. We will talk about the difficulties in finding the items and backtracking in the next paragraphs. Here we want to limit ourselves to pointing out the ~strangeness~ of some puzzles. In titles of this kind, the puzzles can be purely mechanical, or they can accompany the emotions of the characters with creative and thoughtful ideas. In both cases, however, they are context-related. In Montague's Mount they seem randomly placed. For example: why to lower a bridge you have to insert colored energy cells by placing them in the order suggested by a marine buoy using the Morse code? Mystery. We don't mind surreal puzzles, but the problem is that in this case they claim to be mechanical and, therefore, should be as logical as possible. In general however, despite the forcings, the puzzles are not bad, also because they have to be solved a few at a time and understanding their composition never takes too long... as long as you manage to find the objects necessary for the undertaking. Montague's Mount is the search for the truth about the past of the slowest man in the history of video games Crawling on the memory wire Each feature of a video game can work or not depending on the context in which it is placed and the other elements that surround it. In Montague's Mount it seems that every choice has been made more to lengthen the broth than for merely playful needs. The result is disastrous and nullifies what good the game has to offer. We had to activate the aids to discover the existence of that square But let's take a few examples to clarify the situation. Let's start with the first plague that the player will have to deal with: the search for objects. The game starts on a desolate beach filled with stuff scattered across the sand. The aim of the player is to search for a support stick before being able to open a wooden gate that will give him access to the interior of the island. Unfortunately, the protagonist's movements are greatly slowed down by a wound. Not bad, one might say, except that it is difficult to identify the object we are looking for at first glance, since it is well hidden among the others, and we have spent more than ten minutes wandering around at the speed of a crippled snail the limited area to explore, also disadvantaged by the grain of the image which makes the scenario difficult to read. Having found the stick on which to support our poor limbs, the speed increased significantly and we were able to open the gate; unfortunately it hasn't increased enough to prevent the second major problem plaguing Montague's Mount: backtracking. Now, do you think it is normal to be asked to go back and forth over an average large area while driving a character who walks very slowly and cannot run? Unfortunately this is not a sporadic case that occurs at the beginning and is then resolved, but it is a real rule that accompanies the story until the end. So let's see: difficult to see objects (only in the first area there is an essential one hidden in a very dark spot), slowness of protagonist, constant backtracking... What's missing? Ah yes, an incomplete save system peppered with blocking bugs that force you to reload the game. How to forget so much suffering suffered to write this review? A true story But let's take another direct example of gameplay and take a situation that has particularly affected us negatively and which sums up all the defects of the game in one fell swoop. To illustrate it properly we will have to give you some anticipation of the story so skip the rest of the paragraph if you don't want to have any. We are on a beach looking for some object that can open a gate blocked by a beam. We have leverage with us, but what can we do about it? After a long search, which lasted several tens of minutes, we discover the secret: there is a crack on the plate in front of the gate. How many times have we had to watch the filmed sequence of photos due to bugs? How come we hadn't seen her right away? Maybe because the crack doesn't look like a crack but is a gray square drawn on a gray object? Never mind, we finally managed to pass and that's the important thing... it doesn't matter that in the meantime we've walked back and forth along the first stretch of beach at least four times. Once on the other side we find ourselves in front of a cave closed by a sort of gate, on which there is a sheet with four numbers written on it (to read them we had to deactivate the grain effect of the images which made it difficult to distinguish some of the figures ). In front of the portcullis is a mechanism that is missing a piece. Understanding what to do is quite easy: you have to find the missing piece, but where? Exploring the area we discover a small safe hidden in the bushes. Without asking ourselves what a safe is doing in that place, we insert the four digits we have just found to open it and take a small screw from inside, which we insert into the mechanism, discovering that... it is gigantic. How did it get into the safe? More mystery. Using another object with the screw, we manage to open the cave and enter. We find ourselves in front of a kind of altar. A filmed sequence starts, formed by a zoom of more than two minutes on a table with photos attached to it. After looking at it we are going to explore the area in search of objects but we find ourselves stuck in the scenario (it had already happened before, but it had never led to such dramatic results). After making a few attempts to free ourselves, we understand that there is only one way to continue: load the last checkpoint (the saves are not free, unfortunately). Remember: too much backtracking can kill you and your gonads And here Montague's Mount decides to show us all its smallness. We find ourselves in front of the portcullis of the cave which opens by itself (it takes more than a few seconds). A little bad. We just have to go back into the cave and... no, what anguish, we have to look at the sequence of photos. Unfortunately, there is no way to skip it. At the end of the sequence we explore what can be explored, take what can be taken and leave the cave. Apparently the way back is closed: the gate that we freed earlier is blocked by a barrel and a beam (does it seem bad to walk over it, given that it is only a few centimeters high?). We search the beach for a way to unblock the passage, but after more than half an hour of searching we are forced to give up. What to do if not go looking for a solution on the web? Unfortunately (how many ~unfortunately~ in this review) by doing so we discover the horror: there was nothing to find. the game loaded the objects badly, which theoretically should have been positioned leaving the passage free, and effectively blocked us on the beach. The only way to pass is to try to reload the last checkpoint, look at the shutter that opens, look at the sequence of photos, take back all the objects, go back to the gate and... find it blocked again. To continue you can only load an even older save ...
