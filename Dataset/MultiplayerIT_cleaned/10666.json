Well, Damnation lacks even something like that, it actually has basically nothing that works. It's not clear to us how it was able to reach the next generation systems and honestly it doesn't matter: having said that, you could go directly to the Commentary, but we hope we have intrigued you enough to read the rest of this review. It's a dirty job but someone has to do it... Why me? Damnation offers a rather original plot: the story is in fact set during the Civil War in an alternative timeline in which a bad guy, Prescott, has started selling weapons to both factions, prolonging the conflict by several decades and transforming the nation in a wasteland with steampunk tones, where robots and cowboys march at the same time. The protagonist of Damnation, Hamilton Rourke, will have to face the armies of Prescott and find his missing girlfriend, proceeding from one stage to another. Damnation's merits end here, the fairly original plot soon gives way to the videogame quintessence of nonsense and a carousel of bugs, glitches and development that really leaves you perplexed, considering which machines the Codemasters product runs on. Technically the game is less than mediocre: the settings are bare, flat, textured so badly that they recall the first generations of PSOne video games. The design of the structures and buildings, which play an important role in the gameplay, is absolutely nonsensical and without logic. The polygonal models of the protagonists and enemies show a very banal design and animations so woody as to make it difficult to distinguish a robot from a human being: Rourke, moreover, lacks the slightest charisma and considering that the inspiration of his creators seems to have been the Gunslinger Roland Deschain, protagonist of Stephen King's The Dark Tower, we can say that their ~ka~ doesn't work so well. In the midst of all this, there are truly incredible programming errors: interpenetration of polygonal models and textures, vehicles that glide on the ground and sometimes merge with it, poorly implemented particle effects and badly synchronized explosions. To complete this bleak technical picture, a low quality audio sector could not be missing: mediocre music and decidedly uninspired dubbing. Playstation 3 trophies Damnation features 13 Bronze, 7 Silver, 7 Gold, and 1 Platinum trophies. To get these rewards you have to complete the game on various difficulty levels or perform some particular tasks such as killing certain amounts of enemies in various ways. Damn! Wanting to be generous, the control system in Damnation is quite intuitive and in a few minutes you learn to perform each of Rourke's motor skills without too many worries. The usefulness of these, however, is immediately questioned. Essentially, what Blue Omega Entertainment wanted to develop was a sort of acrobatic shooter: a potentially interesting feature of Damnation is in fact the possibility of climbing and jumping from one building to another to reach the end of the stage, in the meantime shooting at everything that it moves. However, the experiment fails when the poverty of the animations makes any performance of the protagonist improbable: especially after seeing similar mechanics in inFamous or Assassin's Creed, one is left appalled by the collision problems of Damnation. And then comes the time when you shoot enemies: the amount of weapons available in addition to the default pistols is modest, but the real problem is the resistance of the opponents who need several shots to be killed. We could talk about high difficulty at this point, and so it would be if our opponents didn't get stuck without showing a shred of strategy, seeking shelter or attacking us wisely. But no, they stay there, getting riddled, without a shot being fired. Boredom which, moreover, is a predominant element in a multiplayer mode that practically nobody plays online, where the maps are not selected based on the number of players, leading to situations in which one wanders around a stage for minutes in search, perhaps, of the only opponent in the game.", "date": "2009-06-29", "grade": "3.0"}
