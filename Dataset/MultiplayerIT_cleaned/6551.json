Before giving you any further explanations, read the review of Cities XL 2012 by Rosario Salatiello. If you look at the cons it says ~lack of novelty~. If we had put an image of Cities XL Platinum you wouldn't have noticed it Now let's jump to the Cites XL 2011 review. What can be read in the cons? ~After the collapse of the online component for the 2009 edition, this new chapter is a sort of big patch~. Let's rebuild for the slowest: the 2012 edition was not very original compared to the 2011 edition which in turn seemed like a big patch of the 2009 one. If you want we can add that in 2013 Cities XL Platinum was released, a sort of definitive version of Cities XL 2012 with all the additional content released over the months, as well as various bugfixes and gameplay adjustments. You should have figured it out by yourself by now, but it's better to clarify: the main difficulty we found in reviewing Cities XXL was that the more we played it, the more we were amazed at how similar it was... no, not similar, identical to the previous edition, to the point that we could take one of the reviews above and use almost all of the concepts without hesitation. Wishing we could kill Salatiello, delete the article and then propose it again with an extra X in the title and there would be no problems of coherence. We have often talked about titles similar to their predecessors, but in the vast majority of cases it is a way of saying to indicate that there is little originality in the gameplay or in the plot or in other aspects. In this case, unfortunately, the statement must be interpreted ruthlessly literally. We reviewed Cities XXL, but in fact we already reviewed it at the time of Cities XL Platinum The news... It takes very little to list the new features in Cities XXL: we have support for multicores, a few more buildings among the advanced ones and a general revision of the interface, which is even difficult to realize and which, frankly, does not improve then who knows how much that of Cities XL Platinum. Let's say that the impression is that some buttons have been moved and some irrelevant options have been added, just to be able to claim to have made some changes. The basic functions have remained identical to those of the past. For the rest we have the same game dynamics, the same progression, the same buildings, the same buildings, the same vehicles and pedestrians and so on. In short, you take virgin territory, build land on it and watch the urban fabric grow, intervening where the requests become more pressing. Is there a lack of work for the workers? Factories or shops are built. Do you need executives for tech companies? Building areas are built dedicated to the upper middle class. Do we have a beautiful lake to exploit? Then we build hotels for tourists and so on. When our city has reached a considerable size and is well characterized from an economic point of view, profitable exchanges can be started with other cities in order to compensate for what we lack and, perhaps, earn something from the surplus. The trouble is that we did exactly the same things in Cities XL Platinum, with the same results, because graphically not even half a step forward has been made and the recycling of three-dimensional models is total. The same goes for multiplayer, where innovations can be counted on the fingers of a one-armed hand. It is worth considering Cities XXL only if you have never tried a title in the series, otherwise it is better to wait for the imminent Cities Skylines of Colossal Order, which at least promises some novelty from a visual and gameplay point of view.", "date": "2015-02-20", "grade": "4.0"}
