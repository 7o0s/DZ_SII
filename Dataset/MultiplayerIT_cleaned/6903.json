Although not the alternative to the most famous competitive shooters, Garden Warfare perfectly manages to transport its peculiar style in the field of third-person shooters, forcefully stating that behind a ~cute~ and ~nice~ look there is also a lot substance. plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare arrives on PlayStation 4, plants on the assault! War behind the house In this new review we will not dwell on the examination of all the contents, for that there is the full-bodied judgment of February, but we will try to tell the sensations that the game offers. But first, however, there is the dutiful summary of what we find on the disc, which we remind you is sold at the budget price of 39.90. All the DLCs released so far, namely Garden Variety Pack, Zomboss Down and Tactical Taco Party Pack. However, the last Suburbination is missing. A substantial package of extra classes, maps and modes which, therefore, immediately expand the game's potential without paying extra money. So here's the chance to test ourselves with the fun (but also exhausting) Gnomba mode, or rather take the ~bomb~ and bring it to the opponent's base, but also Confirmed Elimination, re-edition in Plants Vs. Zombies sauce of the now classic Call of Duty Kill Confirmed. The contents therefore do not seem to be missing, for up to twelve players per team, with the game modes played ~smoothly~ or with the various customizations activated, which change not only the appearance of plants and zombies but also the effectiveness of their weapons. Plants and zombies are therefore the absolute protagonists of the game. The third person view allows us to admire their design, but above all their diversification into classes is really well done, each with its own ~nemesis~, and capable of greatly diversifying the gameplay, thanks to the primary weapon and three special skills both defensive and offensive. In fact, the cooperative thrust is also (and above all) strong in competitive games, with the characters representing the cartoon version of tanks, healers, stormtroopers and so on. The appearance is ~cute~ and ~nice~, but the dynamics are much more complex, with the most heated matches requiring an iron teamwork to win. Team play that we also find in the total cooperative mode Operation Garden, 3D version of the original tower defense, with increasingly difficult and demanding waves, with the possibility of also counting on extra ~consumable~ plants to be planted when needed. However, they can also be used in competitive multiplayer. The progression and growth of the two factions takes place in a linear, decidedly guided, but no less interesting way. The three skills are unlocked by completing the ~challenges~ related to the class, therefore perfect as an advanced tutorial to understand the characteristics of each single plant and zombie, consequently all must be played to completely dissect the title. Without forgetting that the upgrades pass through the purchase of packs of stickers with the money earned in the game, thanks to which, in addition to aesthetic and consumable accessories, it is possible to obtain real sub-classes that significantly alter the basic character. It goes without saying that some figurines can be very rare and expensive. We can spend real money to buy game currency, but you just need to give the title some time to have the coins needed to move forward with the progression. Playstation 4 trophies plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare rewards the player with 56 trophies that push us to explore the game in its entirety, in both competitive and cooperative multiplayer. In the latter, for example, you have to be successful at all levels of difficulty, while in the classic multiplayer you have to perform decidedly complex actions, with all weapons and with all classes, to prove that you are a ~pro~ on all fronts. There is (almost) everything Where the game wins, however, is in the apt characterization of the characters and in the fun dynamics of the combat of the game. Both plants and zombies, although they are the emblem of the ~round~ and cartoonish look, go into battle with a good war face, look at the sunflower when it heals its companions or the pea shooter who seems to rejoice during a killcam. The maps, very colorful and (only) fairly large, are made on purpose to make the most of all the class features of thetwo factions. There is never a shortage of roofs to climb on, numerous defiles, underground passages, ~dynamic events~ and many covers to hide behind. The more staid pace of the game compared to any Call of Duty imposes a much slower speed and less possibility of carrying out circus maneuvers, both in defense and attack. Stopping and hiding can be a good solution, it being understood that bazookas, explosive beans, and various flying drones can knock out the most fearful ~campers~ without too much difficulty. Game dynamics, however, discreetly refined, perfectly inserted within the paper, scissors, stone, chaotic mechanisms at the right point, but still less punitive than competitive first-person titles. However, we are not talking about a perfect title, despite all the DLC there is a need for more content, especially as regards the game modes (the modes without customizations are not exactly attractive) and the quantity of maps, but given the price and the decidedly non-hardcore target, the game offer is respectable. Guaranteed fun for a gaming experience different from those usually beaten, but in the long run it undoubtedly loses the challenge with the usual annual competitors. On a technical level, the small jump in resolution, from 900p in the Xbox One version to 1080p, gives Garden Warfare a more defined look, without however distorting its overall look, on the other hand, the cartoon style is not the most suitable for highlighting hyper textures. detailed. The game lets itself be watched with great pleasure without a doubt, but it is certainly not a champion in showing off the muscles of Frostbite 3.", "date": "2014-09-20", "grade": "8.3"}
