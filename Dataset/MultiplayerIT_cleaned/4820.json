It takes very little to ruin them. It is a genre so minimalist and fragile in mechanics that it risks collapsing with every intervention out of place. To understand what we mean, try sticking a baroque angel in an abstract painting by Mondrian and then tell us. It will seem paradoxical, given that we are still talking about video games, but works that live completely on staging cannot afford mechanics that get in their way. The Chinese Room, Campo Santo, Tale of Tales, Giant Squid and others understood it, some more, some less, Act 3 Games instead got caught up in the anxiety of somehow disguising The Fidelio Incident as a video game and ended up weaken it in its essence. The title obviously refers to Beethoven's play, mentioned directly within the adventure, and to which we owe the name of the protagonist's wife, Leonore. If we want between the two Fidelios there is also a commonality of themes, given that in both there is a wife who dedicates herself body and soul to her husband, sacrificing herself for his good. The stories told, however, are very different. Some sequences are really nice from a stylistic point of view The ice inside The Fidelio Incident begins with a plane crash. Leonore and her husband Stanley are flying over the coast of Iceland when the aircraft literally breaks apart in mid-flight and the two find themselves stranded on a frozen island. Back to his senses, Stanley, whose point of view the player will embrace for the entire game, will set out in search of the woman, discovering that she is somewhere on the island stuck under the metal sheets. We don't know how to get to her, but we have a point of reference that the woman herself gives us, contacted via smartphone: black smoke. Here also comes the first game mechanic that ~breaks~ the walk. Leonore tells Stanley to retrieve the pages of her diary scattered in the wreckage. The woman does not want to risk being found by others so as not to reveal their identity. You will have already understood that it is only by reading the diary that you will come to understand the true story of Stanley and Leonore. Finding the pages is very easy - just follow the smoke. The pieces of the exploded airplane have in fact formed small fires that emit white or black smoke and are clearly visible from afar. Reaching the fires, however, does not only serve to discover pieces of the couple's history, but also to warm up Stanley, who if abandoned for too long to the rigidity of Iceland risks dying of hypothermia, with the classic ice effect that gradually fills the screen. Where is the problem, you may be wondering? Well, going in search of the fires ends up weighing on the main mechanics of the game, namely exploration, slowing it down beyond what it should. Themes and problems Walking into The Fidelio Incident isn't as interesting as it should be. The scenario has not been charged with the profound meanings of a Dear Esther or a The Town of Light, nor with the haunting beauty of an Abz, nor with the metanarrative force of a The Beginner's Guide. Of course, the fact that the different areas of the island are linked to the four stages of hypothermia is peculiar and, if you like, the prevailing frost is an allegory of the couple's condition, but that's all. Moreover, having to go hunting for slips of paper also breaks the narrative tension a bit: but how, there is our beloved lady who is seriously in danger of dying and we waste time jumping from one black smoke to another? Fortunately in the second part of the game there is a recovery. Could there be some frozen caves missing? The fires to reach get closer, the scenario becomes more visionary and creative, the few puzzles become slightly more interesting (generally they ask you to find some object or turn some knobs) and the story written in the diary takes shape, making us plunge into problems such as terrorism (we are talking about the Irish one in the second half of the last century), self-confidence, the relationship with parents, love and more. Fortunately, the written story is accompanied by some dream sequences that give strength to Stanley's state of mind and make us understand the drama he is experiencing and why he will decide to end it in a certain way. Too bad for the abuse of clichs that connote the story in a highly rhetorical and personal way, without realizing the weight of what that historic moment was for Northern Ireland. Not that it lacks drama, fortunately, but some narrative solutions are far too overused to really hit. Scattered considerations In short, in The Fidelio Incident you walk, you collect a few objectsi that are used automatically when necessary and one pines for Leonore's fate, both by talking to her on the phone and by reading entries in her diary. To complete the adventure it takes about two hours (doing really everything), which is in line with the average duration of walking simulators. After all, those who love the genre are not very interested in this aspect, just as they are not very interested in hearing about graphics, which we only mention briefly. Sunday, Bloody Sunday The Fidelio Incident is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and, within the limits of the scenario (a snowy desert island), does its job well. However, don't expect technical wonders, even if some places are well done from a stylistic point of view and render very well. In fact, the game gives its best during the ~visions~ of the protagonist, evidently the most well-finished sections. We also point out the excellent soundtrack by Michael Krikorian, who has manipulated some passages of Fidelio adapting them to the atmosphere of the island and to Stanley's moods and has composed other passages following the same style.", "date": "2017-06-08", "grade": "6.5"}
