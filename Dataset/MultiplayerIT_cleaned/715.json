Anyone who wanted to know, probably already knows what it is. It's hard to find someone who has no idea what the new story starring Gordon Freeman is, an atypical scientist with a particular propensity to save the world. However, you never know. It may be that there is someone who, not having a PC equipped enough to run HL 2, has decided to look away and pretend that one of the best games of recent years had not come out, and it may also be that there is someone who, incredibly, has become accustomed to playing Fps comfortably seated in an armchair with a pad in hand, rather than with a mouse and keyboard in front of a monitor. For these people there is work to be done. A beautiful adventure, a continuous crescendo of emotions and level design quality, starting from an escape on the roofs of City 17, crowded with persecuting soldiers and resistance fighters, up to the epilogue in the center of evil, without taking a breath. what will remain with you is a constant progression of quality with some truly memorable phases City 17 Really, what amazes about Valve's work is the quality and care placed in level design, it is the ability to be able to make a series of levels with the most varied mechanics cohesive, so as to give the idea of a long journey which, among many different locations, it recomposes itself in a spatial continuum in which one never loses one's bearings. Some sections are, to be honest, longer than others and seem more gimmicks to increase the longevity of the title, but what will remain with you is a constant progression of quality with some truly memorable phases. There is everything in Half Life 2, from the driving sections, to quotes from titles such as Call of Duty, to the platform sections, up to that little gem that is Ravenholm, an evident homage to the school of survival horror, so much out of context , how damn funny. Technology that oppresses and liberates, science that teaches and hides, the lies and truths of a succession of emotions such as those that only the best films and best books can arouse. Mechanics. In Half Life 2 you collect a variety of weapons, tons of ammo and shoot. We understand each other, it's a Fps. However, it's not just that. Strengthened by the implementation of the Havok Engine, for the first time, a video game goes further and makes a lavish use of physics, no longer just an aesthetic tinsel to make the sequences more captivating, but a real pivot of the gameplay. In the game, in fact, you are soon equipped with a weapon that allows you to attract objects to yourself, to throw them and to interact with the seabed. First, you are introduced into Valve's design as spectators, gradually realizing the potential of your vehicles, and then find yourself rummaging through the pixels in search of solutions to overcome obstacles and levels in the best, fastest or most creative way. depending on your inspiration. If a wall of creatures stands in front of us there is never a single solution, and it goes from spilling tons of lead, to throwing a can of paint at the eyes of a zombie and then eliminating it with crowbars, once he is no longer able to see us. The fact is that Half Life 2 is one of those rare cases of design balance whereby, whatever type of approach one decides to adopt to progress, what will not change will be the degree of satisfaction felt and the precision with which all the various pieces go to get stuck. The shooter phases are exciting, as are the platform ones or those in which you have to extricate yourself to overcome the small puzzles that punctuate Gordon Freeman's adventure Mechanics. The shooter phases are exciting, as are the platform ones or those in which you have to extricate yourself to overcome the small puzzles that punctuate Gordon Freeman's adventure. The only exception is the driving sections, on which the developers have insisted a little too much, but which offer two of the most beautiful sunsets we have ever seen in a video game. Not to be forgotten, however, is the fact that in Half Life 2 for Xbox there is no online mode of any kind, neither versus nor cooperative, and that, once the credits of the main adventure have been reached, all that remains is to face it at a higher difficulty level or bask in the memory of the 15/18 hours it takes to complete the game at a normal level. Mechanics. Audiovisual Half Life 2 is still one of the most satisfying visual experiences on PC today. Without the excesses of the normal mapping of the ID engine and Doom 3, the Source is able to give breathtaking visuals even on Xbox. He spies on themgges that line Highway 17, the cliffs that border Nova Prospect, up to the cold metal of the buildings of City 17, any excuse is good to snatch a sigh of admiration from the player with a continuous tension to discover what comes next. Of course, many elements of the port had to be scaled down in order for the game to run on the Microsoft console, but the end result is stunning. The textures of the characters' clothes are sometimes just mentioned and the frame rate, especially in areas full of water and therefore full of effects, tends to limp, even if never to jeopardize the fun that the player feels. Frankly, we didn't think that Valve would be able to replicate the visual experience of the original so faithfully, which remains essentially unchanged and capable of rendering the same emotions as the PC counterpart. Provided that we turn a blind eye to the compromises that programmers have had to make, inevitably. The audio deserves a separate discussion. If on the one hand the musical recordings are perfect and the work done by the technicians on the sound effects is excellent, the same cannot be said of the dubbing, which does not support a fair translation work. The voices in the game, all dubbed in Italian, sound aseptic in too many situations. Comment The life of a console is full of compromises and Half Life 2 for Xbox has to accept several in order to be able to run on hardware that is now four years old behind it, managing to make the gaming experience as amazing as the original. For this alone Valve deserves applause, because, textures and frame rates aside, their latest jewel is perfectly enjoyable in the twilight of the Microsoft console and is a more than faithful reflection of the best PC game of 2004. After the online orgy of Halo 2 , another masterpiece appears in the Xbox toy library and that, if you don't have a computer that can handle it, it's almost an obligation to try to play and complete. A year after its release, Half Life 2 remains the best single player shooter a player can experience and it would be a mistake to miss this last chance to enjoy the sci-fi epic from Valve. Pros: Surprising adaptation work Unparalleled Level Design Exciting like few others Cons: Lack of online mode Textures not always defined and dancer frame rate A year has passed since the publication of Half Life 2 for PC and still, despite a good dose of top-level titles, Valve's game is up there looking down on a genre that, to say something new, knows only what cards to play play. With a lot of noise, Half Life 2 has created a series of waves that have yet to break in the sea of memories, thanks to a community of modders who are doing everything with Source, the engine that moves the game. Strengthened by its pace and regardless of the launch of Xbox 360, HL 2 arrives on Xbox with a conversion that is surprising for how it brings, on a four year old machine, one of the most beautiful games of the latest generation personal computers and which, despite lacking any multiplayer modes, every player should try to complete.", "date": "2005-12-06", "grade": null}
