We are in this case in front of a virtual reality shooter for PlayStation VR, which to function necessarily requires the use of two Move controllers and puts us in the role of a special agent whose voice will certainly be familiar to you, since it is that of Doug Cockle, former interpreter of Geralt of Rivia in the series The Witcher. Tire, this is the name of the protagonist of the game, is sent by helicopter, together with a sexy colleague, to an island shrouded in mystery where a person seems to be trying to discover the secrets of immortality. At one point the aircraft is shot down by a monster and our character wakes up in chains, but is helped to free himself by an unlikely youtuber who has come to that place to get the scoop of life. In fact, legend has it that real dragons live on the island, and the possibility of filming one in the flesh was an essential attraction for the eccentric network star. Story and gameplay In fact, few elements are enough to understand how the narrative sector of Immortal Legacy: The Jade Cipher is actually a very inconsistent patchwork, in which the authors have slipped everything without an apparent solution of continuity, passing from Tire's memories to monsters in the caves and playing the fanservice card from time to time as well. A brief flashback serves as a tutorial to try to get familiar with a rather wooden and unintuitive control system, which undoubtedly stands as the least successful thing in the game. The problem is that to meet the complexity of any maneuver, inevitably the artificial intelligence of the enemies is also leveled down, and so you will see the mercenaries first and then the monsters keep their position waiting to be hit, repeating a few patterns that become immediately very predictable. As mentioned, it is necessary to have a pair of Move controllers to play, but in our opinion it could very well have opted for the simple DualShock and perhaps obtained a less mangy layout, capable of guaranteeing a more immediate experience in most cases. In fact, the movement system involves pressing the Move keys to advance and tilting the viewer to make detours, after which the central buttons of the devices are used symmetrically in order to quickly rotate the view, resort to lateral strafe, retreat and open two separate inventories, one for the right hand and one for the left, in which to store weapons and objects. Once a pistol or rifle is equipped, it is possible to open fire by obviously pressing the trigger on the controller, but you have to get used to an aiming mechanism that is a little obscure at first, which can give some satisfaction but also waste a lot of ammunition uselessly. To remedy this lack, a laser sight can be activated which ends up, however, making the experience a little too easy and banal, especially where headshots are scored. Playstation 4 trophies Immortal Legacy: The Jade Cipher includes a total of thirty-seven Trophies with a rather ambiguous and oriental description. Many achievements are obtained by completing certain actions for the first time, using the arsenal thoroughly, exploring the scenario well in search of secrets and documents, but also incurring the game over in the most imaginative ways. Technical realization In short, it takes a lot of effort to move and fight decently in Immortal Legacy: The Jade Cipher, but it must be recognized that after a couple of hours the situation improves a bit and quite interesting situations are introduced, provided you don't wonder too much about the progression of events. The introduction of some puzzles, for example, is more than welcome and at first succeeds in shuffling the cards a bit, but this aspect too soon falls victim to a certain degree of repetitiveness. However, the game boasts a moderate duration, superior to many other experiences available on PlayStation VR: it takes about five hours to complete, which for a sale price of just 19.99 is certainly an important advantage. Unfortunately, however, there is little else to get excited about, and also on the front of technical realization the limits of Chinese production are immediately afloat. Yes, some polygonal models are well made, but the enemies are terribly old-gen, angular and with few animations. Similarly, the scenarios appavisually they are a bit too monotonous and generic, with an excessive abundance of rocks that repeat themselves to exhaustion and therefore fail to best communicate the atmosphere that the title tries to build during the most tense sequences, those where it can escape even a jump from the chair. The voice of the protagonist is good, as mentioned, but from the perspective of a sound sector that in general does not shine.", "date": "2019-04-24", "grade": "6.0"}
