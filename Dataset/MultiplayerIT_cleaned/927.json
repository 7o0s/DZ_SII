Technically, however, the work done by The Collective is decidedly good on both versions we tested. The models of all the protagonists are treated perfectly and closely resemble the actors who play them on the big screen. The animations are quite accurate and varied, even if sometimes a little woody. The scenarios, unfortunately sometimes damaged by a camera that crashes, have been recreated to perfection, with the possibility sometimes of interacting with them, damaging them with our lightsabers. It is very satisfying to move on the screen when the action develops deep in the background, in those situations it really seems to be in the cinema. The frame rate is quite stable even if sometimes we have noticed some drops, especially in the most agitated situations Between the Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions there are no significant differences except for the fact that the version for the Microsoft console supports 480p definition. As far as the audio sector is concerned, we cannot make any criticisms, it is undoubtedly a first-level title, as is the localization in Italian, exclusively on video with subtitles. Comment Summing up, this Episode III Revenge of the Sith is only a decent title, and certainly could have been done better, much better. A classic hack 'n slash with lightsabers instead of punches and kicks, which fails to convince that much precisely because of the defects highlighted in our review: too low a difficulty, limited longevity, no innovation and exasperating linearity . Certainly, however, it will be a title appreciated by enthusiasts, also thanks to a good technical sector, but listen to our advice and go to the cinema before playing the LucasArts title, if you don't want to spoil the surprise. The numerous extras inserted by the developers, and we are not only talking about the bonuses but also the clash mode, one player against another, and the cooperation mode for two players, only slightly increase the charm of this title, but at least we must acknowledge the The Collective for trying. Pros Star Wars and all that means Technically valuable Cons Too easy and linear Not innovative at all No online support Punctual as a chronometer, precise as a Swiss watch, at the same time as the most awaited of the films that make up the Star Wars saga in theaters, the video game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Episode III Revenge of the Sith was released. The wait for the film was incredible, and also the success achieved at the box offices all over the world, the same cannot be said for this umpteenth ~stellar~ title, which passed a bit on the sly after the glories of Kotor 2 and the success of Starwars: Battlefront. The brand is strong, the Star Wars universe is certainly one of the most captivating settings available to any developer, but this brings with it the usual problem of making the most of the official license and all the possibilities offered, so as not to relegate the game exclusively for enthusiasts. The universe imagined by Lucas can not only be the frame, the player must feel captured by the screen and projected into the boundless galaxies having the good fortune to impersonate the favorite character or to become the strongest Jedi knight. Did the developers succeed in Episode III Revenge of the Sith? Not just an advertising product dedicated to enthusiasts but also something else? Follow us in our review to find out. Alone against everyone The fires of the Clone Wars are blazing in every corner of the galaxy. Controlled by the Sith and under the direct leadership of Count Dooku, the Confederacy of Independent Systems has dealt blow after blow to the Republic. Summoned to the battlefront by the Outer Rim, Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker return to Coruscant to find the planet under siege. In an attempt to further plunge the Republic into chaos, the evil cyborg General Grievous has infiltrated the capital and kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. As the Separatist army flees Coruscant with loot, Obi-Wan and Anakin embark on a difficult rescue mission to freeand the prisoner chancellor. The fate of the galaxy rests in their hands, or rather in ours. This is the incipit from which this playful transposition of the third chapter of Star Wars takes off, the plot of the game follows in an absolutely linear way that of the film now on display in theaters. We will guide Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan in the development of the plot, characters on which the title focuses more, deliberately leaving out what happens to the other protagonists. The developers of The Collective, already authors of the video game transposition of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, have basically focused the whole game on pure action. Each mission of the 16 available begins with a video, obviously taken from Lucas's latest cinematic effort, which will serve precisely to paint the situation in which we will find ourselves acting. the plot of the game follows in an absolutely linear way that of the film now in theaters Alone against everyone Of course, those who have not yet seen the film could spoil the surprise, but the excellent quality of these clips should be underlined. Immediately after the cutscene, we will be catapulted to the scene, via a classic third-person view, armed with our lightsaber and the Force. The title is, as we said, mainly based on action and fighting, fortunately the control system is very fluid and easy to use and in a few moments we will be able to duel like perfect Jedi knights, slicing our opponents without a moment's hesitation. Different types of moves can be performed, such as horizontal and vertical cuts with the sword, but also grips and paralyzing attacks achievable through the Force. You also know how satisfying it is to throw an enemy clone against a wall, or against other opponents, and see it explode into a thousand pieces. Unfortunately, the response to the commands given will not always be quick and effective and more than once the doubt will arise: ~Didn't I press the button to parry?? But hadn't I jumped to sink the blow?. Certainly this imprecision definitely ruins the good done at the level of study of the control system, which in the end is nothing more than decent. From these few lines of text you will have understood that the fights will cover the heart of the whole game, a classic hack 'n slash title? Yes and no, the elements are all there but some typical RPG features have been added to make the experience more lasting and engaging. At the end of each mission we will in fact be able to enhance our character, allowing us to learn new strokes and to enhance those already known. Everything already seen and nothing revolutionary. Advance - kill everything around you - keep advancing Revenge of the Sith, as the only distraction from the ~advance-kill everything around you-continue advancing~, presents some scenes in which we will command fixed machine guns, or rather called blaster cannons, interludes certainly not to be remembered with particular emphasis . The game, in addition to not being long enough, each mission lasts between fifteen and twenty minutes, for a total of about 5-6 hours of gameplay, it is absolutely too easy. The robots we will encounter will behave like cannon fodder and present almost no challenge to a sufficiently savvy player. To increase the replayability of the title, at least numerous extras have been included, which will allow us, for example, to play the adventure impersonating Yoda or Darth Wader, an incredible number of concept art and also an alternative ending.", "date": "2005-06-03", "grade": null}
