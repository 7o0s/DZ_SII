For those who have slightly confused ideas about the releases of Winning Eleven in Japan, let's immediately clarify a bit: it is already a consolidated practice by Konami to propose a new episode of the series, churning out a re-edition starring the Japanese championship (renamed J -Legue) and finally release the ~final~ version of the aforementioned title, which in fact becomes the edition with the greatest number of additions and improvements. WE6 Final Edition follows this philosophy slavishly, proving to be an improved title in many respects and which winks at the spectacularity and speed of play. We will rock you Abandoned the Queen soundtrack, the presentation is always of excellent workmanship, but perhaps less inspired than that of the previous episode. The options field initially seems unchanged but in reality it offers several very welcome additions, starting with the editor, which hides in the depths of the Japanese characters the possibility of editing the players of the national teams and all the flags and jerseys of the teams participating in the Master League, updated this season and increased in number. Also noteworthy is the possibility of creating a player from scratch, equipped (during the creation phase) with many variations for each somatic trait, who can now be added directly to the team. Another section that has benefited from additions is that of training, where each test (for a total of six) is proposed in five levels of difficulty that will vary its composition, as in the case of the race between the pins, which will be equipped of five different routes associated with the level of difficulty. Finally, we point out the end-game statistics, enriched in number and equipped with the classic report card for each player, as well as a detailed analysis of the areas covered by their men and a summary of all the main actions that took place during the match. On the pitch Also in this edition Konami has remained ~fond~ of the Renderware graphics engine, which if on the one hand is able to return an exceptional reproduction of the players' movements, on the other hand makes the game lacking in everything concerning the surrounding graphic effects , audience and atmospheric effects in particular. The players who take the field appear slightly stockier than in the previous edition, while the reproduction of the shirts is certainly more appropriate and adequate than what was seen in Pes 2, even if not at the level of the J-League version, a prophet in this sense. Once the game has started, the aspect that most catches the eye is the disproportionate increase in the number of player animations, as well as a whole series of goodies that would be too long to list. The goalkeeper who climbs into the area during a corner kick, his partner who applauds our play after a dangerous action, the many new ways of cheering by the most representative players (one example above all: Vieri who silences the public as in the unfortunate match played against Korea at the World Cup) demonstrate the care taken by the Japanese software house in this regard. The goalkeepers have benefited most from the animation upgrades, spectacular and at the same time very effective, which in fact bring them into line with the excellent general quality of the rest of the players. The refinements made by Konami on the eleven on the pitch are not only spectacular: the slowdowns have disappeared, the reactivity of the players has now reached peaks of excellence, the tracks are a distant memory, the possibility of shooting while running or with the ball at half air (following for example a low cross from the back) the offensive solutions increase, the variety and the spectacularity, an aspect towards which the game tends more. In fact, the increased speed, combined with a greater inclination towards dribbling, shifts the balance of the game towards more solo actions and offensive sprints, with a preference above all for counter-attacks. In fact, a quick pass to one of our players launched on a wing will be enough to allow him to cover a large portion of the field and converge towards the center, thus finding himself alone in front of the goalkeeper. Even the physics of the ball has been further perfected, with the Fevernova ball intact in its beauty and finally free of the trail during the most powerful shots. On the other hand, some perplexity arises on the occasion of shots from outside the area, which take place at an excessively high speed, and for the values of some players, perhaps a little too high compared to the ~supporting actors~. Same thing with regard to some game tackles, where sometimes the ball seems to be too lightera. As previously mentioned, the graphic detail has not undergone major upheavals, however the creation of the textures appears more defined and brilliant, with a use of less washed out and more vivid colors. The sound commentary is entrusted as always to the voice of John Kabira, while the choirs maintain fairly humble tones, even if the possibility remains to unlock the call names and personalized chants following a victorious statement of the Konami Cup with the club teams. Comment Winning Eleven 6 Final Evolution once again indicates to the gamer where to go when you want to give the ball two digital kicks. The latest title from mother Konami focuses its attention more on variety and spectacularity, without giving up the solid simulation and realistic base of the whole series. The increased speed and some concessions to the physics of the ball may not please everyone, but in this case there is always the J-League alternative, which offers us a more reasoned and realistic version of a football match. Ultimately yet another title not to be missed if you are a fan of football on consoles. Pros Incredible number of animations Great showmanship and fun Many options and improvements in general In two or more it's infinite Cons Sacrifices teamwork a bit in favor of more showmanship. Konami has lately been following a precise common thread with regard to its football simulation: no upheavals but continuous improvement, aimed at distancing even more (as if there were a need) the competition, now unable to find alternative solutions or to get even close to this title. With Final Evolution, chapter number 6 of the series closes, which will also arrive on GameCube for the first time on January 30th.", "date": "2002-12-23", "grade": null}
