{"name": "Calcio vecchio stile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/144902-active-soccer-2-calcio-vecchio-stile.html", "text": "Associating the phrases ~football game~ and ~touch device~ represents a practice that often causes hives, this is because the former belong to a genre that does not go well with the control system of the latter, and today the football titles of more successful on these platforms are represented by light interpretations or focused on specific aspects, rather than on the complete experience. Active Soccer 2, developed by the very Italian Gianluca Troiano, does not reinvent the wheel, but it is an enjoyable football title that evokes, with the necessary exceptions, the atmospheres of Kick Off and Sensible Soccer, offering a complete experience in terms of options and championships. Active Soccer 2 arrives on iOS and Android offering a fun and rewarding football title Think of a game with a frenetic pace, in which it is possible to pass, shoot and set the trajectory even after the shot; all with a virtual stick positioned on the left, and two big buttons (A and B) on the right, whose functions are illustrated thanks to a handy tutorial present in the options menu. With the double tap on the key used for passing, it is possible, for example, to trigger one's partner for a possible triangle, a more or less prolonged pressure of the shot will determine its height. Consecutively sliding twice allows you to perform in one shot, and it's perhaps the only thing that doesn't work much of an otherwise very intelligent control system, which allows you to have fun and give even a minimum of variety to the games, for a setting which veers decidedly on the arcade. In addition it is possible to operate on some parameters such as automatic dribbling, facilitated movements and assisted passes, in such a way as not to lose the ball on the street too frequently, and concentrate on the rest. The result is among the best that we have come to appreciate on a Touch device, Active Soccer 2 works very well for what it aims to do, does not pretend to be simulative but also offers a level of variety and challenge capable of involving for many games. The database of teams available includes 800 clubs and national teams, including most of the European championships and our Serie A, with the names not licensed but at least linked to the city they belong to. In the same way, the 21,000 players present have fictitious names, with an interesting possibility offered by the name editor: instead of proposing granular modifications for each player, Active Soccer 2 allows vowels to be exchanged between them; with the right combination, which you might find among the photos in the article, a tap is enough to find all the real names of the players. For the rest, the game offers the possibility of playing a friendly, even online, the classic personalized tournament and the career mode, the more interesting one in which there is also a light management of transfers, the balance and the squad. There is also a discreet customization from an aesthetic point of view, with the possibility of positioning the field vertically or horizontally, the presence of a dynamic camera (always from above) and the possibility of setting the fluidity between 30 or 60 frames per second, based on the technical characteristics of the device used. There is no shortage of snow and rain, which give that extra touch to a graphic style that recalls Sensible Soccer as mentioned, and which does its honest job in this arcade football game that also works well with the touch control system, and which offers for the most demanding support for iCade and MFI controllers. The last gem is represented by the music of the game, created by that Chris Hlsbeck famous above all for the Turrican soundtrack, and who on this occasion created a cute but obviously pure accompanying tune.", "date": "2015-02-10", "grade": "8.8"}
