{"name": "Camera Caf - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/camera-cafe-recensione.html", "text": "Hours spent at work Camera Caf tries to reproduce the structure of any life simulator by placing it in a context known to the couch potato masses and stripping it of much of its complexity. Starting the game, rather than the masterpiece The Sims, the mediocre The Partners immediately comes to mind even if, testing the title thoroughly, one soon realizes that even this comparison is not appropriate. The only play area available is that of a floor of the company where the two protagonists work (Luca Nervi and Paolo Bitta, who are also the only two controllable characters). The floor is divided into various rooms (the offices, the bathrooms, the meeting room and the ever-present corridor with the coffee machine) which unfortunately offer few interactions. Having chosen which of the two characters to use (each has two pre-set campaigns and a free campaign available) we just have to figure out how to have fun. The campaigns are divided into working days, divided in turn into half days (morning and afternoon) with intervals of lunch break, in which we will have to carry out the main objectives (those of the campaign) without forgetting our work (every day tasks will be assigned by that will take up timeunless you can get someone else to do it). The work goals are rather bland and usually consist of making a few photocopies and a few phone calls. Nothing demanding given that just click on the object with which you have to work (the photocopier for photocopies, the telephone for phone calls and so on) and select the appropriate option to carry out the task (doing so a clock will appear which will show us how long took us to do the whole thing). social interactions In the same way you interact with the characters who populate the office (which are actually those of the show: Silvano, Patty, De Marinis, Alex, and so on). By clicking on it with the left mouse button, you can choose whether to talk about some fixed topic (usually you ask for information about the campaign tasks, if you are on good terms with the character, otherwise you receive annoyed answers) or to talk in general of some topics typical of the character (for example Paolo loves to talk about his family and his Alfa) to try to ingratiate himself with the interlocutor. Each of the available topics corresponds to a reaction that can be positive, negative or neutral. Getting a lot of positive reactions will lead to friendship between the two characters and, in some cases, love. Negative reactions, of course, will make relationships worse. Another way to improve relationships is to offer a coffee (taking it from the special machine). Having good relations with a character will not only mean the possibility of obtaining information but also that of entrusting him with your work. social interactions The fulcrum of the game are, however, the missions of the campaign, which generally all take place in the same way: given a problem you have to talk to all the other characters to understand what to do; once this is done, the solution must be applied. The missions can be of various types but they do not differ much from the classic archetypes even if, it must be admitted, in some cases they have an adventure vein which is not bad. Unfortunately this is one of the few and irrelevant qualities of the game that is overshadowed by the defects. One call too many [C] Social interactions are very limited. What does it remind you of? Unfortunately the function of this shot is; cosmetic only. [/C] The big problem with Camera Caf is that there is almost nothing to do. The dialogues are always identical and run out after talking to the first character, later resulting in a mere task to be overcome as soon as possible. The interactions are few and not at all interesting and, essentially, in the long minutes of the game in which you are not committed to understanding what you need to do to overcome the campaign missions, boredom reigns supreme. The lack of things to do is not mitigated by the interlude dialogues (not dubbed) between Paolo, Luca and the other characters, nor by the possibility of using the shot that made the show famous (which, moreover, has a mere decorative function ). The illusion of comparing Camera Caf with The Sims stops at the main menu, while that of comparing it with the mediocre The Partners lasts more than five minutes of play, just long enough to understand the elementary nature of the system of interpersonal relationships and to understand the limited overall production. There are no reasons to go on ... even if it must be said that to finish the four main campaigns it takes a handful of scarce hours and chand there is no point in participating in a free game because there are no elements that can make it interesting. Even from a technical point of view we are not there. The limitedness of the scenario would certainly have allowed to add a few more details to the bare and repetitive environments, while the models of the characters are of mediocre workmanship and barely recall the real characters of the show. At the sound level we are always on rather poor levels with very few effects and only one music. In short, if we are not faced with a half-disaster, we are close. Hardware boxes All you need to run Camera Caf is a 1GHz processor, 64MB of RAM, a 32MB graphics card and 500MB of free hard disk space. The game was tested on a 3.4 GHz P4 equipped with 2GB of RAM and a 256MB GeForce 7800 GT graphics card and gave no problems whatsoever. Final comment There is very little to add to what has been said in the review. Camera Caf is a poorly made game that doesn't save itself from any point of view and that perhaps will only be of interest to fans of the television series although I wonder why fans should always be considered so badly. Pros Simple simple interface The characters are nice The price Cons Give me something to do! I BEG YOU! Very limited interactions. Technically mediocre Reduced to pixels Raise your hand if you don't know the Camera Caf show. Come on, the one in which all the action is framed by a POV of one of those infernal machines that dispense coffee in offices. Surely you will have happened to see it, even if only for a moment, turning between the various television channels. As has become the tradition of recent years, a successful television broadcast corresponds to a video game. Among the examples that we can cite, how can we forget the game of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, that of Big Brother and that of Inheritance? More than in the case of games taken from cinematographic films, those taken from television broadcasts are noted for the overall paucity (technical or content) of the achievements. Will this Camera Caf rise above the average? Obviously not.", "date": "2005-12-28", "grade": null}
