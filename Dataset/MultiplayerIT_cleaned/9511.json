Originally expected to be distributed at the launch of the new generation of Xbox Series X and S consoles, even a year ago, the new work of 343 Industries has instead undergone a substantial postponement after being shown at the general public for the first time. A reveal that, we all remember, generated such a mass of criticism regarding the graphic and technical aspect, as to force Microsoft and the developer to rethink some fundamental aspects of the work. And so we found a divided and diluted Halo Infinite in our hands: the free to play multiplayer available for everyone in beta version as early as mid-November, the single player campaign, subject of this review, published on December 8 through Xbox Game Pass and in a packaged version, with the co-op mode postponed to a later date together with the Forge, the creative mode capable of extending the life cycle of the title. The Halo Infinite review that you are reading right now therefore focuses exclusively on the main campaign, well aware that, for now, it is possible to face it exclusively alone, without being able to access that cooperative mode that has always characterized the launch of each chapter of Halo. In our opinion, a very important lack especially in the light of today's panorama so poor in coop experiences, but which sooner or later 343 Industries will fill with an update. Until then, if you want to play Halo Infinite with other players, you will have to ~limit yourself~ to the multiplayer that we have reviewed with a dedicated article. History Master Chief in all his glory Leaving aside the numerous spin-offs and secondary chapters of the series, Halo Infinite is configured as the sixth main episode of the Master Chief saga and in particular as the third chapter of the Reclaimer trilogy inaugurated with Halo 4 and continued with Halo 5: Guardians. The narration is set about a year and a half after this last episode, representing a very direct sequel. We will leave it to you to find out whether or not this is the final chapter of this second trifecta to avoid any form of spoiler, but it is still important to highlight a couple of crucial elements of the story of Halo Infinite that will help you manage your hype and become aware of the narration of this game. First of all, the guys at 343 Industries have this time decided to play it safe after the perhaps too elaborate drift of Guardians. Luckily, we add. The story of Halo Infinite is in fact entirely focused on that triplet of elements that has always made the narrative arc of the series excellent and distinctive: Master Chief, Cortana and Halo. You will therefore always and exclusively be in the armor of John-117 in a desperate search for the artificial intelligence that has repeatedly accompanied, betrayed, found and deluded the Spartan. In the background, one of the familiar ring planets, in this case the installation 07, better known as Zeta Halo. Alongside this trilogy of familiar and characterizing elements of the saga, we find a number of recurring elements that return to the scene as if to underline how much Infinite is at times more a best of Halo than a real sequel: the recurring enemy is represented by the Exiles and their ruthless campaign to conquer the ring. For the uninitiated, it is a diverse group of well-known aliens gathered under the dictatorial leadership of a group of Brutes. Thus we find Grunts, Elites, Jackals, Hunters, Drones and the Brutes themselves, with all their variants, characterizations, weapons and means of transport that have accompanied us in these 20 years of Xbox and Halo. The new artificial intelligence that will accompany Master Chief: the Weapon There will even be some references to the Oracles and clearly at our side we will find the Marines of the UNSC with their characteristic paraphernalia accompanied by the usual group of vehicles and aircraft that have made the Halo universe famous and characteristic. To counteract this desire of 343 Industries to respect, almost not touch, what are the archetypes of Halo, there is the nature of the campaign that partially abandons the linear structure with large levels in favor of an open world map with progressive objectives, collectibles and secondary activities. A first time for the series that deserves a dutiful study inthis review. The open world of Halo Infinite A part of the Zeta Halo map The open world component is certainly the most unprecedented and original element of Halo Infinite, the one on which 343 Industries has also repeatedly paid attention to underline the desire to break a traditional linearity perhaps today considered anachronistic for a first person shooter. Francesco Serino in the previous test of the campaign had already talked about it in great detail therefore, in this review, we will try more than anything else to express our evaluations on this structure. Go through a couple of initial linear missions which act as tutorials and allow you to become familiar with Master Chief, the enemies and the gunplay of the saga, Halo Infinite catapults the player into its open structure that goes well with the freedom transmitted by the artificial nature of the ring planet. In reality, the work done by the developer intelligently tries to ~confine~ the player in the early hours of the campaign to keep his wanderings under control and give an adequate sense of progression. This mainly happens by dividing the Zeta Halo map into a series of macros- areas that cannot all be reached immediately, but require some ~structural~ interventions interconnected with the continuation of the story. In this way the degree of challenge and the sense of discovery do not end in the very first hours of the game, but the gameplay takes us by the hand for longer than other completely free open worlds in both first and third person have usually accustomed us. Through the fast travel we will always be able to retrace our steps and move to the parts of the map already crossed and freed, while the fragmented composition of Zeta Halo will prevent us from moving forward sooner than necessary.Once the flying vehicles have been unlocked, about halfway through the campaign, we will instead be able to go around the entire map without any limitations whatsoever, with the clear exception of the story missions which will follow their natural order. In fact, the game tends to divide the quests relating to the story in a very rigid way and all the rest that is relegated to a mere secondary activity that can be freely tackled to unlock some collectible, a special weapon or a skill point for the Spartan armor of Master Chief. The Jackals in Halo Infinite The main quest therefore has a very linear and precise continuation that often consists of long missions in indoor environments, complete with loads to break the rhythm of the action, while in the free map we will be able to carry out basically only three activities: free the bases (which become fast travel points) or marines captured by the Outcasts, kill special enemies, which are nothing but enhanced versions of normal mobs scattered around the map, collect a large number of collectibles that allow you to upgrade Master Chief, unlock some ' of skins for multiplayer and listen to a vast repertoire of audio recordings of key figures in the history of the Halo franchise. A little bit for what, ultimately, is the most heralded feature of this sequel. In reality, all the contradictions of Halo Infinite emerge precisely in the open world: its multiple souls that try to coexist in the same place, but which sometimes punch each other. We are convinced that when this chapter can be played in coop, its open world will gain a depth and thickness that today, alone or at the most accompanied by a small group of marines controlled by artificial intelligence, it just can't achieve. come out. Real secondary missions or in any case additional narrative lines separate from the main quest would probably have helped and instead in Infinite there is a main story, linear and schematic and a rich handful of ancillary elements that fill the large spaces of the map but which, concretely, result in shootings and collection of objects without any narrative element that connects them. We dedicate a small digression to the progression system of Master Chief who, during the campaign, will be able to access a series of suit upgrades Mjolnir. These will unlock some gadgets such as the grappling hook, a shield to be thrown on the ground, a proximity sensor and small jetpacks to perform a quick lateral sprint. Each of these skills, which can be called up with one of the backbones, can be enhanced by spending the Spartan cores found in the open world to earn further passive bonuses and thus further define our style of play. The close-up of a Brute While we're at it, let's add a comment right on the main campaign since even in this area, Halo Infinite is not all rosy, unfortunately. While appreciating the epic tone of the story and a whole series of archetypes of the saga that are celebrated here, it is the very composition of the missions that has not fully convinced us. In fact, with the exception of a couple of quests that force us to free or destroy specific structures scattered around Zeta Halo without a precise order, the backbone of the missions almost always involves reaching the starting point of the story, therefore entering a indoor area, a loading and then carrying out the actual mission, as if it were a fairly classic first-person shooter. The real problem, apart from this rigid separation with the open world, is an important underlying repetitiveness that afflicts a good part of these missions. And by repetitiveness we really mean a problem relating to level design and the artistic sector itself which, especially in final stages of the campaign, forces us to continue for dozens of corridors and rooms always proposing the same situations in terms of structures, obstacles, composition of the areas and waves of enemies to face. We cannot therefore hide that we arrived at the finale with shortness of breath, tired precisely because of this important repetitiveness that sometimes exhausted us. For information, we spent 18 abundant hours to conclude the story of Halo Infinite, dedicating a lot of time also to secondary tasks and totaling an 81% completion as indicated by the completion counter. The gunplay Vehicle Shooting in Halo Infinite Multiplayer If we allowed ourselves to express some perplexity regarding the structure of Halo Infinite, when you start shooting the new work of 343 Industries does not betray its glorious past and here, really, there is none for anyone. The gunplay of this sequel is simply excellent: calibrated to perfection, incredibly satisfying, so varied depending on the gun you are holding and particularly believable when you indulge yourself with the various types of grenades or start ringing combos by taking advantage of the special gadgets of Master Chief.Shooting at the uncovered hand of a Jackal or at his foot to see him let go of the shield for a moment so as to reveal the chest and head, or repeatedly hit the areas where we first blew up the armor of a Brute or, again, launching into the very long circular dance useful for hitting the very few unarmored areas of a Hunter generates a satisfaction that is really difficult to experience in other first-person shooters. And the same goes for all situations in which we are aboard a vehicle or we have to make the best use of covers and shaded areas of a base or structure controlled by the Exiles and which we are eagerly trying to put on fire to place under our control. On board a Scorpion ready to conquer a structure The gunplay of Halo Infinite is extremely tactical and consistently returns the clear sensation that a successful hit or a sensational smooth ball are determined solely and exclusively by our ability. Getting by when heavily outnumbered generates a great taste and releases huge doses of adrenaline in our hearts, as we run from one side of an open area to the other, alternating between sprinting, grappling and deploying shields, collecting weapons dropped by enemies to avoid reloading or hurling left and right explosive coils. And at the same time staying dry does nothing but increase the desire to try again, to face the same group of enemies with a different spirit, perhaps making better use of a shelter or entering the base from another access point or jumping from above on board of a Wasp. Everything is granted and the outcome of the battle will always and only be thanks to whoever has the pad in hand. Also in this case there is unfortunately a downside, once again a symptom of a game where the highs and lows seem to mix without solution of continuity. And so, if the gunplay also shines thanks to an artificial intelligence of the enemies that is always centred, precise and able to offer a fairly balanced level of challenge and in any case able to surprise the player for most of his experience with Halo Infinite, the the same cannot be said for the allied companions who will sometimes join us during our expeditions. In Halo Infinite there is no real and proper way to recruit non-player characters but, sometimes around the map, or in the bases we will have freed and where it will be possible to recall weapons and vehicles to equip yourself before launching into action, it will be possible to be followed automatically", "date": "2021-12-06", "grade": "8.5"}
