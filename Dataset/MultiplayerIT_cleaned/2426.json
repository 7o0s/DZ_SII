Due to a series of problems related to my video card, I couldn't test the game at home (hence the tremendous delay of this review), so the game was tested on a P2 350@ 390, 192 mb of ram and Voodoo 2 Creative 12mb from a dear friend and reader; by setting Dominion Wars to medium values, the fluidity was in any case well defended with values that settle around forty frames per second, which decreased by double when there were a lot of spaceships, explosions and so on on the screen. Speaking of visual detail, we certainly don't have fantastic graphics in front of us but we can say that it does its duty: some spaceships, especially the more massive ones, are really a feast for the eyes and even the smaller ones are more than discreet. As for space, as usual for this genre of games, the backgrounds of your battles vary from evocative to terribly stark and bare, even if the mobile camera will try to give everything more pomp. Something that really disappointed me instead is the sound, the exact opposite of what I expected, since it fails to give that indispensable galvanizing effect during battles and presenting, as usual, the usual continuously recycled sound effects. The dubbing is the English one (and well made), being translated into Italian (at least as far as they tell me) the only manual. Game structure Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars is a real-time strategy that puts you in the ranks of the faction that best suits you to successfully overcome the twenty missions included in the package. In case you get tired of the single player mode, there is always the possibility to play in LAN or via internet up to a maximum of 8 warriors! Now we will analyze in detail both game modes. First of all, let's see what armies are in the field: on the one hand we have the Federation and the Klingons, on the other hand we have the Dominion and their Cardassian allies. As mentioned a few lines above, the player (or players if playing in multiplayer) is asked which faction to belong to before playing (just as it is possible to adjust the game speed to favor even those not accustomed to strategy games). At your disposal you will have a maximum of 6 spaceships that differ in shields, speed and other fundamental parameters such as attack power while about twenty are the means included in this RTS. Once you have chosen the spaceships to send to attack, you will also have to choose a leader capable of keeping the situation under control among those available (and who will gradually reach greater and greater degrees of experience) as well as the type of crew, depending on what there is to do. Each battle won will mean increased income as well as more experience for commanders, so as you progress you will have better ships, as well as stronger shields and increasingly more effective firepower. After explaining the preliminaries of the battles and how important it is to win as many as possible, let's now talk about the very moment of taking up arms but first a dutiful clarification: even if the 3D graphics can be misleading, the movement of your vehicles does not take place in a similar way to the beautiful Homeworld and Cataclysm, so we talk about shifts in the two-dimensional plane. Sin. Once on the battlefield, you will have at your disposal a map showing your position and that of your enemies, as well as where the objectives of the current mission are located, while to your right there is a command ring from which you can issue orders such as the type of attack, where and how to hit the enemies, always keeping an eye on the situation of your military forces. After talking about the game structure, let's describe the modes included for when you want to play in the company of your friends: among others we remember the classic death match, the dominion mode (occupy and keep the occupied planets at your mercy), while the beta available to me did not want to let me try the others available as well as to be patched (patch 1.03), under penalty of termination of the multiplayer game. Conclusions Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars is a discreetly packaged strategy that places the battles between the various warring factions as the fulcrum of the game mechanics. Discreet graphics, soundpassable, a slightly cumbersome playability does not allow him to reach higher than sufficient peaks despite some not bad multiplayer modes, more than enough reason for fans of the saga (even more if they are also fans of strategic games) to spend the hard-earned cent saved . Negligible for all the others who have many more valid alternatives available, even in budget format (Homeworld above all). Everlasting franchises There are very few TV series, cartoons or video games that after years (or, as in this case, decades) still have the same ability to entertain, excite and leave a crowd of fans in suspense. Let's try to give some examples of successful franchises that for over a decade (or even twenty years) have not lost ground: we could speak (in addition to heroes born on paper such as Batman, Spiderman and the X Men or anime such as Kidoo Senshi Gundam and Mazinger) of TV shows like Star Trek; the undersigned still remembers, complete with a nostalgic tear, that in the evening, in addition to the usual feast of big Japanese robots, he never went out to follow the adventures of the spaceship Enterprise and I remember how in the morning at school, uh...I wrote the captain's diary (uh, Pucci I didn't mean you ^_^')! As often happens in long and always very popular series by aficionados, Star Trek has created a real universe, sometimes generating spin-offs, i.e. parallel sagas (previous or future) with respect to the main ones, without forgetting the various cinematographic films, a myriad of gadgets, models and an impressive series of videogames dedicated to this famous science fiction saga. It would be my great desire to talk in general about all the Star Trek video games released from 8 bits to date, but since I don't think you readers are interested in reading a semi-encyclopedia, I only remember how said brand is now associated with platformers, first-person shooters (with the engine of Unreal and Quake 3) and, coincidentally, rts, given that the game here by Gizmo Games is a strategy inspired by the saga known as Deep Space Nine.", "date": "2001-08-06", "grade": null}
