{"name": "Grand Slam Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68616-ea-sports-grand-slam-tennis-e-quasi-ace-per-ea.html", "text": "For a long time, the technological and gaming revolution, at least in the Nintendo house, were practically synonymous: every step forward on the hardware front was constantly accompanied by one in the software one, so that they exalted each other, as happened, for example, between the Nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64. During the same era, however, Nintendo did not, to put it mildly, facilitate third-party development on its platform; now we are in 2009, the Wii is the best-selling console of the generation, and to open the dances of the MotionPlus there is not a Mario, but Grand Slam Tennis, by EA. Learning climb Anyone expecting to be faced with a Nintendo-style game, pervaded by the sacred fire of the now famous ~easy to play, hard to master~, will surely be dumbfounded: MotionPlus does not make the experience more intuitive but, rather, the makes it more difficult (especially for those who do not have tennis experience - real, not virtual - behind them). Leaving aside for a moment the quality of the game with the new peripheral, one cannot help but notice that, deprived of MotionPlus, Grand Slam Tennis is more cumbersome and less profound than Wii Sports tennis: the shots are always directed based on the timing with which the ball is hit, however the automatic movements of the tennis player follow less realistic and, above all, less functional routines. Things improve a little by attacking the nunchuk, giving oneself the possibility, essentially, to correct CPU errors by directly moving one's alter ego: in this case the exchanges immediately become more fluid - and varied - but, at the same time, require more skill and coordination, driving away all that band of casual gamers on which Wii Sports has built its fortune. Therefore, if played for a short period of time, Grand Slam Tennis does not convince with any control system: with Motion Plus and nunchuk it is not very immediate, without, however, less intuitive and fun than Wii Sports. New generation EA tennis is therefore not only not immediate, but it is completely devoid of a bridge that takes the player from the simplest mode, the one with only the wiimote, to the more complex one with MotionPlus and nunchuk: the initial phase is a very steep climb, one obstacle to be overcome only with perseverance, which will push away, before the game mechanics are mastered, many users, potential and real. However, once you learn to coordinate the movements of the tennis player with those of the racket, once you understand how to hold the Wiimote and how to hit the ball, the depth and variety of Grand Slam Tennis manifest themselves in all their grandeur: probably already in a year will be over, but now, both when compared to games without motion control, and when compared to first generation Wii games (such as the aforementioned Wii Sports), it takes the interaction to a higher level than anything tried before . The variety of shots is enormous: there are many directions that a shot can take, there are even more effects that can be imparted to the ball which, summarized in the two macro categories Topspin and Backspin, are declined by the many possible inclinations of the Wiimote. All these variables, which influence every single shot, enhance the overall quality of the exchanges, which never before in a video game had been so heterogeneous, numerous and realistic. Online The least well-finished element of the control system are certainly the beats, which are regulated through the timing of the shot - similar to Wii Sports - and the inclination of the analog stick: an approach not dissimilar from what could have been done without MotionPlus. Another questionable choice, at least in theory, it seemed to have entrusted short balls and lobs to the pressure of a button: on the contrary, this solution proved to be effective and useful in not further complicating the game - excessively -, making the games more rhythmic without depriving them of depth. In Grand Slam Tennis players have the opportunity to improve together with their alter-ego, given that the most successful mode of the entire product, at least in single player, is precisely the career: although the four tournaments that make up the Grand Slam are not interspersed with minor competitions - excluding bonus matches and friendlies - to see your character grow, in stats and skills, and improve as a player at the same time, is quite rewarding. Mastering the EA title control system is not easy, but once you have succeeded, the climb to glory is fun and rewarding, above all because it is very demanding, which is rare in a period like this in which we are witnessing an embarrassing drop in average video game difficulty. Developmenttracing the characteristics of your alter-ego is fun, but it would have been much less stimulating without the possibility of making him compete online with other tennis players: fortunately in this Grand Slam Tennis he succeeds in full, so much so as to offer the best Wi-Fi service on Wii, surpassing even Mario Kart, more than in the absence of lag, almost imperceptible in both games, in the quality of the service, finally free of friend codes, quick to find rivals and with rankings both singular and divided into nations. Sweaty nerds The stereotype of the immobile ~hardcore~ player is destined to be overturned in the immediate future, provided that the path indicated by Nintendo, as seems increasingly probable, becomes the standard to which everyone will refer: playing Grand Slam Tennis is not only not enough to swing wrist like in Wii Sports, but you can't even sit. To win it is often necessary to rotate the body according to the position of the character, and to carry out certain blows it is necessary to move the whole arm, not just to hint at a movement; in addition to fatigue, there is a real risk of getting injured if you are not trained well. Due to the large (physical) space required to play, as well as the inevitable but annoying vertical split screen (doubles excluded), offline multiplayer is not as fun as hoped: of course the problem is relative and mainly logistical (as well as financial) , given that with a spacious room and a 40'' TV the issue would be resolved immediately. Although technically poor, another successful aspect is the graphic style adopted, which makes Grand Slam Tennis more pleasant to watch than it would have been if the developers had opted for realism, a field in which the Wii, due to well-known and recognized limitations , it certainly can't compete with the Sony and Microsoft consoles. The soundtrack was composed by Paul Van Dyk, one of the most famous and talented DJs on the planet, who, although he certainly didn't offer his best performance, gave life to some very characteristic pieces, in line with the Grand Slam graphics Tennis.", "date": "2009-06-29", "grade": "8.3"}
