First of all, because looks can easily be deceiving: there is a stark contrast between the sweet and dreamy style of the graphics, reminiscent of a children's illustrated book, and the deeper concepts that emerge from the narration, so as to leave quite astounded arriving at the end. The alienating effect given by the evident conflict between the tone and the contents of the dialogues, and between the latter and the events we see unfolding on the screen, is what makes Winding Worlds unique, moreover lending itself to different levels of reading between the playful surface and simple as a title for children and the most hidden meanings that can be fully grasped only by the older ones. The predominance of the story is clear, even if the texts are actually very few: Winding Worlds is essentially more an experiment in interactive storytelling than a real video game, which could be a major limitation to its use. The puzzle design is not exactly elaborate and in general the level of challenge is essentially non-existent, given that the solution practically comes by itself for each puzzle. It's a shame because some puzzle mechanics are also well thought out, but the idea of basing all interaction on two single actions, which might seem brilliant on the surface, becomes too much a limitation to guarantee minimally engaging gameplay. It's all part of the general design of the game, in any case, which simply aims to illustrate a strange story by making us experience short fragments of other stories, up to an ending that leaves us somewhat perplexed but which we will need to see once the journey has begun, even because this actually doesn't last long. Willow's strange story Willow is a ~girl~ - or a sort of anthropomorphic female rabbit - who seems to spend her life peacefully on a micro-planet, in the company of her dog. She is a sunny person and always ready to help others and probably because of this characteristic she is chosen by a strange vermiform being to carry out a very special ~mission~, whose outlines remain somewhat obscure. In fact, Willow finds herself having to carry out various tasks within seven levels, each corresponding to a particular micro-planet all focused on the problems of the character who lives there. Apparently these are small inconveniences such as finding a lost teddy bear, helping a scientist with low self-esteem or inviting an astronaut to open up more, but each of these actually hides a huge and fundamental knot for each respective existence, the resolution of which solves the great problem vitally important to every character we meet. The achievement of the solution, although it brings joy to each of them, also determines a considerable load of melancholy because in fact it seems to be the final step towards another ~phase~ or dimension, probably quite definitive. The particular narration remains largely suspended and hermetic, leaving the player with a good deal of thoughts and considerations to ponder on the meaning of what we find ourselves doing on the screen, but the idea is that there is something strongly metaphysical in the situations in which Willow finds herself, from micro-cosm to micro-cosm, touching various problematic lives until having to face and resolve her own existential knots. In all of this, the gameplay takes a bit of a back seat, although you actually find yourself acting all the time. The solution adopted by KO_OP for the interaction is very particular and characterizes the whole gaming experience, essentially based on two movements: the swipe on the screen, laterally and vertically. Each of these two movements corresponds to a reaction of the elements on the screen, both as regards the movement of the protagonist on the planets and the variations that can occur in the scenario, and as regards the more particular mechanisms of each puzzle. While on the one hand this maintains a remarkable fluidity that never affects the rhythm of the story, on the other the puzzles practically solve themselves, almost eliminating any element of challenge and commitment required by the game.", "date": "2020-05-21", "grade": "7.8"}
