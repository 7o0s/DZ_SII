{"name": "Largo Winch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/largo-winch.html", "text": "Old style is still style.<br> Following the assassination of some of your employees, you set off on an adventure that will take you to travel various continents (from the Americas to our Sardinia, up to Russia), meeting characters typical of the places, always very characterized in attitudes and even in the accent of voice! Some of these characters will appear often in the game and will be useful or indispensable to you in solving some puzzles. Others will simply want to ~skin~ you and you will have to annihilate them either with cunning or by facing them in pseudo-rpg style fights, that is, by executing attack moves in turn until one or the other's energy is exhausted. In most cases your task is to find out how to access the right rooms to steal information, whether it is recorded on PCs or diaries, just like a private investigator. The information will then be recorded in your personal database and always accessible to reconstruct the outline of the story you are living. Many times you will have to combine objects together to find a way out against uncooperative people (for example a nice glass of champagne...). There are also gallant adventures, including spicy scenes (these are the ~risks~ of the trade). In conclusion, we are facing the compendium of soft-spy stories dear to the USA in the 80s. Old style is still style.<br> Largo vs Resident Evil The setting of the environments and the movement of the characters, based on the rotation on their own axis, immediately and inevitably recall a title to memory: Resident Evil. Indeed, at first glance, don't be surprised if you will naturally say: ~this is how RE should be!!~, because the graphics are very colorful, the characters are animated with continuity and, unlike the Capcom masterpiece, the game rooms are very extended (one wonders how they crammed everything into memory) and the stairs are freely climbed at every opportunity. However, the analogies soon stop, and the needle of the balance returns in the expected direction. First of all, RE is a masterpiece of suspense, where LW is too linear: everything is foreseen, and even the dialogues with the characters are predefined. In RE you can use weapons to vary the ways and effectiveness with which to overcome obstacles, in LW there is generally only one solution and you only have to reason to guess it. In RE the fights are a strong point of the game, and they are very challenging, in LW the fights are unavoidable and often just boring. So why did I want to compare these two titles? First of all because RE is the yardstick of adventures on Playstation and then because it is evident to adventurers how the game mechanics of LW are peculiar and different: here reasoning is the basis of everything, instead of action. If this is what you are looking for, you have arrived at your destination, if you are looking for another RE, continue further. The ~technical~ point LW undoubtedly belongs to the second generation of PS2 titles (or third, if you think in Japanese terms): graphics without hesitation, which moves gigantic characters in animated scenarios (not very much actually) with convincing textures and rich and inspired colors. In short, it is very pleasant to see, and your friends will certainly notice it while you play, having fun following your wanderings. From an audio point of view, then a praise to Ubisoft for the effort put into the dubbing, with reasonable conversations and a realistic tone of voice most of the time. The user interface is not the most effective, with an apparently basic menu which cannot be accessed serenely due to the use of all the backbones in a contextual way to the action. That is to say that sometimes the keys will lose their function or change it depending on the object/person you are close to. Not for nothing they have implemented a text help (!) to remember how to use the commands. My infinite congratulations instead to the developers for the implementation of the free save, executable at any time: a real relief, waiting for it to become the standard in all games and make you forget the Resident Evil typewriters (perhaps the Hard Disk will be the key to this little revolution....). Final judgment LW is pleasant, linear and not too difficult. In short, an adventure that will pleasantly fill the moments of pause while waiting for the tele+ film. For fans of the genre it is a small revenge in a world now accustomed to the rhythms of Lara Croft, but those who love freedom of choice and action may be bored. In any case, I advise everyone to take a look at least. Pros  Flashy graphics and ~huge~ characters  Well done Italian dubbing  Cured plot, worthy ofa small TV production  Lifelike and varied characters Cons  Sometimes basic animation  Too piloted, sometimes puerile puzzles  You are a bit too much ~spectator~ of an already written story  The fights are really terrible Old style is still style.<br> Welcome to Largo Winch. You lovers of classic adventures, who spend hours looking for objects and combining them together, scrolling through lists of dialogues to choose the right phrase with which to speak to an apathetic interlocutor, wandering through empty rooms clicking in every corner in search of an iteration hidden from the eyes inexperienced and unable to tame the desire to find out ~what will happen next~.... In short, welcome with me on a journey to the past. Oh yes, because LW is one of those titles that are rarely seen by now, not because it is an abused or unattractive genre, but because the massification of the market has forcefully pushed the software houses towards the graphic spectacularization to the detriment of the plot and the smart content. The plot instead returns sovereign in this work wanted by Ubisoft, which at first glance can only please us. But let's start in order: perhaps few of you know who we are talking about, unless you have lived in France for some time. Largo Winch is a successful comic from the Dupois publishing house, producer of, among others, The Smurfs and Lucky Luke. Such a success as to convince French television to produce the TV series, which will soon arrive in French-speaking land. Largo Winch is a rich adventurer, a lover of women and much loved by them for his beauty, bravado and, of course, for his money, which allows him the most fascinating expedients on every occasion (pizzeria or dinner on a boat with a private helicopter tonight ?). Largo is the head of a large industrial holding inherited from his adoptive father, within which betrayals are perpetrated and plots are woven that you will have to unravel during the game.", "date": "2002-09-10", "grade": null}
