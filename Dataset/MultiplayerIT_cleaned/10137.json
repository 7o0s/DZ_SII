Entrusted to the capable hands of Milestone (which, to be honest, certainly does not seem to have put all of its effort into the operation), the MotoGP series recorded an increase in sales of around 18% compared to THQ management (270,000 copies approximately for MotoGP 07 against the 320,000 copies of MotoGP 08 - various sources) in the Xbox 360 version alone, with the addition of the PS3 and PC versions to double these figures. So it is not exactly clear why the franchise was entrusted to Monumental Games, a software house specializing in the creation of MMOs and not very accustomed to the genre of racing games. The development of MotoGP 09/10 took more or less two years and the result is a product with a distinctly arcade flavor, which renounces the simulation ambitions (up to now proposed in a rather convincing way) in favor of a broader structure, which does not limits the game modes to the mere reproduction of the official MotoGP championship but offers us a generous range of possibilities, with interesting facets. Warm up Once the game has started and the installation on the hard disk has been carried out to speed up loading (but the operation is optional), we can access five distinct modes. The first is clearly the ~Championship~, divided between the 125, 250 and MotoGP classes: we choose our rider from among those available (all real, since this is an officially licensed title) and we tackle a sequence made up of sixteen races (or seventeen, as the case may be) where our objective is clearly to cross the finish line first. Each of the events shows the classic subdivision into three sessions (free practice, qualifying and race) which we are in no way obliged to respect: we can very well accept the last position on the starting grid and launch ourselves into a desperate chase to get to the front of the group within the three laps that make up the race by default. Similarly, adopting a more patient and reasoned approach will serve to make the difference between finishing first or last, if we have selected the highest difficulty level. The difference between the three engine capacity classes is extremely marked: on board a 125 cc. we will be able to do more or less whatever comes to our mind, go long in the hairpin bends and yet be able to brake enough to cut them effectively, without worrying about the speed peaks reached on the straights, which are actually negligible. Driving in the MotoGP, on the other hand, implies completely different timing: the bike shoots very fast and you have to brake well in advance before tackling a curve, even if otherwise the arcade character of the game proves to be able to forgive most of our mistakes. Collisions with other drivers almost never lead to an accident in the first place. Similarly, finishing long on gravel only results in a crash if we insist on accelerating while the wheels are turning. Moreover, the thing is rendered visually in a very bad way, with the rider jumping off the bike for no one knows why. The ~Arcade~ mode is a ~carefree~ alternative to the championship, with the engine capacity classes that must be unlocked one by one through victories and a single race session in which we systematically start from the bottom, while the ~Time trial~ it is nothing more than the classic ~time attack~ in which we can try our hand at the same circuit in search of our best times, comparing ourselves with a ghost. MotoGP 09/10 includes a multiplayer mode both locally (two players via horizontal or vertical split screen) and online, but unfortunately during our tests we never found anyone available for a game: too bad, it would have been interesting to understand how the game with its twenty players on the track at the same time. Playstation 3 trophies MotoGP 09/10 offers a total of forty-six trophies. Some of them are obtained by completing rather simple objectives (winning the first race, hiring a complete staff or filling up with sponsors in the ~Career~ mode), others require a much greater commitment (winning a category championship, racking up twenty-one online victories, win on each track) and the latter, finally, have been designed for the most expert and patient players (complete one hundred races, obtain the maximum reputation level in the ~Career~ mode, etc.). We go down the track The most substantial and fun mode, however, is undoubtedly the ~Career~. All in all, this is what the series lacked when it was in Milestone's hands: a way where you start from the bottom, in a satellite team, con a slow bike and an all uphill journey which, however, slowly leads you to appreciate every little upgrade. At this juncture it is possible to create your own rider and team, manage money by hiring engineers and press officers who will respectively take care of improving the performance of the bike and obtaining contracts with sponsors, changing manufacturers whenever possible and trying to finish each race in a dignified manner. Within each event there are numerous small missions to be completed to earn experience points: reach a certain place on the starting grid, maintain a certain average speed for a section of the track, overtake an opponent indicated on the screen, maintain the perfect trajectory in a curve, etc. The default settings show us on the track an indication of the trajectory that changes color according to the speed with which we have to tackle it: this is an aid that can be deactivated, but which at least initially proves to be quite useful for understanding how to move on the track. tracked. Finally, the incidence of upgrades, the management of the engineers' work and the possibility of customizing the colors and livery of the bike, suit and helmet are always welcome extras. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, we are faced with a title that often compromises. The MotoGP 08 graphics were far from perfect, but they did not disregard the precision of the polygonal models of the motorbikes, which in this 09/10 edition are decidedly simpler and poorer in detail. There is a whole series of solutions that visually leave something to be desired: the sequence of the crash already mentioned above, the first person view in which you don't see the rider's hands on the handlebars but above all the sloppy and carefree construction of numerous tracks, especially those in which you run at night, in which practically the background consists solely of anonymous lights arranged around the track. However, there are well-made scenarios, above all the always excellent Mugello (we see that the developers particularly love it), and the effect of the wet asphalt is very nice, but the frame rate in no way manages to reach 30 fps and very often shows the side to very visible declines. The action is accompanied by a signed soundtrack (at least in theory), which has the merit of always keeping the pace high and stimulating the adrenaline. On the other hand, the effects from the voice of the speaker to the roar of the engines are completely insufficient.", "date": "2010-03-18", "grade": "7.0"}
