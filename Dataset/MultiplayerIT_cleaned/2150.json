{"name": "Star Wars Obi-Wan  Pal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-obi-wan-pal.html", "text": "Menu. Once started, the game offers us a short but nice presentation where the LucasArts logo is the protagonist. After a short while, a screen with Obi-Wan's image appears. After pressing start we can choose, thanks to the futuristic-looking menu, between: New Game, Load Game, Training, Jedi Duel and Options. I'm certainly not explaining the meaning of the first two choices and then I go on to describe the Training mode. In general, the best way to familiarize yourself with a control system is to go through a sort of guided tour (a tutorial) in which all the commands that characterize our character are illustrated. Training, therefore, proves to be an indispensable tool for 'getting to know' Obi-Wan. The Jedi Duel game mode is appreciable, designed to entertain two players with the split screen system (or divided screen). Two friends can challenge each other by choosing one of the six available arenas. The selectable characters will initially be 2 but the others (up to 9) will become available as soon as they are defeated during the bonus trials in the single player mode. By selecting Options from the main menu, we will be able to modify: music volume, effects volume, voice volume, vibration (yes or no), communicator text (yes or no), subtitles (yes or no), lock ('enable': with a single press of the right trigger toggle or 'hold': hold to hold lock) and controller (3 key configurations, which are very similar, to choose from). The Force is nothing without control. The game in question exploits all the features of the pad, in fact the default configuration is: with the left analog stick we move the character, with the left trigger we activate the use of Force, with the right stick we use the lightsaber (to use sword like a boomerang it will be necessary to use the Force and simultaneously press the right stick), with the right trigger we will be able to 'block' the target (for example an enemy), the A key is used to jump (using the Force we will jump much higher), the B key allows us to perform stunts or throw objects (if we combine the use of the Force), the Y key is the classic 'use' or Force push (with use of the Force), the X key serves to duck / roll or disarm enemies (using the Force), with the arrow keys we manage the inventory, the black key allows us to perform a 180 degree turn, the white key allows us to look around or switch to the view of Forza (particular function that allows us to slow down time for a few seconds, it's a kind of slow-motion useful in moments of chaos) and finally the start button to pause. I must admit that the control system turns out to be very immediate and functional. Using the sword is very intuitive and rewarding even if the 'response' is rather slow. The game. We choose New Game from the main menu and give a name to the 'block' that we will use from now on to load/save the current game. Saving is automatic. The single player mode is characterized by five chapters, each of which is divided into missions, for a total of 15 levels. In addition to these sections we have a fair number of duels to face and overcome to continue the story. After a cinematic-style interlude (which, however, takes advantage of the game's graphics engine), the adventure begins and we are catapulted to Coruscant to investigate the presence of a new threat to the peace of the galaxy. It goes without saying that we will find out who is responsible... Let's leave the story behind and deal with the actual game. At first glance it looks like a third person adventure but after a few minutes you realize you are dealing with a 'pure' action game; in fact, the use of the lightsaber is predominant. To offend, in addition to the sword, we will have available: 3 types of grenades (incendiary, ion and concussion), sniper rifle (a few times actually). In some of the last missions we will also be able to use a trade federation cannon . Initially we will carry with us, in addition to the sword, a useful telescope with variable zoom. During the missions, in addition to grenades and rifles, we will find scattered: healing packs, complete healing packs, unlimited strength addition, invincibility shield (lasts about 20 seconds) and exploration signals. The enemies we will face during the game are many (mostly droids) and quite intelligent. Luckily,in some levels we won't be alone, you will have our friend and Jedi master, Qui-Gon Jinn and later others who I won't mention so as not to spoil the 'surprise'. Each mission we are going to carry out will be described by filmed interludes and superimposed texts, the objectives will be clear from the beginning and if we have any doubts about what to do, just press the start button on the pad. To complete each mission we will have 5 lives available; if we don't make it we will have to start over again. There are, however, several autosave points in each section. During the game, the puzzles to solve will be very few and one in particular will not be exactly immediate. The development of the levels is always very linear (sometimes too much), you will hardly lose your bearings. As far as longevity is concerned, I would say that we are below average for this kind of software: from 10 to 15 hours of play, based on the skill of the player. Nice animations but... From a graphic point of view, Star Wars Obi-Wan leaves much to be desired as regards the realization of the levels; the latter are deficient both in terms of the number of polygons used (sometimes it seems you can count them!) and in the quality of the textures (the ones used for the 'render' of the rocks are horrible). Some color combinations are bad, as pastel colors are combined with bright colors. The trees are embarrassing, they look like cardboard. The water yield is fair but this is not enough for the title to reach sufficiency, limited to the graphic aspect of the locations. On the other hand, the construction of the arenas for the Jedi duels is good: well-finished textures and a good level of detail. Contrary to the locations, the number of polygons that characterize the protagonists is quite high even if the use of bump-mapping is not appreciated on the textures that compose them. Sin. The animations, both for the main character and for the others (including the droids), deserve a positive mention, as they seemed to me to be well done (the one of the escape of the droids is hilarious). The use of dynamic lighting is excellent (you will always see the blue reflection of the lightsaber, both near walls and near fountains) and the management of shadows, calculated in real time. The frame rate is on average acceptable even if in some circumstances (it is not clear whether for saving on the hard disk or for actual loading) it drops dramatically. It's not uncommon to see the picture freeze and resume after a split second, especially when the animation related to Obi-Wan's death is shown. As expected, in the busiest moments the graphics engine seems to lose speed (read slowdowns) even if the gameplay remains unchanged. A name a guarantee. Fortunately, John Williams takes care of reviving the fortunes of this title. His music (the original 'Star Wars') will accompany you throughout the game, including the menu. The audio is therefore of the highest level, a joy for the ears; the sound effects could not be outdone, simply fantastic that square the sound experience offered. The environmental effects are sufficient, not in terms of quality but quantity (a little). Positional audio is excellent, even for those with two stereo speakers. Two words for the localization, completely in Italian, of the title. The voices given to the characters, enemies included, are spot on overall (those of the droids are very funny) even if sometimes, in some dialogue, the right emphasis is missing. Obi-Wan is not convincing and turns out to be a rather modest game overall. Maybe and just maybe it could satisfy Star Wars fans but everyone else will probably turn up their noses a bit... Pros: Excellent audio Main character Control system Animations AI (artificial intelligence) Cons: Few polygons for the settings Slowdowns Textures of the levels Color combinations Repetitive (the sword is almost always used) Too linear Poor longevity Materials: Tips Once upon a time... In the world of video games LucasArts (as part of Lucasfilm) is synonymous with Star Wars, i.e. software inspired by the famous saga: 'Star Wars'. With Star Wars Obi-Wan we will have the opportunity to put ourselves in the shoes of the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and aspire to become a Jedi Knight. For the uninitiated, the Jedi Knights are the champions of peace and justice throughout the galaxy... If you want to know more about the history of the game, I can only advise you to read the excellent preview of Mark (Marco Miramonti).", "date": "2002-04-26", "grade": null}
