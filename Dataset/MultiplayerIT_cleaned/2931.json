Dontnod is no stranger to sensitive issues and this time has decided to focus on the introduction of a transgender character (Tyler) to give her way a contribution to the battles aimed at recognition but above all at the acceptance of LGBTQ + people. In this respect, the French development team returns to demonstrate that sensitivity and delicacy presented, albeit in a different key, with the original Life is Strange and which instead had been lost with its sequel - making quite a few missteps in the characterization of the characters and, consequently, in the staging of history. With Tell Me Why, on the other hand, we rediscover the pleasure of leafing through the characters and learning to support them, understand them but also to criticize them precisely by virtue of those nuances that make them closer to us: therefore, humans. Find out in the full review if Dontnod has been able to return to its glory or not. Return to Delos Lake Speaking of the first episode we were able to underline the profound characterization among the merits, flanked by a graphic sector that finally abandons the rough edges of the previous Life is Strange to return to embracing that realistic style already spotted in Vampyr and further improved here. We are faced with expressive characters, capable of conveying a mood with a simple frown or a twitch of the lips, when not with a look that often speaks louder than the voice. And precisely the Voice, with a capital v, is a founding aspect of the young Ronan, who like every protagonist of the Dontnod video games have a special power on their side (perhaps vampirism is to be seen more as a curse but it is always supernatural): it was in fact decided to give shape to that bond that two people, as twins, are said to share and among the peculiarities of Alyson and Tyler we find the possibility of communicating telepathically. A power that plays an active role during all three chapters, allowing a silent dialogue between the two that can unlock any new answers during a conversation with other characters. Nothing that really alters the balance of Tell Me Why, but since it is a narrative adventure where the gameplay tends not to expand that much, it is an addition very much in line with the personality of the two brothers. In addition to the Voice, and this is the most important aspect, they are also able to recall memories as soon as they feel a very strong emotion: this will allow them to dig into that past they have to and want to face but of which they have confused memories , sometimes conflicting. In these cases we will be asked to choose which of the two to give credit to, a decision that weighs above all on the relationship between Alyson and Tyler without significantly altering the story. To liven up a well-established gameplay we find small puzzles whose solution is always contained within the Book of Goblins that we carry with us, provided we know how to read between the lines: a nice expedient to put our brains to the test more than the usual exploration. Also in the first chapter we underlined a structure of the dialogues that begins to get cloying due to its being ~in watertight compartments~, leaving the idea of witnessing more of a conversation between automatons than between human beings: fortunately with the progress of the narration the situation, while not disappearing completely, becomes less pressing, giving space to fluid and pleasant conversations to face. What left us more skeptical was above all the rhythm of the introductory chapter, very slow and focused on the character of Tyler to allow us to better enter his shoes, if not understanding at least experiencing his inner torment, the fear of opening up to others and showing oneself for whom really. While on the one hand the choice enhances the characterization, on the other it pulls the brakes on the narrative, which drags on to a predictable and bite-free conclusion that only arouses interest in the introduction of a very surreal character. A narrative of ups and downs Thus we arrive at the second and third chapters, which respectively represent the highest and lowest point reached by Tell Me Why: in Family Secrets we witness a surge in the story, which still takes its time to work on the introspection of the characters but it leaves much more room for the actual narrative, the one that really matters in the end because, we will never stop quotingFrank Miller, ~without a story all your beautiful shots and fantastic drawings are useless~. The characters can be multifaceted and deep to levels never seen before, but if you can't put them in an engaging and coherent context it's a waste of work; precisely for this reason, the second episode manages well that rhythm and that immersion which the previous one lacked, bringing the plot not only forward but also towards potentially interesting shores. As always, it is difficult to enter into an articulated discussion on a game that makes narrative its cornerstone without risking something too much. In any case, this second act closes some small parentheses between the twins and the few characters present, managing in the meantime to dose the information on the plot just enough to arouse curiosity until it reaches its peak, where the still unhealed cracks widen up to to a breaking point. There is therefore a springboard ready for the story to take off one last time, then letting it glide delicately towards its almost certainly touching conclusion. Right here, however, is where Dontnod takes the biggest misstep, demonstrating that when it comes to working on the individual parts (such as the characterization of the characters) it manages to juggle well; however, when these fragments have to recompose in the complete picture, the grip begins to become less firm, the plots fray and the plot, trying to continuously force that ~wow~ effect in the player, stumbles over itself putting flesh to the fire which is then left to burn and blacken or, even more simply, it didn't feel necessary. Inheritance is that chapter whose task would be to put a point and instead ends up leaving a smudge, showing the same predictability side of the first chapter with the aggravating circumstance of pushing towards a final choice by the player very inconsistent with the rest of the narration: if in the first two Life is Strange a great responsibility was placed on our shoulders - in the first more direct, in the second due instead to the sum of the choices made during the journey - here the aim is to take responsibility away from the twins and their actions, leaving up to us to decide whether what happened in the past is true or not. It is a pity that the clues scattered above all along the course of the third episode point in a well-defined direction: making Alyson and Tyler choose, by our hand, to turn their backs on the truth, not to acknowledge it in spite of everything, may want to underline human weakness but in the end it creates a short circuit for which there is no logic behind this choice. The protagonists choose to face the truth, whatever it is, the same one that we have chased during an entire game, only so that in the end we are given the opportunity to throw everything to the wind and bury it together with that past that has tormented them so much. The feeling is that you are trying to justify them in some way and in a narrative there is nothing worse than justifying someone, regardless of the action performed. As already mentioned, the set of information, sometimes useless, combined with the predictability of the twists and turns (daughter of a reduced cast of characters and, although characterized, too clear to leave room for doubts about who does what) leads to a non-final : a conclusion that does not have the courage to clarify itself, giving a precise identity to the story, preferring to leave the task to us. Several missed opportunities Dontnod tries to exploit the misaligned memories of Alyson and Tyler to make us doubt the facts, when in reality these very facts tell a single plausible scenario. It's not a question of questioning the events, but of deciding whether to face them head on or not: a choice that clashes with the characterization of the twins, each with its fragility but at the same time strong enough to overcome themselves, the sure belief in which they have lived for ten years, and dig to the bottom. You try to exploit an ~antagonist~ without any bite and this is also the biggest problem, not having given him the thickness necessary to really be an obstacle: the confrontation with the twins is among the worst parts of the script. Where the authors have tried to be able to take the reins of the characterization, if not of all at least of most of the characters, when it was necessary to put the puzzle together they once again lent their side with a story that seems to have been thought in pieces, rather than as a single element to then be divided. Some perplexities remain about the choice to introduce a transsexual protagonist not so much for a quequestion of politically correctness, luckily dispelled initial doubt, as well as because beyond the fact of having treated it with great delicacy and respect, it has no real reason to exist as such: Tyler constantly looks in the mirror, figuratively speaking, reflects a lot about himself and his inner dilemmas but he doesn't deal with the outside world because, basically, there is no external world to deal with. Everyone is understanding and kind towards him (here the clever choice of having set it in a village with a few souls and having inserted a small number of characters weighs heavily), the greatest lack of respect we encountered was the confusion on the part of one supporting actors between transgender and transvestite - something that in a forgotten corner of Alaska is at least understandable. Tell Me Why starts with a very precise focus on Tyler, to the point of tying him hand in glove with past events, implying that the mother tried to kill him precisely because of his initial transitional path: when it is revealed that Mary-Ann was trying to understand her son, everything turns out to be stalemate and the matter is no longer mentioned or investigated. Perhaps it is due to the reduced number of chapters, but that an essential element such as the mother's presumed rejection of her son is thus forgotten, insisting moreover on her presumed guilt, leaves a bad taste in the mouth for the narrative and emotional potential that could have have. Basically, the possible weight of Tyler as a transsexual ends in a stalemate, to the point that the character fits fluidly into the context and the only moment in which we remember that she is a person still full of doubts and fragile, is when without a real logical thread with the narrative decides to take time to self-reflect. Technical details From the point of view of the technical implementation, Tell Me Why instead hits the mark especially as regards the graphic sector and the acting: put together they are two aspects that involve a lot in the single scenes, except for the narratively weak ones, and once again confirm plus the return of Dontnod on the right track of characterization. The musical tracks are not equally memorable, which, although following the trend of the previous titles and therefore accompanying the scenes well, are unable to remain in the lead such as - for example - the soundtrack of the original Life is Strange. We noticed a few small bugs and some polygonal interpenetration here and there, nothing so prohibitive and which can still be postponed, while we did not miss a sometimes imprecise localization, which erroneously translates very basic expressions from English to Italian ( remember the famous ~to play~ of The Last of Us?). In this respect, no doubt more care should have been taken. Overall, the technical realization is what helps Tell Me Why to stand out, together with some scenes that analyzed in their singularity are handled in a commendable way from a narrative, emotional and directorial point of view.", "date": "2020-08-30", "grade": "7.5"}
