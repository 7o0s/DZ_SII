{"name": "Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gran-turismo-3-a-spec-3.html", "text": "Once the game has started with the calmness of those who want to savor the experience in every detail, you are greeted by an introductory film that skilfully mixes excerpts from real competitions with particularly spectacular passages taken from the game. Everything is so engaging that I challenge anyone to jump directly to the initial screen, which in any case appears almost by surprise after a few minutes. The two main game modes are as in the previous incarnation the Arcade Mode and the Gran Turismo Mode. As you can guess, however, the latter represents the heart of the game, especially given the structural complexity that it presents right from the start. The various options available however, despite the abundant presence of Japanese ideograms, can be consulted without too many problems. At your disposal we have: the Car Dealer (the price list from which to choose your racing car), the License Center (the section in which to earn the famous driving licenses B, A, IB, IA, Special and Rally), My Home (practically the own garage), Tune Shop (the virtual shop in which to buy the various components of the car), GT Auto (where to choose the rims, wash the car and even change the oil), Machine Test (where to test the effectiveness of the technical modifications made) and finally Go Race (the starting point for experiencing driving emotions now close to reality). Having thus established the renewed immediacy of the main menu, we move on with the usual and predictable thrill to the first remnant of action, the choice of car! The most evident novelties in this sense are represented by the lack of the second-hand price list, present instead in past editions, and by the lower number of vehicles available, no longer 500 as in Gran Turismo 2 but 165. Disappointed? I assure you that there is no reason to be, especially considering the fact that only the poorest cars have been excluded and that the level of detail of the Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec racing cars is absolutely disarming. Think that a week of work was needed to create a single polygonal model for this masterpiece, against the single day required for the aforementioned Gran Turismo 2 on PlayStation. Not bad in terms of variety either, it will even be possible to unlock Formula 1 models dating back to the end of the 80s! In any case, considering the immediate appeal that is generated with this game, I am sure that you will be able to find out why this numerical reduction is not at all compromising in terms of evaluation. At this point it is necessary to move on to the analysis of the available competitions. Once again, the number of events and races in which to participate in order to awaken one's racing instincts is considerable. As usual, to access certain competitions it will be necessary to first obtain the infamous driving licenses. Also this time there will be the grueling Endurance, races characterized by an impressive number of laps to go, and the various one-makes, to be tackled only and exclusively with a specific car. Well, until now we have only talked about what can be considered the shell of this game, but moving on to pure action, how does it behave!? At this point I could easily answer that it's probably the most fun driving game ever conceived, and conclude the review here... but I imagine that many of you demand the necessary technical reasons. The first impression you get once you get off the track is in any case exciting and enveloping and you immediately notice how the frame rate is truly exceptional. Suffice it to say that everything runs smoothly at 60 fps, where the polygonal engine of the two predecessors did not exceed 25/30 fps! Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec truly represents a galvanizing experience, also because the cars now seem decidedly less heavy than before and respond incredibly to the roughness of the road, this time much more abundant than in the past. There will certainly happen to exalt yourself for having taken a climb at full speed or for having perhaps controlled a violent skid by cutting on a curb. In short, the promises of the Yamauchi project leader regarding a realism never seen have been fully maintained in our opinion. Not infrequently you will find yourself gritting your teeth worried about braking to the limit that could compromise your performance, or a shiver will run down your spine as you come out of a tunnel and you will begin to set up a tremendous sharp bend!Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec is all this and much more, the perfect combination of stunning graphics and fluidity never seen before. Having said that, however, we could not finish the review without having made a healthy constructive criticism in search of future perfection. The only flaw, if it can be defined as such, that we found in the prolonged test session of this game, is probably represented by the not exceptional artificial intelligence that distinguishes the opposing cars on some occasions. It is true that the situation has improved compared to the past, but it is also true that we often witness the usual problem of more or less pre-set trajectories, which in practical terms involves an annoying but fortunately sporadic alignment of one's antagonists. This does not mean that this small imperfection can easily be considered the very thin line between the video game and absolute perfection! In the past, the added value of Gran Turismo compared to the myriad of driving games released for all consoles was represented by the multitude of interventions that could be carried out on your car to face the various competitions. Now you can easily add stunning graphics, a renewed complexity of the physical models of the cars and finally an amazing fluidity to say the least. If it hadn't been for some imperfection related to the artificial intelligence of the opponents, it would have been close to perfection. The fact remains that we are faced with an absolute masterpiece! Only those who have had the opportunity to get their hands on the first two episodes of Gran Turismo that appeared exclusively on PlayStation in the past can understand the enthusiasm with which we began to unwrap the packaging of this Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec! You should all know the story (the script of Beautiful in comparison is obvious!): initially a certain Gran Turismo 2000 was announced, which however should have been a simple conversion of the previous episode, transposed in this case on the PlayStation 2. Obviously commercial reasons, however, quickly convinced the project managers to abandon this solution in favor of a completely renewed title chock full of important innovations. However, as many of you will have already understood, the times for the realization of this mammoth work could not be the same as those foreseen for the abandoned project, and so it was that the upper echelons of Polyphony Digital decided that the numerous fans of the series scattered throughout the world would have had to suffer until April 28th, the expected date for the birth of the definitive driving game, a certain Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec!", "date": "2001-05-11", "grade": null}
