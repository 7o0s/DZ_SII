{"name": "Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions  - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-tactics-the-war-of-the-lions-recensione_a.html", "text": "The war of the Lions Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions for the Sony laptop is a faithful remake, especially in the gameplay, of the old original game, even if minimally revised and corrected in some points. Which is completely logical if we consider the fact that even today it is considered not only the progenitor of the ~new generation~ of ~made in Japan~ strategy games (Suikoden Tactics, Nippon Ichi titles such as Disgaea, etc.), but also the best ever of its kind for its beauty and depth. With the confusion often generated by pseudo-remakes that sometimes distort a title in an ambitious attempt to renew it, it's nice to know that in this case the focus was on the classic, on the safe side, simply improving what could be improved without distorting anything. In fact, as we will be able to deepen shortly, the only differences of a certain importance between the two versions can be found in the graphics sector, in the addition of a couple of ~new~ classes and characters, plus that of some new battles and missions extra with Delita, as well as two new modes. The plot itself has remained unchanged, even if it must be said that it has undergone some modifications for the addition of some unpublished aspects capable of offering further insights into the storyline. It is set in a time frame probably post FFXII, in some regions of Ivalice, where due to a war that has just ended, a vacuum of power has been created that many aim to fill. Against the backdrop of the struggle for domination of the region between nobles, conspirators and non-human creatures, the story of the heroic protagonist, the knight Ramza, of his tormented and ruthless friend Delita, of the princess Ovelia, of Argath (in the original Agrias ) and a whole plethora of characters with a strong charisma in which there is often no clear distinction between good and bad and where betrayal is always lurking. Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of Lions is available for PSP. News and battles The adventure, structured in four chapters, follows all the classic canons of a turn-based strategy and obviously includes a certain number of battles. They take place in pseudo-3D environments with an isometric view, where the player arranges, as per tradition, his men who make up the party, being careful to choose them based on the nature of the area in which the battle will take place and his own skills and of enemies. During the battles, which are quite demanding due to the continuous variables involved in each of them, the player must achieve a particular objective that varies from time to time, and which can be saving a PC or defeating a particular enemy to immediately end the fight, or even kill all opponents. The deployments do not move in a schematic, fixed way, but each initiative is dictated by one's own unique abilities and each move is related to one's speed of execution and to the Job, as well as, as mentioned before, to the natural environment and its obstacles. The maximum number of recruitable characters has now increased from 16 to 24. The back buttons (L & R) zoom the images, while the analog stick rotates the scenarios. Two new classes have been added: the Onion Knights, already seen in FFIII, and the Dark Knights. The ~Knight of the Onion~ does not learn any skills, but can equip anything and become very powerful once other Jobs are brought to Master level (level 6 for the Squire and Chemist classes), so much so that he is very strong almost at the end of the game. While ~the Black Knight~ has abilities similar to those of Gaffgarion. Which makes it a very strong Job and therefore difficult to obtain. There are also two new special characters that can be recruited and played. They are Balthier, directly from FFXII, here engaged in the search for treasures, and Luso, the protagonist of the upcoming FFTA2 on the DS. The first has a Job called ~Sky Pirate~ and can count on the Target skill. The second, however, has the one called ~Mob Hunter~ with in addition, among other things, the same skills as Ramza. New characters and classes also bring with them new items and weapons, such as the Fomalhaut rifle or the powerful Durandal for the knights, with the Holy element, plus Protect and Shell always present Multiplayer However, the most consistent novelty of The War of the Lions remains in our opinion that of the multiplayer. To be precise, these are two new methods that constitute a further welcome addition to the product. They are called ~Melee~ and ~Rendez Vous~ . In the first mode you can challenge a friend in 5v5 battles in order to obtain prizes by winning. To be exact, the winner will be able to choose three objects, while the defeated only one. After finishing a fight, in fact, you will be able to access a schermata in which various treasure chests will be displayed, from which you can choose. When you select this mode, after having established who will start the battle, a series of items will appear which will allow the first player to define the settings of the battle (location, duration, actions that can be carried out, location of traps, etc). Note how, in the event of a physical attack by a character against an opponent, it will lead to a real ~two~ fight, in which both players will find themselves repeatedly pressing the circle key... In the second mode, Rendez Vous, two gamers can instead join forces in facing one or more battles. There are 15 missions in total, which will become available as you progress through the game. These can be selected from the appropriate options menu and tackled either in chronological order or at random. The player who does not choose which battle to carry out will be able to read the information relating to the clash and consequently accept or decline the invitation to fight alongside his friend. Each of the participants will be able to choose a certain number of units which will vary according to the combat to be faced and which will never exceed three units. The fewer units there are in battle, the more valuable the rewards are. User performance is monitored by an evaluation system ranging from one to five stars: if both players have three units on the field, they will generally receive three stars at the end of the mission, five if they manage to finish the battle using only one character and to win. To play this title in multiplayer you obviously need two PSPs and a pair of Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions. Graphic restyling From a graphic point of view FFT on PSP still manages to amaze positively with its splendid 2D. Basically, also in this case, the product is similar to the PSX counterpart, but in reality there is a certain restyling aimed at cleaning up the scene more and softening the colors, the angles (for example, the same sprites were used for the characters , but these appear to be rounder and therefore more refined) and everything that makes up the scenarios. The latter, in pseudo-3D, despite their simplicity, turn out to be detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The important addition in terms of graphics was made by Square-Enix with the insertion of movies in perfect anime style, which take the place of the interlude sequences in the original created with the same game engine. Made in one of the most beautiful cell-shading ever seen, with its particular style made of pastel colors, of strokes that seem made in pencil, even in the coloring, it is an authentic work of art, which tends to enhance even better the work of Akihiko Yoshida, the character design of the game (also seen at work in FFXII), with the characters who finally manage more than ever to convey emphasis to the story, and real emotions to the player. Among other things, it should be noted that in this version for our market these ~cut-scenes~ are beautifully dubbed in English, unlike the Japanese version which only had subtitles. Still on the subject of sound, we can also add that in this case too we have kept to the classic, to the delight of the fans of the original, and therefore we have in fact the same (apart from a couple of remixes), same soundtrack by sure emotional impact created by Hitoshi Sakimoto with the collaboration of Masaharu Iwata, already appreciated in the PSX version, and the same effects for spells or battle noises. Comment Years go by but FF Tactics continues to be one of the reference points of the J-RPG strategy genre. Like good wine it has aged well, especially if, as in this PSP version, the elements characterizing the original, i.e. the enthralling and obscure plot, the practically perfect game mechanics and a top-notch soundtrack, are added new acts to improve every single aspect. Giving the title that ~something more~ which makes it, among other things, an ideal product for those who want to try their hand at this genre for the first time, or one more reason for those who have already played the original to play it again here and enjoy it in a more complete version, sometimes unpublished. There is a flaw, however, the development of the action, the opponents' turns and so on has remained identical to the original version of ten years ago, therefore they become a bit slow especially when compared with that of the strategic ones that came out over the years follow, which offer more up-to-date dynamics and seasoned with shortcuts that speed up the flow of fightsand downtime. Whether this thing is bearable or not is a subjective assessment, while the fact that the title still remains a small masterpiece of its kind in this version is objective. Pros: More complete and detailed than the original. Oscar-winning anime-style interludes. New modes and classes. Cons: Lack of localization in Italian. Game scheme anchored in the dynamics of 10 years ago. Ivalice Alliance is an almost parallel project and conceptually similar to that inherent in the main saga of Final Fantasy, namely Fabula Nova Crystallis. In line with Square-Enix's new development policy, in fact, the one that involves the creation of multiple titles linked to the same videogame universe, but with different gameplays, the Final Fantasy Tactics series also has its own multiplatform project. Project that bears the name of the imaginary world created in 1995 by Yasumi Matsuno and which has had development over the years as well as in the ~tactical~ also in Final Fantasy XII and Vagrant Story. A series of video games such as Revenant Wings and Final Fantasy TA2: The sealed Grimoire, for Nintendo Ds, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System, for PS2 and Final Fantasy Tactics: Shishi Senso (aka The War of the Lions) for PSP, remake of the very famous turn-based strategy that by now ten years ago conquered millions of fans of the genre all over the world, on the Playstation, and which we are going to talk about in this review. Explains Akitoshi Kawazu Executive producer of Square-Enix: ~This project aims to be a way to expand the universe of Ivalice, to expand its world and its history, attracting new and old players to this franchise~", "date": "2007-09-28", "grade": null}
