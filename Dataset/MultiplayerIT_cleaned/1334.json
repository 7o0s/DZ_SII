{"name": "Knights Of The Temple", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/knights-of-the-temple.html", "text": "A knight without a round table The action takes place in the third person with fixed camera shots, so the CPU will decide the camera movements based on the situation. As often happens in similar productions, the latter affect the orientation of the player to favor a cinematographic direction. However, in principle you have sufficient control of the situation or almost, but we will explain why later. The biggest problems derive from the playful sector, obtusely anchored to a sterile formula of endless fights, manageable with a few basic attack and defense moves, plus a series of combos. Only two keys for soft or hard hit and one key for blocking. Immediacy risks turning into boredom too soon, as the player will not be slow to find the rhythm to pierce the most difficult defenses with a shrewd use of the parry (enemies make cyclical attacks), even worse if we consider the fact that there is a easily executable move to break through the opponent's block. In an attempt to offer feeble incentives to the player (talking about rpg elements is out of place), as you progress through the game, increasingly intricate attack combinations are opened, but whose usefulness is rather questionable. Soon we return to using the classic basic techniques of the parry-lunge, sacrificing every possible evolution of the gameplay in honor of pragmatism. Furthermore, the enemies tend to surround the protagonist, at which time the deficit of the cameras becomes worrying. Taking blows after blows without being able to react adequately makes the experience frustrating, especially when the shots contribute to generating confusion and disorientation. This is precisely the biggest limitation of the TDK title, which refers to playful mechanics from beat'em up arcade, where the immoderate amount of enemies always facilitates a breach where to strike against the player. But then this gameplay that we could define as ~strategic~ was motivated by the need to insert coins into the cabinet, while Knights Of The Temple has quite other entertainment duties. Xbox vs PS2 We tested KOTT for both platforms. Although sharing the same graphics engine, the two versions differ significantly in terms of optimization, to the clear advantage of the Microsoft console, which sports a greater definition in the textures, but above all it is much more fluid with a 60fps framerate, albeit with some drops. The PS2 version settles at 30, but always with dips that make the most chaotic situations anything but fluid. Furthermore, the uploads on the Sony console are really unnerving, which does not happen on the Xbox by virtue of the never too praised hd. To conclude, we point out the Live multiplayer support, however limited to one-on-one clashes in closed arenas, a mode that frankly did not convince us at all. My kingdom for a sword Perhaps aware of this, to break the linearity, the programmers have planned the levels to facilitate minimal exploration, as well as adding some easy-to-solve puzzles. Furthermore, as you progress it will be possible to wield different weapons, use magic and even a bow. This last feature is the one that most allows the title to detach itself from the aforementioned formula, introducing some strategic element. The view becomes subjective, allowing the player a certain precision in the use of the arrows, these are used not only to shoot down insidious snipers, but also to solve puzzles. However, these additional ingredients are not enough to raise the fortunes of a title whose playability is never fully convincing. Technically, the work done is not outstanding, but it is valuable and, even if the polygonal engine does not exceed in virtuosity, it does its duty with dignity. The atmosphere, as mentioned, is spot on and is undoubtedly the highlight of the product, thanks to an accurate reproduction of sixteenth century England and the abundantly lugubrious tones. The animations of the protagonist are also convincing, whose slow step with raised sword makes the idea of a warrior weighed down by a heavy tunic believable. The sound accompaniment is also honest, but even on this level there are no characteristics that effectively distinguish themselves from the average. The cut-scenes are subdued, made with the game engine and rather anonymous in terms of direction and emotional involvement. Comment Knights Of The Temple is a title that rises from anonymity by virtue of a professional graphic realization, an apt atmosphere and some good ideas capable of arousing interest, not least the formula closely linked to the concept of scrolling fighting game, but enriched with adventure elements. YouAll this, however, risks lasting too little, but not for the length of the adventure. The infatuation for the meticulous medieval reproduction could quickly vanish and lift the veil on the defects of the play structure, chained to a sequence of badly diversified fights, tedious over long distances and penalized by the poor effectiveness of the evolved actions. It can represent a good title to spend a few hours of leisure, but to really involve the player a greater productive effort is needed, an effort that we honestly do not see in the latest TDK effort. Pros Satisfactory graphics Adequate atmosphere Might keep you entertained for a while Cons But not for long. Some fights are frustrating Too repetitive The vein of chivalric adventures has always enjoyed some success, however lately the exponents of the genre have dwindled (if we exclude the Lord of the Rings tie-in). TDK takes care of rebalancing the situation with an adventure with strong slash'em up imprints, or with progression linked to white weapon fights. The programmers wanted to give the product an oppressive atmosphere, well recreated with the use of very dark medieval settings: from gloomy manors to remote citadels, passing from very uncomfortable dungeons, keepers of horrible secrets. The intent is to mix the historical period of the crusades with typically fantasy grafts, if not exactly horror. We will take on the role of Paul, a fearless Templar warrior involved in a bloody series of clashes against the forces of evil, whose epilogue will even take place in the underworld. On our tortuous journey we will meet everything from assassin monks, to brawny knights, ruthless snipers and even demons! Sounds ridiculous enough, but the bizarre cocktail works, even if its heavy splashes of gore make it not for everyone. In fact, the violence present in the game is very high, well above the average of the genre. Although there are no beheadings or mutilations, the emphasis placed on the protagonist's offensive actions is very marked, especially in the final animation of deadly combos on the unfortunate victims of the moment. The game does not skimp on dispensing large quantities of blood, both from the tortured bodies and from the purulent stones of some filthy torture chamber. It goes without saying that certain situations are very tense, so much so that it is not possible to understand when the game will divert to rarefied atmospheres or claustrophobic horror raids. This bizarre (although not very original) peculiarity fuels a certain interest in trying this title.", "date": "2004-04-22", "grade": null}
