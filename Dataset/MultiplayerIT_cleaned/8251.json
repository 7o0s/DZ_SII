At a friend's house, or perhaps a cousin's, their pudgy fingers have wrapped around a control knob, joystick or, more recently, a joypad. At two years of age, the smartest ones already had the fingers of the left hand ~in WASD~ and those of the right hand like claws around the mouse. However, the same is true for everyone: from that moment the spark was struck and goodbye to social life, respect for peers and outdoor games. What you wouldn't do for love. And just to celebrate this passion, in its unforgettable phase of the 80s and 90s, Brian Provinciano created Retro City Rampage, a tribute to everything he and millions of players loved in those roaring years of pixels, disks and expensive cartridges. Originally this game was supposed to be a Nintendo demake of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then the project has grown and now it's ready to spread its nostalgia virus on quite a few platforms. So let's play as Player and find out what there is for us to do in Theftopolis, where crime never loses. Free quotes Retro City Rampage is every child's forbidden dream, an open world in which to carry out raids without brakes or limits, occasionally discarding a new toy, the missions. The amount of content is impressive: 40 challenges, 60 narrative missions, over fifty vehicles and various mini-games, including a fun tribute to Super Meat Boy, to be played in a cabinet inside a Theftopolis arcade. Retro City Rampage is a concentration of pop and videogame quotes from the 80s and 90s so vast that it is impossible to even think of drawing up a list. It happens to turn down the street and see the Ninja Turtles come out of a manhole and beat us up. During a mission in the house of Biffman, a parody version of Batman, we happened to search for objects to solve a fake puzzle and then suddenly realize the wink at Maniac Mansion. Not to mention the moment in which Provinciano makes fun of us by offering us help to continue, as happens in today's graphic adventures. In Retro City Rampage everything refers to something else that we have already experienced in our lives as players. From Smash TV to Halo, Donkey Kong to Robocop, there's room for everyone in Theftopolis. Imagine an 8-bit version of Grand Theft Auto in which you can fly with a jet pack, run on super shoes, kill passers-by, steal cars and engage in shootouts with the police without worrying about a thing, without too much effort and at great speed. Stopping every now and then for a crazy haircut or to put on an unlikely hat. A feast of extremely detailed characters and vehicles, designed with the hand of a pixel craftsman and made even more festive by the effects and music of yesteryear, obviously inspired by famous motifs. That's the best part of Retro City Rampage, an outlet for freedom from a fictional Nintendo. But then, as an open world requires, come the missions. And soon the enthusiasm collapses under the weight of frustration. Tired repetition Parody is the stylistic hallmark of Retro City Rampage, which makes fun of both the heroes of the past and the mechanics of the video games that hosted them. And as long as we stick to the free-roaming of Theftopolis, with its over-the-top mayhem, the game's bare-bones simplicity works great. You shoot, you run, you jump on people's heads and you can even duck behind cover, with the handy target lock function to avoid dislocating your fingers with the keyboard. Even the first approach to the missions, with a ridiculous version of the Joker and Doc from Back to the Future, runs smoothly without a hitch. But then, after a few hours, the game suddenly becomes brutal. We've just finished having a blast cleaning out a factory that we're asked to clear the traffic by blowing up twenty cars with dynamite before time runs out. Fantastic. Too bad that in an instant we have the police on us and after a few seconds we are already dead. Or again: we are in prison and we have to get past the guards without being seen during a mini infiltration mission. That's when a pixel out of place is enough and you have to start over. But things are worse in the next corridor, when we fray our nerves trying to jump squarely on the officers' heads only to be killed instantly by a policeman with a rocket launcher in front of the exit door. And off to the beginning again. After about fifteen attempts it is usually possible to overcome the obstacle, but the stimuli are few. It makes no sense to joke aboutboredom that generates a stalking mission, asking us to drink coffee before falling asleep, if then it is enough to miss a petrol station because a vehicle got in the way to have to start all over again. Unfortunately this is the rule: there are not enough checkpoints in Retro City Rampage. And the controls are not adequate for the type of challenges proposed, especially during the more difficult missions. One could argue that this frustration is an homage to the old days, when there were no finesse controls and Super Meat Boy would have seemed like an easy game. Very true. We really liked Retro City Rampage and we are sure that many players will find great pleasure in finding their past and enjoying a few hours of senseless destruction. The fact remains that the missions, as they are structured, are only bridges to move from one quote to another, unrelated to each other and weak compared to the free game mode. If that's just what you're after, then you can give Retro City Rampage a full rating and travel back in time without fear of disappointment.", "date": "2012-10-18", "grade": "7.3"}
