That of Harvest Moon is now known by all the fans who have been following it since 1998, from its first appearance on Super Nintendo: an intriguing mix between simulation and role-playing game, all set in the peasant countryside. We start with a long and detailed tutorial that immediately introduces a fundamental feature of this ~new beginning~, i.e. the much more marked customization compared to the other chapters. After choosing a proper name and that of our city, we move on to the face of our digital alter ego, scrolling through the various physical and anatomical options, concluding with the clothes. During the game it will then be possible to model your own home and the elements of the farm, the cultivated fields and the village itself as you like. During the first hours of the game (more than an entire season) practically nothing happens: you live in an empty village, without inhabitants and shops, without possibilities or many options, creating an initial sense of frustration and disorientation also because you don't understand fold will take later this Harvest Moon. Once the stumbling block of this very long prologue has been overcome, the game gradually meshes and from the second, third season onwards it becomes a real mine of surprises, things to do, fields to manage, people to meet and... obviously a boyfriend/girlfriend to find, as per tradition. Social relationships are mostly based on two concepts: the first is conversation, the second is the exchange of gifts. It is therefore very important to often visit the people who live in the village, and perhaps give some gifts to those who are more sympathetic to us. Establishing a relationship with the Echo Village clothing designer will lead us to receive clothes and accessories, where perhaps the blacksmith would give us upgrades for work tools or new iron objects. You can go as far as the wedding, and it's nice to note that finally having a bride (or a groom) is not only a side element but serves and helps the player to maintain the house and the farm, looking for useful objects in the city, cooking and cultivating the land. In short, within the role-playing game, the management game and the simulator, there is also room for feelings and love. Stressed out by city life? The new Harvest Moon could be the solution I want to go live in the country Those who expected to be faced with an innocent farmer simulator will have to change their minds quickly, because Harvest Moon: A New Beginning becomes, season after season (this is how time is marked within the game), a real parallel world made up of friendships, loves, home and work to maintain. There is obviously a certain similarity, from some points of view, with Nintendo's Animal Crossing; the social side of Harvest Moon, highly developed in this chapter, has the advantage of distracting the player from what would be his main task (farming), offering a valid pastime that interrupts the monotony of work and gives more rhythm to the gameplay. The interactions between villagers thus have the dual objective of making us obtain new useful objects and making work in the fields less tedious. Where games like Animal Crossing worked with a sort of ~real time~ virtual clock, Harvest Moon: A New Beginning is instead always linked to the actual game time, in the sense that the world does not progress with the Nintendo 3DS switched off, but only when it starts at a rate of a virtual hour every minute of the clock. As time passes, energy is consumed and one finds oneself progressively more and more tired and forced to eat and drink to recover one's strength, a strategic factor of no small importance. Every day jobs must be completed and daily objectives obtained such as watering, fertilizing, harvesting, selling the crop: small quests that are independent of everything else and are practically mandatory to continue. Outline, there are hundreds of things to do to pass the time between secondary activities (fishing, for example) and the customization options that the title allows. In addition to the simulation and managerial phase, there is in fact a story to follow which, however simple, is extremely captivating: you have to bring people back to live in their semi-abandoned village. To do this, it is necessary to continue with daily life and work, but above all to modify the surrounding environment trying to make it as livable and welcoming as possible: build gardens, fountains, green spaces where you can socialize, plant flowers, trees and much more Still. Consequently, we must obtain the necessary for the realization of our projects, and with the money earned you can buy tools and materials useful for the purpose. The lower screen of Nintendo 3DS constantly acts as a map that can be consulted at any time to locate fellow citizens and their position, even if the developers could have dared something more by giving a more intelligent use of the touch screen. For example, it could be better exploited in interacting with animals, or by creating special mini-games. Language barrier The version distributed in Italy is completely in English, a factor which automatically determines its exclusion from those who unfortunately do not know this language well. Harvest Moon is quite a complex game, full of text, conversations, things to read. Being also an RPG, therefore, understanding it is important enough to fully enjoy it. The Mother of all Harvest Moons The very nature of the latter Harvest Moon: A New Beginning makes clear the intention of the Japanese developers, which is to create a real reboot of the series even before a classic sequel. The assumptions of this theory all lie in the fact that this title is a real ~summa~ of all the best features and options present in the previous chapters, all amalgamated by many small new features unpublished for the series. It is now possible to fish with traps, for example, and many cultivable plants have been added such as cotton, cacti, lotus; bizarre animals such as llamas and alpacas, as well as greater interaction with dogs and cats (always remember to feed them!). The whole social side has been enhanced, starting right from the relationship with the spouse that we can also take on a trip to four different locations such as the sea, the mountains, at the ancient ruins or the cherry orchards to spend a romantic honeymoon. Furthermore, continuing in the game and building new places in the village, new portions of the map that can be explored are discovered, thus increasing the areas that can be walked on. Once the edit mode has been made accessible, it is possible to change everything we want within the village, trying to make it more and more beautiful and livable just as if we were playing a LEGO title. Another novelty is the totally polygonal graphics, which finally retires the old sprites and gives a whole new look. The commands for moving with the directional cross follow the indications of the polygonal engine and are much freer and more fluid than in the past, even if the change of setting reveals some uncertainty and imperfection in the character-object interaction. The graphics engine is solid but it doesn't work miracles, there are no big bugs apart from some sporadic polygonal interpenetration and some slowdowns, but the general cosmetics don't even make you cry out for a technical miracle. The general retrogaming feeling, however, fascinates and almost brings back to that Harvest Moon on Nintendo 64, one of the most popular. The stereoscopic effect of Nintendo 3DS, then, is not one of the most memorable in the albeit short history of this console, resulting mostly a graphic quirk even before an option at the service of the game and gameplay. Last but not least we also talk about the possibility of using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for multiplayer (also possible locally, by the way). Connecting to the internet through Harvest Moon is only possible after the appearance of the Goddess of the Harvest on the 27th of spring of the first year, after she has explained all the options to you through yet another tutorial. You can roam the city together with up to three other buddies from your friends list, or connect with random players from all over the world. It is also possible to exchange objects and this is precisely the fastest way to scrape together everything we need in our village. Summing up, it's really impossible to talk about everything in this Harvest Moon: A New Beginning, and on the other hand it would also be quite boring. Suffice it to say that the game is so full of events (there are so many festivals in the village!), options, things to do and characters to meet that it will probably be able to occupy your next gaming months. Then considering the budget constraint, we believe that Natsume has created if not the best Harvest Moon ever, one of the best ever.", "date": "2013-10-17", "grade": "8.0"}
