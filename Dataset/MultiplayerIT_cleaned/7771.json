Arrived in the West with the less exotic name of Time and Eternity, the new adventure of the Luminous Arc and Fate/Extra team promised an experience capable of combining a pleasant character design with a series of completely new ideas for the genre, both in terms narrative and game mechanics. It is a pity that, especially in a genre reluctant to innovation such as that of jRPGs, good ideas must then be implemented and inserted into a well-finished and coherent product, which unfortunately the project led by Kay Hirono has not managed to do. Fancy Towa Time and Eternity is the story of Zack, a somewhat manic knight who prepares to marry Princess Toki, but who is killed by a group of assassins just as he is at the altar. Obviously Toki is not a princess like the others, and with the help of her second personality, the blonde and energetic Towa, she decides to go back in time to find out and stop who ordered the assassination. As if the premise weren't improbable enough, once in the past Zack discovers that his consciousness has been transferred into the body of Drake, Toki and Towa's pet, thus being able to help his girlfriend and take advantage of it for pathetic skits from the voyeuristic flavour. The idea of a protagonist able to switch from one personality to another has been tested over and over again by Japanese (and not only) authors, but in Time and Eternity it tries to clearly influence the plot and gameplay. Unfortunately any hope of an elaborate, emotional and twisted story is suffocated by the myriad of Japanese clichs ranging from winking skits to slow and useless chatter between the various female archetypes typical of anime: the introduction of the game itself is a long and boring chat between Toki and her friends. Just like Toki and Towa, the game itself is also made up of two different souls, continuously alternating the fights and growth of the protagonist, typical of the jRPG genre, with the dialogues and interactions with the characters that usually characterize visual novels and dating simulators. However, the latter part is weighed down by banal dialogues, uninteresting discussions and gags repeated over and over again, not to mention the poorly spot on and too often out of sync English dubbing. The screenplay put together by Imageepoch never manages to touch the emotional chords of those who play, almost always preferring a trivial comic drift and treating the few dramatic moments and the inner conflicts of the characters too superficially. Playstation 3 trophies In Time and Eternity the bad news is that it is not possible to take home the Platinum in the first game, and that it is necessary to replay the adventure at least a second time. The good news is that there aren't particularly difficult Trophies to unlock, as most can be obtained simply by continuing the story, completing side missions and continuing your relationship with Toki or Towa. Ideas without substance If the visual novel component of Time and Eternity is a real sieve, things get (slightly) more interesting when, having collected a quest between a chat and another, you take the field and experience the combat system. The clashes take place against one opponent at a time in the role of Toki or Towa, carrying out the various attacks with the four front buttons of the DualShock, one for the standard shots and the remaining three for the special techniques that can be unlocked and equipped. Placing itself halfway between the old static combat systems and the recent action-jRPGs, the player cannot move freely on the battlefield, but by moving the analog stick to the right or left he can dodge incoming shots; in the same way, by tilting it up or down, it is possible to approach or move away respectively to attack the opponent in melee or from a distance. Especially after the first few hours of the game, as you get new spells and special techniques, this particular system becomes dynamic enough to be almost enjoyable, but it all comes crashing down due to some glaring glitches. In addition to the slow response times, there is in fact the lack of strategic depth of the combat system: once the type of attack of a particular enemy has been memorized, dodging or repelling his blows becomes child's play, making every fight all too trivial. Especially among the bosses there is no shortage of qusome more demanding challenges, but the power of elemental spells, even the most trivial ones, is so unbalanced that just a couple of hits are enough to eliminate any opponent. A few more for the bosses. Precisely for this reason, every fight is reduced to always repeating the same strategy, dodging the blows of the enemy and filling him with blows until the special attack is ready to be launched. The superficiality of the system and the possibility of further lowering the difficulty level can effectively satisfy those looking for an undemanding jRPG in which there is no need for grinding to enhance one's character, but at the same time the developers are never able to to meet those who prefer challenges that are at least more demanding and tactical. A stylistic mess Despite a fresh and interesting idea base, sadly insignificant quests and mediocre combat represent only some of Time and Eternity's various shortcomings. Especially when you consider the names behind it, the artistic component of the game turns out to be a spectacular hole in the water. On the one hand there are the forgettable, repetitive and anonymous music of a Yuzo Koshiro who does not seem at all the same composer behind the electrifying or epic themes of Streets of Rage and Ys II. We have already talked about the forgettable English dubbing, but fortunately the possibility of setting the original voices of the Japanese voice actors is at least given. But it is from a graphic point of view that the Imageepoch title takes the biggest stylistic slip: the Taiwanese artist Vofan took advantage of a mainly female cast to indulge himself with a character design characterized by particular and brightly colored clothes, giving life to extremely pleasing illustrations. It's a pity that everything is ruined by the unfortunate choice of inserting 2D characters in (poor) environments and (poor) three-dimensional mechanics: the friction is already evident in the dialogue sequences, but it grows dramatically both during the fights than while exploring the desolate dungeons. Overall, one almost gets the impression of being in front of a low-budget game, like those full-bodied doujin games that lack the stylistic coherence and finishing work necessary to make them pleasant both to see and to play. Time and Eternity is packed with ideas, but it's also a generic, superficial game full of clichs", "date": "2013-06-27", "grade": "4.8"}
