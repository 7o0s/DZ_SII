Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. If drag racers are conquering a certain space on mobile devices it is certainly thanks to the NaturalMotion developers, who with CSR Racing have managed to create a product capable of capturing the attention of many enthusiasts, moreover willing to spend real money to get your fastest car. After having collected several million dollars, the authors of the game have decided to get back on track and look for the difficult encore with CSR Classics which, as the name suggests, focuses on the charm of vintage cars to also attract users who hadn't let themselves be fascinated by the previous title. The formula remains the ultra-tested one of the origins: after having purchased a ~loser~ car with the initial credits (literally: each car is available in the ~old wreck~ and in the ~flaming new~ version), with ample room for upgrading , we are offered numerous races based solely on speed, just like those in the movie ~Fast & Furious~. Sequences in which our driving ability is practically never questioned, given that all we will have to do is act on the ignition, gearbox and nitro button as precisely as possible, earning tenths or even hundredths of second useful for overcoming the opponent before the finish line. CSR Classics clearly improves the experience of the first episode, even if there are no big news Even faster, even more furious The NaturalMotion guys didn't sit idly by and observed very well what was happening in the drag racer genre on iOS and Android. The excellent Fast & Furious 6: The Game had introduced interesting elements to make an otherwise highly repetitive action more varied, however it was decided to postpone this and to remain anchored to the traditional gearbox/nitro combination without involving drifts , a conservative solution that shows all its limits in the long run. What is certain is that, however, on the technical front the work done was incredible, and looking at CSR Racing and CSR Classics they look like games belonging to different generations, the improvements in terms of graphics and sound are so evident. The new episode catapults us into a scenario incredibly rich in elements, plays of light, reflections, truly splendid to see in motion. The engine didn't have to make who knows what effort because the route is only straight, one could say, however the enormous visual impact of the experience must be recognized, which greatly helps to make the cars present and the races in which they are involved more fascinating , prompting us to ~grind~ to get credits with which to buy the numerous upgrades. On the front of the structure there is in fact a lot of substance, between ~main~ and ~secondary~ competitions, an outline of the plot, challenges to the last centimeter and even risky bets in which we could lose the hard-earned gold tokens, i.e. the valuable currency of this freemium which, we must admit, is a bit invasive in its continuous ~offers~ but basically lets you play without too many problems, beyond the traditional ~tank~ which empties a little with each race we face.", "date": "2013-10-26", "grade": "7.7"}
