Developer Electronic Arts has adapted the PC game mechanics to the Nintendo handheld, downsizing certain aspects and expanding others. In Sim City DS we take on the role of Mayor of the city, and helped by one of our trusted advisers who constantly follows and advises us (there is also Will Wright, the creator of the Sims) we must organize the metropolis in which we live and make all happy and satisfied inhabitants. The commands, actions, statistics and options have all been placed on the lower screen, which for the occasion has been assigned to ~control~ every situation. the difficulty curve, in spite of that ~PEGI 3+~ printed on the cover, is high Nintendo DS is the perfect machine for a management There are so many icons and writings on the screen that it will take some time to learn to understand them all: it is strongly advisable not to start the game by creating a city but to follow the full-bodied tutorial, through which we will become familiar with all the controls at our disposal , otherwise the risk is to find ourselves literally lost among icons, drawings and graphics whose meaning and use we will not understand. Once the explanations are over and we feel ready to leave, we have to choose the plot of land on which to start building: the map is divided into many ~cells~, each of which with its own morphological characteristics (courses of water, sea, land, coast) and a different budget of money available to start, a factor that differentiates the degree of initial difficulty chosen. The second piece of advice we feel like giving is to start with a high budget, at least if it's the first time you're playing a Sim City: the medium/difficult levels are really difficult to carry on, the difficulty curve, in spite of that ~PEGI 3+~ printed on the cover, is high. Touch screens and dual screens are ideal, perhaps. Our (at least initially) small city immediately possesses the basic and fundamental infrastructures, those necessary for the minimum ~survival~ of the population: hospital, fire brigade, power plant, some roads, and now it is our turn and we must demonstrate all our organizational skills. Each action is performed with the stylus, in two ways. Sim City, as previously happened in Age of Empires and Anno 1701, takes full advantage of the touch screen as an interface, thus bringing all the functionality of the mouse back to the stylus. The upper screen is therefore the main one, which displays the map and the interactive elements, while the lower one is used to convey information and display data and statistics. Everything is therefore designed to be done using the stylus and the touch screen, from moving around the map to selecting the available actions. Everything is therefore designed to be done using the stylus and the touch screen, from moving around the map to selecting the available actions Touch screens and dual screens are ideal, perhaps. By pressing a few keys, however, it is possible to perform quick commands such as zooming on the map. There are some flaws in the use of the touch, for example it is quite difficult to draw the roads that are often built in a ~zig-zag~ with consequent waste of public money. Going instead to build something on the edge of the screen, the scrolling that moves the camera is activated too quickly and quickly, making us lose control of what we were doing. Returning to the roads, it is better to start managing our city from here, as they are very important for travel and communications. There are three different areas to organize and keep in balance with each other: the residential area, the one where the citizens live, the commercial area, with shops and activities, and finally the industrial area, where we have to place power plants, factories and industries. The happiness of the inhabitants first of all In Sim City DS we must always have an eye towards balancing the three main areas mentioned just before, in fact it is not recommended to build houses near polluting factories: the population would suffer and would not be satisfied. ~the aura~ must always be positive so as to create a relaxed and serene atmosphere among the citizens. It is therefore necessary to provide neighborhoods with public parks, green spaces and entertainment. In the area comon the other hand, commercial centers and activities such as post offices are placed, which can be used to send ~messages~ and letters to other mayors of Sim City, via the Nintendo WI-FI connection. It is also possible to exchange particular buildings and constructions, attaching them to mail messages. At the beginning of the game we are given a certain amount of money to spend on developing the city. On the first day of each month, all income is added to our ~account~, while the running costs are deducted constantly. People also don't like to commute to work The happiness of the inhabitants first of all If we find ourselves without available funds it will be impossible to continue building and we will have to wait for the following month, hoping that nothing serious will happen to our city. The population increases as the residential areas are extended, but will soon leave the city if I am not satisfied with the standard of living achieved: it is therefore preferable to always use a part of the funds for the entertainment and needs of the people. People also don't like commuting to work, so it's advisable not to force them to move too far and build businesses close to homes, connecting them with excellent means of transport such as roads and trains. The sims then only develop the areas that are within a certain distance from the road, four boxes for residential and industrial ones, three for commercial ones. The age-old problem of waste also haunts us in Sim City Every area of the city requires water and energy; we have to build power plants and water facilities to bring livelihood to our sims. These buildings do not have infinite autonomy, but their ability to provide services is limited: as the city expands, it is always necessary to build new ones, and to destroy the dilapidated ones in order not to cause some environmental disaster to explode (whose rarity can be set by options, however). The energy can reach any point, but it spreads within four squares of empty terrain with no roads, buildings, or flora. In this DS version, then, it is impossible to cross some constructions such as, for example, electricity with roads, as could be done in the PC versions, and certainly the reason lies in the programmers' desire not to further burden the graphics, in order not to make it unclear, even if the result is an extra inconvenience. Just like in reality, after a flourishing progress come the contraindications: the more inhabitants, activities and industries we have, the greater the amount of waste produced. Just like in reality, after a flourishing progress come the contraindications: the more inhabitants, activities and industries we have, the greater the amount of waste produced The age-old problem of waste also haunts us in Sim City It is our task to build disposal centers and landfills, being careful however that these do not interfere with the life of the inhabitants, as nobody wants to live near these structures. By clicking on the magnifying glass on the lower screen, it is possible to ~point~ to any building to receive all the data and statistics useful for managing them in real time, on the upper monitor. It is very important to check these data often, the risk is that of causing an accident or fire to happen (in case, it will be better to blow hard into the microphone of the DS!). Keeping an eye on our financial budgets will instead be less complicated, as there are special statistical tables that summarize the monthly situation with a handy graph that is always available. Whenever we have to disconnect the game and save the position reached, we will be asked to overwrite the save file: in fact, there are no other slots and it is therefore impossible to carry on more than one city at a time or return to a previous state if we realize that have done something seriously wrong. The mayor's life is really too hard! Graphics and sound On the purely technical side, Sim City DS is not a game that makes us cry out for a miracle. First of all there are structural defects due to the low capacity of the cartridge: the artistic variety of buildings, houses, buildings and similar has obviously been resized for reasons of space, and consequently the cities will all be more or less similar from an architectural point of view. The Electronic Arts title, just like the other management systems that have already appeared on the DS, is entirely in 2D, and this factor brings to light ancient defects such as the inability to rotate the view to understand and see how much space there is around the buildings. Place one building behind another leaving enough space for a street nonor will it be such an immediate operation: much will depend on our capacity for imagination and ~spatiality~. The level of detail isn't the best either. In Sim City DS you can use two different zooms, one closer and the other panoramic. Even if you use the closest one, the bitmaps are poorly defined, as if they had undergone a process of digitizing the originals at a lower resolution, thus losing detail. there are some structural defects due to the low capacity of the cartridge: the artistic variety of buildings, houses, buildings and similar has obviously been resized for reasons of space Graphics and sound Scrolling is fortunately fluid and without uncertainties, even if, as previously mentioned, once you get the stylus to the edge of the screen it starts too quickly, making the construction operations not very precise and orderly. The music and effects, moving on to the sound side, are few and decidedly anonymous. The latter are limited to a few sounds in particular events, such as fires and destructions, while the background music is simply midi made with two, maximum three mixed sounds. The available space of the DS cartridge was evidently exhausted. No excuses instead for the bad character design that accompanies us throughout the game with our adviser and the various characters who will visit us: rarely in recent years had we seen such a bad construction style. Regardless of the artistic side, the characters are animated with very few frames and perhaps colored with Paint, very bad. Comment Electronic Arts has succeeded in the difficult task of transporting the complex game mechanics of Sim City to the small Nintendo DS. Despite some changes due to the size of the screens, this title follows the gameplay already appreciated on Personal Computers, even if the reduced capacity of the DS cartridge had to sacrifice many aspects of the game. Amount of buildings, detail, graphics and sound have been cut to fit into that narrow handful of Megabytes, and the end result is what we find ourselves playing a decidedly subdued version of the famous EA brand. For all those approaching it for the first time, however, it is not a title to be underestimated. Pros Deep and long Pleasant use of mail with Wi-Fi Connection Lots of things to manage and organize Cons Some control problems Graphics and Character Design Only one save slot Nintendo DS confirms itself as the ideal machine on which to develop strategic and managerial RTS: thanks to the intuitive use of the stylus and touch screen, in fact, it appears to be the console that comes closest to the mouse pointing characteristics for PCs, the hardware on which they are conceived, designed and intended almost all of these genres of video games. In recent times there have been many PC - DS conversions precisely because of this extreme ease of use of the controls, starting from the good old Age of Empire through Anno 1701, up to Settlers. Electronic Arts certainly didn't stand by, having one of the best known and most successful franchises in this field, and has finally decided to develop a portable version of its evergreen ~Sim City~, renamed for the occasion and without too much imagination ~Sim City DS~, which can already be found on all the shelves of our trusted stores.", "date": "2007-08-09", "grade": null}
