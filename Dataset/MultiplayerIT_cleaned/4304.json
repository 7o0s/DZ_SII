Legacy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/197911-nova-legacy-la-recensione-di-nova-legacy.html", "text": "More than nine years have passed since the release of N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance, and the scenario of first person shooters for smartphones and tablets has changed, although not substantially. We have naturally witnessed a technical evolution and the introduction of refinements regarding the mechanics and touch controls, but in recent times the productions belonging to this genre have become rarer or have veered towards online. It is therefore interesting to note how Gameloft wanted to apply the remaster philosophy also in the mobile sector, first on Android and now on iOS, with N.O.V.A. Legacies. The game proposes precisely the experience of the first episode of the series by adopting, however, a freemium model and a completely revisited technical sector, in some ways also in terms of features (see multiplayer for six participants instead of four). The story and content therefore remain the same: under the command of Kai Wardin, a N.O.V.A. veteran, we will have to put on the armor again and take up the rifle to defend the planet from the invasion of a particularly hostile alien race. References to Halo (and Crysis, for some design choices) abound, but the single player campaign, with its five chapters and extra missions, still manages to entertain and excite today, being able to count on a substantially improved visual impact. Swiss? No, N.O.V.A. After a short tutorial, the action of N.O.V.A. Legacy flows smoothly and convincingly, proposing situations that are in truth always quite similar: we find ourselves in scenarios invaded by enemies and we need to eliminate them, using the different weapons that make up our equipment and which we can enhance or replace with new tools, based on the money and items collected at the end of each mission. There are switches to flip, an abundance of lifts, modified gravity sections with the requirement to cover short distances in the least amount of time; but also completely different scenarios such as the large forest to explore during the central phase of the campaign, a location which unfortunately does not benefit greatly from the remastering work and immediately reveals the limits of a polygonal construction and effects designed to a much less performing hardware than the current one. Certainly a significant boost has been suffered by the enemies, who now boast models that are practically unrecognizable compared to the beginning of the franchise, very detailed and not at all angular, with even some touch of class as regards the animations of evasion. Unfortunately the gunplay remains anchored to the original vision, connected to a touch control system which is confirmed as precise and consistent, but which does not overcome the age-old problem of the separate fire button in this remaster. It is a solution that Gameloft itself has set aside for its latest projects, which unfortunately makes some situations cumbersome and forces us to limit the artificial intelligence and the readiness of the opponents, who never make the first move as they would always catch us unprepared . The problem is particularly felt with single-shot weapons and it is a pity that the developers did not think of solving it, letting themselves be intimidated by the need to carry out a rebalancing which, however, would certainly have made the gameplay more frenetic and engaging. A similar argument must be made for support for the iPhone X, currently missing: on the latest Apple terminal the graphics bear two black bands on the sides and therefore do not exploit the total width of the screen. Finally, a few words for the freemium system and the multiplayer sector. The original N.O.V.A. was a premium title, this remaster instead is offered for free but with some compromises, in this case an indicator of the energy of the action which is consumed quite consistently with each attempt (only in single player, however), forcing you to wait a few minutes or to use real currency in order to quickly start a new game. In the end, the solution seemed balanced to us, especially if we consider that the campaign can be finished within three hours, special missions aside, and that therefore an uninterrupted rush could have accelerated its completion. On the other hand, little to say about online, which works very well from the point of view of matchmaking and latency, giving us fun team deathmatches within maps that may not be very beautiful but are able to offer many ideas, especially in terms of vertical development of the 'action.", "date": "2018-04-14", "grade": "7.7"}
