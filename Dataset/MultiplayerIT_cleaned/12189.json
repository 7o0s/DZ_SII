{"name": "Samurai Warriors 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-warriors-5-recensione.html", "text": "Four years after the last episode, the review of Samurai Warriors 5 projects us back into the Sengoku period, during the long war for the unification of Japan which saw the rise of various charismatic leaders on the battlefield, whose feats have inevitably been fictionalized on a thousand different occasions. An idea strongly rooted in musou-style productions, extremely immediate and frenetic action games in which you put yourself in the shoes of these powerful warriors and face thousands of opponents simultaneously, performing spectacular combos and special maneuvers capable of routing entire deployments and allowing our army to liberate the hottest areas of the map. History From a narrative point of view, Samurai Warriors 5 follows the story of two characters in particular, the famous Nobunaga Oda and the lesser known Mitsuhide Akechi, Japanese commanders determined to win the war and to reform the country once and for all. Surrounded by an enormous amount of more or less important supporting characters, who also really existed, Nobunaga and Mitsuhide are the protagonists of as many parallel campaigns, each composed of different chapters and acts that are unlocked as we complete the missions. This is a novelty for the series produced by Koei Tecmo, which recounts for the first time the exploits of the young Nobunaga Oda, the Honnoji incident and other key episodes of a legendary period, which still fascinates many people today. Beyond the good interlude sequences, which benefit greatly from the introduction of cel shading, the narration is however not very exciting, carried on between dialogues that are a little too verbose compared to the distinctly action vocation of the experience. Gameplay Samurai Warriors 5, a classic combo against dozens of enemies. After the failed experiment with the open world of Dynasty Warriors 9, the developers of Omega Force have seen fit to retrace their steps: the team that wins doesn't change and the fact that the franchise has been thriving for over twenty years always proposing the same mechanics stands as a clear indication of the will of the fans of the musou genre. In short, the need to open up these titles to a new audience will have to wait once again. This is to say that in terms of gameplay Samurai Warriors 5 is the same game as always, with the usual structure based on the liberation of the map, the elimination of enemy commanders and the possible protection of some allies. The news are few, albeit welcome: some changes to the crafting of weapons (which however remains rather bizarre) and to the upgrades, with the introduction of a traditional skill tree, but above all a set of unpublished moves to be accessed during the 'action. Samurai Warriors 5, one of the special maneuvers. In addition to the classic combos and supers, we will in fact be able to perform four special maneuvers subject to cooldowns and customizable on the basis of the skills unlocked up to that moment, using them to inflict further damage on opponents but also emphasize our defense capacity for a few seconds, recover health or fill the spiritual energy bar. It seems like a minor addition, but when you find yourself dealing with a formula that pushes you to always perform the same moves to mow down hundreds of enemy soldiers (practically devoid of artificial intelligence : mostly they wait for death), it is clear that four extra movements come in handy and slightly reduce the intrinsic repetitiveness that has always characterized the musou. Technical realization If it is true that the mechanics of Samurai Warriors 5 introduce only marginal innovations compared to the previous chapters of the series, from the point of view of the graphics something has been done, in this case an excellent cel shading has been inserted to obtain a substantially anime style more marked in the visual representation of the characters. It is not the first time that Omega Force has used this technique, mind you, but for Samurai Warriors it is a new choice that we greatly appreciated, especially during the interlude sequences. It is therefore a real pity that cel shading has not been used also for the scenarios, which remain the weak point of the technical sector: empty, repetitive, without any element of interaction, decidedly old-gen. Samurai Warriors 5, a spectacular action special. Fortunately, the old pop-up effect on enemies seems to have been definitively resolved with the latest releases, and this episode confirms the graphics engine's ability to handle hundreds of characters on the screen without ever an uncertainty. Even more so on PC, where the game runs at 4K and 60 fps with allmaximum effects without slowdowns or problems of sorts. Of course, the effects used and the quality of the assets are what they are, but everything is undoubtedly functional to the action. Just as the sound sector is functional, made up of beautiful music perfectly suited to the period and the atmosphere that is represented on the screen, supported by well-interpreted Japanese dialogues, but subtitled only in English: this too is a return to the origins.", "date": "2021-07-27", "grade": "7.0"}
