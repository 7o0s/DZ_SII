{"name": "Shadowrun - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadowrun-recensione.html", "text": "From paper to polygons Shadowrun was born as a ~pen & paper~ RPG in 1989, and this transformation into a Counter-Strike-style first person shooter may seem a bit forced, but Microsoft has attempted the feat. Shadowrun mixes typically cyberpunk atmospheres with classic RPG magic and first person shooter weapons with all the trappings of the case. The first thing to note is the total absence of a single player campaign: the game is in fact, if we exclude the obvious initial tutorial, entirely focused on online multiplayer, even if if you want you can play offline against BOTs (opponents managed by the computer ). The number of players who can participate in a game at the same time is 16, divided into two teams of 8. The four selectable races are distinguished by unique characteristics from each other. Humans are the best at using technology, elves are faster, can regenerate their wounds and use magic well but are physically weaker, while trolls, as per tradition, are big, bad, not very agile and clumsy in the occult arts, and dwarves, well, they are always the same in any RPG so let's not dwell too much (actually here they have the ability to absorb magical powers of those nearby and even resist a single headshot, but don't tell anyone about it). From paper to polygons Each of these races can be deployed in the ranks of RNA Global or Lineage terrorists, the two factions that vie for control over Santos, a Brazilian town rich in magical essence, whose control is the cause of the war. The game setting is very reminiscent of that of the famous Counter-Strike (which we would not like to bother too much on this occasion) seeing, in fact, two teams contending for domination on the map in 3 different modes, which in reality are not so different. At the beginning of each round there will be a short interval to allow players to better equip themselves, buying weapons, spells and accessories. The game modes, as we said, are three: Raid, Extraction and Attrition. The first two focus on the conquest of an artefact, and in fact are a sort of ~capture the flag~: in Raid each team must take the artefact and bring it to the appropriate capture point, while in Extraction each team must prevent cost for the artifact to be removed from its initial location. In both modes already described, however, you can also win by simply eliminating all the members of the opposing team, which is the only way to win in the simplest Attrition. Now you will understand why we said earlier that these modes are not all that different from each other. Shadowrun, the first game in the Games for Windows line specifically for Windows Vista, is an interesting experiment by Microsoft Games Studios, which attempts to introduce a dose of originality into the world of online first-person shooters based on, guess what, an old paper role-playing game. Will the developers of Uncle Bill be able to expertly mix all the elements of this strange alchemy? It's a question of skill... and not of reflections, as the good Jack Burton suggested (but it must be said that they too are certainly convenient). The fulcrum of Shadowrun is precisely in the abilities given by the technological enhancements and magic that the characters can use, the main strength and element of originality of Shadowrun. Once the corresponding skill or magic has been purchased, warriors can teleport, glide, heal and even resurrect companions, turn into smoke making themselves invulnerable to conventional weapons, throw gusts of wind, block passages (or trap enemies) with magical crystals , see through walls, summon a monstrous creature, and more. It's a question of skill... Choosing the right skills and using them in a complementary way during battle is undoubtedly fun, and gives that ~never seen before~ feeling that is increasingly rarely seen in video games. Spotting an enemy through a wall, teleporting over them, and gliding overhead unbeknownst to them is an experience worth trying, and is just a small sample of the various combinations that Shadowrun can do. The races present are very intelligently balanced, and boast equally distributed skills (although online elves are the most popular). The regrettable thing is that the positive aspects end more or less here, leaving the game with the label of ~big missed opportunity~, above all because the maps and game modes are very few, and consequently the sense of repetitiveness catches the player soon, accompagnated by the inaccuracy of the firearms and some rather questionable design choices. Multiplayer only, elegance appreciated, selection at the entrance Shadowrun is the first game in a long line that allows PC gamers to join matches alongside Xbox 360 gamers. In gameplay, distinguishing participants by platform is nearly impossible, and the programmers have managed the daunting task of balancing everything best without favoring one over the other. From time to time you can encounter some rather annoying problems in creating and searching for games, which can keep players stuck in front of an empty list even for whole minutes. As already mentioned, it is possible to reproduce online matches offline, playing against computer-controlled opponents, but since the artificial intelligence of bots is quite questionable, we imagine that this practice will not be very successful. Multiplayer only, elegance appreciated, selection at the entrance Graphics and sound Even from a graphic point of view, Shadowrun reveals itself in its ~half~ nature of the game: while the quality of the textures, some spell and particle effects can be defined as more than good workmanship, other things lower the balance and stand out in stark contrast to those just listed. Among the most out of tune aspects there are certainly the animations, often totally missing or made in an approximate way. The worst thing, however, is that to move these graphics, which as a whole certainly cannot be defined as extraordinary, you need an extraordinary computer instead, as you can see by reading the appropriate box on system requirements. As for the sound, there is little to say, given the total absence of music. The sound effects though, fare pretty well. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows Vista Processor: Dual Core and up RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Nvidia 7800 / Ati X1800 with 256MB RAM or later Disk Space: 4.5 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: E6300 or higher (or AMD equivalent) RAM: 2 GB Video Card: X1900 or equivalent Disk Space: 4.5 GB Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 @ 3.3 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Ati X1950Pro Monitor: Dell 24@1920x1200 Comment Shadowrun is a game with a basic concept that is certainly good, but which is lacking in several respects. The license of the role-playing game it is inspired by is only marginally exploited, but this, also considering that practically nobody knows the original franchise, is only the lesser evil: the real flaws of the Microsoft game are in the insane system requirements, in the ridiculous lack of maps, in the non-impeccable technical realization and in the decidedly too high price. Shadowrun feels like a product that would have needed several more months of development, additional modes, more optimization and all the other things that distinguish a game from a half game. Recommended only for true fans of the genre who want to try something undoubtedly original, but who at the same time are ready to shell out 60 already knowing that what they take home is worth much less. Pros Some interesting news Possibility for Vista and Xbox 360 users to play together Cons Exaggerated price for what is offered No single player mode Exaggerated and unjustified PC system requirements Goals 360 As with all goals related to online games it takes patience. 60 points are unlocked simply by finishing the tutorials, for all the others it will take many games on the net, since most are related to the creation of 100 kill series or games of the same type. 100 games played as a Human rather than an Elf, 100 kills of Human characters and so on.", "date": "2007-07-03", "grade": null}
