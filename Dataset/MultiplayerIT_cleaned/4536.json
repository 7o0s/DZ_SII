Already a month ago, in our preview, we broadly illustrated the offer of the title, focusing on the most interesting and innovative elements, but also expressing more than one doubt about some mechanics that are a bit forced on the small screen. After continuing to fish, pick fruit, and furnish our campsite every single day, we're ready for the final verdict. A completely new trail Animal Crossing Pocket Camp could represent a crucial turning point in the series: the title has been enriched with a series of innovations in the gameplay which, if taken up in future chapters, could make the franchise an increasingly full-bodied management of content, with minimal drift towards the GDR. We had sensed that something was already in the air with Happy Home Designer, a forerunner in the new way of organizing internal and external environments. The mobile chapter continues with the changes, partly because it must necessarily offer a different experience being pocket-sized, partly because it tries new solutions on its own. The heart of Animal Crossing Pocket Camp is above all the progression system, which will lead us to unlock new furniture items, pets and tools as our Villager levels up. We won't have everything immediately available, limited only by the change in our pockets (still represented by the ~stars~), but we will unlock the contents a little at a time. In this way, interest is kept alive in what are ultimately few and repetitive daily actions, but capable of decreeing the success of the series right from the start. The real breaking point with the past is also the manufacturing (or crafting) system: only a few pieces of furniture can be bought by Tom Nook's grandchildren, we'll have to do the rest ourselves. Or rather, we'll have it made by Merino, the blue alpaca introduced in Animal Crossing New Leaf, delivering him the precious materials obtained in our carefree wandering around. If you think that in Animal Crossing you can only accumulate fruit, fish and shells, you will have to think again. Pocket Camp introduces essential raw materials such as wool, wood and iron, but even more precious and interesting are the essences, divided into four different types and closely linked to the interests of the pets. If the description of a certain character portrays him as arrogant (for example Apollo), it means that the latter will be satisfied only if you create objects related to the theme of arrogant for him, and that in turn he will give you essences of this type for the creating new decorations. The tents themselves are linked to the new role of the funny little animals in the title, and are grouped according to their type: by enhancing the home of the characters of the respective type, all of them will acquire a friendship bonus, give us gifts and feel more connected at our campsite. Missions, friends and some weaknesses Maybe historical fans won't like it, but in Animal Crossing Pocket Camp we won't be able to choose the pets to appear at the beginning of the game by continuously restarting the game. The characters that will arrive are established by the developers according to a certain order, and will respect the player's level. However, there are also positive aspects: although, as always, Animal Crossing does not impose any objectives, the management of our camping area can be considered in all respects the closest thing to the purpose of the title. By expanding it, and building the right tents and structures, we will be able to invite the little animals scattered around the game map to move to us, thus creating the private club made up of the ones we prefer. For the first time, they are the ones who assign you real secondary missions, small objectives that require you to find certain fish, certain shells and so on, and then bring them to them. The reward consists of useful materials, but also in increasing their level of friendship, another detail that favors the farming mechanics, and therefore the longevity of the title. Of course, it doesn't take long to satisfy all the requests of the characters present, and there are only four animals around after all (excluding those in the campsite), but every few hours they take turns, alternating with the others that we have already unlocked . The more we level up, the more pets are made available, thus increasing the missions and resources available. If the proposed mechanics, however repetitive, manage to convince, Animal Crossing Pocket Camp discovers the side right where it feels likeplus the weight of the mobile factor. The environments are tiny, the game map skimpy, and nothing can be done about it, even if new areas are added with future updates. Net, fishing rod and shovel cannot be used at will, each of them is linked only and only to a specific territory. Which explains the absence of tools that have now become canonical, such as the slingshot, the megaphone and the stopwatch. Again, the items that can be transported in the inventory are really too few, especially considering that the accumulation of resources is one of the cornerstones of production. We can't even leave them on the ground like in the other episodes of the series, and the fact that the expansions have to be paid for with Leaf Tickets makes our noses turn up even more. Furthermore, from time to time, the times required for the completion of the operations become frustrating: the three hours pass for the fruit trees to ~recharge~, some buildings even require two days to complete the construction. Instead, we were convinced by the few online features present. Our friends can come and visit the campsite that we have prepared, send us help to unlock a minigame available every twenty-four hours, even put items up for sale at their stall, which we can buy in case of urgent need to complete the missions. There is no shortage of short and long-term challenges, with which to earn Leaf Tickets, which can also be purchased with real currency. In this sense, at least up to level 30, freemium mechanics have never been a problem. Everything is done calmly and patiently, you don't need to spend a single euro. And isn't ~calm and patience~ the second name of the series?", "date": "2017-11-22", "grade": "8.0"}
