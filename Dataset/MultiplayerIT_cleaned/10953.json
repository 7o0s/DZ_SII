{"name": "SingStar - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/singstar-recensione.html", "text": "Sony's musical series, SingStar, does not seem to experience any declines in production or sales. It is not for nothing that only in the last month have five products with this brand been released on the Italian market between PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, confirming what has just been said. However, since titles are conceptually and technically the same as each other, in this special review we will try to analyze the products released specifically for PS3, focusing in principle on what each of them offers to potential buyers. We also remind you that the various editions are available in two different packages: with two microphones included at the price of 69.99, or without at 39.99. SingStar SingStar has been one of Sony's most interesting projects since the beginning, especially for the PlayStation 3, even if it was originally born on the younger sister, the PS2. Developed by the internal London Studios team, the ~game~ is not only a perfect party game, one of those titles, that is, primarily intended to entertain video gamers of any age, perhaps during a party with friends, but also something more , thanks above all to the internet services offered by the new console of the Japanese company. In this real reworking of the traditional karaoke, users can do practically everything, performing singles based on songs and videos of the most important international music stars, entertaining duets with friends and relatives, singing challenges and counter- singing, in group challenge mode (up to eight players) with a series of tests of various kinds which aim to obtain certain scores for teams of video gamers based on their vocal performance, etc. The CPU evaluates the performance based on the players' ability to keep the right note and tempo. Through the web, on the other hand, you can customize the repertoire of songs available by downloading your favorite songs from the huge online catalog of the SingStore, skins for the menus and upload the videos of your performances recorded with the Eye Toy camera on the servers made available by sony. More choices, more music, the latest in music videos and the chance to become an online star by showcasing your performances to the world. This is, in short, the ~motto~ of the product. Here is the list of thirty songs available on the Blu Ray of the game. Track List Blink 182 - All The Small Things Blur-Coffee & TV Britney Spears - Toxic Coldplay - Fix You Gorillaz - Feel Good Inc. Gwen Stefani - Cool Junior Senior - Move Your Feet Macy Gray - I Try Musical Youth - Pass The Dutchie Ne-Yo - So Sick Orson - No Tomorrow OutKast - Hey Ya Primal Scream - Movin' On Up Pussycat Dolls - Beep Radiohead - No Surprises Razorlight - America REM - Losing My Religion Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman - Something Stupid Scissor Sisters - I Don't Feel Like Dancing Supergrass - Alright The Automatic - Monster The Cardigans - Lovefool The Fratellis - Chelsea Dagger The Killers - Mr Brightside The Stone Roses - She Bangs The Drums The Zutons - Valerie Twisted Sister - We're Not Gonna Take It U2 - Beautiful Day Weezer - Buddy Holly Wolfmother - Love Train The SingStore As mentioned earlier, the strength of the title therefore also lies in the various online options available. Like the SingStore. Extremely simple to use, it is none other than a virtual store which can be accessed directly from the game while it is running and used by the user, in real time, to download paid music tracks (more than 530 songs, many of which exclusives, with the addition of the entire SingStar catalog for PS2 and contents updated every month), videos and skins to customize the menus. SingStar has an option to ~download in the background~, which means that you can for example queue up the audio files you want to buy and continue playing while they download: as soon as this process has finished they are then displayed among those available in the game. The songs are cataloged by genre: Pop, Rock, R'n'B, Indie/Alternative, Rap, Soundtracks, Duets, etc. The cost of the songs varies depending on whether they are purchased individually (1.49 each) or in packages (for example those containing ten Queen songs, two separate blocks, around 6.99 each). The purchase procedure is similar to that used for the PlayStation Store and each song purchased includes a standard resolution video that takes up 50 to 70 MB of hard disk space. My SingStar Online The other very interesting element of SingStar is the My SingStar . Things? A community that allows players to share their game performance with friends, or herefunniest and most memorable, create your own personal Playlist and participate in initiatives and surveys of various kinds. In fact, this service, together with the previous one, represent a sort of point of contact between iTunes and MySpace. My SingStar therefore works like a normal community, where with a USB camcorder you can take photos or videos of your singing performances which, like the audio ones, can then be uploaded to your personal space (you need to create a profile). Here other users can then observe or listen to them and give their opinion on the ~test~ or in turn create a link between their online space, that of the gamer and other friends, perhaps in order to create a sort of ~tribe~. Of course, to make the most of this service you need a broadband connection and that the cost of the Internet connection is charged to the user. SingStar Vol. 2 The second title in Sony's musical series is also the one that introduced several significant innovations in its time, starting with a restyling of the user interface. In SingStar Vol. 2 it is possible to interact remotely with the PSP portable console (via wireless), but also to create a personal track list, download new songs while playing and also try their hand at singing performances online. But above all you can play with the unprecedented two-voice mode, Harmony, a new way of performing that allows two players to sing different parts of a song at the same time, thus demonstrating their organizational and timing skills, as well as singing . In fact, there are pieces specifically designed to allow real duets in which to perform two different vocal melodic lines, to intertwine them in the best possible way. And still some medleys to sing directly on some mixes of the songs present. Track List Aerosmith - Dude Looks Like a Lady Blur - Country House Bobby Brown - My Perogative Eminem - Without Me George Michael - Freedom '90 Gorillaz - Give Gossip - Standing in the way of control Hot Chocolate - You Sexy Thing Kaiser Chiefs - Ruby Kool and the Gang - Celebration The Lovin' Spoonful - Summer in the City Maximo Park - Our Velocity Morrisey-Suedehead Nirvanna-Lithium Panic! At The Disco - But It's Better If You Do Paul McCartney & the Frog Chorus - We All Stand Together Pulp - common people Radiohead - Street Spirit (Fade Out) Shakespears Sister - Stay Spandau Ballet - TRUE The Cure - Pictures of You The Killers - When You Were Youngl The Libertines - Can't Stand Me Now The Killers - Mr Brightside The Offspring - Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) The Police - Don't Stand So Close To Me The Proclaimers - I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) Tom Jones with Mousse T - Sexbomb Tone Loc - Funky Cold Medina Young MC - Bust A Move SingStar Vol. 3 The third episode of the series on PlayStation 3 is also the first for this format consisting entirely of songs sung by Italian artists. SingStar Vol. 3 indeed contains a series of national-popular songs of various genres, both old and new. From the legendary Vasco Rossi to Jovanotti, from Franco Battiato to Ligabue, passing through Carmen Consoli or Biagio Antonacci there is something for all tastes. Plus a new graphic setting that is even simpler and more intuitive. The game system always remains the same, and consists in performing as hard as I can avoiding false notes, challenging friends and showing the rest of the world via the web one's singing performance. But the presence, as mentioned, of tracks sung by local artists makes the title perhaps also attractive to a wider range of users than the previous products, because it invites those players who are not attracted to foreign songs, perhaps due to language problems, to try it. Let's see what is the list of pieces available in the Blu Ray. Track List Anna Tatangelo - My friend Biagio Antonacci - Irises Carmen Consoli - Plastic love Edoardo Bennato - Neverland Fabio Concato - Let's hope it rains Fabrizio Moro - Yet you changed my life Finley - You remember Finley - Anything is possible Franco Battiato - White flag Gianluca Grignani - Walk in the sun Gigi D'alessio - How many loves Irene Grandi - Happy birthday Jovanotti - I will marry you Jovanotti - Mud The aura - Enough! Laura Pausini - Stay tuned Ligabue - Happy hour Ligabue - I'm lost for words Marina Rei - Spring Max Pezzali - I'll be right back Max Pezzali - There you are Negrita - We will never look back Niccol Fabi - Millions of days Omar Pedrini - Shock Pino Daniele - I have no doubts Simone Cristicchi - I'll give you a rose Tiziano Ferro - And Raffaella is mine Tiziano Ferro - Relative red Vasco Rossi - Some say no Velvet - Boy band Singstar ABBA It is the latest addition to the series for PlayStation 3 (the game is also available for PS2). Dedited to the very popular Swedish group that literally depopulated in the 70s (and partly in the early 80s) and to its songs, recently back on the crest of the wave thanks to the success of the film Mamma Mia! in which many of their songs serve as a soundtrack, in SingStar ABBA you can do everything that we have already described about the other chapters of the series, let's call them that. In fact, the Blu Ray does not present significant innovations compared to the latest releases. So here are the songs available on the game disc in detail. Track List Chiquitita Ring Ring Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) SOS Take A Chance On Me Summer Night City Dancing Queen Super Trouper Does Your Mother Know Thank You For The Music Fernando The Day Before You Came Happy New Year Head Over Heals Super Trouper Does Your Mother Know Thank You For The Music Fernando The Day Before You Came The winner takes it all I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do Under attack Knowing Me Knowing You Voulez Vous Oh mama Waterloo Money Money Money When All Is Said And Done One Of Us And since we are the Christmas theme, we conclude this article by pointing out the package of five songs dedicated to Christmas released in recent weeks. Song Pack Festive Fun Celine Dion - Christmas Eve Toni Braxton - Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas Babyface - Sleigh Ride Paul McCartney - Wonderful Christmastime Shakin' Stevens - Merry Christmas Everyone Conclusions Sometimes you don't need scary graphics or who knows what other ~devil~ to create a pleasant and addictive video game in its own way. An idea is enough, even a simple one, but adequately supported by whoever proposes it and transforms it into something concrete. This is the case of SingStar, which by reworking the idea of karaoke by adapting it to new technologies, including the internet, has managed to conquer millions of gamers all over the world and really seems to experience no decline in popularity. Considering the interchangeability of the track lists, the possibility of also using those of the previous PlayStation 2 releases and of always downloading new contents, SingStar, which we evaluate as a single entity, remains an absolutely valid product with practically infinite longevity. Absolutely recommended! Pros: Great fun both alone and in company. ~Ad hoc~ songs for all tastes. Infinite longevity. Against: Few Italian songs in the huge database.", "date": "2008-12-22", "grade": null}
