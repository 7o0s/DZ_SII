Pure strategy Gary Grigsby's World at War is a turn-based strategy set throughout the Second World War, in which we will have to take control of one of the five superpowers that took part in the conflict (Rome-Berlin axis, Japan, the Soviet Union, China and the Allies). facing one of the four campaigns present (replayable in a different way with each of the factions). The phases of which the game action is composed are three: the phase of movement of the troops and of attack, the phase of management of resources and production and, finally, the phase of observation of the moves of the enemy. Screenshot taken from one of the cutscenes, created by assembling archive images The units available to the player are nineteen divided between ground troops (infantry, tanks, artillery), air troops and naval troops. Each troop must be managed according to its own functionality and must be used taking into account its characteristics (illustrated by numerical values). For example, planes will be great for supporting other troops and bombing allied resources (factories, railroads, and more), while tanks will be great for taking control of enemy or neutral territories. The fights take place automatically and cannot be managed directly by the player; once a certain number of troops have been sent to enemy territory, you will be able to choose the type of attack to carry out and you will have to watch the result. Determining the fate of the battle will therefore be a purely strategic question: the player must think about which troops it is best to group to counter the defending army, without however revealing themselves too much (penalty of enemy retaliation during their turn, or partisan uprisings). Once you are satisfied with your choices, you will be able to launch the attack, observing the result on a schematized virtual battlefield (contained in a single two-dimensional and far too static screen) or completely skipping the representation of the clash, going to read post-battle reports. Everything is very simple to manage, but complex to master, given the numerous variables (troop values, terrain type, victory percentage plus many others) that can intervene and that must absolutely be considered. Each troop must be managed according to its own functionality and must be used taking into account its characteristics Pure strategy Take for example the management of conquered territories. These can be used to obtain resources and do research, but they will not be able to generate troops and you will need to control them well with your soldiers, so as not to get immediately kicked out by some insurgency. The production phase is on its own. Where in other titles of the same genre it is present as an addition of ~seasoning~ to the other phases, here it is instead a well-kept and profound section, as well as being decisive for the success of a campaign. Moving resources from one territory to another, deciding which troops to create, assigning the different production points trying not to run out, plus various other factors (explained in the manual and useless to describe for the purpose of the review), guarantee a depth and balance of rare value. It is not recommended to entrust economic management to the computer which, although not bad, could create major imbalances in your army, resulting in a more difficult continuation of the campaign. Change the story This whole complex construction, full of elements of diversification, would be nothing if it were not accompanied by adequate artificial intelligence. It is from this point of view that Gary Grigsby's World at War gives its best. By selecting the highest difficulty levels (there are five in all) you will be able to observe the computer performing maneuvers worthy of a human being, so as to put even the most savvy players in difficulty. One of the production screens. Don't be scared, managing it is easy. more easier than it seems Each campaign thus becomes a chess challenge in which one's moves must be performed with great skill and with careful observation of the entire area in which one is fighting. The possibilities offered in this sense are truly many and the obligatory choices practically nil. Starting from accurately reconstructed historical situations (at the beginning of the campaigns), we will be able to expand in any direction by choosing to radically change history (for example, do we want to be able to conquer Australia? Why not... as long as it is an action that is useful to our strategy and not it just wastes resources.) Defects PMore than a few flaws, however, there are. In the first place, the mediocre technical realization which, although not essential for games of this genre, could have been better cared for, especially in the combat phases which are bare and uninteresting. Certainly better animations and more details would not have hurt, so as not to be faced with such a spartan and uninteresting screen. On the other hand it is true that the general style of the menus and screens is not bad and helps to get into the spirit of the game, even if the fixed resolution (1024x768) should be noted which could cause some problems. By selecting the highest difficulty levels (there are five in all) you will be able to watch the computer perform maneuvers worthy of a human being Defects Another flaw, considering the point of view of the average user, could be the initial learning curve not helped by the aforementioned bug in the tutorial. It is true that, given the reference target, one cannot complain too much. The lover of classic strategic games is used to juggling dozens of summary screens and managing dozens of troops individually. After all, a large part of the charm and pleasure given by these titles comes precisely from the slow and careful planning of each move, studied by consulting accurate summary screens. Also from the sound point of view, much more could have been done with some more inspired music and with less bland and repetitive effects. Hardware boxes The requirements necessary to run World at War are quite limited: an 800 MHz CPU, 512 MB of ram and a 32 MB 3D graphics card. The recommended ones, however, require you to bring the CPU to 2.0GHz, the ram to 1GB and have a video card with 128MB of ram. The system on which it was tested is a 3.4 GHz P4 equipped with a Geforce 7800 GT and 2 GB of ram, on which obviously no problems of any kind were encountered. Final comment Gary Grigsby's World at War is a title that will thrill lovers of pure strategy but will leave everyone else cold. A mediocre technical realization is counterbalanced by hours and hours of play, an AI of the highest level, a very accurate basic complexity (both strategic and managerial) and the possibility of playing via email with a friend, in addition to the decidedly excellent price ( which earns him a few more points on the overall). Also recommended for those who have never tried the genre and want to do it with a title of excellent caliber that does not cost much. Pros AI of the highest level Excellent management section High complexity but satisfying Cons Technically mediocre Some annoying bugs Fixed screen resolution What you can't see The title Gary Grigsby's World at War may not tell you anything, but it is, without going around too much, one of the best turn-based strategy / management games released in recent years. Starting it, you have the strong feeling of being faced with one of those old titles made of substance and few frills, a feeling strengthened by entering the game and observing the numerous summary screens and the general map. But let us not be deceived by the senses accustomed to festivals of lights and sounds, which often hide the most total emptiness. Here it is not what you see that amazes you, but what you don't see. The beginning is not the simplest given the general complexity that can be seen from the options screen. Then when you find yourself in front of the world map, with the numerous choices represented in the upper part of the screen by various buttons, the sense of loss grows even more. In reality, before dedicating yourself to the actual campaigns, it would be advisable to either read the substantial manual included in the package, or take part in the tutorial campaigns. As far as the tutorials are concerned, unfortunately there is an annotation to make: starting the one concerning production management, you will find it truncated; that is, at a certain point no more explanation windows will appear and you will not know how to continue, thus having to return to the main menu. Not bad since there is the manual and it is also quite full-bodied, but the annoyance still exists, especially for those who do not like to read the manuals to have to play. Hoping for a patch that fixes the problem, it's time to dive into the game.", "date": "2006-01-05", "grade": null}
