Not without merit, given the qualities of the first chapter which in 2013 was able to attract a host of admirers linked to what could be defined as the only zombie apocalypse simulator. As we saw in the review of the Xbox One version of State of Decay 2, the qualities of the predecessor have been taken up and expanded to give life to a title with more varied and dynamic dynamics, however stumbling over a too crude technical sector. Precisely for this reason, it undoubtedly makes sense to go and take a look at the PC version of State of Decay 2, released yesterday together with the Xbox One version. Together for survival Before going into the characteristics of State of Decay 2, it is worth remembering that it is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, therefore playable with a single purchase on both PC and Xbox One. The saves are imported from one platform to the other, thus allowing the player which of the two to prefer according to his needs. From the point of view of content, State of Decay 2 is identical in both of its incarnations. As we said, it is a sequel in the strictest sense of the term, which in fact immediately puts anyone who approaches it at ease after having had the opportunity to play the first State of Decay. More than on zombies, the focus is on the group of survivors that we find ourselves controlling, without there being a real protagonist among them. With the complicity of permadeath, which puts a character out of action once they have lost their life, State of Decay 2 tells us a different story in every game we play, keeping as a common trait the need to survive in a state of ruin , as suggested by the name of the game itself. The state of apprehension linked to having to keep one's group alive is almost constant, and is fueled by the risk of causing everything to precipitate at the slightest mistake. For this reason, you have to plan your steps well, making use of the multiplayer cooperative mode if necessary, among the innovations introduced by State of Decay 2: each player can ask for help via the Internet, thus allowing any volunteers to enter their game with whom to complete missions or other particularly difficult tasks. Even if participating in other people's games does not allow you to go ahead with your own, by helping other people it is possible to obtain rewards in terms of influence, a real ~currency~ of the game with which to occupy outposts and acquire important elements. In case you want to learn more about the components of State of Decay 2, we refer you again to the review of the Xbox One version, or to the test published after a few hours of play. Better but not perfect Having made the due introduction, let's go and see what changes for State of Decay 2 in the transition from Xbox One to PC. Let's start with the graphics settings, which are presented in the game menu under an additional section: inside it is possible to choose the general settings among the three levels called Medium, High and Ultra, with the option to change the values concerning individual parameters such as quality anti-aliasing, draw distances, the level of detail of the world and characters and the quality of some effects such as shadows and ambient occlusion. Already leaving the values on those suggested at the High level, it was possible to appreciate a significant general improvement compared to what was seen on the basic version of Xbox One: overall cleaner image, greater visual distance and number of frames per second anchored at sixty, with short descents of a few units only in the driving phases. Moving everything to Ultra level we noticed a further enrichment of the detail of characters and objects, accompanied however by a slightly more dancer number of frames per second, still able to touch the figure sixty as a tip but also to go down to thirty in phases particularly agitated or, also in this case, driving. In this regard, it is worth noting that the test configuration is in line with the recommended requirements, as shown in the table below. Returning to the graphic quality, with both configurations the pop-in effects that we had instead encountered with the Xbox One version also seemed limited. On the other hand, the situation linked to some bugs did not seem to change much, such as the one that sometimes forces us to reopen a door that seems already open. As for the systembut of control you can of course play with mouse and keyboard, but the use of a controller is also recommended on PC.", "date": "2018-05-23", "grade": "8.5"}
