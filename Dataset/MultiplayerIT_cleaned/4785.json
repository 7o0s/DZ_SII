Compared to the preliminary version, a simple narrative introduction has also been added relating to the mission we are about to embark on: one of the most impressive stellar corporations has set its sights on a huge wreck and called its best predators to reach it, grabbing all the resources possible. A real treasure hunt, made however complex by the presence of a myriad of security systems, as well as by an obligatory path that will take us to visit five different abandoned stations before being able to face the legendary Cryptark. Put on your overalls when you go out The Cryptark formula has therefore remained unchanged, with gameplay characterized by an absolutely non-trivial level of challenge, although there is the feeling that the authors have ~softened~ the experience a bit in certain situations. The basis is that of a tough and ruthless twin stick shooter, in which we control an exoskeleton equipped with customizable weapons, energy shields and extra devices to be equipped during the briefing that precedes each expedition. During the campaign, which can also be tackled in co-op with a friend, but only locally, we will have to select one of the seven Pioneer Suits available (to unlock them it will be necessary to collect a certain number of artifacts), each equipped with specific abilities, and face a sequence composed of a total of six ~stops~, the last of which is represented precisely by the Cryptark, a space wreck of disproportionate dimensions. Each of the missions can be modulated in terms of difficulty, in the sense that we are given the possibility to choose between four different abandoned ships, each with a different degree of challenge and compensation. The ~permanent death~ factor in the game is rendered in a relatively permissive way: if we are killed but we still have credits, we will be able to start from the last step of the campaign, otherwise it will be game over and we will have to start all over again. The key to success is therefore to save money on equipment during the initial missions and start investing only when really necessary, so as to guarantee at least a second chance in case of defeat. Space, last blasphemy As mentioned, Cryptark remains a very difficult game, an experience that conceptually recalls that of Galak-Z: The Dimensional, given the presence of scenarios generated by a procedural system that make each game different, while enjoying a much more control system permissive, with no inertial forces to counterbalance. The fact remains that the extraordinary quantity and variety of enemies present within each space wreck will give us a lot of trouble, sometimes encircling us and opening fire mercilessly, strong not only in number but also equipped with d different attack, haste, and energy shields. The work done by Alientrap on the front of hostile units undoubtedly stands as the flagship of this title, instilling in the player a real sense of tension because it is not possible to know who we will be facing and when, if not by checking the detections on the map. Small detail: when we arrive at the Cryptark, the radar will be disturbed by a jammer and we will therefore have to grope, revealing the huge wreck and its pitfalls piece by piece: a really complicated undertaking. Our objective will in all cases be to destroy the core of the ship we are in, but to do so we will first have to deactivate the shield system, the alarm system and any mechanism that allows the various elements to automatically reset, each manned by a hefty amount of enemies, turrets, and assorted threats. If along the way we want to collect bonuses and clean up the map, much better in terms of credits, but the risks will be high. +11 Playstation 4 trophies Practically all twenty-eight Cryptark Trophies must be conquered with a certain amount of cunning and perseverance, since they imply a great deal of effort on the exploration front and it is not easy to obtain them by chance. You will therefore have to roll up your sleeves and go in search of the artifacts present in the various space wrecks, hoping to reach them before some hostile unit takes you out. Even richer Compared to the Early Ac versioncess that we tried a while ago, the complete edition of Cryptark has been enriched by two extra modes. The first, called ~Rogue~, is accessible immediately and consists of a progression made up of six missions, exactly like the campaign, but without the money or the possibility of choosing the equipment or the ship we prefer to visit. This means that any upgrades for the Pioneer Suit will have to be collected along the way, starting from a disadvantaged situation, and that at game over we will not have a second chance: we will have to start all over again. Complete both the campaign and the Rogue mode we will finally be able to access the endgame, represented by the Excavation mode. At this juncture we will have to deal with an even tougher challenge: a single, terrible mission in which we will have to fight not only against the defense systems of a huge wreck, but also with other space predators like us, in an attempt to recover a precious alien artifact. The merits for the Alientrap title have therefore increased, net of the same defects: the procedural nature implies a certain degree of repetitiveness of the scenarios, with a view to missions equipped with very similar structures, and very little has been done to emphasize the narrative aspect of the experience, albeit marginal to the gameplay. From a technical point of view, there are some solutions that are a little too simplistic in the design of the Pioneer Suits, but as already mentioned, an excellent job has been done on the enemy front and the musical accompaniment manages to involve you right from the start.", "date": "2017-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
