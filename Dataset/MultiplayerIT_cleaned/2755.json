{"name": "Empire of Sin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/empire-of-sin-recensione.html", "text": "That Empire of Sin aimed to be a multifaceted and profound experience, also devoted to a good replayability, can be understood even before actually setting foot in its forbidden Chicago - the promised land of gangsters, the one where the law is a fickle whim to bend as you like and if you like something, you simply take it. It's the 1920s and the city is a powder keg ready to blow up, whose streets but not only are the scene of deadly clashes between criminal clans who exploit prohibition to prevail over each other. From Al Capone to John Dilinger to the Genna Brothers, Chicago has been the scene of some of the most memorable feuds in history and development studio Romero Games takes us back in time to write our own history, written in blood, alcohol and bullets. Before actually setting foot in Chicago, therefore, we are called to choose the boss who we will take to the top of the food chain: the range is so varied, in terms of quantity and facets of the protagonists, that this ambitious management game gave the idea of a hidden potential that would emerge by the hour. Imagine finding yourself cornered, with the police breathing down your neck, the difficult decision to betray a friend (honour is everything, in these cases) and your rivals planning in the shadows. Empire of Sin often confronts similar situations, which turn into many small noir thrillers. Narratively, therefore, it is a game with great potential, which however is undermined not by the actual dangers of a Chicago bent over by the underworld but by technical problems of a different nature, ranging from corrupted rescues (supposed to be the policemen?) to missions that get stuck and characters who disappear for no apparent reason. Even the day one patch didn't solve some flaws, considering the fact that they are not the only obstacle: game design also makes missteps and in these cases there is no patch that holds - for now. Let's see through the Empire of Sin review why the game starts off with a great first impression and then dilutes like one of those cheap distillates that Bugs Moran tried to distribute around our neighborhoods. Gangster life Narratively speaking, therefore, Empire of Sin offers an interesting insight into history which shows how much care has been instilled in showing a context so distant from us in time, space and culture. The most fascinating aspect of all this is undoubtedly the fact that all the major gangsters, whether our protagonist or rivals, really existed; in this Romero's game stands as a valid window on that world. Everyone knows Al Capone but what about, for example, Stephanie St. Clair? A French gambler who ran several criminal businesses in Harlem, able to maintain her independence without being gobbled up by the Mafia. It was our choice for a first, painful match that prompted us to want to know more about her. One of the merits of Empire of Sin, in fact, is to help generate curiosity towards characters who have really marked an important historical period, in its chiaroscuro, and to reproduce them in a very faithful way - even if sometimes having to bend them for narrative needs. A little strategic management and a bit RPG, the game allows us to choose the ~life~ path of our boss and the way in which he handles the various situations that present him/her in front of him, in a moral spectrum tending a little too clearly towards the white or black. However, there are occasions in which the roleplay takes over more and proves to be a little more flexible. For example, you can choose the lesser of two evils, aware of the price to pay but taking the risk of passing an intimidation or persuasion check to obtain rewards that equal, or even exceed, your losses. Nothing that surprises RPG veterans, however for a game that is all about building a criminal empire and shooting guns, the fact that the characters spend a lot of time in the spotlight stands out starkly. As if all of this wasn't already engaging enough in itself, there are two other important aspects to consider: underlings and so-called sit downs. A criminal business is not managed in itself, it takes people to make it prosper. In turn, these subordinates are not mere puppets fixed on the assigned task: they are ~humans~, digital lives if we prefer, who as such experience dramas and conflicts. They have their own friendships, rivalries, vices, and side quests that create both opportunities and obstacles in our rise to power. A character, whether it's the boss or an ordinary follower, starts with some background-inspired traits, whichmore will be added as their life journey deepens - often dictating the law not only on their behavior but also on how to fight or even how fit they are to fill positions of power. Even the slightest change in stats is felt and leads to unexpected twists that make each match unique.As for the sit downs, they are where the cast of Empire of Sin shines the brightest: in short, they are the diplomatic phases of the roleplay, where you and another boss sit across from each other to make your positions clear, through a series of fun and engaging exchanges, where you leverage your opponent's strengths and weaknesses to be able to snatch a potential deal, or even corner him and eliminate him. Not all the performances are convincing, also considering that the expressiveness of the faces is lacking and the gestures are often highly emphasized or out of context, but overall they are exciting comparisons. However, an illusion destined to break against one of the many problems that afflict the game: in this specific case, our interlocutors present us with agreements whose terms are in open contradiction or, worse, turn out to be simple buffs for us without really paying anything in exchange. The decision to present these negotiations with a more theatrical and less schematic approach is not bad for the most part but clashes with the bizarre randomness of some conversations, which shatter the happy bubble in which we have let ourselves be enveloped. The gameplay Moving on to the management aspect of Empire of Sin, the game begins to show its side. In general terms it is no different from many others that we have happened to try, the difference in this case lies in a very subdued experience compared to the narrative counterpart. Although an effort is made to offer different solutions for the various businesses to grow, everything boils down to their continuous updating, therefore to a vicious circle in which money is never enough. Which makes sense when you think you have to build an empire from scratch and hold your own against rival bosses, but in the end it proves stifling and repetitive. Furthermore, the sudden changes of preferences within a neighborhood prove to be more of a nuisance than proof of how the charm of the life of crime hides many complications. One day you discover that you have to offer customers alcohol of a certain quality, perhaps higher than the current one, and the next day you take a step back, only to change again on the third day: a mad carousel that pushes, as we said, to a constantly spending money to keep up with the whims of the residents (or some celebrities) but failing to really feel the sense of growth and power. Not too long ago, each property has become just the name in a long list where to click and enhance certain aspects, making it identical to the many others in our possession. In short, the sense of identity that should be perceived in the rise to power is missing. What makes our empire unique from others? The promised depth, and which could be obtained if the game were worth the candle (that is, if there weren't a scarcely intuitive and coherent interface), disappears the moment you understand that you are being pushed to play aggressively: an approach which anesthetizes the concept of management, by its nature weighted and not risk-free. Here you just need to put more and more money on the plate to resolve each issue. Empire of Sin has different aspects, yet the impression is that each of these jostles to impose itself on the others without creating the synergy instead necessary for everything to work as it should. A similar discourse extends to combat, which thrives on many excellent premises and then resolves into nothing: each character has his own skill tree, traits that evolve or manifest themselves based on his life path, slots for weapons or equipment (which can be bought on the black market, looted or obtained as a reward at the end of the missions), in short, everything necessary to create a small army and, again deluding oneself, can lead to tantalizing and elaborate battles. It doesn't happen. The clashes are poorly balanced in our favor, they do not offer the right level of challenge also due to a questionable artificial intelligence, they can be concluded in the blink of an eye thanks to skills whose power is off the scale and thus lead to the achievement of unique equipment that undermine any claim to challenge. The only interesting note is that, since it can sometimes take hold along the streets, a walking policeman or simply another criminal belonging toanother clan can get in the way. Otherwise, the tactic is thrown out the window and might as well have an auto-resolve command. It doesn't help then that we have given fair praise to the narrative and evolutionary sector of the characters, to the vis--vis comparisons with the other bosses, to the dramas that the subordinates can bring, but in the end if you want to ignore all this and raid a boss's headquarters to kill him and take control of his market share, well, you can do that. If the fights had been up to par, we could also have justified this by virtue of the fact that there could be some serious commitment, so however the only advantage that is convenient is to reach the end of a campaign without running into too many bugs that plague a slightly more reasoned experience.", "date": "2020-12-04", "grade": "5.5"}
