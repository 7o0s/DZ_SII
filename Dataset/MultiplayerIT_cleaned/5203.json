It's a little crazy. Yes, because thinking of spending hours and hours with the pad in your hands managing a farm may seem like an absolutely senseless experience, only to then retrace your steps once you have made the first few meters aboard a tractor to plow and fertilize the fields of our new farm. After the endless wave of meaningless simulators that have invaded our gaming libraries in recent years and after the super success of Goat Simulator, Farming Simulator has proven to be one of the most solid experiences on the market, capable of improving year by year with new content and activities related to farming. Reinvigorated by the break of the last season we are ready to go back to farming with Farming Simulator 17, which without making any revolutions takes the series to the highest levels. Farming Simulator 17 represents the pinnacle of the series developed by Giants Software Gaming farmers The new edition of Farming Simulator does not represent such a Copernican revolution, but it has been improved in so many respects compared to the 2015 edition that we can still say that we are faced with a radically different yet familiar title. Finding yourself in front of an uncultivated field with our plow to prepare it for the first sowing is now a familiar thing, but it only takes a few minutes to start appreciating the new features of Farming Simulator 17. There are so many activities to be carried out, all characterized by vehicles, trailers and specific tools that require a little practice before being handled safely. In all there are more than 250, all reproduced with extreme accuracy from the catalog of models produced by more than seventy companies in the sector. The variety is therefore very high: there are tractors of different sizes and colors, from the smallest and easy to handle up to real beasts with tracks or double wheels for larger fields, but there is no shortage of vehicles suitable for transporting our products or raw materials such as vans, vans, trucks and even wood and livestock trains. For those who hang out in the virtual wheat fields of Farming Simulator it might seem that all this goodness is completely wasted or exclusive to the most avid gamers, given the money needed to obtain the most advanced and performing models. Giants Software promptly circumvents the problem by introducing the possibility of renting each vehicle and equipment in exchange for a small sum which obviously increases as the period of use increases. Simply tap the touch pad on your PlayStation 4 controller to enter the shop and start browsing the catalogue. Renting has a dual utility: on the one hand it means being able to experience immediately all that Farming Simulator 17 has to offer despite us being novice farmers, but secondly it means being able to test vehicles and equipment in depth minimizing the risk of spending the hard earned money. This aspect makes the gaming experience decidedly more dynamic and usable especially for those approaching the series for the first time, who despite an always rather slow progression curve, will be able to enjoy greater variety in learning the operations necessary for cultivation . Playstation 4 trophies Farming Simulator 17 offers 18 trophies including 2 bronze, 6 silver and 9 gold to which is added the precious platinum. To collect them all, you have to get busy by accumulating at least 10 hours of work on a single rescue and achieving some specific results in terms of the extent of the crops and the number of livestock on our farm. Big landowners The career structure of Farming Simulator 17 remains unchanged from the previous one, but in addition to the rental it enjoys another very important novelty, probably the most disruptive of those mentioned so far: the possibility of working for third parties. In the same way that we can start the business and then buy a tractor and tools to entrust to a farmer controlled by artificial intelligence, so can another landowner with us. Wandering around the map, we can see the various requests from other fields and accept new tasks from time to time that we complete within a certain limit in exchange for a sum of money. As for the rental, this addition also gives an important jolt to the gaming experience by allowing us to experiment with different tasks from the beginning: whether it isto sow or to reap the wheat, all of which will provide us with the right knowledge to better manage our company. In this sense, the ultimate goal is always to grow as much as possible, adding sheep and pigs to sheep and pigs alongside cultivation - expanded with the addition of sunflower plants and soybeans. An always in-depth and engaging experience, which however still suffers from a not very lively and eventful game world in which we would like to have more interactions with other non-player characters. The tutorial comes to the rescue of new players in a very complete and accessible way, with many small tasks that teach you how to operate vehicles and use tools according to the situations. It inevitably takes time to get familiar with the game system, but despite the slow and staid rhythms, Farming Simulator 17 gives its satisfaction. The game interface remains extremely dry and fragmented, with the back buttons to access the various functions of the vehicles and the analog sticks to carefully maneuver the vehicles. Even the graphics sector has been the subject of the work of the developers, resulting cleaner and more refined than the previous edition. Nothing to cry out for a miracle, but the road is the right one. The decision to add the mods on the console is interesting, opening up interesting scenarios that could give an unexpected longevity to a title that has never shown as this year that it can be renewed without distorting a game structure now tested and loved by a clog hard of enthusiasts increasingly consistent.", "date": "2016-10-28", "grade": "8.3"}
