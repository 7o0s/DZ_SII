The only hope for humanity therefore lies in the vast unknown space, in the search for a possible future on a planet that can host a terraforming and repopulation process capable of restarting human life and civilization elsewhere. Thus we find ourselves having to guide a single spaceship along what could be the last possible space journey, because on the other hand this is how video games work: always alone against the impending threat, as humanity's only hope against a decidedly adverse. The clich in this case takes on rather different connotations, however, because it is not the classic warship launched against armies of well-armed enemies, but simply an exploration shuttle engaged in a desperate search for a new home, with the need to look constantly from the threats hidden in the space itself between asteroids, comets, black holes, stars too close and any unfriendly alien contacts. The beauty of Last Horizon is precisely its playing with classic elements of video games by recombining them in an alternative way and thus finding a new balance between known suggestions. There's the inertial control system reminiscent of old Asteroids, the need to keep tabs on fuel like in Scramble, and the survival and roguelike elements we've seen in more recent games like FTL. However, all combined together takes on a very special identity in Last Horizon, undoubtedly also thanks to the excellent audiovisual characterization imparted by Pixeljam which amalgamates the experience and makes it more than a simple addition of disparate elements. Last Horizon offers a space adventure in search of a new home Looking for home The control system is limited to the use of three keys to command the ship, relying for the rest on the inertia and the force of gravity exerted by the various celestial bodies: one key activates the spaceship's reactors and the other two are used to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. The aim of the game is to find a new habitable planet and start the terraforming process in order to create a new Earth, but the path is long and necessarily involves in-depth space exploration, with frequent landings on the various planets encountered along the way. the path to replenish fuel, oxygen, resources for ship repair and elements for terraforming, in case the rare planets suitable for life are encountered. It seems like a simple task but space immediately reveals itself to be a decidedly hostile place: if natural dangers such as meteor showers, black holes and stars that are too close weren't already enough, there are also various assorted threats such as the hostility of alien races, which can react badly to any excess of resource collection on their own planets and above all the need to constantly calibrate the thrust of the thrusters and the attitude of the ship in an optimal way in order to avoid crashing on the surface of the planets in the process of approach, a very present danger given the mix of gravity, indirect control of the ship and roughness of the terrain. Continuing into the depths of space, increasing dangers make survival more and more difficult, even considering that the game provides only one life, forcing you to start from scratch each time. Note also the narrative hint represented by the astronaut's considerations that periodically appear on the screen in an elegant and non-invasive way, which in addition to providing a vague trace on the history of the game help to make sense of our wandering through space. The progression is marked by the presence of some extra modes that allow you to tackle the journey starting from different bases and parameters, essentially with a sort of increased difficulty.", "date": "2015-11-26", "grade": "8.0"}
