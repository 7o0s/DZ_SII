The sound sector is average, with every noise in the right place (even if the weapons don't stand out that much...) and a decent English dubbing (all menus and subtitles in Italian). You can set Creative's EAX libraries to improve the rendering a bit. The background music is good even if in certain situations they tend to repeat themselves continuously, soon becoming monotonous. Logan from the X-Men? No! Gabe Logan of the CIA? No! Bolt Logan! Who?? Chrome SpecForce is the sequel to the previous Chrome, released some time ago under the Take2 label. In the role of yet another Logan (incredible how many game protagonists are called that!) you will be called to complete various missions on the planet Estrella, in which a sort of mafia is preparing something diabolical... which will then degenerate into a universal conflict. Broadly speaking this is the plot which, it must be pointed out immediately, is explained without any cutscenes but through meager explanations as the missions go. Basically Chrome is a first-person shooter with some RPG-like elements. There is no growth in experience, but the possibility of using certain special abilities thanks to an armor that we will always wear. In addition, the character has an inventory backpack in which a limited number of items (including weapons) can be stored. This last introduction is rather annoying as if you want to collect something from a corpse the selection screen appears; this results in an exposure to attacks from enemies that breaks the action. The enhancements, on the other hand, can be activated immediately and are divided into four types: neural stimulation is nothing more than a slowed-down view designed to better aim (no graphic effects, only slower movements); the speed is self-explanatory (even if it's like running in a normal game!); shields to protect yourself and finally invisibility (totally useless against enemy soldiers). Unfortunately, activating one or more of them involves the consumption of the batteries, which have a short duration and above all do not recharge; you'll have to look around for them and use them every time they wear out (no auto-recharge). This makes the nose turn up a bit given that in certain situations you have to wander around the huge maps on foot and being able to always run would have been better. Then activating the different functions in battle is really problematic because shooting, recharging the batteries and choosing what to use is not the utmost simplicity. Honestly, it's not that these power-ups shine for practicality... Final comment Chrome SpecForce is a shooter that tastes like it has already been seen and does not involve who knows what innovations (much praised by some) but, it can be a diversion for those who have chewed the various Halo and Pariah for too long (the latter is decidedly superior). However, since the title is sold at a budget price, one can only appreciate the work done by the programmers, who, despite having ups and downs, make the game better than many others offered in this price range. If you like futuristic shooters and with some variations, give us a little thought. If, on the other hand, the price is not a cause for concern for you, it is better to aim for more famous products. Pros Huge maps Budget price Lots of weapons and vehicles Cons Dated graphics Annoying inventory system A hodgepodge of rip-offs from other games Hutson, Apone, Hicks, Ferro, Vasquez, Ripley The multiplayer allows you to play with an average of sixteen players or even more if you want. Unfortunately the game modes are always the classics: deathmatch (all against all or teams) and capture the flag. We expected the possibility of doing races with vehicles or ~infiltration~ type missions, but unfortunately nothing to do. It is possible to play in LAN or Internet and easily create a server with the chosen maps (you will find a dozen). For now, there are three official servers available in which the shadow of a player has not yet been seen; Hopefully the situation will improve over time. Certainly the armor upgrades offer an extra tactical variant but nothing special. Halo? Pariah? Unreal? AvP? As with the latest shooters, here too we find some vehicles clearly inspired by ~Haloana~. The excellent Dune Buggy (from which you can also shoot yourself), a mech and other more or less useful means, ideal for exploring the immense maps that the game offers. The negative note is that often the missions make you wander for long stretches or look for objects by retracing your steps. The result is a feeling of boredom and sometimes frustration, with enemies who then return in quantity and weapons for the most part unsatisfactoryunraveling. As if that weren't enough, many things are copied by the competition: building interiors, vehicles (the APC is the same as that of Aliens!), the weapons themselves, for a meatloaf who doesn't want to know how to differentiate himself from the others, if it weren't for inventories and upgrades Hacking or memory? There is a hacking system in the game that is used to pass certain doors or activate machinery. A sort of memory where you have to guess pairs of symbols within a certain number of moves. Interesting if it worked for all doors It will not infrequently have to look for the keys in the most disparate places LV-426? NO, ESTRELLA! Let's face it right away: Specforce appears dated perhaps graphically inferior to the first Halo. Despite the vastness of the maps and some good polygonal models, many things appear qualitatively poor, giving the idea of a half-finished production. If the game can be admired outdoors, with highly effective landscapes and horizons, the situation changes indoors: we tried to give a little variety, but nothing could be done, everything resembles dozens of other titles (Alien vs. Predator above all) and makes use of poor and repetitive textures. The characters and vehicles are embarrassing: some really well made, rounded and solid (like the Dune Buggy or enemy soldiers); others outrageous and absolutely non-standard (let's mention the big armored vehicles, with the most cubic wheels ever seen in a 2005 title! The sniper rifle has a triangular tip!). The color palette is then based on two main colors, black and brown, which in the long run and especially in certain locations get boring (many areas are darkened, and contrast adjustment is mandatory).", "date": "2005-11-12", "grade": null}
