The question, revised and corrected in a thousand different ways, is the classic one posed by Layton to his aide Luke. The answer varies depending on the situation in which the investigative duo finds themselves investigating: certainly the upright professor Hershel Layton would not appreciate a cut offer, reduced only in Europe by an important extra that the players of the Old Continent, and only they they cannot use. Unfortunately this is what happened with The Call of the Specter, the fourth episode of the highly successful series which, in addition to the usual, spot-on adventure all puzzles and sui generis characters, should have contained London Life. The little gem developed by Brownie Brown that would have added a lot of longevity by mixing the charm of the series with completely new role-playing and simulation mechanics. A pity because it would have been a very welcome extra, a way to extend the life of the cartridge beyond the usual amount of hours guaranteed by a robust experience but which we would not have been sorry to see renewed in some of its mechanics. Where it all began Professor Layton and the Specter's Call is not just any fourth chapter: in fact, it represents the beginning of a second trilogy, temporally set before Il Paese dei Mysteri. A bit like the first three episodes of Star Wars, only without the unsuccessful waste of what has been done previously. A new beginning that places the player alongside a Layton a few years younger but no less skilled, to the point that his old friend Clark Triton asks him to travel to the village of Misthallery. Here he will have to investigate the ancient legend of a giant specter who, guided by a magic flute, would have had the task of defending the city. And which obviously seems to have re-emerged from almost forgotten legends to do the exact opposite of what was told. Within the first hour of the game you are joined by Emmy Altava, Layton's assistant met since the introductory movie, and then by Luke, who we will get to know for the first time, discovering him much more multifaceted and interesting than previously. The cast of characters is excellent, with the two supporting actors well characterized and their relationship with the protagonist evolving throughout the adventure. Although much leeway is left for the episodes to come. Misthallery itself and all its inhabitants create a very varied complex which, even without having to resort to gimmicks such as the train of Pandora's Box or the time travel of The Lost Future, keeps you glued to the screen and makes every dialogue pleasant. The cast is perhaps the most successful of the entire series, despite the fact that the level has always been quite high and here it remains on average overall, and even the pace of events does not make the mistake of slowing down indulging in excessive downtime, to the point that it is A sort of rapid transit system along the Misthallery canals has also been devised to speed up moving operations. Something is changed? Winning team does not change, very true. It must be said, however, that taking advantage of this second start of the Level-5 series he could have enriched the gameplay with some innovations, injecting new life into a formula that even so works properly but could have been renewed more. Professor Layton and the Specter's Call instead asks you to use the stylus to explore the environments and interact with the characters in the same way as always, alternating the unraveling of the plot with the resolution of 170 puzzles developed once again in collaboration with Akira Tago. Riddles and puzzles have acquired a slightly greater variety, following a process of improvement that has never stopped. Given credit for this to the developers, however, it must also be said that some types of games are starting to know a little too much of what has already been seen for the veterans of the series, who instead of a slight increase in difficulty would perhaps have preferred a few more original ideas. But maybe it's just a matter of taste and point of view. There are the Picarata, the coins for the aids and the usual interface as always. There are also the usual three mini games: a train to drive from one point to another on a map full of obstacles and with a certain amount of fuel available, an aquarium to empty the coins contained inside and then some puppets to help in orchestrating their show. Interesting but not unforgettable. Nothing to say from a technical point of view: the movies are always excellent but the same goes for the statistics screens, the character design and the atmosphere a little darker than in the past. There is everything needed to recreate the splendid atmospheres of sempre strong point of Level 5 productions.", "date": "2011-12-05", "grade": "8.5"}
