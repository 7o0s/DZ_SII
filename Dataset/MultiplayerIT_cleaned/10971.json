{"name": "RAW", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/raw_a.html", "text": "Wanting to compare the latest production of the talented Pixalon Studios to a title for PC and console, Rainbow Six immediately comes to mind: exactly as in the game based on the excellent book by Tom Clancy, in fact, the central theme is the fight against terrorism; and the protagonists of the action are special agents trained to face the most extreme and dangerous situations, even and above all in hostile and unknown environments. For the creation of RAW, the Czech team has drawn heavily from the well-established tradition of two-dimensional action games on mobile phones, therefore we find horizontal scrolling stages with two ~floors~ per screen. There is no shortage of news, however, starting with the presence of two protagonists instead of one: we will have to control a team made up of a pair of agents, switching from one to the other by pressing the * key to take advantage of the different equipment. The two characters have independent energy bars, but which are restored simultaneously when we collect a med kit. Let's say that the idea winks a bit at classics of the past such as The Lost Vikings, even if in RAW the puzzle element is completely missing in favor of numerous strategic phases. The story sees us starting from Tel Aviv, with our team engaged in the capture of some dangerous terrorists. Things don't go well, however, and an agent is captured; therefore we will have to complete the subsequent stages, set in various locations, in an attempt to save it. At our disposal we will have different equipment, and generally the couple we control is equipped with mixed solutions: an agent with a ~fast~ weapon (machine gun, pistol), perhaps specialized in the management of explosives; another with a ~slow~ weapon (rifle), more effective for sorties. A large part of the game takes place in closed environments, so we will find ourselves exploring various floors of buildings full of armed enemies, who may have set some nice traps here and there. The combat system is classic, but we won't be able to avoid enemy fire: once in contact with hostile characters, we'll have to shoot first and plenty, or count on the ~fear~ factor to approach and arrest them. In front of each closed door, we will have various options to proceed: simply open it, force the lock (if closed), place an explosive, launch a flashbang into the room or shoot a rifle on the hinges and anyone nearby. RAW introduces a very interesting opponent detection system: once our character is in front of a door, he can listen to the noises inside and pinpoint the enemy's position, to then decide what to do. Given the presence of numerous checkpoints, the action is composed of a series of ~single episodes~ that must be solved with a good strategy in order to complete each mission. Certainly the level of difficulty will represent an obstacle for less experienced players... The realization of the stages is excellent, with locations full of details and equipped with a limited number of interactable objects (crates, doors, etc.). The variety of the scenarios is only discreet, but the chromatic choices help to create some more differences between the various environments. The sprites are very well designed and boast excellent, abundant and rather fluid animation: among the best that have been seen on mobile phones, as regards the genre of two-dimensional action games. The sound does what it can between music and effects: the results are not striking, but certainly above average.
