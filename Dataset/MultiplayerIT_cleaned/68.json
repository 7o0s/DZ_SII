{"name": "Supreme Commander - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/supreme-commander-recensione.html", "text": "I'd better get Wild Africa We need to make a small premise: the writer is a fanatic of all real-time strategy games, provided that the title starts either with a ~Command & Conquer~ or with a simpler ~C&C~: this is to say that any other RTS, however beautiful and fun, it cannot be considered worthy of remaining installed on my hard disk. For the sake of correct information (and not to risk my post as editor, after Pierpaolo's recommendations) I really have to admit that Supreme Commander was the only strategy game to deeply undermine my faith, so deeply that I'm now a university student out of course Take the weekend off While certainly not shining for its originality, the plot will unfold through very long missions that will lead you to discover interesting background stories and quite a few skeletons hidden in the closet of each faction: so we come to talk about the first big advantage of this Supreme Commander, namely the breadth of missions. As soon as you start a new map you will be assigned a primary objective and some secondary ones, not vital for victory, but which can greatly facilitate you, if completed, in subsequent objectives; moreover, the game map is not freely explorable, but will be unlocked as you complete the set objectives. If this can make purists turn up their noses, who could see it as a limit to the exploration and unraveling of the ~fog of war~, it must be said that even the initial map is already of considerable size and you will never have the feeling of being forced within a limited space. Take the weekend off If the vastness of the maps will allow you to carry out large-scale actions, with hundreds and hundreds of units engaged in combat, the reverse side of the coin is the risk of finding yourself lost and with long downtimes, during which you will find yourself wandering around the map looking for the enemy: this problem is not so evident during single player games, since the game will always provide you with rather clear and planned objectives, but it will arise in multiplayer games, where possible situations are not easily predictable. As if the wagons weren't enough... On the other hand, as the Supreme prefix suggests, you could hardly find yourself commanding two or three small groups of units, but you will be required to coordinate your military forces both on land and in the air and sea. The units present in the game, although aesthetically all different, roughly find their counterpart in each opposing faction: however, each faction has strengths and weaknesses that only after several games will you be able to understand and fully exploit: while for example, the 'UEF is unrivaled in the skies, especially in the later stages of the game, on the contrary the Aeons can rely on very powerful naval units, while the artificial Cybrans can boast of amphibious units. Thanks to the profound experience of Taylor, already author of the excellent Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander acquires a tactical depth that is decidedly on a higher level than other strategic titles: the strategy of amassing as many troops as possible and launching them on the attack there it will never lead to any result, or at least it will make you reach it after many losses, while the careful choice of the right unit to face a given situation can distort the fate of a battle. This will lead you to try to create the most heterogeneous armies possible, so as to be able to face any situation, even the most unpredictable, and emerge victorious, or at least with a significant draw. Yay for ACU! The first element that gives unpredictability to all your games is represented by the nice ACU, a sort of warlike cross between Ufo Robot's bad brother and Mazinger: basically it is your alter ego for all the different campaigns and will also represent your mobile command platform. This mammoth vehicle, in addition to representing a devastating offensive weapon (if it ever dies, it will leave behind an atomic mushroom), will allow you to build structures even quite far from your main base, without having to resort to fragile robot engineers: gradually that your base will evolve, going through the four different stages of Technology (from the first to the third, with the addition of a fourth, defined as ~experimental~) you will have the ability to perfect and enhance this robot of yours: prefer to turn it into a gigantic machine able to harvest resources and build at an impressive speed, or add a platform for small nuclear warheadson his back? The choice of changes to be made to the ACU, however, is not definitive: by spending an exorbitant amount of resources you will have the possibility to modify one of its enhancements, so as to be able to adapt it to any situation. We particularly appreciated Taylor's choice to reduce the resources present in the game to just two, namely Mass and Energy: while the first will be essential to be able to build any structure and means, the second will be essential to improve the defenses of the base and the speed of facility and unit upgrades. If this division may seem particularly obvious to you, you will immediately have to change your mind: in any other RTS, if you find yourself without resources you will have almost lost the game, regardless of your technological level and your previous actions; the genius behind Supreme Commander lies in the fact that even if you find yourself without Mass or Energy, you will still have the ability to build any type of building or unit, but the process will take much longer than normal, slowing down all your war machine sensitively, but without compromising the entire game. Dust off your Bocconi degree Resource management is, in essence, the other (yet another) workhorse of Supreme Commander: Mass can be extracted not only from the appropriate mines, but also from any element of the scenario, such as trees, stones and even unit scrap destroyed: each vehicle, in fact, once destroyed will remain on the game map, thus allowing you to recycle it and add a small amount of Mass to your reserve: the usefulness of this trick is particularly evident during multiplayer games, where after each battle a race begins to see who manages to recycle the greatest number of carcasses, so as to amortize the outcome and the cost of the battle. Dust off your Bocconi degree Energy, on the other hand, can only be produced, either through simple generators, or with power plants, exploiting the few natural resources: obviously the programmers have well thought out to insert structures that are able to convert Energy into Mass and vice versa, so as not to excessively penalize those who have not managed to acquire the best sources. It therefore becomes essential to also take care of the microeconomic aspect during all your games, becoming a real mini-game that will require you a lot of attention: it will be enough for the enemy to destroy some of your generators, or blow up a Mass Extractor, to see your apparatus cheap to drift quickly and with it also your chances of victory: being under a heavy attack, with very little Energy available and even less Mass, will lead to a series of penalties that are difficult to amortize; therefore, a true commander will not only worry about assembling the perfect army, but will also have to worry about organizing his own base, in a way close to manic. Forget the pixels... In support of the excellent gameplay, a superior quality graphics engine could only be deployed: your battles will be permeated by smoke, explosions, laser beams and anything else that your mind can insert in a science fiction film: while colossal robots face each other to the sound of missiles and deadly rays, your fighters soar in the sky as fast as dragonflies, intent on lethal dog fights against enemy air units, while at the same time your ships plow the waters in search of enemy submarines. Particularly striking are the catastrophic effects of superweapons, i.e. atomic bombs, which in a short time can wipe out an entire army, first blinding you with their glow, and then showing you what remains of the battlefield: thousands of wreckage and debris, trees on fire or uprooted and a huge furrow in the ground. The graphics, although they may not be fundamental in an RTS, make Supreme Commander so exciting to watch that it will almost be natural for you to keep the zoom level at maximum to enjoy the clashes, even at the cost of sacrificing the tactical aspect. Far from being able to dissatisfy those who feed on bread and wargames, the developers have allowed you to let off steam on the mouse wheel without any hesitation: you can switch from a zoom at ground level, up to the tactical vision par excellence, where the The entire map and your units will have abandoned the three-dimensional aspect, in favor of a stylized one, undoubtedly clearer and more immediate: the functionality of this possibility is undeniable, given that it allows you to enjoy both the tactical and strategic aspects of the title with the most total solution of continuity between a view and theother. Which, considering the size of the maps, is undoubtedly a big plus. Production model on the FIAT style The gameplay is further enriched by the possibility of creating real production centers: if, for example, you put several units in the construction queue, to speed up the process you can connect one or more secondary plants of the same type to the main factory ; in this way, every time the main structure starts producing units, the secondary ones will automatically start building the other units in the queue, so as to speed up the whole process and allow you to mass produce large quantities of vehicles. If reading it may seem complicated, in reality a couple of clicks will be enough to create real industrial zones, capable of submerging the opponent with your military and productive power. Supreme Commander does not stop there: you will also have the possibility to order an infinite series of waypoints (both movement and construction), so as to be able to create rather complex military tactics or, more simply, order your engineer to build more buildings than followed, without necessarily having to constantly care for him. On closer inspection, these are not colossal revolutions, but simple innovations that make the game much more enjoyable and fluid: setting construction waypoints will allow you to concentrate on the clashes while at the same time your base will evolve; likewise, organizing a targeted assault on your opponent's base, coordinating your ground and air forces, proves to be extremely useful and will allow you to overwhelm even those who have barricaded themselves behind tons of defense turrets. Some neo sometimes gives... Unfortunately, Supreme Commander is not the perfect game, although it is very close to it and has a good chance of becoming one: firstly, some units, especially air units, are too weak and fragile compared to land and sea units; by building even just a few anti-air defenses it will be possible to shoot down entire flocks of enemy fighters and bombers, thus encouraging the ~turtle~ development of the base, focusing on defenses rather than attack. The good will of the developers emerges from the launch of a patch that fixes these balancing problems, particularly felt during multiplayer games, a patch that can be downloaded from our Files Area. The other aspect, although it cannot really be considered a defect, are the exorbitant hardware requests: especially when the first shield generators and ballistic missiles enter, your video card will be constantly put under strain: we would like to advise anyone who wants to enjoy Supreme Commander in full detail, get either an 8800 GTX, or an old high-end DX9 card. Finally, to say it all, it must be highlighted that the play area is heavily invaded by the game interface. The title has in fact been the advertising promoter in recent months of a dual monitor configuration or with at least one large 16:9 monitor (24 inches at least). Following these requests, the title is in fact appreciable at excellent levels, but it must be recognized that these are configurations that are rarely usable by the average player and in the more classic case of a 17-19 inch monitor (perhaps 4:3) the play area is often a little too small. However, we don't feel like penalizing these aspects excessively: firstly because SC is perhaps the only game, this last semester, which hasn't shown us any annoying bugs, such as sudden crashes to the desktop or something else, and secondly because These are problems that can be easily fixed through patches and we are sure that Chris Taylor will not abandon his large group of fans. Conclusions We have reached the conclusion and, after having demolished our social life, we can assure you that Supreme Commander is one of the best games we have played in the last 12 months: not only does it manage to refresh the mechanics of a now stale genre, but it does without distorting any aspect, making it enjoyable and fun even for those approaching this genre for the first time. We would like to recommend this game not only to fans of the genre, but to anyone who wants to try the new, in our opinion, milestone of real-time strategy.
