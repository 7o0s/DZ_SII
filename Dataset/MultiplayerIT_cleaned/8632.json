Although this is not the right place to discuss the thorny subject, it is undeniable that something on the other side of the world, always talking about video games, is not working properly. Kojima perhaps represents one of the last bulwarks of hope, a light in the darkness capable of restoring dignity and ~hype~ even to the productions of the Rising Sun; a Japanese that Westerners like, perhaps because he talks about war but from a different point of view, almost philosophical if not downright romantic. Certainly there is nothing beautiful or admirable about war in itself, but even by fighting one can respect values; the figure of the upright fighter, who does his duty without forgetting his human side, is beautifully embodied by the super soldier Naked Snake, protagonist of that timeless masterpiece that was Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. After the HD collections on Xbox 360 and Ps3, which also included this episode, it's up to the 3DS to propose a new version, taking advantage of the particular features of the console, ie Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D. The Cold War as never seen before Eight years after its first publication, talking about the events that form the backdrop to Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D almost seems like a waste of time, given the number of enthusiasts and the philosophical-paradoxical interpretations that fans have indulged in giving all this time. But the political fictional world created by Hideo Kojima still retains a unique charm, thanks in part to the artist's imagination but above all to the profound climate of uncertainty, concern and sometimes fear that reigned in those decades between the 50s and 60s. Then 1962, the annus horribilis of the Cold War due to the infamous Cuban Missile Crisis, is mentioned several times in the course of the game, with original archive footage that contributes to the player's total immersion. That's why it seems necessary to avoid another similar accident, if not even more serious: saving Sokolov, the Russian scientist inventor of the powerful Shagohod nuclear tank who defected to the USA, in a clean and painless way, is in fact the main objective of Naked Snake . However, due to the sensational betrayal of The Boss, the legendary American soldier mentor of Snake, the plans do not go exactly as planned and indeed the situation becomes very hot: Colonel Volgin, head of the GRU (a sort of independent KGB from the General Staff ) and eager to bring down the pacifist Khrushchev, he uses the small American nuclear device donated as a sign of loyalty by The Boss himself to raze a Soviet military settlement to the ground. Khrushchev obviously asks the American president for explanations, suspecting his involvement; behind the hesitant answers of the president, who blames the fact on the defector The Boss and Volgin, the head of the Kremilin gives an ultimatum to the USA: the Third World War can be avoided only if The Boss and Volgin, as well as the Shagohod, are definitively eliminated. The 3D effect Although in certain situations it exacerbates the annoying framerate problem, the 3D effect of Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D is generally pleasant and well done, with some touches of class as in the case of the appearance of the hornets of The Pain that literally pierce the screen. Given the duration of the average game sessions, thanks also to the numerous videos, the advice is always to reduce the impact every now and then to take a break and thus relax your eyes a little. Mobile survival The worrying preamble, called Missione Virtuosa, thus starts the most dangerous and eventful part of Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D, precisely the Snake Eater mission. This chapter of the saga is known as a prequel set about 40 years before Metal Gear Solid on PSOne; as a consequence, the technology available to Snake is obsolete (the radar is in fact very crude and therefore inaccurate, as are weapons and gadgets) and survival in a hostile environment becomes a challenge within a challenge. In fact, the first thing to worry about is camouflage: in the absence of optical camouflage suits, which will appear only later, the only possibility of going unnoticed is given by the perfect combination of facial paint and type of uniform worn, to be constantly adapted to the environments of game crossed. Then there is the recovery of vigor, obtainable through food: the fauna of which the forest is teeming, starting with the snakes, will serve the purpose perfectly. Finally, with the help of the always vigilant Para-Medic connected via Codec, it will be necessary to heal the wounds on their own, applying the most suitable tools each time. The particular care dedicated to this game element still amazes even now after so many years; this time however, thanks to the practical touch screen tool, applying disinfectants, haemostatics, bandages, ointments and other remedies is even more immediate and fun. Dealing with Snake Once the game has started, the system asks a series of questions related to the recommended difficulty and the layout of the controls to which you are most accustomed, listing which of all the episodes of the series you prefer the most. However, all this stems from an undeniable basic problem: the lack of the second analog and two other backbones from the Nintendo 3DS. In fact, the default setting provides, on the model of the PSP episodes, the management of the camera entrusted to the four action keys on the right, with the obvious easily imaginable difficulties. For this reason, the use of the controversial Circle Pad Pro, which enlarges and makes the console less ~portable~ in favor of game comfort, is essential to fully enjoy the entire adventure. With this peripheral all the mapping of the commands, once set from the special menu, becomes familiar and intuitive again: left stick which remains relegated to movement, right stick which manages the camera, back pads to attack and aim and so on, without prejudice the most complete possibility of customization. The bottom screen of the 3DS acts as a map, viewable in real time, and as a survival viewer when you press Start or Select; in particular conditions, that is, when Snake is in a precarious balance, the accelerometers come into play, similar to what was seen for example in Uncharted using the Sixaxis sensors. Moving the console guarantees the optimal position on a branch or on a rope bridge, a feature that is always nice but which is no longer surprising. Impersonating Snake, even with the Circle Pad Pro, requires a minimum of practice: the screen is in fact much smaller than we were used to and the perception of distances, at least initially, can be deceiving; in fact, it will happen to trigger numerous alarms during the early stages, as well as to miss some CQC attacks (the terrible melee technique learned from The Boss), but proceeding with the story everything will return to normal. Everything actually works very well and everything is exactly where it should be; the problem, if such it can be considered, is that such a masterpiece needs an adequate ~stage~ to be fully enjoyed. The quality of the conversion in terms of gameplay is not discussed here, which is ultimately more than satisfactory, but rather the opportunity for such a transposition: those who have not played the 2004 original or the Substance version in their time can now enjoy of an excellently developed HD collection, which does justice to the enormous artistic value of the work. Having ascertained that 3D cannot in this case be considered as a determining element for the choice, here are the reasons for such a conversion, after removing the small percentage of fans of the game who are exclusive owners of 3DS and at the same time without PS2 or PS3/Xbox 360, honestly appear unclear. If to this is added the implicit obligation to purchase the Circle Pad Pro, a cost that adds up to that of the game, the perplexities increase even more. It is fair to reiterate, once again, that in no way is the undoubted artistic value of Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D discussed here; what one wonders is whether this revival on a portable console is really so necessary, considering that the trend up to now has been on the contrary to export the mobile episodes to home platforms (as in the case of God of War for PSP and the Peace Walker himself). Technique isn't everything, but it helps The work done on a technical level has many highs and some lows: in general, the animations and general cleanliness are very good. It seems that a few more effects have also been added compared to the original version and the vegetation itself has enjoyed it in a clearly visible way; there is no shortage of defects and washouts in some textures, especially on the rocks and on some walls, but the result is in any case commendable. However, the serious problems come from the framerate: not so much in the ~normal~ game phase, with the classic third-person view, as in the interlude and more crowded scenes, where the shots become visible and annoying. Anyone who knows Kojima and the concept that the maestro japanese has some ~interlude scenes~ will understand the seriousness of the thing: some of the most memorable sequences are in fact narrated through these movies with game graphics, perfectly directed by virtual cameras with a clear cinematic cut. The tragic discovery of the desertion of The Boss, the first appearance of Ocelot and Volgin, the spectacular endings after each boss battle against the members of the Cobra Unit are just some of the memorable scenes that will keep the player literally glued to the small screen. Finally, it is worth dedicating a few lines to the splendid soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams, starting with the main song Snake Eater, ending with the practically perfect English dubbing, a sign of an attention to detail that is now truly rare to find in other products .", "date": "2012-03-30", "grade": "8.0"}
