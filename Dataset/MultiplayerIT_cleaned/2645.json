{"name": "F1 Championship Season 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-championship-season-2001.html", "text": "The game After an introduction that shows us all the cars of the most important car championship in the world, you will finally find yourself in the main menu. Here you can choose between various options: quick race, multiplayer, game modes, options, other EA Sports products (this is obviously exclusive to the developer). Entering the first option, Gara Veloce, you will take the best shortcut to quickly reach the asphalt of the track. After choosing the driver and circuit, here you are in the thick of the action against as many as 21 challengers. You will start in twenty-second position. With Multiplayer you will be catapulted into breathtaking challenges with another human participant in split-screen mode or you will organize a tournament in which only the best times will count. However, what will interest the player the most is certainly the Game Mode option, that is, the one with the greatest choice ever. You can then decide whether to face a Single Grand Prix (made up of free practice, time trial and the actual race), a Custom Championship (in which you can choose the number of Grands Prix you want to participate in) or finally a Championship Complete (which goes through all the stages of the real Formula 1 championship). What will appeal most to purists of the genre is the possibility of modifying a myriad of factors of your car, making it as close as possible to the needs of the player. As far as the options are concerned, it can be said that they are the usual, but the novelty lies in Other EA Sports Products: here you can watch a spectacular video that shows us all the new games produced by the largest sports title producer in the world. Now let's talk about the track game, the one that really matters to the player. Well I can tell you that from my point of view there is no Formula 1 game that compares to this F1 Championship Season 2000. Sure, it's not as realistic as GP3 but, to tell the truth, I think this is fortunate. EA has found the right compromise between realism and fun thanks not only to the intuitive controls, but also to the total lack of frustration that one feels while enjoying this game. The difficulty is well calibrated and the sense of speed is good. Finally, there are five cameras, three internal and two external. Among these, the most evocative one is certainly the one inside the cockpit which will give you the feeling (or almost) of actually being inside your racing car. Technical aspects EA Sports amazes us once again with a title worthy of the best productions of the genre. The game takes full advantage of the power of the good PS2 and gives us excellent models enriched by perfect textures. In this regard, I would point out the grandeur of the cockpit, truly realistic. The backdrops are made in an excellent way and really worthy of all my praise. Moreover, they are exactly identical to the real ones, which is no small thing. The same goes for effects like rain and smoke. In short, graphically we are really on excellent levels. The sound is exactly like the real counterpart and if you are a fan of Formula 1 you will have a thrill in perceiving the incredible quality of the sound effects. The comment is by Ivan Capelli and for once it is not useless: in fact, Capelli will provide you with interesting anecdotes about the slopes you will ride before each race. Conclusions We are at the end of this review and what can I add? Nothing, except the warmest advice to buy this latest effort from the great EA Sports which once again gives us a fun and impeccable title from a technical point of view. In particular I point out: Pros Excellent from a technical point of view Great playability Cons Simulation purists may not like it A game that was missing The genre of Formula 1 simulators has always had a good success on all platforms, from PC to PSX. The new Sony home console lacked this type of game and here is the licensing house, EA Sports finally distributes its own F1 game throughout Europe: F1 Championship Season 2000. Official update of the unfortunate F1 2000, this F1CS2000 is proposes as the direct competitor of the total F1 simulator Grand Prix 3, released exclusively for PC and sequel to the best-selling Formula 1 title in history (GP2 precisely ndCartac). The fact remains that F1 Championship Season 2000 is the only game of its kind to land on the PS2, but nevertheless the programmers have by no means slumped on their privilege.Instead, they have produced a winning title that will put its future competitors to the test.", "date": "2001-01-11", "grade": null}
