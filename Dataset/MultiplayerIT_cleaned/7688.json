The title of Interceptor Entertainment, in essence, invites us on a full blast through medieval castles illuminated by science fiction lights, populated by soldiers of clear Nazi inspiration and supervised by powerful super-generals and genetic experiments. But in the Apogee series things take a more grotesque turn,  la Duke Nukem 3D, with burps, self-referential jokes, shreds of the enemy that smear the screen and devices with sometimes amazing and very often grotesque effects. Rise of the Triad is a passionate tribute to the fast-paced and irreverent side of FPS history The magic of vintage shooters A worthy representative of the middle age, one in which 2D and 3D elements were mixed due to technological needs, Rise of the Triad was inevitably set aside by the advent of Quake, the standard-bearer of the three-dimensional revolution. But the peculiar visual formula of that genre suspended halfway between the past and the future has marked the imagination of many and survives in the new Rise of the Triad through choices that sacrifice the potential of the Unreal Engine but return something decidedly unique. Enemies' bodies tear implausibly, projecting two-dimensional-looking cascades of blood, and crumble to smithereens when hit full-on by explosions which in turn are peppered with overly bright flames and halos of light. The result, from a technological point of view, is not the best also due to textures with a decidedly fluctuating quality. However, everything is functional in terms of a tribute that certainly doesn't aim to recover a decidedly dated look, as demonstrated by the implementation of an advanced lighting system, but wants to keep the chaotic spirit of the original intact. Spirit that lives on profusion of blood, annoying noises, intense lights and strange devices that can grant us extraordinary cosmic powers or make us ridiculous, as in the case of the famous Dog Mode which has certainly remained imprinted in the minds of those who have played original Rise of the Triad. And the legacy also includes the fearsome dark staff, the most powerful enchanted baseball bat and an arsenal of explosive weapons that include missiles capable of raising hell and the unreliable but decidedly amazing drunk missile. All underlined and magnified by the inevitable metal soundtrack, another seminal element of the classic FPS which in Rise of the Triad refers to the sounds of the original, debtors of Doom, reinterpreted in a modern key with discreet skill. When all these elements resonate, that frenetic and chaotic vintage shooter magic manifests itself which includes traps, another recurring element of the genre, super bosses, complete with spins and super special attacks, and thousands of shiny objects to collect for pump up the score. Like in a platformer The single player campaign of Rise of the Triad is based on the classic score structure with 20 maps distinct from each other and divided into checkpoints. These are quite numerous and serve to avoid any frustration, definitely possible if you decide to tackle the title on the highest difficulties, without implementing the free save which would distort the challenge linked to the points. Not that the various rooms are impossible to deal with but to accumulate points you need to be quick and ring a series of kills. And this can prove more complicated than expected when facing enemies who shoot with a high rate of fire made even more dangerous by increasingly precise aiming as the difficulty increases. Furthermore, the most powerful opponents, more numerous as we progress through the twenty levels of the campaign, are equipped with weapons with explosive projectiles, always very dangerous thanks to an extreme rate of fire, and with automatic but effective reactions such as the lightning somersault that the graduates carry out automatically every time they are hit or like the fearsome net that paralyzes us leaving us at the mercy of enemy fire and forces us to resort to the dagger to find freedom again. But the reactions, as mentioned above, are automatic and are therefore predictable like the traps, all timed, and like the elevators and platforms that distinguish the various platform moments of the title. Even the enemies always pop up with the same timing, they appear in the same spawn points and very often they stay still or just move forwardand towards us in a straight line. In essence, everything is predictable, as in a platformer, including the bosses who move schematically (to put it in the old fashioned way, they make the so-called ~turns~) and who can be killed faster by learning the movement pattern by heart. And even what appear to us as obvious defects seem to be designed to force us to memorize the maps. In fact, the enemies are not very visible, the direction from which the shots arrive is not indicated in a precise way and the maps are full of areas in which the character gets stuck without any hope of being able to free himself. From all this it inevitably follows that in the single player of Rise of the Triad memory is more important than skill and is absolutely fundamental, also given the need to explore to find keys and secret areas, to maximize scores. Ultimately, the only elements left to guarantee a certain variety are the random power-ups, the blood splatters, the good old cheats and the presence of five characters characterized by different characteristics. If you don't shoot in the company The multiplayer sector of Rise of the Triad neutralizes the biggest flaw of the single player which does not shine in wanting to re-propose a decidedly dated and not very exciting exploratory component. In online matches, however, the combat never stops and the abundance of detonations and offal overwhelms any other considerations. Unfortunately, what is not abundant is the offer which is limited to only five maps and team deathmatch, deathmatch and capture the flag modes, but the developers have included the versatile UDK editor in the offer and have already promised updates and DLC in quantity for support what they think is the real core of the experience. Certainly not a risky statement if we consider that the multiplayer sector does not give up the peculiarities of the title and which amplifies them thanks to the greater satisfaction that derives from the possibility of unleashing the absurd power of some power-ups and explosive weapons on the head of human opponents. Opponents also in this case differentiated by characteristics and all damn fast and difficult to hit. And this last element makes the role of the various missile launchers, magic weapons and power-ups even more important which, as we have anticipated, can have extremely positive or damned negative effects. The result is deliberately chaotic with maps designed to enhance the aforementioned elements between lethal tunnels and large spaces that are functional to the ballistic game implicitly included in the presence of numerous weapons based on explosive projectiles. Nothing new, of course, but this is implicit in the tribute operation. This includes high customization with a classic command console and includes dedicated software that allows you to create custom servers. Furthermore, players who do not want to play online are not forced to register and can switch to offline mode which still allows you to do so on a LAN. Obviously in this case the statistics are not recorded but for the developers it is more important that the game is DRM free in all respects, exactly like the original Rise of the Triad.", "date": "2013-08-05", "grade": "7.5"}
