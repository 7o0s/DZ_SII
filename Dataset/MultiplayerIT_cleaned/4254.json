Sdorica - Sunset is perhaps one of the most ambitious projects seen so far by the team, presenting itself as a real RPG that includes puzzle elements in the combat system and a complex mechanics for managing the characters and their evolutions that borders on the gacha with micro -transactions, although it should be noted that it does absolutely nothing to force us to spend money. The premise is something very classic but the story is carried forward in an interesting way: in a world where humans have decided to sacrifice their immortality for a precarious life but free from the dominion of the dragon Sdorica, there is still someone who maneuvers into the darkness to return to the old regime and awaken the mighty creature to bring back eternal life with the ancient status quo. The setting halfway between classic fantasy and fairytale with typically Japanese tones is illustrated with care and a very particular style that recalls Vanillaware productions, above all thanks to well-drawn characters and never too banal dialogues. Certainly it is not a particularly original story, but the way it is told helps to pace it and make it perfectly digestible, being a game that focuses above all on something else, namely combat and the evolution of the characters. While the first is based on a very intuitive puzzle-style system, apparently too simplistic but with a minimum of strategic construct, the second element is probably the most profound and complex one, in some respects even a little cumbersome. Action and evolution The combat system is structured in turns as in the classic JRPGs, but to deliver blows and spells (attack and support) we are faced with a sort of puzzle based on the association of colors: acting on two parallel lines, visible below of the battlefield, we must associate various ~gems~ by color forming pairs or ~squares~ for more effective shots, with each color corresponding to the action of a particular character in the party. It is an extremely intuitive and dynamic system, perhaps even too simple due to the presence of only two lines and types of combinations, but which nonetheless requires a certain strategic approach in calculating which spaces to free up to trigger more powerful shots and selecting which enemy to hit to anticipate the opponents' countermoves. The relative simplicity of the combat system is counterbalanced by a rather complex management of the characters, which is also replaced by a stratified micro-transaction system that requires some study, fortunately all well explained by an exhaustive progressive tutorial. The game offers a large amount of content between the main quest supported by the narrative and the side missions, some of these offered on a daily basis and particularly generous as rewards (but obviously present in smaller quantities, imposing the wait between one day and other) and others more suitable for grinding by offering short and less demanding challenges, as well as quests related to the stories of the individual characters that help shed light on every aspect of the complex game world. Note that there is no energy bar that forces you to wait or make forced purchases in order to move forward: in the end the micro-transactions come into play only to more simply obtain upgrades for the characters or some specific fighters through the system of gacha, but the developers have done a great job of keeping these aspects detached from the standard progression of the game, so it is possible to progress without even considering purchases except to support the team. Simply, the expectations depend on the different availability of the missions more ~rich~ in rewards, many of which are offered on a daily basis and therefore run out within a few hours for each day, but we are far from the most Machiavellian mechanisms seen in this area. The progression system is based on several parallel lines so there is an experience level linked to the player who advances with each encounter and others corresponding to each individual character in the party. Considering that the amount of fighters is constantly increasing, the use of Soul Energy (with which to raise the level of a single character) and Resonance (which allows you to enhance the characters by bringing out new skills) becomes of fundamental importance and requires careful management of resources, or the possible use of the acquisi'm. Beyond the story, however excellently scripted also thanks to the wonderfully designed graphics and the interlude sequences in Japanese anime style, it is precisely in this complex party management, which flows into the pure collecting of characters, the main engine of Sdorica: Sunset.", "date": "2018-05-17", "grade": "8.3"}
