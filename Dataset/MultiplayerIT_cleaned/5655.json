In the case of Lost Socks: Naughty Brothers we are not currently able to say if the concept chosen by the Nerf Game team will be able to convince the user, but without a doubt we feel obliged to congratulate the creative effort born from a mind obviously quite problematic. The theme is in fact based on the age-old problem of mismatched socks, and more specifically on the mystery of the disappearance - during washing in the washing machine - of the ~twin~ of a colorful anthropomorphic sock. A premise in pure nonsense that leads directly into an action platformer that is sometimes surprising, but incredibly frustrating. Lost Socks is a graphically beautiful game, but intended only for an audience that loves a challenge Suck your sock In Lost Socks, the protagonist is precisely a sock. Not a common one, the ones you keep piled up in a drawer, but a hero sock capable of crossing, armed to the teeth, levels full of enemies to be eliminated without mercy. With clear references to the most recent chapters of Rayman and, for veterans, to that Earthworm Jim who left an indelible mark on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive in the mid-90s, the game is structurally organized as a two-dimensional platform, with the however, a variant of the automatic progression of the protagonist which in fact makes the pace of the game always high. In fact, the player cannot freely manage the movements of his alter ego, but only the use of the jump which must therefore be perfectly dosed in order to happily reach the end of the level. Obviously that's not all, because the control system designed by Nerf Game contemplates a total of four keys: one for jumping, one for a sort of forward dash, and the other two delegates to the primary and secondary weapon. In Lost Socks it is in fact possible to unlock during the adventure a whole series of weapons with different effects, to be managed wisely and possibly to be strengthened thanks to the coins collected within the settings. Even the character himself can enjoy a whole series of bonuses, ranging from an increase in the power of the blows to a magnet to collect coins more quickly, passing through shields and other amenities. A well-studied gameplay, therefore, which finds the only real reason for criticism in the excessive proximity of the buttons on the right of the screen, a factor which often determines the execution of a move other than the desired one. An element of frustration which, however, is only the tip of the iceberg, because the developers have chosen to make Lost Socks a difficult, very difficult game. If the very first levels (of the 30 total) flow easily after all, you just need to wait very little to understand what level of attention and commitment is required to complete the subsequent missions. In practice, each stage is scripted, in the sense that the position and actions of the enemies are always the same at every attempt. To be able to complete each level it is practically mandatory to go through a severe ~trial and error~ phase, repeating the same situations several times until you memorize their development and consequently the actions to be performed. As if that weren't enough, each individual area offers three stars to collect and a super star linked to the final score. However, this operation is by no means ancillary, since having a high number of stars proves to be a necessary condition to be able to overcome some blocks and therefore continue in the game. A decision that confronts a brutal, frustrating, undoubtedly rewarding challenge but destined to make the title fully appreciable only by the most skilled hardcore players: certainly not the most representative category of mobile users. Where Lost Socks surprises from the first moment is instead in the technical component, really of a higher level: we were talking about the analogies with Rayman Origins and Legends, basically for the choice to adopt a graphic style based on hand-drawn characters and environments like cardboard animated, with a particular focus on animations and level of detail. The Nerf Game product is practically a cartoon, colorful, vibrant, captivating and very well characterized, which would also look good on consoles. Finally, it deserves to be underlined how the game fully respects its premium sales model, since the 4.99 required for the purchase will be the only oneslove to spend. The total absence of in-app purchases can therefore only be a plus.", "date": "2016-03-11", "grade": "8.4"}
