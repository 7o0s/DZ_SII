The player takes on the role of a leader who must take over the command of an army after the death of his father, trying to lead his soldiers to victory despite the conditions being far from favorable, also and above all due to the betrayal of a faction previously allied. The dynamics of Total War Battles: Shogun are illustrated through a short but original tutorial, which takes place in a situation of absolute emergency, with the enemies who press inexorably against our positions and must be rejected. Using a classic system, based on natural and economic resources, the goal in each stage is to build a certain number of preparatory buildings for the creation of various types of units (from simple soldiers to those armed with spears, from troops to horse to warrior monks, from archers to elite swordsmen, passing through gunners and so on), then eliminate hostile troops or otherwise meet the conditions required from time to time to achieve victory. Surviving the tutorial turns out to be a relatively simple undertaking, but later one realizes that this preliminary phase had to be told more calmly, so as to allow us to better metabolize not only the philosophy behind the controls, which we will see shortly, but also and above all the nature and function of each building. Notions that are thrown away and then missed, especially when we are asked for careful planning to successfully conclude the battles. One Way Fans of the Total War series on PC are well aware that the product developed by The Creative Assembly follows the RTS mechanics, allowing us to manage huge armies and witness phenomenal battles in which literally thousands of soldiers face each other. Clearly it was not possible to do the same on mobile devices, for technical and practical reasons, therefore it was decided to remain in the context of real-time strategy, but to adopt dynamics closer to the tower defense sub-genre. In Total War Battles: Shogun we can create the units we want and place them in any of the ~boxes~ that delimit our base camp, but their movement is not determined by a double selection, but by an automatic mechanism: we give them the ~ departure~ and move towards the right side of the scenario, where the hostile troops are, attacking them as soon as they come back within their field of action. The path of the soldiers can be stopped or they can be ordered to change ~lane~, all according to logics based on the ~cool down~ of the maneuvers, and this adds a further element of challenge when the map has obstacles or ~tight~ sections ~, through which only one group of warriors can pass at a time. In the end, the choice made by the developers pays off, in the sense that the product turns out to be fun, very full-bodied (the single player campaign really consists of a high number of missions) and technically well done (see the animations of the individual soldiers) , but unfortunately the experience suffers from a series of shortcomings: in the first place, as already mentioned, the presence of a too hasty tutorial, which creates many difficulties; secondly, the touch controls tend to ~snap~ (on iPhone 4S), and this makes the rapid selection of different units very problematic in the most agitated moments; finally, the ~one-way~ action of the soldiers prevents troops that are still healthy from being useful in the fight with enemies that are located further up or down the map.", "date": "2012-05-03", "grade": "8.0"}
