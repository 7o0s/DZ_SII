{"name": "Corsa e fango", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/89291-mx-vs-atv-alive-corsa-e-fango.html", "text": "PlayStation 3 tested versionAfter the great work done last year with MX vs. ATV Reflex, Rainbow Studios, which has become one of the internal development teams of THQ since 2001, is back in the limelight in recent weeks with a new motor racing game set in the off-road world, with a stylistically very similar production to the aforementioned work . We are talking about MX Vs ATV Alive, the ideal sequel to Reflex, which in the intentions of its creators should improve and further embellish the gameplay and structure that players liked so much in 2010. Although it was not a masterpiece of the genre, MX vs. ATV Reflex, in fact, all in all had proved to be a decidedly interesting product for every off-road racing enthusiast, at least for the time of release. Excluding a few small imperfections, the Rainbow Studios title could boast a good technical realization from the point of view of physics and gameplay, with unexpected bits of realism in a title of the arcade genre. And this was further confirmation for this development team which has been considered for several years now one of the best known working groups in the universe of video games in the production of titles almost exclusively dedicated to the world of off-road racing on motors. Since the days of their productions related to MX Unleashed and MX vs. ATV Unleashed. There was therefore a lot of expectation for the title that we are about to analyze, above all because given the premises, a lot was expected. Step back Unfortunately, let's face it right away, this MX Vs ATV Alive has absolutely nothing to do with its predecessor and indeed seems to have lost along the way, it is appropriate to say it, many of those interesting features introduced in the previous work. As if there had actually been a race against time on the part of the developers, a certain hurry to get the product out on the market. Yes, because it seems really incomplete in terms of options, modes, challenges. And the fact that by choice THQ will release complementary DLCs for a fee has nothing to do with it: the same seems to be missing a lot of stuff. First of all, a real Career mode is missing, and this already says a lot about what was written above. What is to all intents and purposes the fulcrum around which any sports production now revolves, of which it usually constitutes the main attraction, is here replaced by a small number of unrelated races enclosed in a game session called Fast Race. The annoying thing is that these races have limited access, i.e. they depend on the level of experience accumulated by the driver used by the gamer. What does this mean? Simple, that to move on to a series of subsequent races, unlocking their availability, you have to run to collect enough experience points to move forward. And this in terms of gameplay translates into the frustrating repetition, for the user, of the same tracks doing practically always or almost the same things to get the result he needs. The same procedure is adopted to unlock and increase the level of vehicles, which in this way then have access to new pieces and elements to customize them. Even of the welcome introduction of dune buggies and monster trucks, one of the elements that had characterized the predecessor, there is no longer a trace, just as a greater challenge is missing in the free ride session, where you only have to perform fast spectacular tricks or stay a long time in the air to reach certain scores, but nothing more. Luckily things improve once you get on track in ~normal~ races. The title maintains, in terms of gameplay, the good characteristics that have distinguished MX Vs ATV Reflex, such as the deformation of the terrain, implemented in a rather convincing way, and the control system of the vehicles and the pilot. While maintaining a style essentially designed for the general public, MX Vs ATV Alive does not disdain to indulge in a greater depth of simulation in order to satisfy the requests of every type of user. But, we repeat, without exaggeration. Playstation 3 trophies MX Vs ATV Alive offers forty-seven Trophies divided as follows: thirty-four Bronze, eight Silver, three Gold, one Platinum. The prizes are collected by progressing in the various game modes and in the related competitions, in order to satisfy the demands of the product. So winning a race using the James Stewart outfit will earn you the Bronze trophy called Become a Star, etc. The Silver ones are obtained in a similar way. For example, completing fifty overtakes with contact will have the one called Bullet or the Versatile Talent reaching the first level of eachni race goal. Acquired all the other trophies you will get the coveted Platinum. Technique is not everything The conformation of the tracks and the way in which they change in real time in relation to the climatic conditions, as well as the passage of vehicles, is probable and can profoundly affect performance in the race. A very damaged route makes the vehicle controlled by the user more unstable and has repercussions on the way it drives. Here the control system offered by the game comes into play, practically identical to that seen in Reflex. It allows, through the use of both analog sticks, to manage the driver and the vehicle separately during the race in order to act on the movements of the vehicle and on the weight of the centaur in relation to the type of vehicle driven, balancing. Controlling every movement and calibrating it perfectly to increase grip on the ground and avoid loss of balance, falls or off-track taking into account factors such as rough terrain, route, vehicle physics, etc., it becomes a challenge within a challenge and the correct way to master the game itself. Worth mentioning, highlighting it, is the better implementation of the opponents' AI: if in the past it was too aggressive, now it appears decidedly more credible, with behaviors of the drivers managed by the CPU that vary according to the type of challenge in a realistic and without extremism of some sort. MX Vs ATV Alive also offers a mode for both local multiplayer, for two players in split-screen, and online, for up to twelve users. In all cases it is practically the same course commitments of the single player mode with a lot of attention to the scores obtained. In fact, once the necessary level has been reached, even in the multiplayer segment it will be possible to replace, unlocking them, every component and every piece of equipment of vehicles and pilots. As far as graphics and audio are concerned, there is little to say: aesthetically, the title produced by THQ has the usual engine to which this series of racing titles has accustomed us. It is not a particularly powerful engine, especially when compared with those currently used on next gen consoles in other competing productions, and it happens to see frame rate drops and pop-ups, but the graphics are always good at optimizing what in their possession. Overall, therefore, the game, if we do not dwell on certain details, visually manages to offer good scenarios and glimpses, and also discreet models for pilots and vehicles. Compatibly, we repeat, with the engine used. The sound, on the other hand, offers excellent background samples and a decent accompanying soundtrack.", "date": "2011-06-20", "grade": "5.5"}
