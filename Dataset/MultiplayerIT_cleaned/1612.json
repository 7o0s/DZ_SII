{"name": "The Hulk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-hulk.html", "text": "Looking for a cure In fact, it is not easy for Dr. Banner to have to live with such an inconvenience; Though a source of enormous power, the green beast's uncontrollability makes the Hulk a danger to everyone around him. But the Hulk's power is tempting to many people and the worst comes when Dr. Crawford, now old and confined to a wheelchair, decides to keep that power for himself and become Ravage, another mutant with a clear evil inclination. At the helm of the mighty green giant we will have the task of recovering that power, the source of so much trouble, and not allowing it to fall into the wrong hands. This is the beginning of The Hulk, developed under license from the film of the same name on behalf of Vivendi by Radical Entertainment. In a period in which tie-ins are flourishing (just see Enter The Matrix and Wolverine's Revenge), The Hulk is proposed as something more than a game inspired by a film, rather constituting a real sequel. Two game modes available: the classic Story Mode, which will take you in search of the Hulk's power stolen by Dr. Crawford, and the Challenge mode, where you can dispense tons of free violence and which will only be accessible after unlocking two types of time attack, two survival modes and finally the Hulk destruction mode in Story Mode. During the course of the main story the action will be divided into two types, related to the control of Banner or Hulk: while in the first case you will have to deal with stealth missions, in which you will be called to solve simple puzzles and puzzles to infiltrate the enemy base , in the second case, once the power of the green beast has been unleashed, your only goal will be the total devastation of everything that will stand between you and your goal. The missions in which you will be in command of Banner unfortunately turn out to be a bit monotonous, thanks above all to the control system, which is not always precise. Furthermore, the numerical puzzles are very simple to solve and the action almost always boils down to moving boxes to create new passages. Fortunately, the missions in which we will be in control of the Hulk take care of redeeming the situation, really fun: the watchword is to destroy everything that moves and raze the surrounding environment to the ground. An excellent stress reliever. Among the extras to report the Hulk destruction mode, in which you will be awarded points based on the amount of scenic elements demolished. What a beautiful green face you have The graphics of The Hulk is excellently cared for, both for the movies that act as an interlude to the various sections of the game, and for the polygonal models of the characters and the settings. The level of interactivity with the seabed is very high: in addition to being able to collect almost every object on the screen to brandish it as a blunt or thrown weapon (in particular, each object will have a different use: you can use a rock to crush enemies, a pole instead it can be wielded like a giant baseball bat), your brute force will cause visible damage to the walls, or even craters in the floor. The animations are well made, in fact the Hulk moves in a truly natural way for his size and perfectly executes all the moves that made him famous, from the thunderclap to the various grips. The sound sector is good, with the audio effects which, while not shining in terms of variety, prove to be spot on and perform their task well, thanks also to the full support of 5.1. The dubbing is also excellent, both during the cutscenes and in the in-game sequences. Returning to the gameplay, the green monster sports an enviable collection of combos to get the better of your enemies, whether they are small and insignificant humans or gigantic metal robots. The sequences of moves are simple to implement thanks to the intuitive control system, which in addition to the classic punches, jumps, grips and special attacks, also adds a targeting system (typical lock-on on enemies) which will guarantee you to hit shots more accurately. The only flaws of the game, in addition to the sections with decidedly subdued Banners, are the excessive brevity and a decidedly low level of challenge: three difficulty levels are not exactly the best solution, if only a few days are enough to finish the Normal mode. The large number of extra content and modes will still absorb some of your desire to destroy, however, with the trailer of the film, galleries of artwork, interviews with the development team and an abundance of cheat codes. Also interesting is the possibility of unlocking Gray Hulk, at least to have a laugh and listengoing the jokes he throws at enemies before reducing them to a pulp. Comment You know, famous movie tie-ins aren't always well made. Fortunately, this is not the case with The Hulk, which pleasantly surprises for the satisfactory technical realization and for the moments of healthy fun it offers since the first time the pad is held. Too bad for the sections starring Banner, which as already mentioned could be boring, and for the excessive brevity of the main mode, even if it is possible to unlock a third game mode by watching the film and obtaining clues to compose a special code. In short, a must buy for all fans of the green giant and a title to keep an eye on for lovers of the classic scrolling beat'em ups looking for some free healthy violence. Pros: Good technical sector Immediate and playable Fun sections with Hulk Cons: Perhaps a little short and easy Sections with Banner are subdued I can feel it even now. Buried deep down somewhere. Look at me, wait.. But do you know what scares me the most? When I can't fight it anymore, when it takes over me, when it takes over I love it! By now everyone is aware of what Dr. Banner defines as his ~curse~: one day during an experiment aimed at analyzing the effects of gamma rays on damaged tissue, not everything went well, and in the meek Bruce Banner the deeper and more violent instinct of destruction, which took the form of the green giant, Hulk. Its power is now in our hands, as exuberant and uncontrollable as ever.", "date": "2003-06-25", "grade": null}
