Beyond the huge amount of material dedicated directly to the far distant galaxy conceived by George Lucas, the brand is a war machine even when it comes to lending itself to other works far from the nature of Star Wars. One of these is Pinball FX2, a Zen Studios pinball game that has built its fortunes on tables dedicated to several important franchises, among which Star Wars naturally stands out. The virtual pinball machines dedicated to Luke Skywalker are in fact numerous, including the one dedicated to the arrival in theaters of the seventh episode of the saga. As it was easy to predict, even the release of Rogue One did not go unnoticed, and this is how the new table dedicated to Jyn Erso and associates has been available for a few days. We therefore took the opportunity to join the rebellion once again, doing our utmost in a series of games. Star Wars Pinball: Rogue One is a great reason to come back again in the company of Jyn Erso and Krennic! The pinball machine is with me Before delving into the dynamics of pinball linked to Rogue One, let's analyze the structure of this new table. Its composition is quite traditional, presenting two rows of lateral lanes on which to travel the marble, with the inevitable series of bumpers in the middle. At the highest point of the pinball machine there are the targets that allow you to activate the various modes, which can be reached in a fairly simple way also thanks to the presence of four wings and a practically symmetrical table structure. The player thus manages to properly control the address of the ball on almost every occasion, taking advantage of the presence of a rather airy central area to score particularly effective shots. At first glance, in terms of difficulty, the table dedicated to Rogue One can therefore be classified as simple, but it must be said that to discover all its secrets you still need to have a good dose of skill. In fact, as you play, you realize that to activate the various modes that Star Wars Pinball: Rogue One has to offer, you need a fair amount of patience and precision, in particular to follow the components dedicated to the story of the film . In fact, the pinball machine is linked to the adventures of Rogue One through ten different missions, starting from Jedha up to the fight with the bad guy Krennic, present as an animated model on the table together with Jyn. Among the various situations that we can find ourselves experiencing during a game there is the combat between aircraft, imperial stormtroopers from which to hide and even mammoth AT-ACTs to face. As far as scores are concerned, the pinball machine is quite generous, giving away millions of points right from the start. Trip to Scarif Among the various settings offered by Rogue One, this pinball machine draws in particular from Scarif, the place of the battle that closes what is told in the film. From a visual point of view, we are now used to great things from the guys at Zen Studios, who also on this occasion do not fall short of expectations. The table lends itself perfectly to the Star Wars experience that the player can expect to live, thanks to the presence of various goodies such as the graphic design of the bumpers, TIE hunting ~clothes~ that emit the classic pew-pew when hit. As already mentioned, Jyn dominates the table on one side and her antagonist Krennic on the other, to whom the developers resort to add animations related to the various modes to the pinball machine. As has happened in other cases, the presence of animations can be a double-edged sword, because the more they are interesting to see (and they are), the more they can end up distracting the player from what is happening on the table. Particular care must therefore be taken not to take your eyes off the marble excessively when there is a skit in progress. The audio sector also follows the tradition, relying on a series of dubbing clips of the protagonists taken directly from Rogue One. The latter are of course in English, in case anyone was asking the question. To close we find an excellent use of the film's soundtrack, including famous notes from the Star Wars saga and ad hoc created melodies that the most avid fans will still be able to recognize. In conclusion, Star Wars Pinball: Rogue One is yet another table guessed by Zen Studios, which for this occasion has preferred to set up a rather traditional experience compared to other releases. The result is a pinball machine that can be enjoyed by all types of players, that is to say both by those looking for a mod in a pinball machineor to have fun instead of being constantly concentrated, and by those who instead want to apply themselves to discover all the secrets it has to offer. The happiest will of course be Star Wars fans, who are being offered an excellent excuse to return once again to experience the adventures of Rogue One after seeing it at the cinema about a couple of months ago.", "date": "2017-02-07", "grade": null}
