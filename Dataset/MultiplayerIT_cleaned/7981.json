Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. Developed out of pure passion by a small independent team and made available for free on the App Store, without IAP or anything else, The Silent Age presents itself as an adventure capable of recreating the typical of the great classics of this vein. The game is set in the early 70s and puts us in the role of Joe, an employee at an important company who responds to the identikit of the perfect ~average man~ but who one day finds himself confronted with an exceptional event, which will change him forever life. His working day begins differently than usual: the colleague with whom he used to chat during breaks seems to have suddenly decided to change the air, but that something is wrong becomes clear when Joe finds small bloodstains on the floor. Determined to find out what is happening, the man reaches one of the most hidden areas of the building and there he finds an elderly man wounded, who before dying gives him a device capable of making the wielder travel through time, and begs him to use it. to save the world from impending disaster. There's little time to think: Joe is found near the body by a security guard and handed over to the police, but it's right in the middle of the interrogation that the device lights up and something bizarre happens: the man is still in the police station. , but there is no one left in the room with him. Indeed, there seems to be no one at all: the corridors are empty, the streets deserted... what happened? It will be up to us to find out, during this ~first episode~ of The Silent Age. Every day arises illogical A finger is enough to control the game, thanks to a decidedly intuitive and immediate interface. You have to tap in front of the character to move to the indicated point, or make quick taps to run. Similarly, it is possible to interact with the scenario by touching the objects that we think we can collect, often and willingly ~highlighted~ in some way. Inventory management is basic, the things we've found around appear at the bottom of the screen and can be used by simply touching their icon and then the object we want to combine them with. In the very early stages of the adventure, for example, we find a magnetic card that can let us access a certain room, but the puzzles soon become a little more complex and we will have to think a little to be able to solve them. The experience always remains on the tracks of simplicity, it never asks us to carry out a powerful backtracking and indeed adopts the traditional method of ~watertight compartments~ to clearly delimit the various phases, which must be ~solved~ independently. The puzzles are therefore all at hand, just figure out what to do and how to do it, acting on the mysterious device to go from 1972 to 2012 in an instant and find yourself in a location that is in many ways different. The point is, however, you can influence the appearance of the scenario by making changes in the present and verifying the consequences in the future, and this element soon becomes a cornerstone of the gameplay. The entire structure is based on a very valid technical sector, characterized by a clean and convincing style, fluid animations (although not particularly numerous, a factor that can often be remedied with some expedient) and a great atmospheric sound accompaniment.", "date": "2013-03-02", "grade": "8.5"}
