{"name": "The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-spyro-a-new-beginning.html", "text": "Once upon a time Krome Studios wanted to start afresh, redefine the terms of Spyro the Dragon both from a narrative point of view and from a gameplay point of view. A New Beginning starts with an animated intro that shows us the kingdom of dragons under siege and the brave Ignitus who takes away one of the ~sacred~ eggs and then entrusts it to the current of a river. The egg is found by a family of dragonflies, who raise the hatching weirdo as one of their own and call it ~Spyro~. After a few years, the purple dragon begins to ask himself legitimate questions about his origins, and so he sets off together with the dragonfly Sparx, his ~brother~, in search of his native land. On his way he finds Ignitus, who tells him that the kingdom of dragons is currently in the hands of the terrible Cinerea and that only the ~dragon of prophecy~ could be right about the evil forces that currently govern that land. So Spyro returns to the teachings of Ignitus and sets out first of all in search of the other three guardian dragons, segregated in different geographical areas, with the aim of facing Cinerea after acquiring new powers and thus freeing his kingdom. Evolution of the species From the early stages of the game, the turnaround implemented by the developers compared to the previous episodes of Spyro the Dragon is clear. If before the emphasis was placed on the exploration phase and on the collection of objects, with a combat system functional to what were the dynamics of the action. Dynamics now revolutionized: the exploration and collection of objects have become ancillary elements that are positioned around the fights, now in the foreground. We were used to a dragon capable of spitting fire and ~charging~ the opponent, while now the possibilities are much wider: a ~paw strike~ has become the basic attack, followed by the fiery breath, the ~charge~ and by a kind of long-range explosive spit. All of them can also be performed while jumping, with a series of even rather elaborate combinations that give life to spectacular combos and ~bullet time~ worthy of a much more serious video game. The big news introduced with A New Beginning is the diversification of the elements that Spyro can use as weapons: it starts with fire, but each of the guardian dragons will teach the protagonist to use his own characteristic element. Eventually we will be able to breathe fire, lightning, ice and earth; and each of these elements will be upgradeable through the collection of special credits. An essential practice, given the level of forces involved. Game structure and technical implementation The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning has a linear connotation, which does not lend itself to sudden twists. Basically, you are faced with short exploratory sections and grueling fights, in which you really face a large number of opponents who don't go down on the first try, on the contrary: you will have to put some effort into even the most trivial enemies . In the fight economy, what we will have to pay attention to is of course the energy bar, but also the bar relating to the element that is ~blown~ (be it fire, lightning, ice or earth) and a third bar that will allow us to launch a very powerful ~smart bomb~ capable of cleaning the screen from any threat, variable according to the element in use but always very spectacular. As far as the technical realization is concerned, the game looks very good: the characters are well drawn and animated, and the locations are quite different from each other. Unfortunately there isn't a great deal of detail and the textures are often too simple, perhaps for a precise choice of style. The graphics engine, however, performs well in any situation and the slowdowns are sporadic, an excellent result taking into account how many and which special effects have been used to represent Spyro's ~special moves~. The sound sector is made up of ups and downs: on the one hand there is only ~sufficient~ and not very original music, on the other a localization in Italian that includes speech and which is very well done, with the only drawback of a mismatch between the character's voice and mouth movement, at least most of the time. Comment If the intention of the developers was to upset the Spyro the Dragon series, the goal has been fully achieved. A New Beginning is very different from what we were used to, and it's about determining whether the change has been a good thing or a bad thing. In terms of thickness and variety, unfortunately, the result is traumatic: the sporadic ~flight sessions~ are not enough to counterbalanceI know of too long and demanding combat sections: performing a combo or two on enemies can be fun, doing it ten times in a row can be tiring. And using moves that are often ineffective against bigger enemies becomes even frustrating. All this does not mean that we are dealing with a poor product, far from it. But the optimization of the gameplay and, above all, the search for a greater variety of situations must be the primary objective of the developers who will take care of bringing Spyro the Dragon to the new consoles. Pros: Excellent technical realization Excellent dubbing in Italian At times very spectacular Cons: Too many fights? Quite difficult Not very varied The legend of Spyro: A new beginning is available for Ps2, Xbox and Gamecube. The tested version is the Gamecube one. It's been quite some time since the first appearance of the little purple dragon, eight years to be exact. In this period of time, the titles of the series have followed one another with a certain punctuality on all gaming systems, bringing their own contribution of solid playability and excellent technical implementation. Now The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning tries to make a change to prepare the ground for the next releases on next-gen consoles, and it does it on GameCube, PS2 and Xbox, a bit like a greeting to old friends from the past. adventure", "date": "2006-11-27", "grade": null}
