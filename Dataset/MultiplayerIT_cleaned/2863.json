{"name": "Genshin Impact", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/genshin-impact-recensione.html", "text": "Before the review of Genshin Impact we had the opportunity to talk about the title on a couple of occasions, just enough to scratch the surface of a game that promised heaven and earth and, in the end, was able to not only keep that promise but also to go one step further beyond expectations. For those who have not heard of it before, it is an action RPG developed by the Chinese studio miHoYo, already author of the successful Honkai Impact 3rd. What makes it different in the first instance compared to other console RPGs we are used to is the question of the gacha mechanics, perhaps the element that most worried players given the prospect of being able to spend to continue. An immersion of more than thirty hours in the magical world of Teyvat has convinced us that there is much more to look forward to in Genshin Impact and that miHoYo's ongoing project has not only started off on the right foot but still has a lot to say for the months to come. History Although it is slow to get going and can be tedious in the very first hours, a stigma that other titles of the same genre do not escape, Genshin Impact presents a more complex story than it might seem. It relies on the most common themes of fantasy but nevertheless presents interesting characters, each immediately recognizable and with dedicated missions that deepen their personality, within the limits that an all in all carefree game like this wants to offer - to be clear, we are not talking about NieR: Automata or, to dig even further into the past, Vagrant Story. It all begins with the battle between the two protagonists, world travelers, and an unspecified entity whose strength far exceeds that of the young heroes: once you decide which one of them to play, the other will be taken prisoner while we will be thrown into another dimension also losing one's ability to move from one reality to another. Precisely we will end up in the varied world of Teyvat, which is the backdrop for the events available so far. Here we meet Paimon, a magical creature that to some might remind the petulant Navi of The Legend of Zelda (and sometimes we are on that level, but the interaction with her is more fun) and together with her we head towards Mondstadt in the hope of have news about our missing twin: from here a series of adventures follow one another involving intrigues, divinities and plots woven in the shadows for purposes yet to be discovered. Nothing good in any case. Genshin Impact offers only a portion of its potentially long-lasting story, composed of the prologue, developed around a series of three acts concerning Mondstadt, and part of the first chapter which instead moves to the adjacent nation, Liyue. Although the narrative is only touched upon at this stage, we are still talking about at least thirty hours to complete it since, unlike other RPGs we might be used to, there is a close relationship between the main story and the game world, so much so that often it will be possible to continue if we have not first increased our Adventure Rank (we will return to this shortly). Overall, the plot certainly does not shine for originality nor does it represent the cornerstone of the experience, however it can also be enjoyed thanks to a considerable amount of content: the lines of dialogue are many, dubbed or not, and the characters start real speeches before to decide what to do. They are not put there just for show. The game world As written above, Genshin Impact is set in Teyvat, a world within which the seven elements flow and converge. Divided into as many great nations, each of which is headed by a specific deity who here takes the name of Archon, the world was shocked by the collapse of an ancient civilization five hundred years before current events. What it led to specifically remains to be discovered, nor will we reveal the details collected so far, but as always happens in this genre of games, the presence of the hero or heroine will be essential to restore balance. Each of the seven nations was designed following a particular theme, from which the architectural style of the capitals and minor villages was then developed: Mondstadt, for example, is inspired by Germany and actually walking around the city one has the feeling of being catapulted into a medieval context very familiar to us. The reference element is the wind. Liyue, on the other hand, has obvious references to China and is blessed by the deity of the earth. The game did not allow us to physically go beyond these two nations but we already know the names of the other five and the reference theme, except for one: Inazuma (Japan), Sumeru (India), Fontainand (France), Natlan (unknown) and Snezhnaya (Russia). However, there is an eighth nation, and with it a reference element, of which, however, we only know the name, Khaen'riah. Teyvat presents itself as an incredibly wide-ranging world, much more inclined for open spaces than for settlements urban areas, except for the capitals, and offers different biomes within which you can do everything: explore, fight, accept missions, collect useful items for crafting or cooking, solve time trials, unlock teleportation points, venture into dangerous domains (the equivalent of dungeons) to obtain increasingly valuable rewards and more. All without any limitation, if not one due to the progress of the plot. For the rest you are free to touch the extremes in complete freedom. You will always find a reason to go a little further, be it a trunk or an offering to donate to the statues of the deity of reference to receive their blessing. Colorful, extensive (and we are talking about only two out of seven nations), challenging if you let your curiosity guide you, Teyvat is a lively and vibrant world that winks at the compulsive explorer inside each of us, inviting us without haste to discover the many secrets that hides. The gacha component Before going into the articulated explanation of the gameplay, a brief reflection on the gacha component of Genshin Impact. The latter is an issue that has raised many doubts among players, accustomed to those experiences where advancement sooner or later involves spending real money, but in this case we reassure you: the game supports itself without the need from you to pay out a single euro, nor does it require an excessive commitment in terms of grinding or farming. Going forward with the main story, sometimes detouring to explore here and there while doing several side missions is enough to continue without particular slowdowns. Furthermore, the possibility of earning in-game currency simply by playing is a further positive factor towards a business model that is anything but aggressive. In our specific case we spent about sixty wishes without paying a penny, and we have several more to express when we feel like doing it, however managing to obtain four characters as well as a fair amount of four-star weapons (out of a maximum of five) . Naturally it will be necessary to verify whether the situation will last in the long term or will prove to be a sort of bait to attract as many players as possible however, also given the presence of rather cheap packages thanks to which to obtain resources, we are inclined to believe that miHoYo does not want to concentrate the experience of obligatory spending. Ultimately, the gacha is not an invasive mechanic and one can easily do without it, to be tried for the sake of it or when we find ourselves with desires to spend: of course, the fact of not being still managed to recruit Jean among our ranks we are a little sorry but hers is not a necessary presence as is not that of the other characters - above all because the protagonist is able to manipulate each of the elements. Not to mention that, with a little patience, it would seem possible to obtain some without necessarily expressing wishes: in the Overview Event menu, in fact, there is the People's Choice section which currently allows you to obtain a four-star character (Xiangling) by completing a specific level of the Spyral Abyss. Since the duration of the event is permanent, it is not clear whether it is an isolated case or over time there will be a rotation of the characters but this is already a small incentive to get busy without finding ourselves opening our wallets. The gameplay Genshin Impact is an action RPG and as such it includes many typical characteristics of the genre: you fight using a team of up to four characters (of which, however, there is only one on the field to be interchanged with the others), there is the management of equipment in terms of weapons and artifacts, the individual skills of the character, the constellations that remotely resemble those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the level up, side missions left and right, etc. etc. Where the plot may not fully convince, the combat system is instead one of the elements, together with exploration, which passes the so-called quality test: we are facing a fairly frenetic hack'n'slash, in which the individual characters master the use of a single weapon - be it a sword, spear, bow, broadsword or an enchanted artifact - and are linked to a single element, unlike the protagonist who can instead exploit them all once unlocked (to do so, however, it is necessaryario interact with the statue of the deity in question). Each has two special abilities linked to the reference element, one to be used at will after the cooldown while the other, much more powerful, linked to the collection of magical energy. The real strength, and weakness, of anyone who wants to engage in combat in that Teyvat is linked to the combination of the elements: everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and it is precisely on the latter that you can leverage to solve even the most challenging clashes in a brilliant and clean way. For example, we can use fire to melt ice enemies and immediately after, having become water, switch to lightning to electrify them a bit, and then return to fire or possibly ice to create specific area effects: based on the elements that you will collide, the outcome will be different in terms of damage and any other disadvantages for the enemy. It therefore goes without saying that, with these premises, creating a homogeneous team capable of handling any situation is essential to proceed with the adventure. It also and above all applies to the domains, before starting which we are explained which are the recommended elements to face it both in terms of combat and of puzzles to solve; this is because Genshin Impact does not lack numerous scattered puzzles related precisely to the use of magic. All Genshin Impact, from the main plot to the domains even to some specific features such as co-op, is hand-in-hand with the Adventure Rank: it is a level progression linked to the single account, which can be increased by doing well or badly any action within the game world. Even just opening chests gives us some adventure experience points, although in much lower quantities than, for example, completing a mission. The Guild of Adventurers exists for the purpose of rewarding us for each new level reached, as well as offering us small missions day after day thanks to which we can obtain a fair number of exp. Most of the domains, from the simplest to the most challenging, are unlocked only once you have reached the right level of Adventure Rank, some items in the shops or requests to the blacksmith follow this concept and even the main story itself has setbacks (the so-called acts) beyond which one can proceed only by satisfying this condition. We found this last choice very interesting to push the player to divide his time between story and exploration, moreover in a rather balanced way, so as not to ignore everything that the first taste of Teyvat has to offer. By balancing your activities, you are unlikely to be that far behind in Adventure Rank before you can move forward with the story. The most critical could consider this solution as a patch for a main story which, if followed without a hitch, would last ten hours or so but we prefer to see it as the will of the developers to present Teyvat in the best possible way. talks about things to do, Genshin Impact does not spare itself by acquiring not only domains, outposts, treasures and so on but also a series of minor narrative arcs dedicated to individual characters. That's right, where many games with gacha mechanics just put them there without a minimum of characterization or development, all those present here are either somehow linked to the main plot or enjoy dedicated missions which in turn are unlocked by increasing the Adventure Rank . A choice that will undoubtedly find the approval of RPG enthusiasts, motivated to persevere to get a certain character. The type of missions varies according to the figure they revolve around: you go from a cooking competition to a much more complex dynamic that takes into consideration an excellent boss fight with a majestic ice wolf. In short, beyond how they are obtained, there is a concrete and valid reason to unlock new teammates. In order not to miss anything, the Adventure Rank also regulates the level up of characters and weapons. The characters level up not by fighting but with the use of special objects capable of offering certain experience points based on the quality of the same; of course, you also earn something by cleaning up a camp or completing missions but it is little stuff compared to what is obtained using the dedicated material, which, moreover, is obtained by raiding trunks or as a reward for assignments of any kind. The AR acts as a level cap, which allows us to initially reach 20, then 40 once we reach an AR of 15 and so on. However, once a level cap is reached, the character needs to ascend to succeed at au", "date": "2020-10-05", "grade": "8.3"}
