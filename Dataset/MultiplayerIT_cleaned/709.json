{"name": "The Sims 2: Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-recensione.html", "text": "Live life Categorizing The Sims (and its sequel) within a pre-established genre is a difficult undertaking, perhaps the most fitting definition could be ~life simulation~, a genre created ad hoc to explain what this Maxis product consists of, the result of a long series of experiments in the strategic-management field that have characterized the various Wright & co. products over the years. always marked with the prefix sim-. After having been mayor of a virtual city, having controlled the progress of natural selection and having observed an active computerized anthill, the time has come to see how humans fare inside the monitor / television. The sims are therefore characters that populate the imaginary world of the game, and over which we have almost complete control. We can direct their lives, choosing for them in almost every aspect of existence, from choosing what to eat for breakfast to the workplace in which to advance their career, while trying to keep the Sims healthy and efficient through the satisfaction of basic needs (eating , sleeping, going to the bathroom) and existential needs (aspirations, dreams, desires). the most fitting definition could be ~life simulation~, a genre created ad hoc to explain what this Maxis product consists of Live life A great responsibility therefore, but also the satisfaction of a secret desire that dwells in all of us, the desire a bit halfway between the voyeur and the omnipotent desire to observe the lives of others, to influence their choices to give a bit of our personality to the virtual alter ego or, on the contrary, push it on completely different paths from the ones we would have chosen to see what can happen: all this finds expression in The Sims 2. Welcome to your new life Once the initial loading is finished, we are immediately faced with a choice, which introduces us to the two fundamental game modes: ~free play~ or ~story~. The latter is the big news of the console version, while the other represents practically the same standard mode of the PC version. By choosing the story mode we move on to the section dedicated to the creation of the sim, a very complete and well done system: after choosing the gender, the physiognomy of the character is created randomly with the immediate construction of a family tree which determines its basic look. Starting from this, we can then further customize the character with a supplied selection of hairstyles, beard and mustache cuts, build, clothes and accessories, all this only with regard to the physical aspect. A further customization concerns the purely character area of the sim, with the various attitudinal choices and aspirations that will characterize his life, up to the zodiac sign, which will influence some behavioral parameters such as ~sympathy~, ~order~ or propensity to socialise. Welcome to your new life Once the creation of our alter ego is complete, the actual game begins. The particularly open structure of The Sims 2 could disorient those who have not played the previous episodes, since we are faced with a game that does not have a clear timeline, with progression through levels and missions, here we are faced with the life of a person, simply. The objectives to be completed will be marked by the wishes and aspirations of the protagonist, and will vary from the simple purchase of a new bed, to knowing how to paint a picture or finding a job as a doctor. Time will flow inexorably and we will find ourselves on the one hand keeping the Sim in good physical condition, making him eat, sleep and go to the bathroom, and on the other hand trying to make him live the life he would like, in a social, emotional and economic. The control over the characters takes place through an exhaustive interface and is distinguished in two different modes: the classic one, derived directly from the PC version with the analog stick to take the place of the mouse and the new one, created specifically for consoles, which ensures control of the sim by moving it directly through the same stick. The great variety of actions available are in a certain sense context-sensitive, i.e. they will depend on the situation in which you find yourself and on the people or objects you are facing, and range from watching television, repairing a sink or cooking something eat. Standing in front of an object or a character and pressing the ~action~ key, a list of possible actions appears to choose from, which allow for a truly remarkable variety of situations. Welcome to your new life The actions carried out are reflectedin the behavior of the sim and in the development of the game: if they are compatible with the wishes and well-being of the character, they translate into a good state of mind and the earning of some particular points, which can be used to buy various objects that serve as furnishings for the house and from reassurance of the owner. Most of the game time will be spent in ~lots~, or areas of interest in which the action takes place, within the buildings that can be visited, among which the sim's own home is of particular importance. Taking care of the house is an aspect that requires a lot of commitment from the player, who will often have to provide for the cleaning and correct functioning of all the services, as well as any expansions, new furnishings and various renovations. Going back to the beginning of the game, the ~free play~ mode is based on the same structure described above but follows the classic approach of the game, with complete freedom as regards the creation of the Sims to follow, and, if desired, the possibility to build the house they will live in from scratch, starting from the floor and walls up to the interior finishes. The Sims 2 light There are some differences that distinguish the PC version of The Sims 2 from this one for consoles, and that suggest a lightening of the game structure for a more carefree audience. First of all, the already mentioned ~story~ mode has been inserted, which allows a more user-friendly introduction to the dynamics of the game, with identification with a single character (at least in the early stages) and a series of gradual explanations on what to do which unfold as a sort of in-game tutorial, a much softer approach than the one obtained by selecting the ~free play~ mode and creating sims and a house from scratch. Then, one of the innovative features that distinguished the PC version of this second chapter from the first was eliminated: the temporal progression. In the computer version the sims lived a real life, characterized by growth, aging, reproduction and death, thus placing constraints on the objectives to be pursued which, given the transience of the characters, had to be completed within a maximum time. In the console version, however, we have returned to the timelessness of the first episode, with the hours passing and the days passing without the sims undergoing any aging process, freeing the player from temporal constraints but in fact freezing the game in a prolonged moment endlessly. The Sims 2 light As in the PC version, The Sims 2 differs from its predecessor in the use of fully 3D graphics, whereas for the first an isometric 2D setting was chosen. As a result, we have the possibility to rotate and zoom freely on the playing area by choosing at any time the shot that best suits us, from a ~bird's eye view~ to the closest one behind the shoulders of the currently controlled sim, even if you often find yourself having to constantly change shot given the visual angle which tends to never be too exhaustive. The control system has been adapted to the joypad, allowing the choice between traditional pointer control, with the analog stick to simulate the mouse and the new system with direct control of the sims through the movements of the same stick. Given the evident superiority of the mouse as regards the traditional type of control, the best choice falls on the new method of movement, even if, despite an initial feeling of freedom in being able to move the characters in a more instinctive way, soon certain imprecision in the interaction with the surrounding environment, given the perfect alignment that the sim must have with the object we intend to use. However, this is a minor issue in the generally excellent adaptation work done for the interface of this console version. A completely new addition in this version is the possibility of creating more or less elaborate recipes and dishes starting from the ingredients present in the refrigerator of one's home. The previously automatic action of cooking has turned into a sort of subgame in which it is possible to indulge oneself by transforming into a chef and creating an enormous quantity of different dishes with the ingredients that will gradually be added to the food reserve present in the kitchen. These recipes can be learned by spending time reading newspapers or dedicating themselves to some other action intended to increase the knowledge of the character, or created from scratch by trying to mix the ingredients in an experimental way. The results are the most varied, and can lead to particular dishes with energetic or aphrodisiac powers, e.gparticularly recommended for those who intend to pursue a career as a playboy. The dialogue system between the various sims has also been particularly expanded in the console game, in an attempt to give greater depth to interpersonal relationships. The possibilities of the various topics and attitudes to choose during the direct relationship with the other sims have definitely increased, with a particular close-up shot that comes into action when the dialogue begins and highlights all the various animations and expressions assumed from the characters. It is also true that this aspect still has ample room for improvement, with a management of emotions that is still a little too simplified which leads the sims to fall in love or hate each other at an impressive speed, despite the undeniable care placed in the attempt to simulate the networks real interpersonal. The various versions The Sims 2 is a multiplatform title, therefore it is available for all the various consoles on the market: Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Gamecube. There are no substantial differences between the various versions, except for a certain graphical superiority in the one dedicated to the Microsoft console. More defined textures and a greater graphic cleaning make The Sims 2 for Xbox slightly superior, from a visual point of view, to the other versions which however are almost identical in terms of the actual game. Comment The Sims 2 can be absolutely addictive, however, after the excellent initial impact, the absence of any real progression in the game begins to make you think that everything boils down to a non-stop race to satisfy the sim's needs. in an attempt to square all the positive values. The decision to remove the age factor and aging in this console version is also somewhat dubious, because it only makes the claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in an ~eternal instant~ worse. Ultimately, The Sims 2 relies on the one hand on the voyeuristic pleasure of observing the lives of others, on the other hand on the desire for omnipotence, in being able to influence them: all this translates into an aesthetic contemplation of the lives of the Sims as it can be comes from the vision of a beautiful aquarium. If the idea appeals to you, or if you are a fan of the first episode, The Sims 2 is a must buy even on consoles, otherwise take a look at it first because it could tire you much sooner than you might imagine, while remaining a rather successful attempt to repurpose the complexity of real life into a video game. Pros The closest thing to a life simulation on the gaming market Intuitive and functional interface You will immediately immerse yourself in the world of the Sims... Cons ...but you might soon get out of it if you are looking for something deeper Camera system often inadequate Control system awkward and inaccurate mouse-like Video game experiments In 1986 Activision had a really interesting idea, to offer to a still largely immature gaming public in terms of diversification of experiences in the field of gameplay. There were already flight, driving and war simulators, what would it have been like to simply reproduce life on the screen of home computers? Little Computer People allowed the player to control, or rather observe, the lives of small characters living under one roof. The AI was still pretty raw and the interface allowed for somewhat limited interaction, but the idea had been floated and would later be picked up by Will Wright and Maxis who came up with The Sims in 2000 and its sequel in 2004. official game (after a long series of expansions and various add-ons), which has only recently arrived on consoles.", "date": "2005-12-09", "grade": null}
