{"name": "Gladius", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gladius_a.html", "text": "The force is with you, gladiator It has been known for some time that George Lucas's software house was capable of producing titles not necessarily related to the Star Wars universe or point-and-click adventures. And it should therefore come as no surprise that this Gladius was created under this very label, an original and interesting strategic RPG set - as you can easily guess - in the age of the gladiators. The long wave of Ridley Scott's film, which consecrated the talent of the excellent Russel Crowe, therefore had a fundamental influence on the artistic vein of American programmers, who tried to set up one of the many points of detachment from the aforementioned classics of the genre. The aim of the game is in fact to follow the exploits of a young gladiator (or of a charming barbarian girl, choosing the easy difficulty level) through a series of clashes in real arenas, complete with actively participating audiences. Of course, not alone; in fact, the narrative plot wants the protagonist to be intent on building a school for gladiators, with the intention of starting from amateurism to see it establish itself in the end as the best in the region. Traveling along the kingdom and visiting the different cities it is in fact possible to hire, temporarily or indefinitely, the ~free~ wrestlers, in order to use them as support during battles. The towns, in addition to the place in which to gather new students, actually represent the focal point of most of Gladius's play offer: in fact, the vast majority of tournaments and competitions on which the mechanics of Lucasarts production revolve . Everything unfolds via the menu: once you have crossed the game map on foot (in perfect Final Fantasy style) and reached the friendly walls, in fact, you will be given the opportunity to choose between a handful of competitions, in turn divided into a variable number of challenges to be tackled often in the order you prefer. If in the first cities the entrance to most of the battles is free and without particular limitations, continuing in the game you will often have to deal not only with entrance fees, but also with prohibitions on using, for example, a specific class of warriors. Yes because, as in any self-respecting strategic RPG, gladiators differ from each other in terms of characteristics, skills and weapons in their possession. Furthermore, users of white weapons are also distinguished by ~tonnage~: a factor, this, which does not resolve in a mere aesthetic variation, but which on the contrary also determines effectiveness ratios in direct clashes in a similar way to the classic ~rock paper scissors . To this kind of gladiators are added support classes, such as spearmen or even animals, summoners, archers, amazons, bandits and so on. A certainly appreciable variety, and which is also expressed in the actual attack phase; in fact, one of the major peculiarities of Gladius is undoubtedly the control system, especially when hitting the opponents. In fact, on this occasion, the programmers decided to liven up and make such a purely strategic phase more dynamic by subordinating the effectiveness of their shots to the correct pressing of the key during the loading phase of a special bar. In a very similar way to the archaic Track'n Field, or to golf games, once you decide to attack an opponent, the aforementioned bar will load quickly, leaving the player with the task of interrupting his run in the small sector capable of churning out a slash to great effect. An early pressure, and the result will be absolutely normal, while a delayed one will generate a tap with reduced effectiveness to say the least. This solution finds a further expansion on the occasion of special attacks, for which different pressures are required or perhaps the creation of real combos in the shortest possible time. Modulation The development of the characters and their level growth, obviously linked to the experience gained in battle, also has a double purpose: in addition to increasing the statistics, it makes available a certain number of work points, which represent the fundamental bargaining chip to ensure let the gladiators learn new moves and skills. Among these, magical attacks, defensive moves but above all combinations of attacks, essential for establishing yourself in the most demanding battles. The idea of inserting a variable such as that of the public, and the influence that this can have on one's group, is very interesting. A conduct of battle pparticularly spectacular or based on special hits, in fact, it determines greater support from the public, who will therefore incite their favorites with renewed vigor. Earning the favor of those present has the concrete advantage of an increase in statistics, or a greater possibility of scoring critical hits. There is also the option to enhance your athletes by purchasing weapons, armor and accessories in shops; in this sense, the visual feedback that each object has on the appearance of the gladiator is appreciable. Everything perfect then? Not exactly. Unfortunately Gladius is an extremely ambitious product, but one that fails to fully convince due to a series of aspects that undoubtedly deserved more attention. First of all, the Lucasarts production runs the risk of quickly becoming repetitive even for the most ardent fans of the genre: entering a city and starting to face its battles means in most cases carrying out a long series of clashes within the same, identical and limited setting. In fact, each location has its own arena, within which all the fights take place; in fact, despite the different enemies and the game conditions, often everything is resolved in going on the attack of the opponents trying to eliminate them before they eliminate us. The possibility of exploiting the conformation and elements of the arenas is foreseen, but far too marginal to represent a true cornerstone of the game. To this must be added a really, really slow plot development: the feeling, not too veiled, is that the programmers wanted to forcibly expand the total number of hours necessary to complete Gladius, inserting too many battles equal to each other whose overcoming is often inevitable. To this must be added a sometimes confusing and unclear menu structure, often a source of frustration for less patient players. Far from venial sins therefore, which partially compromise anything else good that has been studied by the team of programmers. Among these, there is undoubtedly the aesthetic component: even without making people cry for a miracle, the title is in fact well done, with a particularly appreciable style and a decidedly valid level of detail. The sound, on the other hand, is rather limited, with minimal effects and certainly not unforgettable music. Comment Gladius is undoubtedly a good starting point, as well as a very interesting western experiment in a genre that has always been dominated by Japanese products. Nonetheless, the Lucasarts production probably lacks inexperience and ingenuity, revealing itself in some respects as decidedly improvable: a marked repetitiveness, an enormous slowness in the narration and the excessive cumbersomeness of the menus are the errors on which the team will have to work, in whether a sequel is being considered. Which would be really welcome, since even so, even with its flaws, Gladius is a product that lovers of the genre should seriously consider. Pros: game structure full of original ideas great depth respectable technical aspect Cons: narration too slow global length forcibly diluted risks becoming repetitive soon Thinking of strategic RPGs on consoles, it is natural to recall great masterpieces such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Vandal Hearts, Front Mission coincidentally, all Japanese productions. Being able to find a noteworthy title belonging to this vein, and packaged far from the land of the rising sun, is really a difficult undertaking. And if you think about it, the reason is not at all mysterious: who would be brave enough  or reckless  to challenge the Japanese in a territory where they have always reigned supreme, mostly in a clearly niche video game genre?
