Tour de France 2023, will bring the stages, climbs, rivalries and sweat of the Grande Boucle into the homes of all cycling fanatics with better artificial intelligence for managing opponents and a more defined and understandable system for consuming and recovering 'power. Forget the screaming graphics of other more famous sports simulators, this game aims to replicate first of all the strategy, tension and precise fatigue management that professionals must have in order to wear the yellow jersey. Developed by Cyanide Studio and published by Nacon, Tour de France 2023 is a no-nonsense game made for a very specific audience: cycling fans. After having competed in the Pyrenees and along the Champs-lyses, however, we can tell you that, having overcome an initial linguistic barrier made up of French terms and specific vocabulary, even a novice of this world will find in the game a fairly comfortable access ramp to the world of elite cycling. In this review of Tour de France 2023 we will tell you about the structure of the experiences and the improvements made compared to previous versions, explaining how the title manages to perfectly encapsulate both the peace and the adrenaline of a complex and multifaceted cycling race like the Tour de France. Tour de France 2023 is designed for passionate cyclists Tour de France 2023 manages to digitally recreate the tension that reigns during a race Anyone who follows stage races such as the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France or the Vuelta a Espaa knows that their charm lies in an almost alchemical mix of strategy, teamwork, individual physical strength and endurance. The video game we are telling you about manages to recreate this adrenaline-pumping cocktail almost perfectly. If we were to analyze the individual elements of this smoothie, however, several of the most obvious flaws of the 2023 Tour de France would emerge because team communications are limited and the automatisms don't always bring the desired results. In addition, there is a clear disparity in the performance of cyclists with higher recovery than all other statistics. The flaws, however, disappear when we look at the overall experience. What the Tour de France 2023 does well is immerse the player in a storm of seemingly insignificant decisions at the time, but with an unpredictable impact over the course of a 150km stage . Is it better to push up a hill and take the extra points or keep the stamina for the final straight? Is it better to stay in the queue and recover your strength by exploiting the slipstream of a teammate or to push like crazy to separate yourself from the group and not risk a crash in the tightest corners? As professional cyclists have repeatedly said throughout their careers ~these questions are answered only up to a certain point~. Each stage has pitfalls and surprises and not every digital cyclist can excel in everything. Cyanide has done a good job of creating a balanced ecosystem that makes players feel like they almost always have a chance of winning if they play their cards right. How a cyclist works In the Tour de France 2023, managing blue and red energies in the best possible way is the key to not finding yourself exhausted in the final sprint Making all these decisions would be a nightmare if there were more than five variables because the combinations and repercussions would be too many. Fortunately, the system created by Cyanide has only three: the blue bar, the red bar and your driving style. The first represents the overall energy of the cyclist, the one that allows him to accelerate, downshift and keep pushing during a stage. The second is his stamina, the brute strength of when he jumps up on the pedals to push in the last few meters before a finish line. The blue bar can be recovered on descents while the red one fills up slowly automatically, both can then be restored manually using the two water bottles (one for each colour) available to the cyclist. The driving style is very easy to master and the trajectory line on the asphalt will tell you when you are going too fast. The brake button on the controller is very sensitive and pressing it all the way down will almost always make you crash so learning to dose it is essential, especially on descents, when you need to get into an aerodynamic position to recover energy. A variable that affects only when the level of difficulty becomes very high, then, is the wind both in the form of the gusts that can arrive during a stage and in the complex wake and group dynamics that the game does not explain very well and you have toreverse engineer with experience. In a nutshell, depending on your position at the top of the peloton, behind a single rider or in the middle of the peloton, your energy consumption changes because in addition to the slope you will also have to counteract the resistance of the wind. Two things have slightly puzzled us about the Cyanide cycling experience, but both have a very simple solution. The first is the public: their cheering chants enrich the experience and are also in many different languages (French, English, German, Spanish and Italian) to represent the entire spectrum of the cycling public. The problem is that there are 25 sentences in total, five per language, and they are hammered into the player's head for the duration of almost every stage. Fortunately, the volume of the public is an adjustable and even resettable parameter even if we would have preferred a greater variety or a lower frequency of these incitements. The other thing that bugged us is the robotic commentary that accompanies the rides. The sentences are poorly linked together, not very varied and sporadic with very little information on what other cyclists are doing. In the calmer moments we would have liked to hear some curiosities about the race or the cyclists or the place we were crossing and instead we remain in total silence. Great rides for great riders There is no shortage of variety in the Tour de France 2023 because not only are there all 21 official stages of the Tour but also other cycling monuments such as Lige-Bastogne-Lige or Paris-Roubaix Being a licensed sports video game, Tour de France 2023 can count on a large catalog of routes that wind through five mountain ranges (Pyrenees, Massif Central, Massif du Jura, Alps and Vosges) divided into 70 stages. The most important teams and more than 800 cyclists from all over the world could not be missing, each with 13 different statistics and a specialization divided between sprinter, climber, master of the hills and hybrid. All these numbers, then, are the backbone of the different game modes available within the Tour de France 2023. In addition to the most iconic race on the calendar, in fact, there are two other career modes: one dedicated to the team and one to the individual cyclist. The first takes full advantage of the fellow game of TDF 2023 or Pro Cycling Manager 2023 and allows you to manage a team of cyclists, while the other is the classic climb from the lowest leagues of international cycling to the yellow jersey. We have found this game mode particularly useful not only for those looking for a personal and immersive experience but also for anyone who wants to fully understand the deep team strategies at play during cycling competitions. In fact, by making a career as a single cyclist, you will start not as a super promising youngster aiming for victory in his debut year but as a follower, or rather a rider whose placement and performance serve to protect the owner's climb to victory. Your goal will be to improve more and more and become the top cyclist of a team with which to aim for victory. Here you will study the importance of intermediate placements, points in the mid-stage climbs and the management of the seconds of advantage or disadvantage over a race that lasts three weeks. Also be prepared to invest quite a bit of time in improving this game not only in terms of the learning curve which, after a soft start, becomes quite steep, but also in terms of time because the longer stages can get even asking you for a yarn play hour. Competitive ambitions The asynchronous competitive mode of the Tour de France 2023 is fun but inevitably leaves you unsatisfied due to its shallow depth Tour de France 2023 also has an asynchronous multiplayer mode based on the best times in what the game calls Challenges of the Moment. This year's edition, in addition to the classic time trial races, also has a mode dedicated to descents, a part of this game that is underestimated and poorly explained in the tutorials. The descent, in fact, has its own dynamics in controlling the bike and managing energy recovery, all factors that were not studied in depth which, in the first few races, cost us precious seconds. Leaderboards will then be drawn up every week, every month, and every year, and the most dedicated players will be able to destroy their digital calves to find their name at the top. Competing every week will give advantages in the final score multiplier of each race therefore, as in real cycling, the developers have decided to reward the perseverance of the most passionate. Given the eminently multiplayer nature of the Tour de France we are sorry not to see aa real multiplayer mode to race against other human cyclists. We understand the population problems but putting a single stage every day and finding 40 or 50 players doesn't seem like such an unattainable undertaking given the not insignificant numbers of the previous titles. There is also a system that equalizes runners and equipment for all players in order to have balanced competition. We hope to see this feature implemented in future editions but it is unlikely.", "date": "2023-05-20", "grade": "7.5"}
