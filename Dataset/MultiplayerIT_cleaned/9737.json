{"name": "La guerra non  finita", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81411-medal-of-honor-la-guerra-non-e-finita.html", "text": "Tested version: PCWe left Medal of Honor hanging from a parachute three years ago in the skies of Europe in the middle of World War II with Airborne, a title that between strengths and many weaknesses had the courage to modernize the gameplay with an unprecedented approach ~ free~ to the missions, this year there is a decisive return to classicism, that is linearity and script, albeit in a context, that of the conflict in Afghanistan which has returned to dramatic relevance in recent days. Danger Close, the internal team of EA who has dedicated himself completely to the single player campaign, has positioned the ten missions that make up the game in the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom, so we are talking about the end of 2001, the beginning of 2002, in a lapse of time, if we exclude the initial prologue, of only two days, with a very tight temporal scan, in which we follow the actions of the Tier 1 special forces for almost the entire time. The latter represents the warrior elite of the army of the United States United, men used to fighting alone behind enemy lines, versed in acts of sabotage and infiltration, and as the title will show us several times, decisive for the designation of targets to bomb. However, the perspective is multiple: in some missions we will also play the Rangers, therefore we will have a type of gameplay more similar in some ways to the canons of the series, with large numbers of the army in the field, not just a few - and silent - special units, while the only concession to the smashing show, a real duty to pay on the altar of realism sought by American boys, is when we get on board an Apache, probably the weakest part of the game, and frankly avoidable. Brothers in arms The title offers missions in which the actions of one group fall directly on those of the other, or rather the achievement of a common goal is told through two different points of view, in which the sequentiality is also strengthened by the fact that we often see , perhaps from a long distance, our companions, this is a sign of a probable change of protagonists on the scene. Therefore, being almost in the presence of the three Aristotelian unities of time, place and action, which castrate the game on the side of the variety of settings, the rhythm and goodness of the staging must make up for this deficiency, and luckily for us Danger's work Close is undoubtedly excellent. By choosing the Afghan setting, the developers have taken an impervious road, because despite having truly successful events behind them, and trusting in the collaboration of those who have actually been on the battlefield, they have effectively kicked out the real protagonist of titles such as first Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, or rather History, the one with a capital S, and which managed to fill the void of a narrative that only served as a common thread between the various topical moments of the Second World War phases. From this point of view, only Brothers in Arms has tried to get away from this setting, recounting both the final stages of the war in Europe and the life of the soldiers, their hopes, their thoughts, their mood. To the epic nature of a landing in Normandy, or the assault on the Reichstag Danger Close, not being able to contrast historical moments of battle, given that the war is still ongoing, but above all because the conflict is too controversial for us to give birth to a solid epic , made the wise choice to make us protagonists of ~small~ operations, and to put us always and constantly in danger, binding the lives of the various special forces operators together, making us part of ~a family~, a sensation also corroborated by cutscene in which the field commander argues bitterly with the general in suit 150,000 miles away, guilty of not understanding or not wanting to understand the real needs of the soldiers. The epicity is therefore given not by pyrotechnic explosions, by gigantic invasion scenes or by adrenaline chase scenes, present moments anyway, but by the sense of brotherhood, which emerges between the various Tier 1s. constant radio chatting at most there is room for a quick joke, the men who fight (we always have two/four companions behind us) are not simple mannequins moved by artificial intelligence exempt from friendly fire, but they are companions to all effects, and the dramatic final crescendo, increasingly epic and poignant, confirms it. Starting from the second day, almost everything will go wrong, there is no hope of victory, there are no flags to plant, nor statues in the square to be torn down, but only the dead to mourn and possibly avenge. In short, an American war video game is rarely stacted so ~un-American~ and anti-rhetorical, the power of the war machine is indeed shown in all its spectacularity, there is no lack of ground-guided air support, but more generally there is an extremely realistic air, credible in staging the stories of men always on the verge of dying, who do their job and that's it answering only to themselves, trying only to save the skin of their companions. Perfect balance Pad in hand, all of this translates into missions which, while not taking us around the world, and almost always remaining anchored to the rugged Afghan mountains, manage to never be boring, alternating ~stealth~ phases with more ~explosive~ ones, with sudden gameplay changes, never in watertight compartments. There's the whole repertoire of titles of this genre, frontal assaults on well-fortified bases, urban combat, night infiltration, long moonlit picnics on quad bikes, demanding sniping sessions a kilometer away, and the ever-present C- 130 with which to hammer the Taliban, Medal of Honor does not invent anything, but manages to create an almost perfect alchemy, with very few phases of tiredness, also thanks to a decidedly well-implemented level design, full of shelters and places to hide (inserted for this the slide to quickly reach the cover), despite a marked linearity and scripting. It would seem like a perfect title, but this reboot of the series is certainly not without its flaws. The first, what is now a true trademark of all war FPS of recent years, is its brevity. Five hours, albeit very intense and beautiful to play, are objectively too small a quantity, also in light of the fact that the type of gameplay would certainly not invite you to replay it just for the sake of trying a different approach to the action. Furthermore, the title should only be played on a difficult level, medium is really too easy, you die only in those moments in which, and they are quite frequent, the enemies take you from behind, but not for their own tactical initiative, but because they appear in a point it should be safe, which is similar to cheating. Secondly, the artificial intelligence of the enemies oscillates between the basic and the stunned: they get up and down from cover, they have good aim, but there has never been concerted movements to take the player from behind, and despite their ~fixity ~ sometimes they have the bad habit of looking for the center of the scene, with the only result of being covered in lead. On the other hand, that of our comrades is of a completely different kind, who always return fire, do not suffer from particular pathfinding problems and often and willingly manage to bail us out in the most agitated moments. A far from perfect campaign, with a couple of rather heavy structural flaws, but which manages to involve the player, and to be remembered in the months to come. Tier 1 In addition to the single player campaign, we find the inevitable range of multiplayer possibilities. In addition to the real multiplayer game, Danger Close has included the Tier 1 online mode, which sees us replay the missions inserted, however, in an ~arcade~ context in which the final score is based on the time taken (we have a par in minutes for each level ), and our skill with the rifle. In practice, each headshot, melee shot, close-range killstreak subtracts a certain number of seconds from the final calculation, from two to five seconds. Once the level is over, you enter the classic final in which, in addition to the prize medal, it is possible to keep an eye on a whole series of statistics such as the kill from the greatest distance, killing with bare hands and with grenades and so on. We are invited to replay the game over and over again to climb the rankings, with some limitations, however, compared to the main campaign: there is no possibility of resupplying from your companions, which is fundamental given that the caliber of the bullets is not the same for all weapons , consequently it is always better to keep the starting ones, also because in view of the realism sought by the developers those of the enemies are not technologically advanced and do not have support optics. Furthermore, there are no crosshairs or danger indicators, each session must be completed by pushing continuously without ever dying, and the difficulty level seems to be the highest. You can't waste time behind cover, you have to be quick and above all infallible, knowing how to use the slide well to get as close as possible to the enemies, either to facilitate the headshot or for instant killing with bare hands. In practice, the approach to the game changes which becomes hardcore, you play decidedly more attentive and less relaxed, Tier 1 so it worksna as an alternative mode to the short single player, it being understood that it may not be of interest to everyone, offering an approach intended, but not something tangibly different from the main campaign. The normality of multiplayer On the multiplayer side, as everyone knows by now, Danger Close has given way to DICE (the team behind the Battlefield series), who have left their mark both visually and from a gameplay point of view. The graphic detachment between the two sectors is immediately noticeable, the Swedish team has implemented its proprietary engine, the Frostbite version 1.5 instead of the Unreal Engine, used however keeping in check its peculiar characteristic, the complete destructibility of the environment, seen that Medal of Honor cannot be a Bad Company clone, and that here it is limited to those parts of the scenario that can be torn apart by virtue of the developers' upstream choices, such as fences, sandbags and so on, as well as some sections that are important to game progression, such as fortifications, gates, etc. The maximum number of players who can participate in the battles is twenty-four, distributed over eight maps for four main game modes, to which is added the hardcore one, in which no help is present on the screen, where you die with one shot. The impression we had returning to play against human opponents did nothing but confirm the recent sensations found in the long test directly in the DICE studios in Stockholm, and that is good steps forward compared to the not very exuberant PlayStation 3 beta this summer, confirmed by that PC now running. Of the four types of game, the most peculiar is certainly Combat Mission, which has the advantage of wanting to link the different objectives within the huge maps in a narrative context, or rather to give a logical link to the different moments of attack and defense. It works and entertains, with a slower and more ~reasoned~ pace than the others. On the other hand, those looking for a more frenetic and conventional action can play, in addition to the classic deathmatch, Sector Control and Objective Raid, with smaller maps, vehicles and more generally a nice level design to enhance the various classes available to the player, which they can evolve by acquiring new weapons, gadgets, bonuses and various optics, with an experience system similar to the big guns in the sector. For a complete examination of the multiplayer part map by map, our advice is to read the full-bodied test, but ultimately the sensations had remain the same, or rather an ~average~ game offer, which is ideally positioned between Modern Warfare and Bad Company, and for this very reason it could make fans of both turn up their noses, but which at the end of the day works, even without the fireworks of the other DICE and Infinity Ward productions. Technical part From a cosmetic point of view, the work done by Danger Close and DICE is certainly of a high level, and both offer a good impact, capable of sending breathtaking views to the screen, especially in the single player campaign, in which you are practically always in high mountains, immersed in the dense bush or in the impervious paths at high altitudes. More generally, the game succeeds very well in recreating a credible and realistic battlefield, acting as a perfect counterpart to the adult and painful attitude of the two days of the main mode; Danger Close in this sense has been impeccable in staging truly epic and dramatic moments, thrilling us and fully immersing us in the action without exceeding in explosions and fireworks. There is no shortage of excellent special effects, particles abound, especially in Ranger missions, and HDR blinds us when we finally manage to reach the top of the mountains, making us tremble when a black figure stands out against the sun armed with RPGs. In reference to the story mode, the detail of the companions is really high, just as the animations are good, a little fluctuating instead of textures and modeling of the seabed, which still stand on a good level without ever excelling. Having tried the game on PC, many of the perplexities about DICE's work have definitely diminished compared to what was experienced a short time ago on the console and, more importantly, we have not witnessed textures mixed on the more distant elements of the background, which makes the engagements from much easier distance, being able to make the most of the painstaking level design fielded by the Swedish developers.", "date": "2010-10-12", "grade": "8.5"}
