{"name": "Spidey  tornato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105312-the-amazing-spider-man-spidey-e-tornato.html", "text": "The Amazing Spider-Man, the new film starring the most famous web-slinger of comics, was received amid much controversy and perplexity, above all because honestly, a reboot was not really felt, considering the relative youth of Sam Raimi's trilogy . But Hollywood has decided that way and we can't do anything about it: away with the good Tobey McGuire then, and way to the equally good Andrew Garfield (The Social Network); via Sam Raimi and camera on his shoulder, so to speak, to Marc Webb, that with that surname it would have been the worst to make a mistake. Predictable, then, the typical video game tie-in, as for any self-respecting big film, but the result is a little less obvious: those who expected an opprobrium like many other tie-ins, could be pleasantly surprised. Sure, the standard of Spidey's videogame adventures has recently dropped a bit and it's perfectly normal to hold the joypad with ill-concealed prudence, but how can you resist the temptation to twirl around Manhattan comfortably sunk in your armchair at home? My name is Peter Parker... The Amazing Spider-Man is a true sequel to the film that will be released in theaters worldwide in a few days, this means that if you haven't seen it yet when you start the game for the first time, there will be no more in theaters twists to gape your mouth. In case you have been living in suspended animation for the last sixty years, we specify that the young Peter Parker assumed the secret identity of Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically modified spider that gave him incredible powers among which a real sixth sense and extraordinary physical abilities. Since Peter is also a bit of a genius, just to please he has built devices that allow him to shoot cobwebs with which to move or capture the bad guys. In this adventure, Peter is grappling with a viral infection caused by the same experiments that transformed Dr. Kurt Connors into the abominable Lizard: to resolve the situation, Spidey will have to resort to risky help, to say the least, fighting mutants, robots and pickpockets. A decent dose of fanservice is also inevitable, in the form of costumes and characters that comics lovers will know well: the Black Cat, Rhyno, the Scorpion, Vermin and other archenemies with a new design more in line with the atmospheres of the film play the role of bosses and supporting characters and it is possible to collect special costumes hidden in the most remote corners of Manhattan to make Spider-Man wear the classic colors, of the Future Foundation, of the 2099 series and so on, which however get ruined and deteriorate as they gets injured. On the other hand, the adherence to cinematographic sources leaves a little dumbfounded, with a Gwen Stacy and a Kurt Connors not exactly identical to Emma Stone or Rhys Ifans; on the other hand, we will never see Spiderman's face: in the few cutscenes in which Peter doesn't wear the costume, the first person shot prevents us from seeing the polygonal features of Andrew Garfield, probably in a clumsy metavideoloudic attempt to lower the player himself completely in the role of the Arrampicamuri. After all, the entire technical framework is made up of ups and downs: between a splendid use of blur and plays of light and a few episodes of tearing and bad clipping, a frame rate that is not always stable and some textures that are a bit out of place pass; the whole soundtrack of the film is seasoned, very beautiful, for heaven's sake, but not always apt to what happens on the screen and made up of a few tracks that are repeated for the entire duration of the adventure. Web Swing! But honestly very few will play The Amazing Spider-Man for the story, which is quite predictable and botched; the question that in all likelihood whirls in the minds of Spider-Man fans is only one: do cobwebs work well? In an attempt to bring the brand back to a semblance of free roaming, we can say that the developer Beenox has managed to develop the mechanics of the webs in a more than satisfactory way, while not reaching the freedom and technique of titles such as Spider-Man: Web of Shadows. The structural complexity offered by new technologies has forced some compromises and traveling with cobwebs is now a little more automatic than in the past, which on the other hand prevents the occurrence of bugs or other problems caused by a possible excess of freedom . The player sprays the canvas by pressing a back button and the impetus offered by the swing allows the development of incredible aerial acrobatics that make the tens of meters covered with a single leap spectacular; to another dorsal key is instead relegated the technique of the ~shot of ragno~, in two variants: the first, which can be performed with a slight pressure, allows Spider-Man to instantly approach the target aimed at the moment of shooting; the second, however, occurs by pressing the button more deeply and involves a temporary slowdown of the time during which it is possible to view all the grab points in the field of vision: at that point, just release the button to immediately go to the desired position, perhaps to escape an enemy in a specific direction or gain a better vantage point. Finally, spider escape is a maneuver that allows you to move away instantly with a leap backwards, excellent for escaping the attentions of enemies. The combination of these techniques, jumping, running and sticking skills allows you to explore this convincing reproduction of Manhattan far and wide: despite the absence of real interaction points that motivate movement and a realistic reconstruction like the one that a latest generation Grand Theft Auto could offer, soon moving around the city becomes a source of great entertainment, especially if you decide to hunt down the seven hundred pages of comics scattered practically everywhere, on the roofs and in the alleys , on poles and in the middle of Central Park. These goodies allow you to unlock real comic books to read in the comic menu and represent a more than valid incentive to complete the game completely, but we found it a bit frustrating to search far and wide for them or stop constantly during a journey to locate the exact position of the closest page, fix the camera and finally recover it; however, completionists will get their money's worth and if the pages alone aren't enough, there are several other activities that can keep them busy, at least for a while. Playstation 3 trophies There are 47 Trophies to unlock and for Platinum you must first get 33 Bronze, 11 Silver and 2 Gold. It goes without saying that you will have to complete all the missions, collect each page and solve some fights in a more particular way than usual. Arkham City Docet It is clear that the guys from Beenox were largely inspired by the award-winning Batman: Arkham City, in fact there are many points of contact between the two titles. The main objective of the player will be to reach some points on the map to undertake the missions through which the story will develop, often connected to the exploration of an internal setting such as a laboratory or a sewer or to a fight with more or less gigantic bosses . Alternatively, the game soon disseminates various secondary missions around the map that can be undertaken in any order: the variety is not lacking and you can try your hand at acrobatic competitions, crime fights, timed challenges, infiltration missions and so on. Once you have obtained the camera, you can also try your hand at simple missions that require you to photograph precise elements of the environment; in short, the game offers a decidedly considerable amount of content in addition to the main campaign, the problem is that each mission is identical to the others of the same type and does not influence the surrounding world in any way. Soon a certain boredom sets in, and traveling from one point to another becomes more enjoyable than the actual missions, witnessed by a passive and useless citizenry. The purpose of our heroic actions all the same is to earn experience points and level up, unlocking new abilities to improve Spider-Man's fighting skills, for example the speed of throwing his webs or the ability to slow down time longer during the spider snap. The combat system is also largely inspired by that of Batman: Arkham City, with a button dedicated to punches and kicks and another used to shoot webs and trap enemies, the combination of which allows you to ring combos up to the point in which it is possible to perform a sort of final blow that gets rid of the target. Another key is instead dedicated to the counterattack and, by pressing it at the right moment, just like Batman, Spider-Man can also dodge and respond to enemies' blows. However, not all situations can be faced head-on and enemies can therefore be rid of even by attacking them by surprise and trapping them with a single blow: if it is true that one can freely decide which approach to use, soon the difficulty of the clashes forces one to a painstaking and mechanical cleaning job that makes each new battle the same as the previous ones despite the discrete variety of enemy forces, except for the bosses. It is in this case that The Amazing Spider-Man gives his best: the animations of the enemies in general are woody and unnatural but those of the protagonist and the most imposing bosses are absolutely exceptional, fluid and elegant; clashes with the biggest enemies often require excellent reflexes and a lot of maneuvering skills and chasing a gigantic robot through the city streets, shooting cobwebs and vaulting from one skyscraper to another to reach the weak point will make both fans of the cartoon than the movie.", "date": "2012-06-29", "grade": "8.0"}
