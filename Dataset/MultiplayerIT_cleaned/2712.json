{"name": "Beyond Contact", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beyond-contact-recensione.html", "text": "There is a catastrophe that threatens to destroy the planet Ketern, to which we have been sent to search for potential survivors of previous expeditions and, above all, to find and stop the unknown energy source that is about to make this remote celestial body a barren desert lifeless. We are in 2766 and apparently, despite the immense technological development that allows us to travel in space, we have not managed to invent a suit that can provide us with oxygen for more than five minutes or energy bars that can sustain us for at least a whole day. In the role of Quinn Hicks, an agent of the Space Corps of the United World Congress, we must therefore be able to make us, the planet and all its inhabitants survive, helped by the android C.A.R.L., which acts as a multifunctional tool, able to give us indications , run scans and whatnot. But will it be worth doing? To find out, you just have to continue reading the Beyond Contact review. Scenario Ketern is a planet rich in resources While talking to a resident of Ketern, Quinn dies. We immediately understand the reason for the sudden death: the oxygen has run out. Beyond Contact is a game that transmits anxiety from the first moments, even in moments when it shouldn't. Ketern is procedurally generated and we have to go around scanning the local flora and fauna, collect materials and resources and avoid the monsters that populate the different biomes, attached to each other as if to form an abstract mosaic. Quinn is constantly hungry and needs oxygen, with the latter which can be obtained from some bubbles that are found here and there on the planet. At the beginning it is completely defenceless, but over the hours it will be able to acquire offensive tools, which will help it in its exploration and will allow it to reach even the most inaccessible and distant areas, where the best resources are found, arriving to build a entire base equipped with autonomous defenses and means of production. In reality, fighting is not all that engaging, given that one is limited to using the selected weapon on the enemies on duty, without having to lavish particular virtuosity, apart from a few moments of hit and run action when we are clearly outnumbered. That said, it's best to avoid enemies while possible. Exploring is fundamental to the gaming experience, because it not only makes us discover new areas, but allows us to scan more objects, simultaneously advancing our technological tree (scans earn research points). At the beginning we can only extract materials from some plants, but already with the first pickaxe it becomes possible to obtain basic minerals, which help a lot in increasing the variety of buildable objects. The problem, as mentioned, is that Beyond Contact puts a certain amount of anxiety, which probably meant tension in the designers' plans: the first enemies are implacable and desist from pursuing us only after we have traveled long distances, the resources are randomly distributed and the gameplay has a tendency to be relentless. In one game we ended up in a toxic biome, which we couldn't handle yet, so we fled to end up in a radioactive biome, then in another toxic one and then again in a radioactive one. There seemed to be no way out. Running like crazy, while the poor resistances of Quinn's suit barely protected us, we arrived half dead in an alien agglomeration, where we died definitively while talking to seek help and information, as told at the beginning of the paragraph. To survive The base construction system is complex, but not particularly original The Diablo shot and the map with all the resources indicated help a lot to manage Quinn and her needs, because they give a broader view of the area we are in, allowing us to easily identify the resources present. As a good survivalist, Beyond Contact is a continuous gathering of resources and building new devices, when we are not required to reach the new objective of the main story, with the loop that is only interrupted by some simple mission, usually of the type you go from point A to point B, collect something or talk to someone and return, and from the construction of the actual base which, when unlocked, becomes the core of the experience. Perhaps even too much, given that defending it from constant attacks is really difficult and sometimes ends up choking the player, forcing him to act as her nurse, despite having spent a lot of resources to defend it. Beyond Contact transmits anxiety in some situations The goal of the developers was undoubtedly to create a very difficult game that, despite the naturesurvival, did not give the player a moment of respite. So the collection of individual resources is very fast and you don't spend hours digging mountains or cutting down shrubs, as already mentioned, the fights are resolved more or less quickly depending on the weapon in hand and you run constantly from one side to the other hunting for oxygen and food. The problem is that after a few hours of playing Beyond Contact it starts to tire. The entry phase does not last long, given the meager tutorial, the various systems are introduced gradually, but in the long run nothing emerges that makes the experience particularly interesting. Not even the construction system surprises that much. It is quite rich, including the possibility of customizing the base, building support, production and agricultural structures, as well as defensive ones, but it doesn't offer anything truly unique compared to the thousand other survival games on the market. There are echoes of Factorio, others of Harvest Moon, but in principle we are not very passionate about what we are building, so much so that in some moments it is perceived more as a bottleneck, which prevents us from going and doing something more interesting , which as a feature you really want to spend time with. Without infamy and without praise Technically it's not great, but it performs well From a technical point of view Beyond Contact is without infamy and without praise. Stylistically it looks like a sci-fi pop comic, a choice also underlined by the interlude scenes created, precisely, like comics. Which wouldn't even be bad, except that the procedural generation of the maps makes the game world anonymous and, above all, not very organic. There are some more interesting areas, the indigenous structures are well thought out, out of what they look like from years when sci-fi was much more nave than modern, and the elements of the base are well done, but nothing really stands out, both positively and negatively. The alien vegetation itself, although not without its peculiarities, soon becomes repetitive and almost never creates interesting landscapes, limiting itself to its function. The things to do in Beyond Contact are typical of survival Her story would also be interesting, except that in some moments she is castrated by survival systems and one is almost forced to run, skipping dialogues or dedicating herself less than necessary to exploring certain places, in order not to incur certain death. We understand the desire to keep the pressure up, but everything is not managed in the best possible way and certain constraints end up weighing on the gaming experience rather than enriching it. The substance is that it is difficult to say that Beyond Contact does not try and on many occasions does not do its thing, but without ever being able to stand out and without ever showing some strength that makes it unmissable, almost as if trying to do everything, it is not managed to do nothing at best.", "date": "2023-04-04", "grade": "6.5"}
