{"name": "Naruto: Clash of Ninja", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-clash-of-ninja.html", "text": "The game After an animated introduction, Clash of Ninja reveals its weapons: Story Mode, single mode, multiplayer and Shop. Each contains different variations, depending on the case: Story Mode allows you to play following Naruto's storyline from training with master Kakashi to the tournament for the conquest of the ~title~ of chunin, and your progress is saved to be later retrieved subsequently, with the possibility of starting over from the last internship reached. It is interesting to note that other episodes can be added to the standard Story Mode episodes, which can be purchased in the Shop, which will show us new and spectacular situations (for example the clash between Kakashi and Gai). The single player mode differs from the Story Mode for the possibility of selecting a character of your choice among those available, which in the European version of Clash of Ninja are much more numerous than in the Japanese version: Naruto (also unlockable in the ~enhanced~ version by the chakra of nine-tailed fox), Sasuke (unlockable in the version cursed by Orochimaru), Sakura, Kakashi, Iruka, Zabusa, Haku, Rock Lee, Hinata, Neji, Gaara and some others, for a total of twenty-two ninja, most of them to be unlocked or purchased. Once the character has been selected, a certain number of fights are faced but without accompanying dialogues or sequences. This mode also allows access to the classic Time Attack, the ever-present ~survival~ and an unprecedented battle that sees four characters oppose each other at the same time, perhaps all controlled by human players. Finally, the Shop is the place where we will go to buy unlockables, using the money earned thanks to our progress in the main modes. Among the extras there are characters, moves, power-ups, Story Mode episodes, sampled phrases (to be listened to in the mysterious unlockable mode, which unfortunately is limited to being a sound test), data sheets and so on. [C] The special moves are truly a show. You also find yourself battling multiple enemies. opponents at the same time. Hinata's special move is Hinata's special move. a mix between realistic animations and effectiveness. [/C] Ah, licensed games. Cross and delight of this sector, long periods of total discouragement alternate with moments of great happiness. In this sense, the release of Naruto: Clash of Ninja for GameCube, in full ~Wii fever~, is an interesting event: while the cubic Nintendo console is being sold off in all its guises, this excellent fighting game arrives in Italy ( first episode of a long series published in Japan), perhaps counting on the full backwards compatibility of Wii and on a launch lineup which, apart from rare cases, has disappointed everyone a bit. Hand to the shurikens, then. Comment Naruto: Clash of Ninja turns out to be quite a welcome surprise in the current, truly bleak GameCube gaming landscape. Even Wii owners could consider buying it, given the quality of the technical sector which certainly does not look bad in the face of the titles currently available for the new Nintendo console, on the contrary. The fighting game developed by TOMY manages to combine competence and talent, exploiting an important license like that of Naruto in the best way, while limiting the plot to be able to make sequels. If we want to find fault with this title, the only things that come to mind are the balance of difficulty, generally too accessible but which takes a sudden curve in the final stages (and consequently we are faced with characters stronger than the others, Gaara on all), and the intrinsic limitation of fighting games to encounters, which can have a more or less short life depending on the use of multiplayer modes. Pros: Really, really well done graphics Immediate and thick Several game modes and extras to unlock Cons: Rather easy, at least until the final stages It can only last a long time if you play it in two (or four) Excellent translation of the dialogues, which but they flow slowly Technical realization As mentioned at the beginning, Naruto: Clash of Ninja will not only make GameCube owners happy, but also those who have purchased Wii and are in withdrawal from fighting games. The game can count on an exceptionally powerful graphics engine, which manages to handle a large number of polygons while remaining anchored to 60 fps (measured by eye...). The characters are faithful reproductions of those seen in the anime, and boast truly exceptional animations, very nice to see due to the different fighting styles. The special moves are also excellent, which see the character's full-screen figure for a moment, followed by a devastating attack whose effectiveness is underlined by slowdowns and accelerations inscene playback. The locations are also really excellent, full of details and animated elements: they don't boast a dual nature like those of Naruto: Ultimate Ninja, but they are really well designed and, above all, they are all at the same level of quality, with no dips between one and the other one. The game also looks casual in the multiple fights we'll be facing, with three or four characters on the screen: on such occasions, there seems to be a slight decrease in detail, but absolutely nothing that is easily noticed. The sound sector, as rarely happens, does not disfigure in front of the graphics: the voices of the characters are those of the related Japanese voice actors (translated into Italian on the screen, with an excellent adaptation but unfortunately with too slow scrolling, which often forces you to skip) , therefore excellent, and the music is really well done and makes sense in the economy of the clashes. [C] Gaara acts as the final boss, and is the final boss. probably the most character; strong. Collision detection is a great feature. really excellent, like the playability; in general. Will Kakashi's students be able to beat the master? [/C] Control system Once you start a fight, you realize the direction taken by the developers for Clash of Ninja, in this case there are dozens of combos that you can perform with a combination of fast hit and slow hit, plus a special move to perform when the bar of the chakra is full, a move that starts with the simple push of a button and not through a combination... in this way the value of this attack takes on strategic connotations, since it is possible to execute it immediately and there is only the time to calculate of loading of the maneuver by the character, as well as the distance from the enemy. The aforementioned chakra bar has two levels of filling, and already from the first it can be used for defensive rather than offensive purposes, using a combination that includes the back keys of the joypad and which allows us to drop the opponent in the classic illusion of the disguised tree trunk, taking us behind him in an instant. Defensive maneuvers, however, are not limited to this: each character also has a ~counterattack~ move, that is, he waits for an enemy blow for a few moments and then reflects it with double the power. In all of this there is also the third dimension to consider, which will allow us to avoid a last-minute attack and find ourselves in an advantageous position...", "date": "2007-01-11", "grade": null}
