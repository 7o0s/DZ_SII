{"name": "Spider-Man: Amici o Nemici - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-amici-o-nemici-recensione.html", "text": "Simultaneously with the release of Spider-Man 3 on DVD, Activision is distributing a new videogame dedicated to wall-climbing for all gaming systems. Spider-Man: Friend or Foe takes up the graphic style of the films directed by Sam Raimi in a screaming animated introduction, especially on the new generation consoles, and puts us in a decidedly atypical situation. A mysterious enemy is using alien symbiotes identical to Venom to create an unstoppable robotic armada, plus he has earned the services of some powerful super-villains by mind-controlling them. Spider-Man is hired by Nick Fury, commander of SHIELD, to put an end to this new threat. But he can't do it alone, and so in each mission he will have to act together with a different companion: at the beginning it is the Black Cat, later he will have at his side characters of the caliber of Doctor Octopus, Goblin, Sandman, Blade and Venom. My best enemy In the field of comics, it has already happened several times that Spider-Man had to team up with one of his opponents to face a particularly serious threat. In video games, however, this solution is rather original, and it is interesting to note how the cinematic success of the Marvel character has in fact given life to a ~universe of its own~, in which the characters have a peculiar aesthetic aspect (see Goblin, very different from the his comic book counterpart) but above all of different origins and characteristics. Spider-Man: Friends or Foes is therefore proposed as a ~pair~ scrolling fighting game, in which there are two characters that we can control, alternating between one and the other with the simple pressure of the right back button (our companion will be managed by the AI). One of the two, of course, is Spider-Man; the other changes depending on the stage. The objectives to be achieved are more or less the same for each level: find people, activate devices and make a clean sweep of the PHANTOMs, the enhanced robotic beings that represent the bulk of the army that we will face. The art of minigames The game contains a series of minigames (also accessible via the relative mode from the initial menu, once unlocked) in which you have to use the stylus to open doors, unlock safes or activate circuits. Running these applications is rather immediate and fun, with a difficulty that increases as you go along. In general, however, everything is quite limited and it will take a little time to master each of the games perfectly. Furthermore, their completion does not entitle you to any prize... Sganassoni in pairs The organization of the game appears clear right from the start, with a rather inspired use of the double screen of the Nintendo DS: in an urban context, the cross-section of the road appears on the touch screen, while on the upper display we can see the tops of the buildings and note, possibly, the presence of coins to be collected or other important objects. In the event that the scene moves to underground locations, a geographical map simply appears on the upper screen indicating our position. This type of solution works very well and allows us to quickly exploit the characters' ability to climb any surface, while it must be said that in the game Spider-Man cannot use his web to move from one building to another, given that this maneuver has a purely offensive function (and it will happen that you also attach yourself to nothing to take advantage of it...). All characters have an energy bar and one relating to powers, which is consumed by pressing the A button and activating the special ability selected from those available (which alternate with the left back button). Spider-Man, for example, can fire web projectiles, imprison enemies for a while, or perform a spin attack. It is clear that these types of moves vary according to the characteristics, in fact Blade can throw blades or produce a special attack with the sword, while Doctor Octopus can shoot missiles from his tentacles or defeat opponents with ~walks~. For standard combat, the X and Y buttons translate into punch and kick combos respectively (pressing them simultaneously results in a grab), while the B button is used to jump. Doctor Octopus shopping tips Collecting coins around the levels of Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is not an end in itself: at the end of each mission you can access a shop divided into three sections and spend the money earned to respectively obtain upgrades, new game modes (survival, minigames, etc.) and the possibility to use all the characters in the free mode. A nice solution to encourage us to explore the locations. Technical realization The graphics of Spider-Man: Friends or Foes is certainly not spectacular, but it does its job well if we consider what we have seen so far, in the polygonal field, on Nintendo DS. The engine handles the environments efficiently, save for some slowdowns, and the level of detail in general is decent. We must also take into account that in most situations both screens are called into question, and the idea of the upper and lower view is really good, so much so that it should be recovered for even more ambitious projects. The quality of the characters is good as far as the protagonists are concerned, with a fairly fluid animation, while the enemies are divided into only three or four types, even changing only the color in some cases. The creation of the sound is quite successful, with an enormous amount of speech (Nick Fury's briefings, in particular) and good music... pity only for the anonymous effects. As far as the control system is concerned, we are faced with standard solutions (the d-pad moves the character, who fights and jumps using the buttons), which alternate with the use of the stylus and the touch screen only during the minigames . The game allows us to share the experience with a friend who owns a DS and the Friend or Foe cartridge: by controlling one character by one, the fun literally doubles. Comment The ~commercial~ intentions of a tie-in that comes out simultaneously with a DVD that is sure to be successful are clear, but this does not mean that Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is a title to be left on the shelves regardless. As simple and linear as it is, the game boasts a good number of usable characters and therefore will not fail to make inroads into the hearts of the most ardent Marvel fans. Technically it's decent, the combat system is confusing and ~slippery~ for a moment but in the end it works quite well, and playing in two is really fun. Probably the biggest flaw of the game lies in its limited longevity, because it takes too little time to complete it and the side modes fail to arouse the interest necessary to increase its duration. If you like Spider-Man crazy and you want a simple video game for your Nintendo DS, here you are satisfied. Pros Seven controllable characters Technically well done Fun multiplayer mode... Cons ...but you need two copies of the game Linear and repetitive Limited longevity", "date": "2007-11-19", "grade": null}
