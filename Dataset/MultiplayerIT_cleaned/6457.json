Despite the overwhelming force of this passion, which crosses all latitudes and particularly affects the Bel Paese, always in the front row when it comes to engines, the videogame medium has almost never been able to indulge it with the due attention, at the beyond interesting experimental projects, such as the beautiful Tourist Trophy (2006) by Polyphony Digital on PlayStation 2, and more or less successful licensed titles declined on a specific motoring discipline. Those who have always believed in and invested in digital two-wheelers are the Milanese Milestone, the main Italian software house which, after years of producing licensed games dedicated to Superbike, Moto GP and recently also motocross, surprised everyone by announcing RIDE, a racing game which, in the intentions of the developers, should capture the essence of Gran Turismo and translate it into the roaring motorcycle universe. In a nutshell, the dream of all gamers who are passionate about motorcycles, who have been waiting for a product with the aforementioned characteristics for too long. We have followed it with interest and attention since its debut, attending the various tours organized by the software house, and finally, after seeing it grow step by step, we managed to get our hands on a definitive game code, specifically the PC version. If you're eager to find out what we think, just keep reading. Milestone wins the bet and with RIDE lays the foundations for a successful series I want them all That Milestone has bet hard and pushed on the accelerator right away for this latest creature of his is shown by the numbers at stake: in addition to representing the first new intellectual property for the Milanese house for 15 years now, in RIDE not only fourteen of the largest and most well-known motorcycle manufacturers in the world find space, from Ducati to Yamaha, passing through Mv Agusta, Kawasaki, Honda, Triumph and even Energica, but numerous licensed brands also converge for the customization of the vehicles (both aesthetic and mechanical ) and for the personalization of the rider, with a huge choice of accessories and components. Details which, together with the more than one hundred vehicles reproduced and the fifteen settings available, for a total of thirty tracks, give an idea of the productive effort made by the developers of via Fara. Having installed the approximately 15 GB of data that make up the package and having set the technical options in the launcher, you are projected onto the Gran Prix track of the Donington Park Circuit for an interesting tutorial, where you can assimilate the basic commands and test the substantial differences between the Standard driving model, devoted to the pure and simple arcade experience, and the Pro one, with evident simulation nuances. We will elaborate on this discussion in the next paragraphs. Having taken the measurements of the control system and the interface thanks to the first test laps on the cloudy British route, accompanied by a reassuring voice guide, one accesses the main menu and creates one's own digital alter ego, a pilot ( man or woman) of which we can initially change the sex, the personal details and the face, with indeed somewhat limited choices as regards models, color and hair style. The aim is certainly not to emulate the editor of an RPG, since in any case, during the races, we will always be protected by a helmet, and from this point of view the options are vast and exhaustive to say the least. Simultaneously with the creation of the new profile, we are given the opportunity to choose our first racing car from the three proposed, a welcome gift belonging to the Naked class with an engine capacity equal to or less than 700 cubic centimetres. Between the 106 HP three-cylinder of the Triumph Street Triple, the 75 HP 2-cylinder of the Yamaha MT07 and the 80 HP of the Ducati Monster 696, we opt for the latter without hesitation, both for the seductive beauty of the bike and for its genuine Italian tradition. The choice of the first vehicle opens the doors of the World Tour, the beating heart of the work with its two hundred events divided into categories, the world rankings to climb (from the three hundredth place to the top step of the podium) and the substantial component dedicated to dealerships and motorcycle tuning. InRIDE there are four main categories of motorcycles, namely Naked, Supersports, Superbikes and Historical, subdivided in turn into various sub-classes, perhaps related to engine capacity, year of production, weight, propulsion method and so on, determining made the various competitions which be able to take part. There are no limits whatsoever in the World Tour, and to participate in a specific race it is sufficient to have purchased one of the vehicles with the required specifications. The complete freedom of the various events, offered with a classic graphical interface similar to those already seen in other racing games, such as in Forza Motorsport 5, dampens the sense of career progression a little, despite the possibility of unlocking the so-called Elite Trophy and winning the related special bikes, pushes you to launch yourself into the various challenges proposed with the right spirit, accompanied by the desire to climb to the top of the standings. The possible events are of various kinds, and range from the classic single race over three laps to championships of three or more races, passing through time trials, head-to-head, overtaking challenges on Trackdays, Drag Races where you win in acceleration competitions (in three rounds and rigorously with manual gearbox) and Endurance, where the riders, in races longer than usual, get on their bikes at the start after a short automatic run-up. The variety is further amplified by the conformation of the tracks, which include real circuits, such as the aforementioned Donington, Road America and Imola, Countryside routes immersed in nature, like the splendid Japanese Kanto and the Stelvio Pass, and city circuits, for the occasion set in Milan and Miami. The number of tracks is only sufficient and a few more routes would certainly have been welcome, however the variants for each setting offer well-diversified solutions. In addition to the above competitions, it is possible to run peculiar team races, in which you are accompanied by pre-set artificial intelligences or, even better, shaped on the skills of your friends, a sort of Drivatars seen in the Forza series (called Virtual Riders) from download in the appropriate World Tour menu. Overall, the career mode is pleasant, long-lived and satisfying, of which we also remember the inspired cutscenes that introduce the eight macro categories of events, which, also thanks to the excellent commentary in Italian, transmit a genuine passion for the subject matter. Something extra The hard-earned credits on the track, in addition to determining Reputation, can be invested to buy new racing cars and to upgrade and customize those already present in the garage, as well as to dress up our centaur. As far as the rider is concerned, not only is it possible to choose from a myriad of Shoei, Arai and Agv branded helmets, but you can also change the color of the visor, the model of gloves, the boots, the entire racing suit and the sliders, with real accessories licensed by Alpinestars, Dainese and Rev'it. If you prefer ~casual~ clothing to purely racing clothing, numerous models of jackets and trousers can also be purchased in the shop, and it is possible to create up to four distinct presets to be selected quickly in the World Tour menu. To further underline the level of customization we find the Titles, i.e. phrases that accompany our rider's profile such as ~Bimota fan~, ~Aprilia fan~ or ~Speed lover~, and above all the editor for the riding style, which allows you to vary the lean position, the aerodynamic lean position and the so-called additional behaviors, such as the support foot or the elevation of the torso, with numerous indicators to adjust every minimum detail of the centaur, from the angle of the knee to the rotation of the shoulders, up to the position of the head and sitting on the saddle. To most it might seem like a simple tinsel, but motorcycle enthusiasts will be able to replicate their exact favorite riding position or perhaps that of a Moto GP darling. As far as motorcycles are concerned, there are five distinct areas for improvement, with about twenty interchangeable components, both aesthetic and mechanical in nature. For the engine, for example, the control unit, the air filter, the cylinder head, the muffler and the type of oil can be replaced, and it is also possible to intervene on the gearbox, the chain, the braking system and opt for advanced suspensions , to be adjusted in the appropriate setup menu together with the gears. For lovers of customization you can buy new levers, grips, mirrors, colored cables and steering plates, as well as change the livery, rims and tyres.As is the case for accessories relating to clothing, almost all aftermarket spare parts are licensed, involving well-known brands such as Rizoma, Barracuda, Starlane, Arrow, Termignoni, Zard and so on, with elements sometimes specific to a certain model. The various modifications are not an end in themselves, given that in the vast majority of cases they have a significant impact on the specifications of the motorcycles, varying through the weight, the maximum torque and the number of horsepower the four main parameters that characterize them, i.e. acceleration, braking force, top speed and handling. From the point of view of customization, therefore, the pieces are in the right place, but how do the racing cars behave once they hit the track? Mechanical steeds Being able to intervene on so many parameters and have a solid and satisfying career mode, full of events, bikes and categories, would not be enough if it were not supported by a square and above all fun gameplay, however, fortunately, this is not the case with RIDE , given that the work done by the Milanese software house is certainly appreciable, even if showing the side to some uncertainty. Let's proceed in order. As specified in the introduction, the driving model ranges from the pure arcade of Standard physics to the simulation of the Pro, with the balanced Semi Pro in the middle to satisfy all palates. The substantial differences between the two extremes, which translate into a peaceful walk for the first and a ~nightmare~ made up of violent slaps, wheelies and ruinous falls for the second, are even more tangible when one passes from a docile category like that from the 700 cubic centimeter Nakeds to the Superbikes, runaway beasts that in some cases have to be tamed by constantly choking the gas and brakes. Let's take the fascinating Ducati Monster 696 of our debut and a very wicked Suzuki GSX-R1000, a 185 HP and 187 kilograms weight motorcycle, not too expensive (17,000 credits) but exuberant and significantly faster than other similar racing cars: the experience driving is practically the antipodes. The weight distribution, the brutality of the acceleration and the tendency to betray the Japanese rider not only require a different approach in attacking the trajectories, with completely different bends and entry and exit times, but to be mastered they require a noticeably steeper learning curve, causing you to abuse the Rewind command in the training path. Artificial intelligence, among other things, for the very first positions also engages the player at Easy level (of the five available, from Very easy to Real), and to obtain decent results it is also necessary to know the circuits perfectly, as well as having of a vehicle that is always well trimmed and competitive, with suitable updates when needed. To further underline the depth of the gameplay there are various aids on which to intervene, such as the joint brakes on a single key (Xbox joypads are fully compatible), the anti wheelie on five levels, the TCS (Traction Control System) to be managed with the directional cross, the gearbox and the position on the fairing, i.e. the aerodynamic response of the pilot based on speed. By disabling all the aids, RIDE with the Pro physics set becomes even more difficult and satisfying to deal with, and the level of challenge rises significantly at any difficulty. Too bad that the physical contacts with the other riders, sixteen in the offline modes and twelve playing online, don't always translate into realistic animations and consequences, and sometimes even the curbs and off-piste excursions don't respond effectively to the stresses. These are smudges that partially undermine the goodness of the driving model in terms of simulation, while not compromising the enjoyment and, above all, the drive to turn and improve one's performance. If there is one thing in which the Italian title does well, it is precisely this: it lets you play with pleasure, it satisfies you and makes you want to pick up the joypad again, to go back to brushing a braking section in the best possible way, to experience the thrill of bringing at least a particular motorbike or perhaps expand one's collection of racing cars. Outside of the World Tour mode, it is possible to face quick races, timed challenges and play an appreciable split-screen multiplayer, a welcome option since it is not always present in modern racing games, especially on PC. As far as the online component is concerned, after registering an ad hoc profile, public and private matches can be created by setting the game mode, i.e. championship and single race, the bike class, the physical model, the type of gearbox and the level of", "date": "2015-03-26", "grade": "8.0"}
