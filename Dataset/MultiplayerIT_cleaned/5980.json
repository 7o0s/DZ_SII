However, it was an operation out of time, carried out when the vein had already given everything and seemed incapable of regenerating itself. Two years later, it is clear that proposing the same formula with Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom does not appear as a great ~sly~, so much so that it is possible to read marketing reasons (the promotion of the animated series dedicated to the blue hedgehog, first of all ) rather than the concrete intention of offering a quality title to owners of iOS and Android devices. In fact, there are very few innovations introduced in the package, beyond a couple of special moves (the different ones for each character and the ~dash~, which is loaded by ringing combos), greater attention to the surrounding elements and a simplification of the interface, which makes it clear which are the most marked monetization attempts (see the paid ~continue~) and which, on the other hand, fall within the normality of the freemium model. Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom is an endless runner that is enjoyable but devoid of any original element The five legends What kind of product is Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom? As mentioned, the experience is completely similar to that of the first episode, therefore we are faced with an endless runner with a third person view and controls based almost exclusively on the touch screen, with the traditional lateral and vertical swipes to allow our character to switch lanes, jump, slide and perform special maneuvers, such as the Knuckles dunk. There are five heroes that we will be able to unlock, using the hard currency and therefore with a (good) bit of patience so that we can get them all: Sonic, the aforementioned Knuckles, Tails, Amy and Sticks. The sorties within the fairly varied scenarios are supported by a fairly multifaceted list of achievements and by an upgrade system that allows you to multiply scores and progress faster. Of course, once in action the game is all a dj vu, in the sense that you can easily have fun but provided you have never spent hours and hours with a similar product, above all Subway Surfers. The approach to the gameplay is reasoned, there is time to get used to the rhythms and take good measures to the obstacles and enemies present on the path, so much so that it often happens that you run into game over because you have gone too far and maybe you he wanted to collect rings in extremis, challenging the responsiveness of the controls. To confer a further element of accessibility there is then precisely the question of the rings, which allow you to take a shot before having to start the race over again, beyond the traditional advertising films that give a ~continue~ or app purchase. A good job has been done on the technical implementation front, with nice characters, very colorful settings and excellent fluidity even on penultimate generation devices, but the biggest problem remains: the total lack of original ideas, of elements that in some way they can refresh an experience that is already old.", "date": "2015-10-13", "grade": "6.0"}
