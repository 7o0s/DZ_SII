So here is that for this new foray into smartphones and tablets, Top Gear has decided to completely change register, abandoning the (albeit slight) ambitions of realism of the previous products and embracing two of the most popular formulas of the moment, namely the endless runner and the free to play. Let's see if it was a good choice... Stig's macrocephalic cousin While referring to the now well-known mechanics brought to success by Temple Run and the like, Top Gear: Race the Stig resembles in particular a specific endless runner, or that Subway Surfers released over a year ago on the App Store and Google Play. From the Kiloo-branded title, the BBC product draws heavily not only on what concerns the gameplay, but also on a colorful and cartoonish graphic style. So forget about impersonating realistic polygonal versions of James May, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond: here the protagonist is an anonymous pilot with a huge head covered by a helmet, who drives a toy car with which he must try to cover as much distance as possible by looking at each other shoulders from a Stig also macrocephalus. All immersed in a scenario with almost childish tones, made up of rounded elements covered in bright colors, with the camera taking on an elevated position behind the player, identical to that proposed by the aforementioned Subway Surfers. Just as the gameplay is almost indistinguishable: swiping a finger on the touch screen in the four directions moves the car to the right or left and makes it jump and lower, in order to collect as many bolts and power-ups as possible and above all to avoid a contact with the obstacles capable of causing the game over. Nothing new even as regards the presence of power-ups to be collected on the field for immediate use or to be purchased in the appropriate shop and used as needed (their look changes, but the effect is the same as the counterparts of Subway Surfers), nor for the various missions and challenges to be completed in order to receive prizes. In short, it cannot be said that originality is exactly the strong point of Top Gear: Race the Stig, a title destined to give a strong feeling of dj vu to anyone who has played more than one endless runner in their gaming experience. Top Gear: Race the Stig is an endless runner too similar to Subway Surfers to leave its mark Complicating the situation of a product that in itself does not show great personality is a rather questionable management of the inevitable in-app purchases that fill the game. While not too insistent in proposing currency packages to the user to purchase, Top Gear: Race the Stig offers practically no content that is not related to the disbursement of bolts, obviously given with such parsimony as to make each purchase a real one. own grinding marathon. Anyone who wants to access some unlockable elements without having to play hundreds of games will therefore be forced to open their wallet, but (unfortunately) that's not all: the wrenches are also available for a fee, which are used to restart immediately in the event of a collision with an obstacle, and even a fee is required to remove the invasive and very annoying advertisements which, after the first bars, begin to systematically block the game action. It's a pity that Top Gear: Race the Stig is so blatantly oriented solely for profit, because there are some goodies intended for fans of the television program: the cars that can be purchased - at a very high price - are in fact all related to very specific episodes, with movies that see them as protagonists viewable simply by pressing a button. The presence of Stig, on the other hand, could certainly have been more incisive, while instead the mysterious pilot limits himself to appearing from time to time on the game screen to try to disturb the user and lead him to error. The roundup closes with online rankings and sharing of results via Facebook and Twitter which have now become part of the standard equipment of mobile production.", "date": "2014-03-14", "grade": "6.9"}
