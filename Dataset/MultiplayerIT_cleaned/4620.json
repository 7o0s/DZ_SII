RAID: World War II is nothing more or less than this, an attempt to monetize an old and, by now, unoriginal idea, hoping that the console and PC audience will be attracted like flies to honey. Dear Starbreeze, we want to tell you from the bottom of our hearts: players in 2017 want much more quality. The dispute between Fortnite and Playerunknown's Battleground has recently brought to the fore the discussion between how ethical it is to lean heavily on the ideas of others in an attempt to repeat their success and the videogame history is studded with clones who have unsuccessfully tried to gnaw at each other's users . If on the one hand, however, Epic Games has at least tried to propose a unique and ~different~ vision of the Battle Royale experience, in RAID we find ourselves essentially reliving a Payday 2 in the past, with the aggravating circumstance of having an old engine on our hands several years old and largely outdated mechanics. Did we really feel the need? A breezy cut, at times irreverent The presentation isn't even one of the worst, so much so that, taking the place of our commander, we find John Cleese who, in the guise of an English intelligence agent, will push the team to attack Nazi Germany in the middle of the war. Our task? destroy supplies, cut supplies, kill as many bad guys as possible and in the meantime, if the clock allows us, also loot the war zones bringing home the loot. We thus become a sort of Inglourious Basterds, dedicated to killing Germans deliberately and the game puts no brake on our desire for massacre, rather rewarding indiscriminate extermination. Before entering each mission it is allowed to choose one of the four classes currently available as well as its equipment and then launch us on the online game servers or let artificial intelligence accompany us into battle. RAID: World War II, of course, is not a title that was born with single-player ambitions, on the contrary, it is precisely in multi-player and co-op that it manages to give its best, almost entertaining when played with friends. Almost, however, is a must because the shortcomings of this title are many and extremely heavy. So let's start with the few missions available, taken on weight as a structure by a thousand others seen in recent years. You find yourself wandering around bare and linear maps trying to achieve clear objectives but with little appeal: for example, we will have to place some charges in the bunkers or storm the communication stations, but the strategies for doing so are always few and limited. There are no big plans to get around the numerous Nazi guards patrolling the playing area and the artificial intelligence, even on a difficult level, never offers a fun and stimulating challenge, only becoming more frustrating than necessary. Our fellow soldiers, if they are controlled by the CPU, then limit themselves to following the player like dogs, shooting (rarely) the opponents on their line of fire and remaining essentially invisible to the eyes of the enemies, a situation that in a case like this destroys empathy completely. Not to mention the lack of tactical acumen or the inability to issue even the most basic commands to the team. If you have to play alone, in short, without any hesitation, direct your savings on some other more refined title. Playstation 4 trophies Getting all trophies in RAID: World War II is a slow and frustrating task. You will have to prepare yourself to play and replay the same missions an infinite number of times since to reach the much coveted platinum it will be essential to get all four protagonists to touch the level cap. You will then obviously have to finish all the raids and missions, a difficult task given the amount of bugs and crashes that await you. In four there is more taste The situation does not improve much when three friends, or three random players, take the rifle in hand and accompany us on a mission. Unfortunately the game engine, the same Diesel of Payday 2 (albeit updated to version 2.0), is now old and weighs a lot on the final yield. The whole technical sector of RAID II is at times embarrassing: we are not only talking about the animations, apparently almost from a generation ago, but also about the special effects, the feedback from the weapons, the speed of response in the commands and even a depth of field that does not go beyond a few meters, buried by a nconstant ebbiolina essential to maintain a decent framerate. Unfortunately it's a trick that, at least on PlayStation 4, doesn't work since the drops are obvious and frequent, so much so that some sections are unplayable. Even the uploads are long and unjustified and there have been cases where crashes and bugs have prevented us from completing the missions. Now, we know very well that many of these problems could be solved in the future with some patches but here we are not talking about a project sold at a budget price but a game launched on par with a triple A. We would like to stop here and tell you that RAID: World War II also has positive aspects but we can't do it: the textures and polygonal models are outdated and even all that variety of weapons, attachments and collectibles is missing that ultimately helped Payday to become that media success of a few years ago. In short, playing Raid is frustrating for all this series of reasons and the introductions from the point of view of the gameplay are so marginal as to leave very little room for analysis. The four classes have unique special skills to activate in critical situations, such as the ability to see through walls and increase the damage of our fellow soldiers for a short time, but they are so trivial and obvious that they are not worth your attention. Even the interface seems to have been pulled out of a demo assembled in a hurry, without particular style, with basic icons and lacking any stylistic ambitions. A serious balance of weapons is missing, with guns that can serenely kill snipers at sidereal distances, and even the feeling of heaviness of Payday 2 is less here, with one of the worst feelings of firearms of the last period. The package is closed by an unnecessarily slow progression system, as if to try to force you to stay on the game servers.", "date": "2017-10-11", "grade": "5.0"}
