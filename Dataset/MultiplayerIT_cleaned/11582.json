{"name": "Army of Two - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/army-of-two-recensione.html", "text": "Shooting coop After choosing to play one of Elliot or Tyson, there's not much left to do except face the tutorial, a quick training in a field where it's not possible to be killed and in which you learn all the moves that can be performed with the help from our partner. AoT is a third-person shooter that recalls Gears of War in some respects and that makes these continuous interactions between the two protagonists its strong point. These take place on several levels: some are contextual with respect to certain elements of the seabed, such as those used to scale the highest walls with the help of the partner or to open the heaviest doors; others activate at any time, such as those to switch weapons or to activate coordinated sniper shooting or to drag the comrade to safety when he falls to the ground so that he can be healed; finally, others, such as the shoulder-to-shoulder shooting, are totally in the hands of the developers who have inserted it in well-established moments of the game and which allows you to defend yourself in a bullet time moment that allows you to appreciate the really good animations of the soldiers . Having overcome the novelty effect that these elements certainly manage to give to the gameplay, the overwhelming sensation that emerges is that of a normal, and fun, action shooter in which these elements have been inserted in an unnatural, barely hinted way, so as to be less decisive. Coordinated sniper shooting is used a couple of times throughout the game, for example, and taunting your partner or cheering each other on, which are activated by pressing two buttons, have no influence on gameplay and any situation can be overcome by mostly making use of the possibility of being treated by the other soldier, which makes it practically immortal especially at the basic difficulty level. In short, in the end we are left with the idea that all these combined actions are nothing more than a diversion inserted in the evolution of a rather classic and linear shooter. During the game, money is accumulated by completing the main objectives of the missions and any other optional ones, money to spend to buy weapons and upgrades, which however will only have meaning for true collectors or objective point hunters, given that any of the weapons provision, properly boosted, is more than enough to get the game through without problems. Game that, among other things, you finish in about six hours. Unless you launch yourself into the repetition of the stages at the highest difficulty levels, which, especially with the help of a friend, is able to give great satisfaction. Without forgetting the many downloads of content that EA has said it has in the pipeline and the possibilities offered by the online versus modes, the success of which however will go hand in hand with the community of players that Army of Two will be able to build on the net. Aggram everything The real protagonist of AoT is the aggrometer, clearly derived from MMORPGs, an indicator that can be influenced by calling attention to itself, shooting, or leaving it to the other player, obtaining the opposite effect. The character who refrains from firing becomes progressively invisible, so as to be able to surround the opponents to hit them from behind, which becomes necessary for those marked with the yellow color, which can only be eliminated from behind (unlike the blue ones which are the weaker and of those in red which oppose a good resistance to fire). When playing in two, the coordination takes place clearly by voice, when you are alone, with the digital cross it is possible to give orders to the CPU, requiring it to follow us closely, to hold a position or to go on the attack; deciding at the same time, if we want our buddy to accumulate ~aggro~ or if we want to be the ones to attract the fire of the enemies. In this case, the Artificial Intelligence routines set up by the programmers are of great importance, and which do their duty well in most cases, except for some situations that result in a quick death when our partner chooses unlikely paths to take us to shelter and heal us or when he seems to get lost in deciding the best path to follow to attack his opponents. The speech for the AI of the enemies is different, which seem, most of the time, to run madly along the seabed, except to stop inexplicably in some positions, prey to our inexorable blows, often even turning their backs to us or running beyond the point in where we are. Mercenaries next gen Even the Army of Two cosmetics are the daughter of the air you breathe for the duration of the game. The engine is valid, travels at 30 fps in any situaction and is not denied HDR and rather convincing light effects (as well as respectable polygonal models of the characters, animated with great care). The problem is that of the six stages that make up the adventure, no one manages to leave their mark, to impress, except for a few rare moments. Waterways, Middle Eastern towns and port calls alternate on the monitor, never managing to give the player that sense of wonder which is missing. And it is not even to say that the detail or the creativity have been sacrificed to increase the interactivity of the environments, given that the elements with which it is possible to interact are very few. The global level of production is still quite high, but there is a lack of a leg capable of spreading out. The audio discourse must be tackled on two distinct levels. On the one hand there are the sound effects that are really well cared for, with the dull thunder of the bullets that seem to really hurt when they hit. On the other hand there are the voices of the protagonists able to put even the most patient of gamers to the test. With pearls like ~Look here, look there, that's how it's done~, ~Who thinks he's a fucking Rambo?!~, or the simulation of a guitar solo mimed with the voice of the soldiers when they encourage each other , there is something for all tastes. In context, the irony is completely understandable, but the yuppie accent that has been given to our heroes, in the long run, inexorably tires. Comment Army of Two is a more than decent and fun game, full of good ideas that, however, remain so, without materializing into what could have been a much more convincing title from start to finish. Especially if you have the opportunity to play it online with a friend, EA's new shooter is able to offer a solid experience, but if your daily bread is made up of long solo sessions, there is not enough in this package material to keep you busy enough to repay the purchase price. In a crowded genre like this, Army of Two had what it takes to stand out, too bad the developers didn't play them all, perhaps keeping them in the deck for the next episode.Pros Co-op Shooter mechanics Solid cosmetics Cons Poor longevity Enemy artificial intelligence Barely scratched potential Xbox 360 - Goals Out of Army of Two's 1000 points, around 400 are earned by finishing the game on the first pass and the basic difficulty level. With a friend, and trying to make some money, you can easily go up another 200. Sure, it takes time to make the full loot, but much less than on other occasions.", "date": "2008-03-07", "grade": null}
