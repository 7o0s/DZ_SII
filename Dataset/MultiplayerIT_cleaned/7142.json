Like every year, the foundation awards the Man of the Year award to the person who most distinguished himself for his work in support of the community, and this time the honor goes to Ferris Boyle, CEO of GothCorp. When Boyle takes the stage to receive the award, however, an explosion of ice occurs behind him and several armed men burst onto the scene, led by a mysterious character encased in power armor... Mr. Freeze! The situation escalates quickly, and Bruce Wayne has to escape the gaze of his many guests to reach the cellar and from there go down to the Bat-Cave, so as to recover the tools that could allow him to go into action and save all the people hostage. This is the incipit of Cold, Cold Heart, the new single player expansion created by Warner Bros. Games Montreal for Batman: Arkham Origins. Clearly inspired by one of the best episodes of the animated series dedicated to the Dark Knight, ~Heart of Ice~, the plot of the DLC tells of the first encounter between Batman and one of his most famous nemeses, precisely Mr. Freeze, and of the mystery surrounding the its origins. What drives him to act? What does his frozen heart beat for? Cold, Cold Heart is a nice and engaging (but a bit short) expansion for Batman: Arkham Origins Better a frozen heart... The developers have decided not to risk anything, translating a story that Bat Man fans already know well into video games. The narrative force behind these assumptions is undoubted, even if the ~surprise factor~ is inevitably lost and it is immediately clear what the link is between the villain on duty and what appears to be his predestined victim. After all, though, isn't that always the case when it comes to tie-ins? The initial stages are very interesting and put us (again) in the shoes of Bruce Wayne, therefore without his equipment but determined to make his way through the criminals who have invaded the villa and taken some guests hostage. A few fights, a pinch of stealth and a barely hinted platform phase and then off, again with Batman's costume (pardon, with armor) on, in a mission that goes from protection to pursuit, with a view to a path already tracked from the base game. So the freely explorable Gotham City returns, albeit in this case limited to a few neighborhoods, and the investigations are proposed again in detective mode, with the focus on certain elements and the ability to reconstruct who did what, then sending the simulation back and forth to steal further clues and therefore find a trail to follow. The rest inevitably knows already seen, considering that we are faced with an expansion of the story mode; and the most relevant novelty, namely the XE armor, only plays the role of a simple skin for the protagonist, given that despite its size it doesn't even slow down its movements (as Batman himself confirms, despite wearing that stuff he seems to have the mobility of a brick). Of course, this upgrade becomes essential to be able to explore previously inaccessible areas due to the very low temperature, as well as to free Mr. Freeze's victims from their icy prison. ...that an ice cream in the heart Cold, Cold Heart offers exactly what could be expected from a DLC of this type: no substantial novelties, but the possibility of returning to the streets of Gotham City and solving a new case, accompanied by a fascinating story already known to fans of the DC superhero. In short, the elements that characterized the experience of Batman: Arkham Origins are re-proposed and still work very well, immediately moving on to the ~advanced~ phases and without particular preambles. Therefore, expect from the beginning to face special opponents such as Mr. Freeze's henchmen, also equipped with a freeze cannon (which can immobilize us for a few, long moments), or the Penguin gang members, armed with daggers, machine guns, sniper rifles or riot shields. The new campaign is completed within two or three hours and does not offer particular extras, if we exclude some clashes with the followers of Anarchy. Nonetheless, those who have appreciated Arkham Origins and its mechanics will gladly welcome this DLC, with an honest price in relation to the contents. PC users, however, will be able to enjoy it in the splendor of a ~superior version~ which can count, after various updates, on extra adjustments regarding the DirectX 11 effects and on a frame rate that hardly drops below sixty frames per second on medium-high end configurations. The excellence of the performance goes hand in hand with a valuable artistic component, che shows the side to some low-resolution textures but which generally remains at high levels, giving us suggestive scenarios and a nocturnal Gotham also covered in snow and in an evident curfew regime. The sound accompaniment and the Italian dubbing are excellent, with the only out of tune note of the actress who plays Vicky Vale... like an automaton. It's a shame, because otherwise the work done by our boys was commendable and Marco Balzarotti remains a guarantee. In conclusion... Cold, Cold Heart is exactly what Batman: Arkham Origins fans could expect from a single player expansion featuring Mr. Freeze. The character is not new, having already appeared in the previous (but temporally subsequent) episodes of the series, which makes a very valid and significant plot lose a pinch of bite, nor are substantial innovations introduced in terms of gameplay and structure. However, the formula is still solid and perky, exploring Gotham City (or at least a part of it) by beating hands gives great satisfaction and the system adopted by the developers for investigations has great potential in the future. Perhaps more could have been done in terms of duration and secondary missions, but the experience remains highly enjoyable and adequate for the purchase price.", "date": "2014-05-05", "grade": null}
