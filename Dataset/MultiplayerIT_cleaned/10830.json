{"name": "Resident Evil 5 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-5-recensione.html", "text": "Four years have passed since the last release of the ~regular~ Resident Evil series: that fourth chapter initially arrived on Gamecube and then on PlayStation 2, which shocked the public for the revolution brought to the classic structure of the genre, as well as for its impressive level qualitative. It's been four long years, in which there has been a lack of a new Resident Evil, and in general of a third-person action game with a Japanese taste and superior quality, an increasingly rare commodity in recent times. On the other hand, Capcom has accustomed us to expectations of this kind for this series, pacing one chapter after another at a long distance and thus increasing its charm, fomenting the wait with scarce materials released over the years of development and with effective presentations. And so a good part of this generation of consoles is spent waiting for its own, legitimate chapter of Resident Evil, while details have gradually spread about the unprecedented African and mostly diurnal setting, about the decisive action shift confirmed after the successful outcome of the fourth chapter and on the obvious generational leap implemented from the point of view of the technical sector. In the midst of all this, however, there was also room for some internal discrepancy at Capcom on the subject, with slight shadows cast on the otherwise obvious success of the game: Shinji Mikami, like any good creative deprived of the work concerning his own opera, he wanted to distance himself from it, stating that he didn't even want to play this fifth chapter, not being the game that he ~would have wanted~, even hastening to announce that the next one will in all respects be a new beginning for the series. Of course, it may be too much love for ~his~ survival horror that makes the game designer talk like this, but it is clear that there can be room for some controversy in this fifth installment of the series, and we are not talking about the alleged racism inherent in the setting. With all due respect to the detractors (few to tell the truth) of the fourth chapter, guilty of having distorted the original spirit, Resident Evil 5 continues exactly on the path traced by the adventure of Leon S. Kennedy, reproposing its structure in an extremely faithful way (also too much), and veering where possible even more towards the third-person shooter. The result is still that same particular hybrid admired in the last episode: little survival horror (in the classic sense established by the first Resident Evil), but still not entirely comparable to the modern shooter, given the permanence of some fundamental characteristics of the series , such as the good old cumbersomeness of the movements and the limited spaces available for the inventory. Sickness of Africa The narrative component of Resident Evil 5 represents the most traditionalist element of the game, compared to the series: the characters, the dialogues, the way the plot unfolds will make the enthusiast feel decidedly ~at home~. The protagonist of this chapter is Chris Redfield, ex-member of S.T.A.R.S. joined the special group of fighters B.S.A.A., specifically created to keep the risk born with the proliferation of bio-organic weapons at bay, starting from the first experiments of the Umbrella Corp. As fans of the series well know, it is a character historical, as the protagonist already of the first chapter and present in Code: Veronica, to which this new episode is directly connected. Chris is in the Kijuju region of Africa investigating a terrorist named Irving, along with a new partner: the lithe and sexy agent Sheva. Obviously, the mission turns out to be far more complex than expected, in an escalation of nightmarish events that overwhelms the couple, up to clashes with some key figures from the entire series. The unfriendly local population immediately transforms into a mass of demoniacs, contaminated by a new kind of virus that transforms them into monstrous aberrations ~similar to those described in the Kennedy report~, as Chris himself affirms referring to the ~plagas~ of Resident Evil 4, of which these beings are the further evolution. Obviously we can't reveal anything about the plot, but know that from this point of view this is a Resident Evil in all respects, which fits perfectly into the context created by Capcom and brings back some prominent old acquaintances. The typical B-horror movie atmosphere returns here too, but enriched by some wonderful interlude cutscenes that contribute to overemphasizing the key events of the plot, while the few documents that can be found by exploring the levels, or the classic disused terminals inside of the scientific structures to be accessed, still maintain a link with the old system nnarrative based on investigation and exploration, now limited to a minimum. Always in line with Resident Evil 4, we travel a lot during the game, the backtracking that characterized the first chapters having been completely eliminated: each level is characterized by a different setting, with the story that takes us from the initial and sunny village African up to the underground ruins (more pre-Columbian than African one would say, but anyhow), then passing through scientific laboratories and much more, in a linear path that leaves no room for secondary roads and alternative choices, but which manages to keep your attention high with constant changes of scenery. Survival horror or shooter? The fundamental question on the structural variation implemented by the developers with respect to the origins of the series is therefore re-proposed in Resident Evil 5. Certainly right and inevitable rejuvenation for the last chapter, the action turn here becomes even more marked, to the point of almost completely canceling the original puzzle component which also represented a cornerstone for the entire genre. We therefore find ourselves moving from the dusty streets of Kijuju to settings that seem closer to a Tomb Raider, to then return to the classic ultra-modern corridors of secret scientific structures, racing on off-road vehicles, speedboats and even driving hovercrafts, in a party of action, explosions and a fast pace that really seems to be at the antipodes of the origins of the game, to which we are connected only by the particular movement of the character and by the necessary, careful management of the inventory, which at this point now seem more limiting legacies of the past than elements necessary for the gameplay, but which still characterize this game in a unique way. We no longer speak of zombies, but of scientific ~B.O.W.~, it is no longer too important to make a desperate economy of ammunition, given that in any case the game dispenses with it in good measure and even the old typewriters have been removed for the saving the game, replaced by a more practical system of checkpoints and automatic saving, as if to symbolically cut ties with the past. Of course, there are still stones to be collected and inserted into the orifices of the doors, but these are no more than pretexts to get from point A to point B by making your way with furious shootings, rather than real puzzles, and even those slightly complexes are little more than brief moments of relaxation between the most agitated phases of the game. No compromises are made: the path chosen by Capcom for this fifth chapter is clearly that of the action-shooter. On the other hand, the need for a change was now clear, after 5 chapters which, although well-made, had probably said everything there was to say with the same approach. If anything, we can discuss the fact that, having left all the innovative load on the splendid fourth chapter, Resident Evil 5 could have further refined the gameplay and also proposed something new, instead of offering a multiplayer reinterpretation (which is not a trivial matter anyway ), evolve the graphic sector and propose some new settings, since it is a game of such importance. However, one can also wonder if all this actually represents a defect, considering that we are talking about a well-made product, characterized by a gameplay that has already proven to work splendidly. Couple horror The basic setting is therefore the same as in the previous chapter: with a third-person view behind the protagonist, we find ourselves exploring levels full of enemies who mostly face us in waves, except for the rare clashes with the ~bosses~ who they mark the progression between the levels, or the evergreen sections in quick time events. In this new chapter, the possibility of rotating the shot with the right analog is recorded, while the rest of the controls have remained substantially unchanged, with the typical combat setting that is triggered when the left trigger is pressed: at this point, with the character which remains strictly still, it is possible to move the pointer of the weapon freely to precisely hit the enemies, belonging to different types and usually characterized by particular weak points on which to concentrate. The character's control system is characterized by a certain cumbersomeness typical of the series, which does not allow fast movements and sudden dodges, but is enriched with various contextual actions with which it is possible to carry out melee attacks and ~one-off~ dodges, as well to interact with particular elements of the scenario. Getting ever closer to the modern shooter, in many sIn situations it will be possible to use elements of the background as covers to hide behind when a button is pressed, appearing only when pointing the weapon, just like in Gears of War, for example. Weapons and upgrade system, controls and variety of enemies have remained largely unchanged compared to Resident Evil 4, except for the obvious aesthetic change given by the new setting. The keystone of the whole structure set up by Capcom lies, in this chapter, in the possibility of tackling the game in multiplayer The particular modular ~boxes~ inventory that had appeared in the last chapter has been removed, replaced by a simpler system with fixed slots, and the bizarre and charismatic Merchant in charge of purchasing and upgrading weapons has also disappeared, replaced by a more prosaic menu that can be recalled at the start of each game, based in any case on the same trading system: gold and treasures collected within the levels can be invested in ammunition, weapons and specific upgrades for each of these. The keystone of the whole structure set up by Capcom lies, in this chapter, in the possibility of tackling the game in multiplayer. This is the historical turning point proposed by Resident Evil 5, essentially the only innovative element present within it. The adventure is tackled in pairs, either by playing alone - in which case the companion will be managed by the AI - or in offline or online multiplayer. In the first case, there is a rather convincing behavior of the artificial intelligence, which however often proves to be too frenetic in the use of ammunition and above all of medical kits, as well as obviously not being able to develop too complex team strategies, given the possibility to select only two settings: ~attack~ and ~cover~. The mode that makes the game more enjoyable is the multiplayer, particularly online, so as not to have the view occluded by the shared screen (moreover ~cut~ in a particular, however effective way): now almost completely lost the original atmosphere, the new the fast pace and the variety of situations that characterize the gameplay have become the optimal terrain for a gaming experience in company. Among other things, this also allows a deeper approach to the game, given the possibility of developing a minimum of strategy based on the different placement of the characters in the scenario and the frequent couple actions to which the level design subjects us, although even in this case something more could have been done, such as building entire level traits differentiated for the two players. Never looked so good Capcom has already shown that it is one of the Japanese publishers most at ease with the means proposed by modern videogame technologies, and Resident Evil 5 is further proof of this: the polygonal modeling of the main characters is solid and convincing, while the scenarios are generally treated in detail, although there is a certain qualitative drop in the realization during the second half of the game, set above all in closed and more repetitive spaces, nothing to do with the first impact under the dazzling sun of Africa. The generational leap exists and is one of the hallmarks of this fifth chapter, perhaps the only justification for these 5 long years of development. The interlude scenes are also splendid, created with great care and also characterized by excellent direction and a convincing expressiveness of the characters, enlivened by the now consolidated ~quick time event~ grafts that make them interactive. The sound sector (dialogues in English with Italian subtitles, among other things) excellently accompanies the action with orchestral music created specifically for the game, another demonstration of the value inherent in the production of this chapter. Resident Evil 5's packaging is impeccable - there's a huge amount of materials to unlock, requiring you to complete the game more than once, even to compensate for its limited longevity (10-12 hours of gameplay). In addition to the usual alternative costumes, we find again the ~Mercenaries~ mode which offers a new approach to the game, based on eliminating as many enemies as possible in a limited amount of time, within some ad hoc structured scenarios. Then there is the possibility of facing the adventure in the role of Sheva, of applying particular graphic filters in order to vary the appearance of the scenario and an infinite number of collectible elements. Much appreciated, as you progress through the game, a series of text documents become available which essentially illustrate the entire history of Resident Evil and its p", "date": "2009-03-10", "grade": null}
