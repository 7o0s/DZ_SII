This surprising new episode of the series, created by an ever so inspired Treyarch, offers us the usual mix of single player campaign, online multiplayer and the extras constituted by the ~Zombies~ mode and offline training, the latter a welcome surprise for those who wants to compete with other human players only after having some experience with bots on the maps and with the available modes. The campaign, which is distinguished by a series of courageous as well as effective narrative choices, sees us take on the role of soldier choice Alex Mason, who after a series of missions between Castro's Cuba, Russian prisons and the war in Vietnam ends up being captured and interrogated by a mysterious agency who search his memory for the meaning of a series of number sequences. The story is therefore told through flashbacks and references to other characters, who, in the best tradition of Call of Duty, we will sometimes find ourselves impersonating. The presence of different scenarios and contexts helps to keep the action spectacular at all times, given that in this way the game is not forced to follow the usual gradual path that leads to the usual ~grand finale~ and indeed can move with greater freedom, displaying even very different ideas and situations to the full advantage of variety and involvement. The end result is truly excellent, so much so that the approximately six hours needed to complete the campaign are not even perceived as a lack: better a short but always lively and intense experience, or a long dissertation that inevitably moves between ups and downs? Long live freedom Black Ops is certainly not the first Call of Duty to appear on the Wii, indeed the Activision series has accompanied the Nintendo console since its launch with COD 3, laying the foundations, together with the first Red Steel, for a control system that sees the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote play an absolute starring role. The default configuration turns out to be a bit slow in the movement of the view, but just access the options screen to discover an almost infinite range of customizations, which allow us not only to change the layout of the keys but also to adjust the sensitivity of the pointer , the dead zone on the screen and whatnot. In short, it only takes a few minutes to obtain perfect controls for our needs and for our approach to matches, ensuring great precision also and above all in a multiplayer perspective. Those who really can't stomach the fact of having to reload their weapon by shaking the Nunchuk (not at all uncomfortable maneuver, however) can always opt for the control system via Classic Controller, finally supported. Also in this case there are many adjustments available, but in principle the comparison with the Xbox 360 controller, to give an example, unfortunately appears merciless: the Nintendo joypad is a bit too small and ~plasticky~, and in particular button feedback is mediocre. There is no doubt that by using it you can enjoy good ~support~ for aiming and greater precision in shots from a distance, but playing an FPS on Wii in this way seems frankly questionable to us. Character movement appears slower while running than seen on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; and in general we notice a slightly lower degree of difficulty, also due to the bad AI that often moves our opponents: their shots rarely hit, and sometimes they advance so carelessly as to move among the ranks of our companions without even realizing it. The infinite respawn of the enemies that afflicts Black Ops in all its incarnations and the small ~cuts~ made specifically on the Nintendo console fortunately do not affect that much on the enjoyment of the experience which, we repeat, is truly engaging. Shaun of the Dead The ~Zombies~ mode has the merit of clearing cooperative online multiplayer on Wii, allowing four players to face together the nightmare of being barricaded in an inhospitable scenario, into which hordes of zombies burst in as they become more numerous and tenacious. The purely ~survival~ nature of this mode, which debuted on the Nintendo console (indeed it was missing in Call of Duty: World at War), unfortunately ends up limiting the fun after a certain number of games, despite the possibility of spending one's points for open doors and move into potential areasbetter defensible entity. At the end of the day it is a survival competition for its own sake, fun if played with friends but which at the same time can be quite frustrating given that the undead just touch us to tear us apart. Competitive online multiplayer appears to have a much different thickness, which boasts respectable numbers, with two teams of six players for most of the modes, the classic eight players for the ~all against all~ and two teams of nine players for the ground warfare mode. There are no particular changes regarding the type of matches, while some important changes have been made regarding the acquisition of equipment. While in previous CODs it was enough to accumulate experience and level up to unlock new weapons and complete challenges to obtain the related accessories, in Black Ops we are allowed to spend our points to buy the weapon, accessory or special ability which we need. It is clear that even in this way we will gradually be able to unlock all the objects, but we will be able to start with the things that interest us most and that best suit our way of playing. The challenges have been replaced by contracts, which in turn allow us to earn credits but must be completed within a certain period of time, under penalty of cancellation. Turning to the functioning of online matches, unfortunately it seems that in these days the Activision servers have some problems, so it was not easy to be able to complete some matches. We have seen some lag problems attributable to the poor quality of the connection of the individual participants, but in general it seems that a good job has been done and the quality of the experience is similar to what has already been seen in Modern Warfare: Reflex. Finally, it should be noted that Call of Duty: Black Ops is the first Wii title to support voice chat via the special USB headset produced by the American company PDP. Technical realization It must be admitted that the developers of Treyarch have done their best to bring as many features as possible to the Nintendo console from the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC versions. Beyond a few small cuts in the single player campaign (the crossbow instead of the ~slingshot~ to knock down enemy positions in the Russian prison stage, for example), the presence of a single map for the ~Zombies~ mode ( unless you can unlock others, but it seems not) and the lack of split screen to face online matches in two, in fact, we can say that the game has everything between weapons, missions, challenges and maps for the online multiplayer, fourteen. The latter are distinguished by the generous dimensions (apart from rare cases in which the scenario is deliberately restricted), by the excellent design and by the good variety, even if the quality of the textures leaves much to be desired and there is a polygonal count all 'other than exciting. Furthermore, the rendering of our opponents during online matches is not exactly the best both in terms of the detail of the models and their animation. We can say without fear of contradiction that the graphics of Black Ops do not set new quality standards on Wii, even if in various situations it is at least pleasant. The problem is mostly the instability of the frame rate, really dancer, which also negatively affects the precision of the controls. As far as the audio sector is concerned, nothing to say: the musical accompaniment is essential and that's okay, the effects are normal and the dialogues are very well recited.", "date": "2010-11-15", "grade": "8.8"}
