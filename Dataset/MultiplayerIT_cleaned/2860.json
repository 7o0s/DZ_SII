{"name": "FIFA 21", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-21-recensione-versione-pc.html", "text": "Like many serial productions released between two generations of consoles, FIFA 21 also does not offer striking news compared to the edition that preceded it. Starting with a gameplay that has remained almost unchanged in its points of maximum expression, despite some tweaks have somewhat unbalanced certain mechanics. In short, it seems clear that, like the rest of the competition, the production effort of Electronic Arts is now aimed at the new generation consoles. Having made this premise, let's go into our analysis of the new chapter of the franchise on PC, which many fans still consider the best digital expression of simulated football. Modes, Career and FUT at the top Classic pop-up menus welcome the player to the game's main screen, where various options are available. Among the modalities there are no sensational novelties and all those of last year are present, from quick friendlies to various tournaments, real or invented, each of which is characterized by different options for all tastes and for all needs, also open to online. In this sense, we were able to carry out some tests in terms of friendlies and FUT and, perhaps even for the few connected users, our impressions are quite positive: everything went smoothly, without lag and with a rather fast matchmaking. We'll see if the new servers perform as well in the future, when they are subjected to greater stress. Returning to the game modes, as always, the three main ones that have been given the most attention by EA, starting with the Career, the beating heart of the series. Like the other modes, this one proposes an identical structure compared to last year but, in the case of the Manager one, with some extra options that make it more attractive and complete. In fact, this year's novelties add further depth to matches, the transfer market and training, to give the user greater control over the growth of his team. Specifically, there is a new interactive interface to simulate matches, where the playing time is slightly accelerated, and there are new types of contract during market negotiations, including the loan with the right to buy with the already fixed price tag. To these elements are added some new functions for the training session, where, for example, specific exercises can be organized for each athlete in the team, so as to ~help~ him to develop certain skills or to maintain them as much as possible during his career. Another key mode of the series is FIFA Ultimate Team. Here the most important innovations are the absence of fitness and training cards, the possibility of playing in co-op or joining the global community in FUT events, and the FUT Stadium, which allows gamers to modify their system sports with ad hoc objects found in the sachets: gadgets, decorations, choirs, everything that can be used to better customize the structure. For the rest, FUT maintains its strengths and weaknesses, including the problem of fast players, which undermines the simulation aspect of online races. But this is something recognized by the fans, who therefore already know what to expect. Last, but not least, the Volta mode, introduced last year and as then always focused on offline and online arcade challenges on street pitches. In addition to a narrative component along the lines of The Journey of Alex Hunter, albeit in a lesser tone, in practical terms we see an improvement in the system that manages collisions and defensive countermoves, such as the new blocking system, which ensure more gameplay rewarding, and a greater openness to multiplayer, with online Divisions and weekly events, which therefore offer new opportunities to users. Playability, almost the same but faster Speaking of gameplay, as in the case of the rival eFootball PES 21, the playability of this basic FIFA 21 is not very different from that of the last edition, even if it is enriched with some new functions that significantly modify some aspects. Physicality, greater control over the movements of the athletes on the field, and a more realistic behavior of the ball are in this sense the focal points on which the developers have focused their attention to improve a playability that was already based on fairly solid foundations . But will they succeed? Once you take the field, the feeling with the players is immediately familiar and the feeling of continuity with the previous chapters is clear. The control is good and theconvincing response to commands, with players who naturally juggle the terrain. In general, however, there is now the possibility of replicating a greater variety of manoeuvres, thanks to new implementations such as the reworked collision system, which accompany the movements of the protagonists on the pitch, linked to the dynamics inherent in their running, the their positioning, body gestures during acceleration and deceleration, dribbling or changes of direction. In addition, lucidity must also be taken into account, a new attribute introduced this year that indicates the possible behavior of players in key moments of the match. In short, behind names such as Agile Dribbling, Intelligent Positioning and Creative Insertions, interesting features are hidden that actually impact the gameplay, even if to tell the truth they don't always do it in a positive way. Sometimes, in fact, especially in the higher difficulty levels, the CPU seems to abuse certain plays, even when they are not necessary, and favor too much speed pocketing, thanks also to deadly one-twos that often put the defenses out of play , despite these they generally perform well in the coverage phase, and the physicality of the athletes in the tackles. If we add to this that in some circumstances the ball seems to become strangely light and the goalkeepers are not always impeccable, it is no surprise that some matches end up becoming a race to see who scores the most goals, to the detriment of that realism that many fans they are looking for in a sports title. Graphics and audio, a few tweaks Proceeding in our analysis of the title, we cannot fail to conclude without first talking about its technological aspect. In this sense, the argument we have already made regarding the gameplay is valid, namely that there are no particular upheavals. In fact, on a graphic level, FIFA 21 does not differ much from FIFA 20. Yet there is also a series of significant improvements here which, as often happens in these cases, fans of the series will not find it difficult to notice. Too bad for the absence of the official licenses of Juventus, Rome and practically the entire Italian Serie B, not to mention the real shirt of our national team. As always, therefore, the graphics sector of FIFA looks very good on PC, and even playing with the minimum requirements required by the game it is possible to enjoy a good overview. Obviously, in order to better enjoy the experience and appreciate its aesthetic characteristics, it is advisable to use more performing graphics cards, such as the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670, the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti or the AMD Radeon R9 270x, supported by a good processor. By intervening on the few settings available, you can play at 1080p and at 60 frames per second up to 16:9, with every minimum detail well highlighted thanks to the high resolution. It is also possible to intervene on the multisampling antialiasing to improve the quality of the images by ~softening~ the outlines. We have set the option to 2x, but it is possible to go up to 4x. Also for the frame rate we opted for the No Limit on FPS solution. What gains from it are the staging of the match event, with a television direction that offers a handful of new shots for the skits during the teams' entry onto the field, often interspersed with beautiful overviews of the stadiums and its packed stands, and on computer further enhances the aesthetic quality of the players' models and the licensed shirts. Finally, on the sound front, the commentary by the usual Pierluigi Pardo is accompanied by the ~robotic~ Stefano Nava: dynamic and ~warm~ comments, often close to the action, alternate with phrases that are sometimes out of context and interventions by the second voice of a banality disarming. The effects and choruses are definitely better, which have nothing to envy in terms of power and realism to those heard and sung in real stadiums throughout Europe, especially using a 5.1 or 7.1 audio system.", "date": "2020-10-08", "grade": "7.5"}
