{"name": "Sega Superstars: Sega rilancia EyeToy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-superstars-sega-rilancia-eyetoy.html", "text": "Sega Superstars is a little gem of its kind and probably represents the first title that justifies the purchase of EyeToy without reservations. Fun, involvement and musicality are the aspects that the game exudes in every little detail, and that make us remember how Sega, when it wants, knows how to develop video games like few Software Houses in the world. Samba de Amigo and Space Channel 5 alone guarantee the ticket price, accompanied by other mini-games ranging from fun to challenging, with the necessary exceptions. Excuse us now, we have to rush to buy toys for our Chao... Pros: Addictive and fun Long lasting and with many secrets to unlock Some of the minigames are very well done... Cons: ...while others are of fluctuating quality The component multiplayer is practically absent It was only a matter of time, but we could imagine it. Could a software house like Sega never develop for a device like EyeToy? The vicissitudes of the Sony camera have been rather troubled: received very warmly by the public, in its first year of life it has not seen software equal to its potential. Finally the time has come for redemption, and with this title, not counting Play 2 and Antigrav on the way, we can only agree. Sega Superstars is a collection of 12 minigames (a number evidently very dear to those who develop for EyeToy) taken directly from some of the best productions of the Japanese Software House. The common denominator is the interaction with them, which will always take place with the movements of one's body, even if in a different way for each minigame. In fact, the title offers tests that will put the player's sense of rhythm, his reflexes and sometimes his physical resistance to the test, all while always trying to ensure maximum enjoyment. Let's see in detail the mini-games, which take their name from the game from which they are taken. Secrets and progression In each minigame there are usually three or four difficulty levels, which must be faced in sequence to be unlocked and which therefore guarantee greater longevity. But that's not all, in full Sega tradition, each test will have some secret features: in Samba De Amigo, for example, we will be able to unlock 6 new songs, while in Sonic we will be able to control Shadow in three further levels! To surround the whole is the chao garden, in which we will be able to raise and cuddle our little pet (always using our hands) and we will be able to buy him toys and more through the rings that are collected during each game session. A sort of tamagotchi therefore, which together with the secrets of which Sega Superstar is full, contribute to making the title fun and long-lived. Music and colours Technically Sega Superstars offers the bare essentials on video, but the graphic sector is certainly superior to the other productions for EyeToy, thanks to a display of colors fully in line with the atmosphere that hovers in the title. A separate mention must be made for the sound sector, of excellent workmanship and according to the high Sega standards, also thanks to the fact that many pieces are taken directly (or remixed) from the original titles. The interaction with the camera is practically perfect, and in fact even in frenetic games that require high coordination, once the due initial practice has been made, there will be no particular problems in making the camera recognize all of one's movements. The quality of the minigames varies from title to title, but overall it is of excellent quality. In fact, we have titles such as Samba de Amigo and Space Channel 5, which, thanks also to their sound sector and frenzy, ensure truly high fun and longevity, and certainly represent the flagship of this Sega production. Then there are more complex titles such as Super Monkey Ball, or even relaxing and engaging titles such as Sonic and Nights. The only ones we didn't like completely were The House of The Dead, Virtua Striker and Crazy Taxi, too simplistic and short-lived. Nights: The EyeToy version of the beautiful Saturn title will give you the impression of literally flying, in fact we will have to control the character by moving his arms like an airplane and trying to glide inside circles suspended in the air, also collecting the gems that we will encounter during the flight. By bringing the arms up it will be possible to go up in altitude, by bringing them down you will have the opposite effect. Provided your arms can withstand the physical effort.Chu Chu Rocket: The aim of this minigame is to get the cute Chu Chus safely in a rocket ship ready to go. Their walkno it will take place on broken bridges in some hamlets. It will be up to us to close the ~fractures~ by quickly waving our hands on the appropriate switches. However, we will have to be careful not to let the usual bad guy get on the rocket, who has the ability to skip these points. To eliminate it we will first have to make it pass over the usually interrupted part of the bridge, and then release the button in such a way as to make it fall into the deepest abyss. Puyo Puyo: It probably represents the game with the funniest concept, in fact we will have to drop the Puyo puyo that will fall on us in the four containers of their own color. The fun lies in the fact that we will be able to hold them all by spreading our arms and waving them, with a truly convincing interaction with the screen and a graphic effect. Probably girls favorite minigame. Crazy Taxis: The minigame certainly with the craziest concept of the lot, in which it will be necessary to make as much noise as possible (literally) to attract the attention of the taxi driver and get him to the destination faster (we will be on the passenger side this time therefore), shaking his body and arms like madmen. Amusing and immediate in the first instance, it lacks in longevity and variety. Samba De Amigo: In this game, to the rhythm of Latin American-inspired music and in a similar way to what we saw in Eye Toy Groove, we'll have to hit balls at the exact moment they cross the circles in the corners of the screen. On Dreamcast it was done with the Maracas, in Sega Superstar instead it happens through the use of the hands, while the noise of the maracas is reproduced directly from the game. There are initially six songs available, while there are four difficulty levels, the last of which is really challenging. The perfect interaction with the camera, the immersive music and the game structure that goes perfectly in time with the background music (which was not always the case in Groove) make this a must-have and addictive mini-game for lovers of music games. Space Channel 5: Another musical game, this time taken from the homonymous production brought by United Game Arts released for both Dreamcast and Playstation 2. In the role of the charming Ulala we will have to repeat the dance steps given by the Morolians (alien race well known to those who played the title original) in three different levels of difficulty, the last of which will put your coordination and rhythmic skills to the test. The repetition of the steps, obviously entrusted to the use of the hands, makes the game very frenetic and competitive, however you need to spend some time calibrating well with the camera, so that it interprets all the commands correctly. Ulala Swinging Report Show! Virtual Fighter: Very similar in setting to the Eye Toy Play game entitled Knockout, but more advanced in terms of mechanics. Three levels of difficulty, each of which includes combat with some of the characters from the famous Sega roller. At the easy level you will have to hit the opponent in the points highlighted by a red circle, and parry in those that appear with a blue circle. Things will get more complicated with higher difficulty levels, as we will have less time to block opponents' blows and we will have to avoid their counter-moves. Virtual Striker: In the role of a top scorer, we'll have to head some balls that will fall from above, in order to hit balloons of different sizes, each of which will give a different score. This minigame turns out to be very simplistic and not very long-lived, you will probably not spend more than 10 minutes on it. The House of the Dead: The game mechanic is very similar to Kung-Fu Master for Eye Toy Play, in fact we will have to get rid of some zombies using our hands, and be careful not to hit cheerful civilians who will thank us with a nice slap in the face in the in case they were hit. After a few stages it will be possible to face the classic end-of-level boss, a boss that unfortunately will be identical for each difficulty level, sanctioning the mediocre variety and duration of the minigame.Sonic: At the command of one of the symbolic characters of Sega itself we will have to travel some pipes at high speed, trying to collect as many rings as possible and at the same time avoiding crashing into obstacles, which will make them lose. Furthermore, if we manage to collect the 7 emerads that we will meet during the crossing, we will be able to transform into Super Sonic, invulnerable to any type of obstacle. The control of the blue hedgehog is entrusted to our arms, which by rotating will decide the position on which Sonic will run. Billy Hatcher: The minigame, taken from the platform uscito a few months ago on GameCube, it is controlled only with the hands, which if moved together will allow you to run forward, while moving them one at a time we will be able to control the direction. The aim is to eliminate all enemies in the play area with your egg, which will grow larger through the acquisition of some bonuses, and then escape through a door that will open after you have defeated them all. Super Monkey Ball: Even this version for Eye Toy has a mechanic very similar to the original title, and is implemented quite well. By waving our arms like an airplane we will control the inclination of the table and the speed at which our cute little monkey will move, trying to acquire as many bananas as possible (for points) and to reach the final point within the maximum time, obviously being be careful not to fall. It is probably the most difficult game of the lot, but also among the most rewarding.", "date": "2005-10-25", "grade": null}
