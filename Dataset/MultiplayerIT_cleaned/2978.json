{"name": "Felix the Reaper", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/felix-the-reaper-la-recensione.html", "text": "The mingling of different and dissonant characteristics gives rise to explosive alchemical formulas, which precisely because of this nature can be wonderful fireworks or terrible messes, and sometimes a bit of both, as demonstrated by the review by Felix the reapers. Developed by Kong Orange and published by Daedalic Entertainment, this game will probably have impressed anyone who has seen at least one presentation trailer, because there is really nothing that at first glance falls within the standard rules of the video game (or the somewhat ' in general) in this title. The protagonist is Felix, an Agent of Death who works for the respective Ministry, but he is not exactly the dark angel or demon that we might expect from such an occupation: he is a character with just a few disturbing characteristics (such as the strange skull instead of the head) and some others decidedly outside the physique du rle that would be necessary. He therefore appears as a strange, somewhat overweight little man, fully dressed in a shirt, waistcoat and tie, intent on dancing continuously while carrying on his daily work. Ah, and it's led by the voice of Sir Patrick Stewart himself. The one implemented by the joking Felix dancer is a remarkable de-dramatization, considering that his job is in any case to mow down souls and bring them to a better life, but the fact that all this is done to the rhythm of the dance and by a character who inspires such sympathy becomes almost consoling, especially since the protagonist's final mission is to reunite with his soul mate, effectively placing love as the main engine of all the action. Eros and Thanatos, for a change, but whose contrast is staged in a light and delicate way, like a pleasant and funny ballet performed by a weird employee of death with a romantic soul. In fact, it is the story of a man in love: whether he is an employee of the Ministry of Death engaged in mowing down souls and that the woman of his dreams instead works at the Ministry of Life, are just details in that typical canvas that is love hindered and suffered, but for this even stronger and more irresistible. It's easy to think that Felix thinks of Betty every moment he carries out his relentless work, always in a dance step and with his headphones pulled tightly over his ears, and we can't do anything but cheer for him, despite his position making him in all respects a decidedly fearsome being. The dancing reaper The story remains more hinted at in the background of the puzzle, which is the absolute protagonist in Felix the Reaper, and the protagonist himself communicates above all with his strange and tender movements since in fact he never speaks during the game. In short, the narration appears rarefied and almost immediately gives way to the puzzle, but maintains tangible elements within the levels, to decisively characterize the entire gaming experience. The missions, which always concern the collection of souls within various levels, are dotted with fragments of stories, insights into the victims and contexts, which demonstrate how the whole game world is strongly characterized and charismatic in every aspect, moreover set according to different time periods, just to add a further touch of eclecticism to the recipe already full of contrasts. Felix moves on levels divided into grids, trying to make the unfortunate reach rather tragic ends, acting on the basis of a basic principle which is the one on which the whole puzzle is structured: moving in the shadows. Because he may well be an over the top guy, incurable romantic and music lover dancer, but he can't escape the characterizing element of any agent of Death, i.e. the fact of acting in darkness. On this need and on the fact of eliminating the objectives arranged in the levels, the whole mechanics of the puzzle is set, which essentially provides for two types of interaction with which the player can act: the lifting and moving of various elements of the scenario and the possibility of rotating entire layer to change the position of the sun and shadows between two settings. The basic ideas are very intelligent and seem to pave the way for a rich and interesting puzzle design, only that in the long run they are easily repetitive, essentially repeating the same situations that can be encountered during the very first levels also for the rest of the game . The search for the shadow leads to the organization of the scenario so as to create a free path from Felix's starting point to the goal to be achieved, which involves moving objects and din the angle of the sun, with practically no progressive enrichment of the mechanics. There are not many missions and the conclusion can also be reached in around five hours of play, but beyond a higher level of difficulty with which to take the same path again, there is no great potential in terms of replayability. Style to sell, with some problems There is a certain lack of comprehensive instruction at the outset, despite Patrick Stewart's charming voice underlining some story moments, but that can still be seen as an integral part of the challenge. Once you understand the few main concepts underlying the gameplay, this flows pleasantly in a dance step between atrocious deaths and the constant gracefulness of Felix and his steps between the level boxes. On iOS mobile devices there are some additional problems in controlling the character, somewhat hampered by an interface that is not perfectly responsive. The selection of the boxes for moving can be imprecise, while the shot seems unable to find a happy medium between the more distant one, which makes the movement complicated, and the close one, which is too narrow on the protagonist, so as not to make see the surroundings well. However, since this is a game with a somewhat staid rhythm, these are not defects that affect the results too much, even if they make the overall experience less fluid. Where Felix the Reaper really excels without hesitation is his impeccable style, which manages to blend disturbing elements with other funny and tender ones with great ease, starting from the protagonist himself who is practically built on such contrasts. The actions we carry out could be heinous crimes, if the general atmosphere and the movements of Felix did not make everything almost poetic. Likewise, the other mortals whose souls we must reclaim are also transfigured in the strange general style of the game, with features that could be creepy but always have something almost endearing about them. This strange balance that emerges from a strong characterization played on equally decisive oppositions is what makes this puzzle somehow memorable, even beyond its structural gaps.", "date": "2020-08-03", "grade": "7.0"}
