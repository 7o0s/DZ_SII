An experience from which the American giant has learned a lot, as evidenced by the publication of The Sims Mobile, which arrives on iOS and Android devices after a long period in soft launch, used by the authors to better adjust all the mechanics, especially those relating to progression, and arrive in the best possible conditions at the appointment with the official launch. An operation that can certainly be said to be successful, given that right from the start the game seems to know exactly where to go, allowing us to create a character and tidy up his new apartment using furniture, materials and accessories that go unlocked gradually, experimenting with the various activities available and completing them successfully. Mechanisms, the latter, linked to the tradition of freemium realities: once a task has been assigned to our avatar, we will be able to choose whether to wait for it to be completed or switch to the ~manual system~, directly manage all interactions but thus spend a certain amount of energy. Does this mean that at some point we will have to stop and wait? Yes, even if we will have at least one other character available to use while the first one, let's say, takes a nap. Lots of stuff If The Sims Mobile's touch control system doesn't always impress with its precision, especially when it comes to interacting with objects close to each other (but pinch-to-zoom magnification comes in handy), in terms of numbers, the new mobile production of Electronic Arts boasts a decidedly large catalog, even exaggerated where you are still in the early stages of the game. Of course, many of the objects we will not be able to obtain without putting our hands on the wallet, in the end, but nevertheless the variety and quality of the assets present is indisputable, contributing in an important way to always keeping interest alive. The interactions are also good: once we have approached an NPC, we will be able to choose what kind of relationship we want to establish and try our hand at different activities depending on what we have decided, thus giving a precise direction to our virtual life. Of course, we are still talking about a casual game and this means that the gameplay is limited to a few touches, a set of contextual menus and the inevitable collection of points, bonuses and money released at the end of each activity, but it is a trend that boasts many admirers and The Sims Mobile aims without any hesitation to conquer them. Hence, in addition to friendship or love relationships, growing work activity, home management and the exploration of scenarios, the EA title can boast an excellent technical realization, with polygonal models that may not be irresistible but have a discreet set of animations, lively and well defined. The whole environment is handled smoothly, allowing you to zoom, rotate and drag the view without any uncertainty in the frame rate, while some silly sound effects accompany the action.", "date": "2018-03-13", "grade": "7.5"}
