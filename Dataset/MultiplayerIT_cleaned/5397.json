{"name": "I am Setsuna", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/171538-i-am-setsuna-mi-chiamo.html", "text": "Originally announced during the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo - just over a year ago - the elusive ~Project Setsuna~ should have been the first title of the Tokyo RPG Factory team that Square Enix had set up with the sole purpose of satisfying the needs of fan of 90s Japanese RPGs. Indeed, it is indisputable that the JRPG genre is profoundly changing compared to the times in which the acronym was coined to identify role-playing games developed in Japan such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest: today the most famous and representative brands have begun to turn into free roaming adventures where you no longer fight in turn-based, but in real time. There's a world of difference between Final Fantasy XV and Final Fantasy V, and it's not just ten episodes and twenty-four years of time. JRPG fans who grew up on the SNES era often lament deep nostalgia, and I am Setsuna was developed to strike those chords, mimicking one of the most famous and beloved titles ever: Chrono Trigger. Will the Tokyo RPG Factory guys have succeeded in the enterprise? I am Setsuna evokes everything we loved about 90s JRPGs but gets lost in the details Winter has arrived The line that separates imitation from plagiarism, as we know, is very thin, and Tokyo RPG Factory just failed to cross it while maintaining balance: his I am Setsuna constantly leans from one side to the other and on several occasions loses own identity in favor of a sure footing. Anyone who has played Final Fantasy X will immediately recognize the themes that screenwriters Hirotaka Inaba and Makoto Goya have decided to touch without ever really taking them head-on. We begin the adventure as Endir, a masked bounty hunter who is entrusted with a mission that seems like a walk in the park: to assassinate a girl. The latter is our protagonist, Setsuna, and obviously she's not just any girl. The world of I am Setsuna is wrapped in perpetual winter and the creatures that populate it become more and more aggressive with each passing day: when the situation becomes untenable, tradition has it that a young girl sacrifices herself to appease the fury of the monsters. Setsuna is the martyr on duty, just like her mother was before her. Sweet, sympathetic and resigned, our heroine recognizes a potential ally in Endir and, rather than having him put to death for having attempted to take her life, she convinces him to act as her escort to the place where she will have to sacrifice herself. Thus begins a journey that is not too long, since I am Setsuna is completed in about twenty hours, a few more if you want to complete each secondary objective. They may seem like a few for a Japanese RPG, but they are dense and eventful twenty hours: the script almost never lends itself to holes and fillers, and every stage in Setsuna's journey, even the unexpected ones, involves a narrative development or the introduction of a new character. Unfortunately the characterization of the cast leaves something to be desired; the characters teaming up with Setsuna are interesting but their story arcs wrap up quickly, leaving a bit of a bad taste in the mouth about an ending that could have delivered so much more on that front. The story, fortunately, has a good rhythm and although it is not particularly original or surprising, it still manages to involve the player thanks also to the peculiar atmosphere created by the constantly snowy scenarios and by the soundtrack by Tomoki Miyoshi who composed every single splendid track on the piano . Although they are certainly two strengths, the setting and the music for some players could also represent the weakest links of the Square Enix proposal: I am Setsuna is, in a word, highly repetitive. The musical pieces end up looking a bit alike due to the practically zero instrumental variety, and the same goes for the locations we will explore, a succession of caves, mountains and snow-capped prairies. While every pixel of I am Setsuna deliberately exudes melancholy, the flatness of the colors and lighting manage to be a little too depressing at times despite the art direction trying hard to hide the rough edges of a decidedly limited budget. Playstation 4 trophies The 49 trophies that allow you to unlock the inevitable platinum trophy are divided into 40 bronze, 7 silver and 2 gold. Some are unlocked by simply following the story, while others force the player to squeeze the combat system to the last drop and explore each map from top to bottom. Searching for Zanarkand As we said, the structure of I am Setsuna is strongly derivative and anyone who has played Chrono Trigger in 1995 or later will immediately recognize the mainstays of the gameplay. The Tokyo RPG Factory title is as old school as possible both in presentation and in mechanics: it is a JRPG viewed from above in which we explore cities and dungeons, interacting with non-player characters to discover new information or start/complete any side missions. On the battlefield, contact with enemies wandering around in pre-set points triggers combat: taking them from behind we will enjoy an initial advantage and there is no transition between exploration and battle, as the player's party and that of his opponents are arranged in place. The combat system, for its part, offers an interesting mix between those of the most classic Final Fantasy and that of Chrono Trigger. Tokyo RPG Factory implemented a form of Active Time Battle, a gauge that fills over time and determines when a character can act; it's worth pointing out that the options allow us to set the fight to real-time or standby mode, which allows us to calmly choose our next action during our turns. Endir and associates can physically attack or resort to the Techs, spells and special attacks related to the Spritenite, runes that we will find or buy and that can be assigned more or less freely: this system actually allows us to customize the repertoire of each character, but his intricacies are revealed only towards the last hours of the game. I am Setsuna is in fact a really easy JRPG for at least three quarters of its duration, so much so that it gave us the impression of having been developed specifically to be an ~entry level~ title. Even the Momentum and Flux systems seem almost sketchy during the first few hours: the first depends on an indicator that fills up with each turn and which allows you to enhance each attack or spell by pressing a key at the right time. The secondary effect will vary according to the Tech or equipment worn, guaranteeing a minimum of strategic depth in terms of synergies. The Flux, on the other hand, is a mechanism that we didn't like much due to its randomness, since it triggers bonuses when making a Momentum-enhanced attack. As the hours go by, combo attacks begin to unlock - some shamelessly copied from Chrono Trigger, such as Endir and Aeterna's X-Strike attack that, from the outset, seems to scream, ~we're fans of Crono and Frog, look at us!~ - and combinations of Momentum effects and Flux bonuses that grant a substantial advantage against enemies. At that point, the difficulty level of I am Setsuna skyrockets, forcing the player to develop very specific strategies to defeat some unpredictably difficult bosses: the narrow variety of enemies and their abilities unfortunately makes itself felt for the duration of the game. adventure, and the superficial tutorials, combined with the abstruse and not very intuitive menus, make the experience a bit heavy. The same goes for ancillary features such as cooking and weapon upgrades, perhaps implemented at the last moment without too much conviction. In these situations, the small budget with which the Square Enix title was developed is definitely felt. Also from a technical point of view, we are faced with a pleasant work but almost ~indie~ in its simplicity: looking closely it would have been a perfect game for PlayStation Vita, but the publisher has decided to discard the portable release on western territory. This means that anyone who buys I am Setsuna has to deal with a visual backlog made up of polygonal models that leave something to be desired and somewhat woody animations. The Japanese voice acting is only heard during the battles, while the English-language dialogues will discourage the hardcore fans of the always in demand Italian localization.", "date": "2016-07-20", "grade": "7.0"}
