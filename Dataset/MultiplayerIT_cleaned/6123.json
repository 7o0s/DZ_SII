The reality is that, apart from obvious shortcomings on the gameplay front, the adventures imagined and created by the team have generated several more than interesting products. GreedFall itself, a classic action role-playing game, but well written and discreetly staged, has led many of us to hope for a substantial step forward, almost that of consecration. Steelrising: the latest effort of the team, lives on lights and great shadows. Jumping into the fray in souls-like is never easy for anyone, even more if the team's structural problems concern precisely those aspects that totally change the player's perception of the goodness of the genre. Let's find out which ones in the Steelrising review. The revolution that is not Paris, 1789. Bastille Day never happened and King Louis can now count on an army of automatons who are cornering the city. The people do not pour into the streets. The fire of indignation does not spread and the French Revolution, the most important in Western history, is fading under the watchful eyes of Queen Marie Antoinette. In this particular relaxed climate we will be called to impersonate Aegis, an automaton with female features, employed as a personal guard of the queen and sent by her to track down and stop her husband who is now totally out of his mind. These are the premises of Steelrising, which opens before the player with an imagery that skilfully mixes different styles and that once again highlights the best features of Spiders. It is precisely on the narrative and world building part that Steelrising gives its best. Don't get us wrong: we are certainly not talking about a title with an extraordinary cinematic cut or full of dialogues that will remain in the common imagination. This does not mean that the general quality of the writing and the key elements of a good story are all there, sometimes watered down, others a little phoned, but never really unable to hit the mark. Living the story of Aegis, of its own awareness as a being and of the search for one's place in the world, make it a splendid metaphor of what that fundamental turning point in our history meant. Against the backdrop of a splendid Paris of the late eighteenth century, the story of Steelrising convinced us for a good part of the twenty hours necessary to conclude the campaign, also including a good amount of secondary tasks. Hunting for automatons Steelrising: The love of history is palpable To the excellent narrative component it is impossible not to combine a discussion of the gameplay. Steelrising is souls-like through and through. As a result the usual characteristics of the genre are there ready to torment, but also to stimulate, the player as they have been for more than a decade. The collection of experience that it is possible to lose with each death, the search for new rest spots to recharge one's resources, but also the enemies of the area, the growth based on points to be spent on one of the six characteristics made available to the player and so on, following the classic stereotype of the genre. We are talking about a setting so reiterated in the recent past that it becomes almost difficult to analyze it without perceiving a constant sensation of dejav. Unfortunately the ghosts of Spiders immediately reappear, designing a game with very strong problems with the pad in hand. At the beginning of the adventure it will be possible to choose between four different classes, each with an initial focus on two of the six characteristic points present and which involves a specific type of weapon already supplied. It is on these aspects that the entire combat system begins to creak, giving space to the ghosts of a talented team, but approximate on too many fronts. Steelrising: You will meet several important historical figures The animations of Aegis are unclear and difficult to interpret, often too long and the result of a hitbox cleaning job not done properly. Certainly this changes and is amplified or dampened based on the type of weapon chosen, passing from the lighter ones still capable of having a discreet feedback, but then inexorably falling on heavy weapons that have no sense of existing. Forget the chance to stage a real tank class. The relationship between the damages generated and the risk of those that can be suffered makes everything damned unfair. As if that weren't enough, stamina management is initially really punitive. Once the bar is exhausted, in fact, Aegis will go into overheating, with the risuGiven that she can only walk for several moments before being able to perform any other action, leaving her at the mercy of her opponents. It is true that it is possible to recover an immediate portion by pressing one of the front keys - along the lines of what happens with NiOh's Ki Rhythm - but the system is not very balanced, also in relation to the damage that is suffered. On the contrary, when you start dealing with firearms - even more if they are elemental, but we will get there shortly - the story changes completely, putting us in front of situations that are all too easy, which often simplify progress beyond measure. With a little familiarity, taking advantage of the agility of the Aegis and the tools that the game makes available, almost no situation is really difficult, except for a handful of main bosses who tend to exploit too many resistances to increase significantly the difficulty is artificial. We have mentioned the elements, the cornerstone of a system that allows you to exploit ice, fire and electricity to generate reactions that block opponents or continue to cause damage over time. All weapons can be upgraded, as well as recovery objects similar to Dark Souls' estus, allowing a progression of the protagonist who helps to face the succession of macro areas with ever more agility that make up the Paris imagined by Spiders. Level design and gadgets Steelrising: Aegis, the protagonist It is precisely the level design that becomes the emblem of the schizophrenia of a gameplay that changes within a few seconds, leaving the player to navigate in a limbo of fun and frustration that has left us perplexed, but also cyclically satisfied. Aegis can move between the districts of Paris using the mechanical carriage left behind by its own creator. In spite of what usually happens in derivative souls-likes such as Steelrising, Aegis can count on a series of three gadgets, including an increasingly classic grappling hook, useful both in progress and in combat and which open up new paths and a backtracking that closely resembles the structure of a classic metroidvania. Unfortunately the level design does not help to distinguish the areas well, just as the many shortcuts inserted by the team to facilitate movement are not always functional, putting the player in the position of having to use the compass in the game to easily find the way forward. The elemental powers of Steelrising The same goes for the Vestals - the equivalent of the bonfires of ~darksoulsian memory~ - who experience ups and downs in their positioning in the game. You go from checkpoints a few hundred meters away to others that require several tens of minutes to be reached and unlocked, with the evident risk of having to retrace your steps too often. To make the forced repetitiveness less frustrating, the management of the elements takes care of it. In fact, each zone tends to be more or less dependent on a specific one of them, giving players suitable defense tools and allowing them to speed up progress by exploiting the enemy's weaknesses. We appreciated that in this sense it is impossible to abuse elemental projectiles, just because they can be recovered on the field or by spending the same souls released by enemies, so as not to allow the player to exaggerate in their use. On the other hand, however, the use of firearms is independent of the depletion of stamina, putting you in a position to shoot in bursts until you generate that reaction sought and desired by the player. Technical ups and downs Steelrising: Paris is splendid in these settings Steelrising is a title that enjoys an art design and a worldbuilding that, we want to repeat it, highlights the qualities of Spiders. The steampunk-like Paris of the game is alive, vibrant, even and above all when advancing through the more rural areas which offer interesting and well-designed views. Unfortunately, all this is coupled with a general technical level very close to that of the beginning of the last generation, except for a lighting system that represents the real flagship of the game. The artificial intelligence of the opponents never stands out in the general calculation, but it is also true that the very structure of a souls-like requires a series of stakes in the routines and in the enemy's aggro that it is difficult to overcome. Perhaps we would have liked to have noticed a more interesting positioning of the opponents, which instead seems too thought out to surprise the player at the last moment or on the contrary allow him to overcome all the areas without facing practically any confrontation.]", "date": "2022-09-08", "grade": "6.8"}
