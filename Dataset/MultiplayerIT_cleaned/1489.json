{"name": "Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crimson-skies-high-road-to-revenge-3.html", "text": "Rule the sky The story, although interesting and with a very cinematic cut, is just an excuse to put on the role of a skilled pilot and dart through the skies aboard powerful aircraft. In fact, the planes and the fights on board them are the real fulcrum of the game. We will be able to fly different models, from biplanes to helicopters, characterized by a design that combines retro style with futuristic designs providing a very good and particularly stylish final result. Each model has its own characteristics and peculiarities divided into three main categories: speed, resistance and firepower. We will initially have the Devastator fighter-bomber at our disposal and in the course of the missions we will come into possession of other models: from the seaplane to the Brigand anti-airship fighter and the very fast Desert Fox interceptors. The objectives encountered from time to time are quite varied and usually involve destroying rival gangs, escorting airships, razing enemy positions and some speed races. The beauty is that during the missions we will be able to abandon our aircraft to steal another one or enter some artillery positions, both on the ground and on board the airships, all by pressing the X key when we are close to the plane or the position. This possibility is essential in the event of too serious damage to our aircraft and in addition guarantees a pinch of variety to the action, which does not hurt. Furthermore, again in the event of breakdowns to our aircraft, we will be able in real time, under enemy fire, to enter a hangar and, like a pit stop, exit perfectly repaired after a few seconds and with a few hundred dollars less. Another possibility to repair the vehicle is to collect the medikit crates that are sometimes parachuted as a reward for taking down opponents. The method of accessing the submissions is very nice: flying over the territory, blue signals will appear and once approached, by pressing the X key, we will have a new objective to complete. After completing a mission we will earn money and sometimes upgrades, these two elements will allow us to upgrade our airplane, unfortunately on already established tracks. After all this description you will wonder what the fights are like. Don't worry you haven't read so many characters and then be disappointed. In fact, the aerial duels are really well recreated and the flight sessions are marked by an absolutely arcade vision of the game, almost like a pure and simple shooter. The dogfights are so balanced, thanks to a good A.I. of opponents, and highly spectacular thanks to an excellent control system, which allows us to change direction in an instant and perform surprising maneuvers with incredible ease. With the left analog stick we will drive the steering wheel, with the right one we will have access to the evolutions, with the two triggers we will use the firearms, with the X key we will access the submissions, with Y we will use the turbo, with B the ~brakes~ and with the D-pad we will change the view. The disengagement maneuvers from enemy fire are truly beautiful, which can be carried out by pressing the right analog stick: do you have an enemy in the queue? A nice Immelmann maneuver allows you to rotate 180 on yourself and thus find him in front of you, a nightmare for enemies. Rule the world Technically Crimson Skies is truly splendid. The beauty is that the framerate never suffers and travels stable and without indecision even in the most chaotic situations. The speed effect is good even if perhaps it could have been increased slightly, however risking making the title too frenetic. Therefore, I would not single it out as a lack, but rather as a stylistic choice, fully to be approved especially with a nod to the clashes on Xbox Live. The environments that form the backdrop to the adventures are very well recreated, even if not all of them have been excellently designed, unfortunately some stylistic choices that are not exactly happy are evident. However, all the scenarios are very large, which is already uncommon in an air combat game and, thanks to the beautiful light and shadow effects, they are striking in their beauty. The camera does its duty by remaining only behind the back of our aircraft, in fact the developers have not included alternative views, much less the one from the cockpit. The effect of the motion blur used to render the effect of the engine heat is very nice, as well as the bump mapping on the whole nacelle of the vehicle. The developers were also very good at perfectly recreating those monsters of the air that are airships, shooting them down gives an enormousand satisfaction also because, after a severe dose of bullets, they fall apart, showing their internal structure and catching fire, often breaking into two sections. A particular mention should also be made to the interlude films of a cinematic nature, with the protagonists very well animated and with perfect synchrony between the lips of the characters and their exclamations. The dubbing of the American version is also very good, unfortunately, however, there has been no form of adaptation for Italy. The game is entirely in English and even without the possibility of inserting subtitles, certainly making it more difficult to understand the plot and the objectives of the submissions once activated. The music is quite successful even if it can get tiring in the long run. Encounters on the net No, not in the fishing net but on the Xbox Live servers. Indeed, Crimson Skies fully supports Microsoft's online gaming service, both from the point of view of downloadable content (new missions, new planes, etc.) and from the actual online game. There are six modes to choose from and they vaguely recall, and with due proportions, those already present in a very popular title among users who love Live: Midtown Madness. Dogfight is the first and perhaps also the most intuitive to understand, a free-for-all fight with points, each opponent killed is worth a point and whoever scores the most points within a time limit wins. This mode is also playable in teams. Flag Heist is the classic capture the flag, you have to take the flag from the opponent's base and bring it to your own, it's the only way to score points. Another possibility is the Keep Away, after having conquered an artifact you have to keep it for as long as possible. Finally Wild Chicken, there is a wild chicken in the wild and to score points you have to capture it and bring it to the base, the problem is that the other team wants it too. It is perhaps needless to say but the game is perfect for Live, the clashes are always exciting and full of suspense. The title also constitutes a valid alternative to what is now running on the net, behaving almost like a first person shooter but with a setting that fully conveys the sense of freedom that one feels when flying in the skies. The game supports matches of up to 16 players, that's a lot! The lag is practically always absent and depends a lot on the connection of the host, possibly just set a smaller number of aircraft for the game to run smoothly without problems. All this is crowned by statistics updated in real time on all participants in the clashes. Comment Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, pulling the strings, turns out to be a really good title, technically very valid, fairly long-lived (it ends in about 12-14 hours) in single player and practically infinite if played on Xbox Live. It is certainly not a perfect game, and the defects found in the review do not make it one of the absolute masterpieces, especially if played in single player where it risks being repetitive. Of course, if played online, the situation changes a lot and you will never detach yourself from the joystick, ah sorry from the joypad. The purchase is therefore recommended to all lovers of the genre and to all holders of an account on Xbox Live. Pros: Beautiful aircraft and excellent combat Technically fabulous A must for Live account holders Cons: It is not possible to freely customize the aircraft It risks being repetitive Lack of adaptation in Italian Directors and writers more than once tried to analyze how history would have changed if some events had turned out differently. What if the Western Roman Empire hadn't fallen? What if Hitler and Nazi Germany had won the war? The world would certainly have been very different from how we know it. It is the so-called parallel universe theory that makes us understand how sometimes single choices manage to influence the course of events, in this regard how can we forget the beautiful book by Robert Harris Fatherland? One of these universes is the backdrop to the adventures of Nathan Zachary, the protagonist of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge. Set in America in the 1930s, the title developed by Fasa Studio sees us in command of a group of air pirates, the Fortune Hunters, grappling with various problems, first of all the revenge for the death of an old friend, the Doctor Fassenbiender. America, portrayed in our history, however, we must not imagine it as the one destroyed by the Wall Street crisis and dominated by gangsters, much has changed: the Unionand it no longer exists, communications between nation-states have collapsed, and the only reliable means of travel are planes. Zachary, together with his crew, is a bit of the Robin Hood of the situation and steals from those who have too much to help those who have nothing. Of course, no thief is welcome and therefore Nathan sometimes, if not always, has to take the loot by force, thanks to his exceptional ability to pilot any vehicle that flies at least ten centimeters from the ground. An intriguing storyline therefore forms the backdrop to the latest title from Microsoft Game Studios and is only the beginning.", "date": "2003-11-12", "grade": null}
