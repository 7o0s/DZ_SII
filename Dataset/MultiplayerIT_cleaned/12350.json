{"name": "Spectrobes - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spectrobes-recensione.html", "text": "Spectrobes? The joke on identity that in theory you should have read just before starting this paragraph refers to Disney's choice to ape the Japanese style, especially of anime and manga, to characterize the design, setting and plot of Spectrobes . A sincerely inexplicable will, given that Disney certainly doesn't lack the talent to create original worlds full of personality: the result is therefore a sort of Japanese production which, however, is not Japanese, and the feeling is strange, it takes a while to adapt to the graphic style halfway between a manga and an American comic, and to the oriental names that sound more funny than realistic. In the end, the result is not too bad, but from those who have baked Il Pianeta del Tesoro we sincerely expect something more, sci-fi speaking. The protagonist, however, is a nice and well-characterized speck all in all: Rallen is a kind of space policeman, and together with his colleague Jeena he finds himself dealing with a threat far beyond his reach as a messer and daredevil, at the moment in which while inspecting a planet he comes across an old scientist looking for a way to save the galaxy from the threat of the alien Krawl. The solution could be in the Spectrobes, creatures believed to be extinct with enormous powers, capable of countering the Krawl in combat: the very advanced technology of the old Aeonus, however, will allow Rallen to find the Spectrobes fossils and bring them back to life to build an army to oppose to the lethal advance of the Krawl. The digging phase is one of the funniest playful elements in Spectrobes, rivaling the classic capture using Pokballs in an intelligent and original way: using a Spectrobes puppy it is possible to detect the presence of minerals in the various areas that are explored, useful for enhancing the Spectrobes in incubation, or of fossils of other Spectrobes. Once you have found a fossil, you proceed to brush the earth and dust off the bones with the nib, being very careful not to damage them: for this operation it is possible to choose between various types of tools, which allow different intensities and precisions during the operation of recovery. It is even possible to blow on the microphone to be able to blow away the dust and obtain greater visibility of the fossil. It is certainly an engaging mini-game that helps to make the discovery and growth of the Spectrobes more interesting: the fossils brought to light, in fact, will be placed in a sort of incubation chamber and modified with the various minerals and items recovered around the galaxy, which will change their fighting skills. Oh yes, because exactly as in Pokmon, even in the Jupiter production there is a need to fight. Gonna beat 'em all! Rallen will be able to take up to six Spectrobes on his peregrinations through the Nanairo star system, and two at a time will help him fight the Krawl, while the others will passively influence the main party's abilities with some bonuses: the Krawl manifest themselves in the 3D scenarios in the form of small black cyclones, coming into contact with them, a sort of three-dimensional arena will quickly load in which we will directly control the polygonal model of Rallen, with his brave Spectrobes alongside. Rallen's offensive capabilities are mediocre, a long-range weapon and a sword, the true strength of the young hero lies precisely in the two creatures that follow him: some simple key combinations, which however will create some confusion at the beginning, allow you to unleash the Spectrobes' normal and special attacks against enemies. As simple and spectacular as it is, the possibility of facing enemies in real-time, which was missing in Pokmon, is negatively influenced by the lack of a real ~lock-on~ that allows you to direct the shots of the space creatures towards certain enemies: the Spectrobes simply attack empty, good for us if the Krawl to be defeated are in the trajectory of their blows. Generally it's not a really annoying problem, but when only one enemy is in the combat area, and maybe a small one, you find yourself just hoping you don't hit the air. Furthermore, during the clashes it is possible to load a sort of super-move that combines the destructive capabilities of the two Spectrobes, giving rise to spectacular pyrotechnic sequences: the power of this attack and the simplicity of execution sometimes make it the fastest way to finish a fight, somewhat limiting the variety and difficulty of the fights, especially in the first hours of the game. However, the central element of the concept in Spectrobes is not the combat phase, but precisely thata game of locating and recovering fossils and objects around the galaxy, moving from one planet to another to increase our collection of alien warriors while defeating the various Krawls, completing the imposed and optional missions, advancing in a simple but all in all engaging and with some very pleasant twists and turns, expanded by the ~web-episodes~ that can be downloaded from the Internet. The quality of the texts in Italian, excellent, helps a lot in this sense. And the myriad of things to do makes Spectrobes last longer than it would be by simply following the main-quest, which can be completed in a few hours. The gestation of the Spectrobes in the incubator allows you to feed them, caress them and lead them to their evolved states by checking their statistics and fighting skills: all these activities revolve around the research and unearthing of fossils, minerals and Cubes (objects that, once found, unlock new game options), an activity which, however fun, especially considering the breadth and variety of explorable scenarios, tends to become tiring in the long run. Anti-Pokmon, DS version The technical quality of Spectrobes is remarkable, and Jupiter demonstrates once again a great talent. The polygonal models of Rallen, his adventure companions and the Spectrobes are perhaps a little small, but full of excellent, fluid animations, especially in combat. Some narrative sequences are made completely in three dimensions, and combined with the great variety of artwork that represent the characters during the dialogues, one has the sensation of witnessing a kind of semi-animated manga. Certainly lacks that personality which we spoke of at the beginning, we note that the orientalization of the character design is decidedly forced, but the sympathy of the cast and the Spectrobes makes this misstep soon forgotten. The graphics engine performs extremely well, especially during fights and outdoors: the aesthetic variety of the environments makes their linearity less noticeable than it actually is, above all thanks to the choice to extend the display to both DS screens. The result is a convincing polygonal engine, despite the textures, which are not particularly bright and rather washed out. The musical accompaniment is certainly not unforgettable, but the variety of soundtracks, which differ from planet to planet, does not make it repetitive at all, but rather pleasant and spot on. Technically, then, a title that boldly pushes the capabilities of the DS, while falling short of the quality of products like Final Fantasy III. And the cards? Inside the Spectrobes package there are plastic cards that are very reminiscent of those of the Trading Card Games. Their function is actually quite different. You will notice that they are perforated in various points, and that each card shows a Spectrobe: by unlocking the appropriate option after having found a certain Cube, it will be possible to place a card on the Touch Screen and touch it with the stylus in correspondence with the aforementioned holes: et voil, a new Spectrobe will be added to your collection! The variety of cards that can be purchased together with the game opens up a very interesting range of possibilities and exchanges: a really nice idea, which we hope will be recovered and expanded later on by many other games. Comment The only real flaw of Spectrobes is Jupiter Corporation's will in a certain sense to exaggerate: in Spectrobes there is really too much to do, but everything revolves around the activity of digging for fossils, in the long run more tedious than exciting. However, the amount of ideas packed into this cartridge is staggering, and many of them are great, if not brilliant. Greater care for the visual rendering, especially chromatic, more personality and greater difficulty in the fights would have made Spectrobes a small masterpiece: instead it is ~only~ the archenemy of Pokmon, a really fun action-JRPG, excellently packaged and probably the basis launch of a massive commercial operation that will develop over time. Will it be able to stay young like the infinite Nintendo series? Pros: Original and well developed concept Full of ideas and very varied Simple and fun combat system Cons: Rather low difficulty Ugly textures A bit repetitive There is no doubt that Pokmon have had a significant impact on the imagination of game-designers, and the original pair that started the so-called ~Pokmania~, namely the Red and Blue editions for the Game Boy, have been cloned so many of those times (even by Nintendo itself for the various sequels, to be honest) that there are no longer many video games based on the concept of breeding fighting monsters. And then downMonster Rancher and Digimon, without counting all the variants inserted as entertainment in any kind of title that justified its presence, especially of the J-RPG type. Close to the launch of the new generation of Pokmon, embodied in the Diamond and Pearl versions for Nintendo DS, Disney is even churning out its version of Pokmon, assisted by the remarkable ability of the Jupiter programmers, already authors of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories . The result exceeds the expectations of a dull copy of the mythical adventures of Pikachu and his companions, proposing itself as the ideal beginning of a series that could make Japanese pocket monsters tremble.
