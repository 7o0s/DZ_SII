Available from March 10, 2022, this cooperative brawler - RPG immerses us in a small war between humans and goblins. Let's see all the details in our Young Souls review. Plot and characters Young Souls twins slay goblins We are Tristan and Jenn, twins who, about a year before the start of the adventure, were adopted by the ~Professor~, an academic with the air of a mad scientist (but harmless). The two boys are independent and above all they are petty criminals, who skip school and go around on a moped trying to get alcohol served even if they are minors. The Professor, however, is the classic genius so focused on his research that he forgets to eat. What does man study? As we will soon discover, under the town where our people live - Portsbourgh - there is a huge system of caves within which a goblin civilization proliferates. These have kidnapped the professor and it is our job to go and save him, with the help of some goblins who have rebelled against the underground tyrant who is moving the ranks of a war which - as we see from the very first moments of the game - is destined to get to the surface. From this moment, a simple and linear story will open, during which the twins will be able to get to know all the generals of the goblin army, passing from the necromancer to the brilliant inventor, up to the shapeshifting spy. Between the two parts, the game delves more into the enemies rather than the heroes, leading us to understand what moves them and trying to make us understand that they too are people, not monsters without a soul. However, they are simple characters, characterized by few elements and while understanding them they fail to attract the player's sympathy too much. While Tristan and Jenn will doubt their own actions during this war, the tone remains very light, going against what are clearly the goals of the developers. From our point of view, the plot doesn't have the ardor to completely reverse the fronts, it never has the courage to say clearly that in all of this we too are as bad as our enemies. Above all, the twins are all too simple characters, bad boys with a heart of gold, with the ready joke that they are trying to feel like part of the family and are trying to call the Professor for what he is: their ~father~. All of this emerges in a few dialogues, but it lacks depth and the game doesn't focus enough on them to make their difficulties really engaging. Young Souls, in essence, offers a story that flows without too many problems, but lacks sophistication. Brawlers and RPGs The Twins of Young Souls will have the support of some goblins As mentioned, the plot leads us to explore the goblin caves, which we can access thanks to a series of teleporters. The structure of the game world is very simple: each area has its own access point and we can return to it freely. Our goal, therefore, is to be able to defeat all enemies in each level, which is always structured in a linear way, a row of rooms with a boss or mini-boss at the end. If you die, you lose nothing and start over from the beginning of the level. Each area tends to be very small and the major bosses have the teleport in front of the arena, so even in case of defeat you won't have to repeat long sections of the game. This is an important detail because, especially at the recommended difficulty and especially if you play alone, defeat will not be rare at all. Young Souls is a game with an upward level of challenge, with enemies capable of eliminating us in a few hits and with entire battles based on the use of parry. Let me be clear, lowering to ~Relax~ (minimum difficulty) and overcoming the first stages (more difficult than the later ones), you can reach the conclusion without too much effort, but if you want to play in the way intended by the developers, you will have to accept having a a few times from each boss, at least until you get the hang of the basics of combat. One of the first boss fights of Young Souls As already mentioned at the beginning, Young Souls is a mix between a brawler and an RPG. Our characters can perform normal attacks with their weapon (swords, knives, axes, hammers...), which have a certain attack speed, a certain range and obviously attack stats, but also additional effects (both positive and negative). Then there is no shortagea special attack that consumes mana, to be recovered by attacking and parrying. The latter are essential at the highest difficulties: in a nutshell, it is a parry performed at the last second that completely cancels the damage suffered and stuns the enemy, blocking him and making him vulnerable to critical damage. The bosses, however, will have to suffer many parries in a row in rapid succession, which obliges the user to play well and continuously to achieve their result. At Relax it is possible to attack with your head down without worrying too much about the opponent's moves (even if some dodging and some parries must still be done), but at Recommended you have to play well, otherwise a quick game over. In two players the matter is slightly different, since it is possible to manage groups more easily and it is possible to press the bosses, avoiding getting stuck in a mix of missed parries. Young Souls is based on the fact that you have two characters at your disposal, but fortunately even in single player the thing is not lost. First of all, if one of the two characters dies, the second one comes onto the field immediately and allows us (a limited number of times) to resurrect the other. Also, if you take damage, a portion of the lost life points can be recovered by changing the active character. Switching from one character to another is therefore a useful strategy, also because each twin has his own equipment: by choosing different weapons and armor, we will be able to create a slow but powerful twin, and a quick but more fragile twin, so as to allow him to face enemies different. In this sense, it is also possible to condition the growth of the twins' statistics to ~specialize~ them. In addition to the normal level ups (which assign the same improvements to the statistics to both) we will be able to exploit (a limited number of times defined by the game) a gym to train one of the three statistics of the character, so as to focus more on the attack, on the points life or stamina. Finally, we can upgrade weapons and equipment, although it will only make sense to do so in the final stages, when we will have access to the best items. A training mini-game to power up the twins from Young Souls The problem with Young Souls, from this point of view, is that it tries to merge two types of game that struggle to stay together. The GDR side is not only unoriginal, but has little room to express itself. The adventure is all in all short and various of the tools that we will obtain will be of little use if not useless. We've tried a mix of all difficulties, so our playtime is hardly representative of a player who picks one and never changes, but in Relax it's probably possible to finish the whole storyline and explore some of the secondary areas in less than 6 hours. On higher difficulties, due to regular deaths, it will take several hours longer. Furthermore, the number of hours will be conditioned by the willingness to explore each secondary area and backtrack to recover lost treasures (which require special keys to be unlocked in subsequent areas). In any case, at the end we will have the impression that we have not had much power over the enhancement of the two boys and we will find ourselves not using various objects at our disposal because they are too weak. However, the combat system is always pleasant, especially in the more advanced phases during which the characters have enough stamina to perform more dodges and weapons with various charges for special attacks, which - together with charged attacks, reloading tools (bombs, bows, mines, grappling hooks...) and sprint shots - they help to make each fight fairly varied. The RPG side can be seen at best as a decent way to vary the pace of the action a bit but, if it is the component that interests you the most, this is not the game to play. Our advice is therefore to play Young Souls if you are a brawler lover and especially if you can play with a friend in local cooperative or, on Steam, via Steam Remote Play.", "date": "2022-03-18", "grade": "7.2"}
