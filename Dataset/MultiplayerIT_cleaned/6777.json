It wasn't an RPG, as perhaps someone expected from the graphics, and it wasn't an adventure, given the absence of puzzles, but the fact is that the visual novel set up by Kan Gao struck us straight to the heart, as happened on very few other videogame occasions: he succeeded mainly thanks to a story that remained indelibly impressed on anyone who had the opportunity to complete it. Since then, we have done nothing but wait for news from Freebird Games, which has finally satisfied us with A Bird Story: if you are already rejoicing, calm down for a moment, because in reality it is not a sequel to To The Moon, but a short that actually introduces the character we will see in the next game, telling us part of the story that will see him as the protagonist. In fact, he will be the new subject treated by Sigmund Corp and by the couple of doctors Watts and Rosalene, who on this occasion do not appear at all. After having loved To The Moon, however it may be, we wouldn't have missed the chance to try A Bird Story, which arrived a few days ago in digital delivery together with a special offer that until November 14th allows you to buy it at discounted price, compared to the approximately 4 euro ~list~: pack of handkerchiefs, here is our report. After To The Moon, Kan Gao and Freebird Games are back with A Bird Story: ready to cry again? New emotions Those who expected differences in terms of gameplay compared to To The Moon, perhaps with greater interaction dynamics, will undoubtedly be taken aback by A Bird Story, where the elements left in the player's hands are even less than those seen in the past. For this prequel, Kan Gao has in fact further reduced the few game components seen in the 2011 title, to give life to the essential storytelling, halfway between dream and reality. The player is simply called to move the protagonist boy with the directional arrows, collecting objects or on rare occasions tackling some slightly more articulated sections, which paradoxically end up out of tune in the context and interrupt the rhythm of the narrative. But let's get to the gist of the story, on which we obviously don't want to anticipate anything more than necessary: A Bird Story opens by showing us the life of a rather lonely boy, with few friends and absent parents, who limit themselves to communicating with him through posts. it left on doors and tables. One day, returning from school, the child saves a bird from being attacked by another animal, but failing to prevent it from hurting its wing: from this moment, a strong bond will be born capable of giving both something , of those that anyone who has ever truly loved an animal in their life will not struggle to understand. Although it is all too easy to deal with the feelings one experiences in identifying with a relationship of affection towards a sweet little animal, Kan Gao exploits an apparently trivial story to put his own into it, introducing some particularly touching moments into the game: it doesn't reach the heights of To The Moon, but the hour required to complete A Bird Story still ends up leaving something for the player. To be taken from To The Moon are also the more or less evident quotations from other works, as in this case are those from Super Mario and the same title from 2011, given that the child protagonist soon turns out to be a lover of paper airplanes (remember the rabbits?). Silent story Although the story is the master, even in this sense everything has been reduced to a minimum: in fact, there are no dialogues in A Bird Story. Not even a single letter. But it is precisely this that gives the short story the emotional strength it needs: the dreamlike atmospheres and the very absence of dialogues let us think that the story of this prequel to the sequel is lived through the equipment of Sigmund Corp, thus digging inside inside the memories of the character who, as already mentioned, will become the protagonist of the next game, within which the puzzle will be completed. The idea of revealing the title of the new game at the end of A Bird Story is excellent: we won't say what it is, leaving you the pleasure of discovery too. From a technical point of view, A Bird Story retains all the characterizing elements of To The Moon, starting from the 16-bit graphic style appreciated on the occasion of the latter. In some game sequences, hand-crafted landscapes can be seen in the background, able to fascinate the player, already enraptured by the attention to detail placed by Kan Gao in the creation of the adventure. In fact, the absence of dialogues makes the presence of some visual references to stills of the story told by A Bird Story even more important, supported by a soundtrack that is once again of the highest level: also on this occasion, the main instrument is the piano, using which Kan Gao proves once again that he can come up with incredible melodies, capable of entering the head and never coming out again.", "date": "2014-11-10", "grade": "8.5"}
