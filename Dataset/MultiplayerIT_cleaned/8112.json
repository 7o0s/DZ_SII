Kamitani's latest effort took his time: about 6 years distance this work from Dragon's Crown, another little jewel of the Japanese team that was so prolific on PlayStation 2, but which then slowly got lost in increasingly long times. It is understandable: this, like the previous games, have many things to tell but 13 Sentinels has that extra quid, that passage from action title to graphic novel that colors the future of Vanillaware with wonder. We have already reviewed 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PlayStation 4 in its time; today we face a port that couldn't be easier, for this reason we think the timing is more the result of a commercial agreement than anything else. Yes, because Switch could manage five of 13 Sentinels: the polygonal complexity and the structure are rightly dry, leaving the ball completely in the hands of the narrative and the artistic sector. So let's see whether or not this transition to handheld benefits that gorgeous workmanship in our review of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim for Nintendo Switch. A present that comes from the past The narration of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is the most distinctive, successful and fascinating feature It is difficult to tell the management of times and methods in George Kamitani's story: 13 Sentinels goes, comes, passes through the eras and generations of the characters involved, narrating the journey up to the final moment, that of truth, a sort of journey from the past to the present. It's a Japanese-tinged world in the soul, which is not afraid to show its nature: from supporting characters to mechs, from kaiju to classrooms, from dialogues to the succinct design of young ladies. Passion and tradition blend with elegance, drawing a world as always ethereal, warm in its features, apocalyptic but with hope: in short, the condensed Japan of JRPGs, which from the 90s to today carries on alone the baton of an expression of the Rising Sun proud and timeless. If we have even a little intrigued you, know that the apparent playful lightness of 13 Sentinels hides much more going forward, supporting a management of the characters and the progress of the story that is rarely so coherent and eager not to make the player get lost in rivers of disconnected text. For all the details, we refer you to the review: if instead you are here to find out if the epics of the sentinels can be experienced on Switch, the answer is more than affirmative, thanks to an excellent port that does full justice to the team's ambition, guaranteeing excellent readability and narrative fluency. Looks good even on a small screen 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim presents a dry, fast gameplay but capable of giving excellent strategic emotions If you read these lines, it is evident that you like Japanese titles, especially the more authorial ones: with 13 Sentinels, Vanillaware has outdone itself, offering an extremely fascinating setting, characterized by the right colors, by sweet and competent strokes but above all by a background time ecosystem dragging in. We are talking about a product that tells between the ages, alternating a flow of dialogues and backstory by jumping between characters, slowly leading you to try the sentinels, savor their history. The splendid thing is that the Switch screen lends itself impressively to enjoying of Vanillaware creation: the greatest value of Nintendo's hybrid once again takes the chair, demonstrating once again how being able to live an experience of this narrative caliber in any place you want is a huge plus. 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim relies entirely on its artistic charge, giving animated tables with a pastel style and sublime parallax transitions, also indulged for gameplay purposes, especially in the more scholastic part of the title. The reality is that it is quite a software simple to run on Switch: the transition between battles and story is like watching day and night of a title that has been able to divide the two aspects, leaving the fights to keep players hooked between one section and another. Everything works very well: 13 Sentinels on Switch catapults you into a futuristic world where a splendid fight for survival can be experienced in portability with performances equal to those of the big screen. It must be said that sporadic random drops can be glimpsed, but we are convinced it is only the result of an optimization made a little bit in a hurry.", "date": "2022-04-05", "grade": "9.0"}
