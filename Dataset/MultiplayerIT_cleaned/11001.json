{"name": "NBA 2K9 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k9-recensione_a.html", "text": "Automatic updates However, the biggest news among those heralded to the four winds is the continuous updating of the rosters via the internet. How does it work? On a regular basis (it is not known how much) updated data on the roster is sent to the game in order to keep it abreast of what is happening on the pitch in the NBA championship. Is a player in bad shape? Here he becomes a jug even in the game. An unknown young man coaching champions in a series of matches? Here he is, as a poor player, he rises in rank obtaining a higher quotation. Obviously such a feature is much more appreciated the higher the degree of involvement in the game of basketball and the deeper the knowledge of the NBA championship. In short, if you follow all the matches with interest, study the results and performances of the real championship, finding them reflected in the game has a certain effect. Otherwise this feature almost completely loses interest. Furthermore, it is also true that virtual matches should be something separate from reality. If one of my players was impeccable during a game, why should he be penalized in the virtual world if he behaved like a crook in reality? In this way there is the feeling of playing something derivative and not very malleable by the player, even if it must be said that many love this system of updates. To conclude with this argument, let's cut the bull's head by saying that liking it or not is a mere matter of personal preference. NBA 2K9 is available for PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360. The tested version is the PC version. Sports games are very difficult to make, especially when you choose the path of forced serialization and you have to fight every year with the need to say something new to make sense of the current edition. The war between FIFA and PES teaches that, in case some defects are underlined from year to year, it becomes necessary to get a handle on them, while touching strengths can be detrimental and worsen a product that even the fans have shown they love (and have bought ) enormously. For basketball the story is not very different, despite the fact that in Italy the war for the podium of the genre is not as heated and felt as that of football. Compared to past editions the changes are minimal. Depending on the point of view this can be good or bad, but there is no doubt that, since it is a series of qualities, it is difficult to do better every year (even if certain requests from gamers could be listened to, read the paragraph on the system of control) and it is also unthinkable to claim to revolutionize a winning formula every time. In reality there are some novelties, such as some adjustments in the shots, some rules made more elastic in the application and a greater difficulty in the blocked marking (all too easy in the 2K8 edition). There is also a general improvement in artificial intelligence. In fact, the CPU behaves more realistically than in the past and develops tactics more relevant to countering those of the player. It should be noted that these improvements are not perceived much at the lower difficulty levels, i.e. facing teams of brocchi. To fully enjoy it, you have to push yourself to challenge the teams with the best values, when you have a certain mastery of the game (if you still don't quite understand the function of the different keys and you haven't worked out your own winning automatisms, don't push yourself against, for example, the Celtics they would slaughter you). Only in this way will it be possible to notice how the opponents tend to block continuously repeated tactics by adapting as necessary and only in this way will it be necessary to change tactics several times during a game, studying how to respond to those of the opponents. Like on TV Comment NBA 2K9 is yet another confirmation of a series that needs no confirmation. The final product is excellent, despite some historical flaws that it carries with it from different chapters. Recommended for all fans of the game of basketball, even if those who already own the previous versions may find little reason to switch to this one.Pros Spectacular A myriad of options Periodic roster update Cons Difficult control system Few major changes Commentary in English only PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Operating System: Windows XP / Vista Processor: Pentium 4 2.4 GHz Single Core or equivalent (2.8 GHz for Vista) RAM: 512 MB or more (1 GB for Vista) Video Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible 10.5 GB of hard disk space Test Configuration Processor: Intel Quad-Core Q6600 RAM: 3 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT with 512 MB of memory Control system One ofthe features that should definitely be reviewed is the control system. Let's try to understand each other: when you get a certain mastery and are able to apply all the functions by heart, it's not that bad and, indeed, a complex system allows you to have greater depth of play than one that is too simplified. So, in general, we can consider it positive. The problem is that sometimes the difficulty is too much due to a series of details that turn out to be frustrating. Let's take free throws. As in past editions, to put the ball in the basket it will be necessary to study the animation of the different players and release the shoot button at the right time to launch the ball. More than a penalty for the opposing team, free throws appear to be a penalty for the human player. But let's take another case: steps. The system for passing the ball is very simple (just press a button). The problem is that, at least initially, you can't figure out why it often doesn't go to the player you want to pass it to. After a while you understand the system (you can also help yourself with the electronic manual) and you manage to master it properly, but you will realize for yourself that these difficulties in the learning curve risk keeping a large chunk out of the game of gamers, perhaps simply intrigued by the game who, however, in front of certain rocks risk inevitably throwing in the towel. Obviously we are not asking for a simplified control system in the sense of trivializing it, but it would be nice if certain actions were made simpler and more intuitive. In reality, fans have been asking for a simplification in this sense for years... let's hope FIFA teaches and the developers listen to certain requests sooner or later.", "date": "2008-12-01", "grade": null}
