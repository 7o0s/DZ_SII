{"name": "The Last Case of Benedict Fox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-recensione.html", "text": "Who died prematurely in 1937 in poverty, the American writer H.P. Lovecraft could never have imagined the clear fame that awaited him in any medium: adaptations of his literary works have reached cinemas and splendid comics, and his influence has also extended to the videogame field. The case of Bloodborne is famous, while Call of Cthulhu is more faithful to the original materials; we have recently been able to appreciate the excellent fishing simulator Dredge, in which the exploration of the seas went well with the sense of mystery that reigns in the stories of the Providence writer. Lovecraft, employed as he could in the marketing of many videogame products, has now become an empty advertising slogan with a now vague, unclear, indecipherable meaning like the mysterious beings who populate his writings, entities that the human eye cannot guess nor fully describe. After concluding the adventures of the Plot Twist detective, we can say that The Last Case of Benedict Fox - whose marketing has repeatedly referred to the famous writer himself - has very little of the atmospheres and themes that characterized the production of the illustrious author referred to: the tentacles of the monstrous being accompanying Benedict are not enough to be worth a hook which, in this case, seems completely remote, both on the narrative front and on that of the gameplay. We tell you about our experience in 1925 occult Boston in the review of The Last Case of Benedict Fox. In the name of the father Benedict Fox's father's mansion serves as a central hub for the detective's adventures of the occult Boston, Massachusetts, 1925. It's a dark and stormy night, and Detective Benedict Fox sneaks into a mansion to find out more about his past. His investigation concerns the figure of the father, an individual associated with the occult who, it seems, hides much more than a secret. Without too many preambles - so much so that the introduction is rather hasty, if not confusing for the player - we discover that Benedict is joined by a monstrous, dark and sprawling entity, beautifully characterized with a creepy dubbing: this companion, as we shall see, has a strong emphasis also from the gameplay point of view, resulting in an essential support in the combat and exploration phases. The plot of The Last Case of Benedict Fox proceeds, with some interesting twists, as Benedict gradually enters the exploration of Limbo, an otherworldly space dominated by demons and magic, discovering the detective's past and that of his enigmatic father. We appreciated the warning about the sensitive contents of the work, which can be shown or not with the simple push of a button, with all due respect to those who believe that such warnings constitute intolerable spoilers for the player: it is a solution that we hope to see more often in the future. By revealing the mysteries related to the fate of the inhabitants of the mansion - which acts as a central hub for the protagonist and his supporting actors - we delve further and further into a plot which, despite some undoubtedly interesting premises, fails to maintain a good pace and, above all, it expires in a far from exciting ending. In the overall economy of the work, the management of the progression is particularly problematic, often hindered by excessive backtracking and the absence of clues on how to advance the events involving Benedict and associates. Descent into Limbo from The Last Case of Benedict Fox The various areas of Limbo are really well characterized: the artistic direction is the strong point of The Last Case of Benedict Fox Our demonic companion has the ability to lead us into the past of Benedict's father and other characters we will meet during the adventure, projecting us into a Limbo which, as in the most classic metroidvanias, proves to be articulated and labyrinthine to explore. The settings present are many and demonstrate painstaking care from the point of view of the care of the backdrops; shame about the platform phases, sometimes linked to the need for absolute precision which clashes with the poor refinement dedicated to the inputs, not always responsive to the commands given by the player. The map is very clear, beautiful to look at and easily readable, with an indication of the passages that Benedict can open with the use of the skills he will gradually acquire during the game; shame about the absence of indicators (a classic circular marker would have been ideal) to keep track of the places you want to return to later. Unfortunately, Thand Last Case of Benedict Fox is overwhelming in immediately offering the player dozens and dozens of unopenable doors, unsolvable puzzles, unusable objects accumulated in the inventory, with the sole, exclusive purpose of providing the player with details (often interesting) on the plot: we are, however, inside an interactive work and video games like Dark Souls teach that it is very possible to combine information and functionality, adding depth to the gameplay through the objects found within the settings. The exploration of Limbo is often made difficult by the absence of indications on how to continue and by the presence, right from the start, of an infinite number of doors and puzzles that cannot be approached until much later in the adventure This overabundance of unimportant objects in the gameplay, combined with the unfortunate structure of the exploration - on more than one occasion we found ourselves wandering lost in the settings, with no clue as to how to continue - suggests that The Last Case of Benedict Fox could have benefited from adequate testing before launch and, in our opinion, also given the technical problems we will discuss shortly, it could certainly have enjoyed an extension of its development period. And it's a shame, because the areas crossed by Benedict are often splendid to see, full of details and little gems that will certainly delight fans of horror atmospheres. In terms of puzzles - not always very simple, and sometimes based on the association between symbols and numbers - we found the approach adopted by Plot Twist ideal: the difficulty is fully customizable and if you wish you can choose (even during the adventure, perhaps on a specific occasion that the player finds particularly difficult) to use an automatic resolution option, by pressing a dedicated key. The difficulty of fighting and exploration can also be adjusted, for a widely modular and accessible experience even for newbies, provided that the lack of clarity in the aforementioned progression is taken into account. Gun, knife and tentacles The fights of The Last Case of Benedict Fox are compromised by poor legibility of enemy movements and attacks Benedict Fox and his companion find themselves facing both the ~basic~ demonic beings that populate Limbo, and real bosses. With regard to the latter, we point out the presence of some clashes affected by the need to enter input with absolute precision: as for the exploration phases, also in these cases the technical limitations of The Last Case of Benedict Fox, at the moment - we hope for improvements introduced with later patches - make some battles simply maddening, also because Benedict's death forces you to start over from the last checkpoint, not always very close to the boss. A few bugs don't help, a fairly frequent stuttering (even though our game machine was above the minimum requirements indicated on the game's Steam page) and the occasional crashes that forced us to retrace sometimes quite extensive phases of the adventure, whose duration is around ten hours. Benedict fights with a dagger, a pistol (whose shots are reloaded by carrying out white weapon attacks, a bit as seen recently in the excellent Hunt the Night) and he also makes use of the powers of his demonic companion, gradually enhanced by tattoos given to the detective by a mysterious woman. The tattoo system constitutes, to all intents and purposes, the game's skill tree, but its linearity prevents the inclusion of elements that would have provided originality and greater characterization possibilities to the character, with the result of tracing a one-way path, always the same. Power-ups are purchased from the tattoo artist by bringing her ink, earned through exploration and drawn from the bodies of defeated enemies; Benedict's death causes him to lose the ink collected and not ~fixed~ in the teleportation points, and the same can be recovered by returning to the point of the protagonist's premature death. Some boss battles in The Last Case of Benedict Fox are flawless, while others lead to aggravation due to inaccurate hitboxes and unresponsiveness of the system to player inputs The fights are interesting on paper, but they are woody and unhappy due - once again - to imprecise hitboxes and particularly intrusive visual effects, such as to prevent a clear reading of what is happening on the screen. Enemy animations aren't always distinct, and Benedict's posture (always hunched overforward) does not make it easy to predict whether he will be hit or not. We have sometimes found the use of the parry complex, more due to the technical limitations mentioned above than due to a difficulty in understanding the system, which is in itself rather simple. The hope is that, over time, Plot Twist will improve the situation; at the moment, however, we cannot consider The Last Case of Benedict Fox a satisfying experience in terms of the combat system. Instead, we appreciated the excellent translation into Italian, with excellent texts both in the descriptions of the objects and in the subtitles of the dialogues; the English dubbing is, in general, of an excellent level, albeit with incomprehensible drops in quality for some characters (the tattoo artist above all). The audio sector is interesting, with truly remarkable environmental effects if appreciated with headphones, combined with sounds that refer to the beginnings of jazz.", "date": "2023-05-02", "grade": "6.0"}
