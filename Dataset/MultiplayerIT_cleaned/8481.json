And in any case, there's no denying that Metal Gear Solid has influenced the way video games are made in the last decade. Its impact on the market has been deadly, much more than the progenitor had been at the end of the eighties. HD compilations have been made for much less, it was only natural that sooner or later it would happen with this franchise too. In reality, the great forerunner, the first Metal Gear Solid, is absent from the appeal, apparently too technically old-fashioned to be converted, despite the excellent performances of the semi-remake subtitled The Twin Snakes for Nintendo GameCube. And to be perfectly honest, this new Sony portable version of the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, released a few months ago for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, has been deprived of the conversion of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, originally conceived for the PlayStation Portable . So we are left with Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance and Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, or the revised and corrected versions of the original Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Confused? OK, read on. Snakes on a Lifetime Metal Gear Solid 2 was one of the most influential and controversial products of the PlayStation 2 era. It is difficult to decide which side to take, some consider it an absolute meta-videogame masterpiece and those who consider it just an empty exercise in style and storytelling. In any case, it is absolutely true that in Metal Gear Solid 2 the plot has more importance than the raw game and in fact defining it as an interactive film would not be too wrong either, considering the maniacal care reserved by Hideo Kojima for dialogues and direction. Which then are only the last, eccentric jokes of the game that have aroused some perplexities, given that the Hollywood spy-story plot is absolutely breathtaking: at the beginning you are Solid Snake, again on a mission to investigate a Metal Gear prototype , but soon you will find yourself controlling Raiden, a new special agent of Foxhound with the task of rescuing the hostages of the Sons of Liberty terrorist cell. The plot at this point becomes decidedly complicated and we certainly won't be the ones to spoil the numerous twists and turns that will follow one another up to the epilogue. Metal Gear Solid 3, on the other hand, is perhaps the most appreciated episode of the saga from a narrative point of view, both for the characterization of the various characters and for the much more cohesive plot full of epic moments to say the least. The adventure takes place in 1964, in the midst of the Cold War: it is therefore a prequel to Metal Gear Solid 2, and the protagonist is Naked Snake, a CIA special agent with the delicate task of avoiding a nuclear confrontation between America and Russia. Of course, the story is much more intricate than that, full of facets and twists, and if it is true that one can be a little taken aback by the new context, everything soon makes perfect sense, leading the player to a truly satisfying ending . But if you've already played these two milestones, and possibly also the ~final~ fourth chapter, we haven't told you anything at this point that you don't already know. PSVita trophies Double ration of Trophies for this compilation: 37 Bronze, 5 Silver, 4 Gold and Platinum in both Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3. Many you will conquer as you progress through the story, others with special actions. The Transfarring option allows you to import your save and continue the adventure on PlayStation 3, transferring all Trophies you have already earned to your laptop. The old and the new By now even stones should know how to play a Metal Gear Solid: Hideo Kojima didn't define it as ~tactical espionage action~ by chance and in fact every situation, every map and every challenge can be faced and resolved in various ways. The emphasis is placed on stealthy approaches, so much so that it is perfectly possible to complete the adventure without killing a single enemy: it takes cunning, ingenuity and caution, but it can be done. The two games gradually provide the player with the various tools of the trade and it soon becomes essential to know how to use them in the best way; in particular, Metal Gear Solid 3 is the more ~stealth~ of the two titles, set as it is largely in the thick vegetation of a jungle, where silently creeping through tall grass and setting the right Naked Snake camouflage are crucial tactics that can make the difference between life and death. Metal Gear Solid 3 is certainly the most sophisticated of the package in terms of gameplay and the possibilities offered to the player, who will even have to remember to get food to survive the hardships of the mission.In both cases, however, it must be remembered that we are dealing with titles from almost ten years ago, so it could be difficult to immediately adapt to a somewhat antiquated and convoluted control system; the Vita version perfectly mirrors the original and PlayStation 3 counterpart controls, preferring them to the slightly more modern settings offered by the Nintendo 3DS conversion of Metal Gear Solid 3. The response to the commands is however always excellent and the right analog stick makes the experience very similar to that of home consoles. In addition, the Vita edition has decent touch controls, which allow for example to fiddle during cutscenes by tapping the screen to zoom and pan, but also to manage equipment on the fly, by tapping on-screen icons to open the appropriate menus and quickly select the desired weapon or object. We really appreciated this simple but very pleasant solution; the interactions involving the rear touchpad are a little less, in fact they seemed slightly inaccurate to us especially in the case of wanting to stab a target: if the touchpad does not interpret our touch well, the error could mess up an entire strategy revealing our position to the enemy. In short, you have to get used to it and after a while using this feature becomes quite natural, but in many cases we have preferred to rely on the infallible traditional control system. Aside from these unique features, the PlayStation Vita version of Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is remarkably identical to its PlayStation 3 counterpart, offering an even clearer picture thanks to the console's OLED screen. As we have already said, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 didn't come out the day before yesterday so don't be surprised by some washed out textures or some too simple polygonal model; on the contrary, the two Konami titles still defend themselves very well today thanks to the obsessive attention to detail and to a cosmetics that was already decidedly avant-garde at the time, now embellished by the transition to high definition. On PlayStation Vita, however, we have observed frequent drops in frame rate during the most agitated situations and cutscenes, evident in the case of transition from an outdoor area such as the tanker chapter in Metal Gear Solid 2; curiously, the frame rate appears much more stable in Metal Gear Solid 3, playing which we encountered this defect much more rarely. The result, however, is more than satisfactory and the whole frame, also thanks to an amazing soundtrack and a very high quality English dubbing, once again underlines the skills of Kojima and his team.", "date": "2012-06-25", "grade": "9.0"}
