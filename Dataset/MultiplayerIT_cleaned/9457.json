The sequel to a remake, to be precise. We therefore find Captain ~Rad~ Spencer, who is sent together with his team of Bionic Commandos to the island of Papagaya with the aim of recovering Colonel Brubaker and his men, sent there by the FSA to neutralize General Sabio and his threat nuclear. A failed expedition, that of Brubaker, for reasons that good old Spencer (now with a nice pair of moustaches) will become clear as soon as he sets foot on the island. Papagaya is in fact protected by an advanced defense system, partly made up of conventional units, partly of huge androids that General Sabio enjoys building in his spare time. The bionic soldiers are quickly overwhelmed, and so ~Rad~ finds himself alone, engaged on several fronts: he will have to save his comrades, recover Brubaker and put an end to Sabio's regime. An arduous task, which fortunately he will be able to face relying on some new skills: first of all the ability to jump, which has made many nostalgic for the original Bionic Commando turn up their noses but which has its own reason in the economy of the game, it turns out far from invasive and moreover it can be deactivated by accessing the Retro Mode once the adventure has been completed; the ~death from above~ maneuver, a devastating attack that the character can carry out in mid-air to destroy certain surfaces and defeat opponents, borrowed from the revisitation of the series in an action key released in 2009; the ~components~, an extra piece of equipment that gives Spencer additional offensive and defensive solutions, which can be configured using the appropriate screen; finally the Bio-Vision, a viewer that can be activated via a back button (R2 on PlayStation 3) which reveals the functions of the interactable objects that we are facing, and is also useful when we are unable to identify the weak points of a boss. Randall!!! It's nice to see how Nathan Spencer's character has been characterized with respect to the first Bionic Commando: Rearmed, where he presented himself as an anonymous stunt double for Arnold Schwarzenegger. ~Rad~ now has a more mature aspect, beyond the mustache, which goes very well with the effective humor that pervades much of the dialogue between the bionic soldier and the enemies he will face during the adventure. The game is made up of twenty-four levels (boss fights included) which lend themselves to in-depth exploration (perhaps to be carried out after the first round, once you have acquired new powers) also due to the large number of objects that can be found inside them . An element, the exploratory one, which however is not facilitated due to some questionable solutions, such as the impossibility of visually controlling what is below or above the screen. This limit often forces us to make ~blind~ leaps, which perhaps result in sudden deaths due to an abyss or some trap. As mentioned above, the introduction of the jump in the end does not distort the classic gameplay of Bionic Commando, and the use of the mechanical arm remains essential for moving to the more advanced stages. Whether these features have been rendered at their best or not is another matter: the inertia of the movements is dangerous when you have to pay attention to where you put your feet, the response to the commands is not perfectly punctual and the bionic ~hook~ often it doesn't catch on as it should, generating a series of episodes of frustration that smack so much of hardcore gaming (and in this sense, therefore, respect the nostalgic spirit of Capcom production) but which clearly don't make us utter phrases that we would repeat in front of relatives. Playstation 3 trophies There are twelve trophies contained in Bionic Commando: Rearmed 2: seven bronze, four silver and one gold. The bronze trophies are obtained by completing the game in co-op mode, defeating the last boss and completing all the challenge rooms available after the first round, while for the silver trophies you have to get all the upgrades, complete the game never jumping and so on. Finally, the gold trophy is won by collecting all the Yasichi scattered throughout the levels. Bionic arms stolen from agriculture After passing a few levels, the connotation of Bionic Commando: Rearmed 2 appears quite clear: the game goes by quickly, sometimes even hastily (there are levels that can be completed in a matter of seconds, even), pittingre well made and gameplay based on switches, on doors to open, on the best way to reach a certain platform rather than on fights, which are almost accessories to the action and become protagonists only when the huge bosses enter the scene. The latter are very well done, not so much from the point of view of design as from that of behavioral routines and the inevitable weak points to identify. On the way we almost forget about the Bio-Vision, which however comes in handy when we don't know how to proceed. Instead, the ~components~ are quite useless, precisely because the challenge is small and extreme solutions are certainly not needed to eliminate conventional enemies; on the contrary, in most cases we will end up using only the service pistol, almost without touching the supplementary weapons which also become fundamental in certain cases. The technical sector of the game is in line with that of the first episode, there is a good variety of locations and an effective use of colors, but basically there are much fewer ~variations on the theme~ and the action appears much more linear. free of surprises. The sound accompaniment, again entrusted to Simon Viklund, is confirmed as excellent in terms of rhythms and melodies, remains in the lead right from the start but unfortunately relies on a small list of songs, so much so that the music is often repeated from one level to another . Last note, unfortunately negative, on the cooperative multiplayer mode: available only locally (yet the game requires a constant internet connection, since they were there...), it is spoiled by the absence of the split screen and by the fixed view on the solo number one player, a solution that brings with it a huge series of flaws. At this point it would have been better not to include it at all, the multiplayer.", "date": "2011-02-22", "grade": "7.0"}
