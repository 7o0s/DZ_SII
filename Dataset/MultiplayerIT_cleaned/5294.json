Fundamental pillars of each Nitrome production have always been the free to play nature, the pixel art graphics, the immediacy of the gameplay and the greatest possible simplicity as regards the control system: all elements that figure well in this Stretch Dungeon, combined with a certain underlying madness that makes the dish even more appetizing. A good idea and an impeccable execution make Stretch Dungeon a very pleasant pastime Spread out, sesame! The protagonist of Stretch Dungeon is a funny bearded humanoid who has to escape from his prison: a mere pretext to justify a gameplay that takes its cue from the styles of endless runners, a genre with which it shares many aspects. The player's goal is therefore to get as far as possible, avoiding obstacles and collecting gems within a randomly generated path in each game. However, two substantial differences reside in the fact that the action develops vertically (specifically from top to bottom) and above all that the user does not directly control the character on the screen, but rather the walls of the dungeon: acting with a finger on the touchscreen, in fact, you will see the perimeter walls ~inflate~ thus allowing the protagonist to carry out the necessary evasive maneuvers in order to continue his escape. There are several applications of this single, very simple play mechanic, made possible by the excellent design that traditionally accompanies Nitrome products. By keeping your finger pressed, it is therefore possible to lift walls and floors to slow down or stop the motion of the humanoid, while a quick tap allows it to bounce from the walls, giving the game an almost pinball feeling, also considering the presence of destructible, repelling and trampolines that peep out from time to time, altering the natural motion of the protagonist. Despite the random nature of the levels, the imprint of the developers can be seen very well, made evident by a whole series of different dangers that are added as you continue and which contribute to always keeping the attention of the user alive who must evaluate in few fractions of a second what strategies to adopt. A contact with a spike, a blade and company is enough to end your mad descent towards freedom, but the game offers two loopholes to continue: watch an advertisement (solution which, however, only works once per game) or pay a sum in gems that increases for each subsequent game over. A formula already adopted by Nitrome in some of its previous works and which here confirms its absolute validity, making Stretch Dungeon a good product for both short and long sessions, given that the intrinsic repetitiveness of its play structure does not allow it to be a title intended to entertain endlessly. As long as it lasts, however, the game does its job flawlessly, supported by a technical department that is up to the task. Graphically we are always close to pixel art which has become a real trademark for the English team, with some touches of class such as the protagonist's beard that moves according to strict physical laws; on the sound front, however, the captivating musical accompaniment and the hilarious verses produced by the humanoid when it is slammed from one side of the screen to the other are particularly noteworthy.", "date": "2016-09-19", "grade": "8.6"}
