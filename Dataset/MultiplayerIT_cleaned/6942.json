{"name": "L'eredit dell'uccello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/136755-swing-copters-leredita-delluccello.html", "text": "In the days that Swing Copters appeared on the App Store and Google Play, the two digital distribution platforms were literally invaded by more or less shameless clones and games that imitated their name in the almost grotesque hope of easily taking advantage of the visibility of the original. Dealing with clones and leeches masquerading as developers has become a sadly common problem, but Vietnamese Dong Nguyen's new game is clearly an extreme case. His previous instrument of torture was called the Flappy Bird, a collective phenomenon that divided smartphone and tablet owners into those who hated it, those who loved it, and those who hated it while continuing to play with it. With simple mechanics but excruciating difficulty, it's clear that Swing Copters is trying to do an encore. The author of Flappy Bird has created Swing Copters, an even more difficult and punishing sequel Propeller and hammer To get an idea of how Swing Copters works, just start Flappy Bird and rotate your smartphone. Instead of a clumsy bird, there's a bean with a propeller, and instead of green pipes, there are platforms from which big hammers swing. The goal, once again, is to pass through it without coming into contact with anything, but instead of proceeding from left to right, the action takes place vertically, and the goal is to get as high as possible. All this translates into quickly and compulsively touching the touch screen, since with each touch the tiny protagonist changes direction. As in Flappy Bird, the secret is again finding the right rhythm as you repeatedly swing left and right in an attempt to avoid the swinging hammers that randomly spawn with each playthrough. Yet, although the basic idea clearly recalls that of Nguyen's previous game, some tiny design differences end up drastically changing the feel. Just take a spin on Twitter or watch some Let's Plays on YouTube to find old Flappy Bird fans struggling to score even a single point in Swing Copters. How come? The fact is that, despite the appearance, Swing Copters is not simply Flappy Bird played vertically. The mere addition of inertia completely changes the cards on the table: this time the movements from one direction to another do not occur instantaneously but take into account the thrust and speed of the player; getting too much speed before changing direction is a perfect way to lose control and get a hammer in the face. Every touch on the screen suddenly becomes crucial, and since there is no margin for error it is even more important to be able to maintain concentration. And then there are those huge, annoying swinging hammers, which add another variable to take into consideration and which make every match much less predictable. While the latest update has made Swing Copters less frustrating and more accessible, Nguyen's new game remains more complex and difficult than Flappy Bird was. It is more rational and less instinctive, and while the previous one had conquered the masses for the sheer simplicity of the design, this one introduces two or three variables sufficient to frighten and alienate that same audience composed mainly of casual users. With different backdrops, some unlockable costumes and slightly more accurate graphics, the author has also tried to make Swing Copters more attractive, but paradoxically his new game suffers from the success of its predecessor. The Flappy Bird phenomenon has given birth to so many similar titles in the past months, that it is really difficult to find an iota of originality in Nguyen's new work.", "date": "2014-08-30", "grade": "6.0"}
