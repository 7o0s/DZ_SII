Therefore taking for granted that one cannot expect any desire for originality or freshness from a product of this kind, it remains to be understood whether Disney Sorcerer's Arena can succeed in establishing itself in such a crowded segment, perhaps leveraging on particular technical skills or on the charm of its roster of iconic characters. The usual strategic ... but with Disney characters When figures from universes as distant as those in the Disney catalog are put together, it is practically impossible to have a sensible plot as a glue, and Disney Sorcerer's Arena does not even try: the user is initially explained that he has the possibility of using cards that evoke the relative heroes, and that is enough to stage an infinite sequence of turn-based fights against the most disparate enemies, but without a real ultimate goal. Nothing to be too shocked about (in the mobile sector we are used to much worse), while the exaggeratedly long tutorial that marks the first stages of the game is arousing more than a few perplexities: I agree that it is a product aimed at an audience young and that there are many things to explain, but even reaching level 6 with a ~blocked~ progression marked only by the decisions allowed by the software can seriously test even the most patient players. The fact is doubly annoying if we consider that, as in many other similar titles, the mechanics of Disney Sorcerer's Arena are extremely redundant to the point of becoming confusing: between double or triple currencies, energy values, collectibles, stars, materials, rewards and who the more you have the more you end up accumulating serially (and spending) without really understanding what you are doing. This is obviously not a design defect, but a project specifically designed to push users towards the tide of microtransactions displayed in the dedicated section, all optional in terms of progression in the game but capable of providing convenient shortcuts to climb more quickly level up or obtain desired characters or equipment items. So far we have talked about what all in all are common features of millions of free to play titles similar to Disney Sorcerer's Arena, but how is the game itself? Unfortunately it's nothing special: the turn-based fights field a strategic component in rose water, with characters equipped with two specific skills to choose from and stop. There are no pawns to move, objects to use or particular parameters to take into account, you just need to tap on the desired icon and observe its effects on enemies or party members. The AI of the enemies is at a minimum wage, and the coefficient of challenge is all about an upgrade of the opponents that advances faster than that of the characters controlled by the user who decides not to spend money, forcing him to grind or buy of premium packages to be able to continue when it comes to the inevitable bottlenecks. What is certain is that the charm of the Disney universe has few equals, and there are so many heroes that you can add to your stable, each with characteristics in battle that mirror those of their animated counterparts (Aladdin is fast, Sulley from Monsters & Co . is a tank and so on). However, this is the only discriminating factor that separates Disney Sorcerer's Arena from its competitors, given that not even under the technical front who knows what prodigies are recorded: the graphics of the game defend themselves well with a pleasant cel shading but nothing more, while on the sound front there is the phantom minimum wage.", "date": "2020-04-06", "grade": "6.5"}
