{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent-recensione-2.html", "text": "Double play At the end of the first mission, a prologue useful for practicing the game controls, you are immediately catapulted into the narrative plot. The tragic death of Sam's only daughter convinces our secret agent to accept a suicidal task: times have changed, and for the Third Echelon the fight against crime is increasingly challenging. If you can't defeat them, join them: this is the idea of Colonel Lambert, who forces Fisher to infiltrate a terrorist cell (the fearsome JBA) to defeat it. After helping Jamie Washington to escape from prison, in a level clearly inspired by the famous telefilm ~Prison Break~, Sam is introduced in the headquarters of the JBA; it's up to the player to try to maintain cover, while thwarting the shady plans of the terrorists. Never change a winning team Anyone who has ever played a previous episode will immediately feel at ease: the controls are almost unchanged (with the only addition of the motion detector, as we will see later), and the general feeling has not undergone any type of variation. Precisely the total absence of even the slightest variation in the gameplay leads Double Agent to also maintain the historical defects of the series: the most serious is represented by the field of view of the enemies, once again excessively limited, and by some not too realistic reactions of the Artificial intelligence. However, the matter changes at a higher level of difficulty: in this case, the guards will no longer follow a single standard itinerary, and will also be much more vigilant, forcing you to wait for whole minutes in total darkness, waiting to take advantage of the moment more propitious to overcome the obstacle. The real innovation instead invests the double identity of Sam Fisher: we will have to manage both sides of the coin (that of an infiltrated secret agent and that of a terrorist), balancing the decisions in order not to compromise one's position within the two factions. To make it easier for the player, there will be two reputation indicators; each choice (such as whether or not to kill a prisoner) will heavily influence the course of events, guiding us towards one of three different endings. Of particular relevance are the missions inside the terrorist headquarters; in this case, you will first have to carry out some jobs within a limited time that will be commissioned from you by a subordinate of the organization, then, in the remaining time, recover useful information on the members of the criminal cell. By also completing the secondary objectives, you will be rewarded with gadgets worthy of the best 007; however, you will soon realize that such an arsenal is a useless pretext for showcasing the game action. Finally, compared to the past, we note a particular innovation in the Level Design which combines the usual closed environments with open spaces such as the Congolese savannah and the glaciers of the Siberian coast. Unity is strength Raise your hand if you never played cops and robbers as a child. The concept of the online component of Double Agent is based on it. There are two modes: the cooperative, in which you will be called to collaborate with other users, and the Versus, a real workhorse of the multpilayer. This mode sees on the one hand the mercenaries patrolling the building in search of enemies, and on the other the spies who, taking advantage of the countless tunnels and shaded areas, will try to steal information from the terminals scattered throughout the level. The approach, depending on the class chosen, is diametrically opposite: the Upsilon mercenaries will have limited visibility from the first person, but will enjoy special features such as motion sensors and warning at any hacking attempt. For their part, the spies, immensely more agile, will be able to exploit the scenario itself, very rich in ravines and tunnels inaccessible to the Upsilons, and the gadgets, this time very useful, among which we mention the flash grenade (which blinds the opponent) and the Jammer (useful to fool the motion detector). To underline some unpublished contents for the Playstation 3 version: the dream of many boys has been fulfilled by the entry of a female character (present exclusively in the multiplayer) agile, elegant, and damn lethal. 2 extra maps have also been included, which enrich the already large number of settings. The result is good, but not overwhelming; the online is therefore a nice appendix to the single player, which remains the true fulcrum of the title. Comment Splinter Cell: Double Agent is definitely the best chapter of the saga. However, the typical defects of the series, and a technically inadequate transposition,do not allow the Ubisoft game to become an essential title in the Playstation 3 soft library. Recommended for Stealth game lovers and anyone looking for an adventure with an intriguing plot. Cross-platform users, on the other hand, should turn without hesitation to the Xbox 360 version, graphically superior and available at a more favorable price. Pros Intriguing double role Good variety of action Excellent sound sector Cons Ridiculous framerate A.I. not always up to par Luca Ward's voice is gone Nextgeneration? Technically speaking, the game disappoints. We are faced with yet another botched conversion from Xbox360, and in which the only improvement is represented by the possibility of activating the motion detector of the pad. In this case, the features of the Sixaxis can be exploited in the numerous hacking actions, further identifying the player when called to break into a safe or to set up a mine. However, graphically we are clearly below the standards proposed, by the same title, on the Microsoft home console. The poor optimization can be found above all in the framerate, truly at historic lows, which strongly penalizes the game action. On the other hand, the sound sector is excellent; the music, catchy and never invasive, pursues the key moments, while the Italian dubbing is very good, despite the fact that Sam's voice is no longer entrusted to the legendary timbre of Luca Ward. However, his replacement proved to be up to the task, even though he did not possess the immense charisma of the previous voice actor. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent is available for Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, GameCube and Wii. The version reviewed in this article is the PlayStation 3 version. The first Splinter Cell will be remembered as the most credible alternative to Metal Gear Solid: released in the now distant 2002, it managed to win the consensus of the public and critics thanks to a more realistic and less cinematic approach than Kojima's masterpiece. However, the absence of an intriguing plot represented the greatest limitation of the saga; the guys from Ubisoft Shanghai, authors of this fourth chapter, therefore ran for cover, keeping the gameplay unchanged, and aiming instead to create a story worthy of a spy film.
