And so, just two weeks after our Sonic Runners review, here we are again analyzing what this popular video game genre still has to offer, in this case for iPhone and iPad owners. Samurai Blitz puts us in command of a skilled samurai, as the title suggests, dealing with hordes of oni (the demons of Japanese tradition), which we will have the task of slicing with our sharp katana. In an endless horizontal scrolling context, as already mentioned, we will therefore find ourselves proceeding infinitely towards the right side of the screen, from where enemies will appear at different heights, but also containers of coins to be smashed and, at the end of each scenario , a dangerous boss. Endless yes, in short, but with clear elements of progression: as we proceed, the setting will change, marking the introduction of a new background precisely with the bosses. Finally, the collection of coins will allow us to purchase from the in-game shop not only purely aesthetic objects, such as tunics or swords, but also and above all scrolls endowed with mystical powers, which will constitute a substantial advantage because our attempts take them as far as possible. Samurai Blitz is a different endless runner, capable of innovating through some excellent ideas What a special trick! The control system of Samurai Blitz is obviously simple and immediate: by touching the left side of the screen it is possible to take a single or double leap, more or less wide depending on the pressure, while by touching the right side the sword is struck. Impacting the demons produces a ~bounce~ which allows, during aerial slashing, to actually jump from one enemy to another, however trying to make the touches with the maximum possible precision in order not to suffer damage and lose one of the three hearts that they make up our vital energy bar. Multiple attacks give life to a combo, with the samurai spinning on itself turning into a sort of cutting hurricane, but this is a rather rare eventuality: in order to get as far as possible, face the bosses and admire the change scenario, we will in fact find ourselves proceeding in a cautious manner, often remaining on the ground, without risking a flying attack (an eventuality which represents, in its own way, a ~defect~ of the gameplay) and only slicing the oni that come towards us, as well as avoiding the sudden poisonous bullets that always come from the right side of the screen. The idea of progression of Samurai Blitz is fascinating, in particular thanks to the beautiful design of the bosses and the general look of the game, which draws heavily on pixel art; and things work especially when enough coins are raised to afford a first upgrade, strictly one of the rolls, whereas for the rest the prices are quite high and difficult to reach without spending real money. At game over there is also the possibility of continuing the game by spending a few coins, but this is a double-edged sword, given that we will return to action with only one heart available, in the hope (often in vain) of recovering others on the way doing.", "date": "2015-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
