There were beatings and murders for trivial reasons, often due to the Devil's Hand, a ruthless gang dedicated to drug trafficking and crime. When some henchmen belonging to this group notice Mikey's jacket, with the Retribution logo, they decide to make an example of him: they cut his throat and shoot the helpless Jake, thinking they have killed him. However, Jake Conway is tougher than you think, and as soon as he gets out of the hospital he wears Mikey's jacket and sets off on his motorcycle with only one thing in mind: to destroy the Devil's Hand and all its members. Obviously the ruthless hunt will not be able to occupy 100% of Jake's time, who every two by three will come across scantily dressed young ladies ready to lick his wounds, within honestly ridiculous cutscenes in which the protagonist mimes some Kamasutra figures, keeping all clothes on, as well as his partners (even multiple). The famous modesty of the seventies. From the trunk to the furniture On paper, Ride to Hell: Retribution could have been a great action game. The setting is in fact relatively original and far from overused, the incipit of the plot is valid and engaging, the gang theme always appeals to the public and alternating fighting, third-person shooter and driving sequences, the latter with a Road Rash-style attitude, could represent an explosive mix. In the role of the publisher, in front of such a project we would clearly have given the go-ahead and also uncorked a bottle of sparkling wine, while we were at it. The problem is that there must have been many bottles, so as to cloud the vision of those who actually had to monitor the progress of the works. In fact, not noticing the game's shortcomings in terms of direction, cleanliness and design seems incredible to us, so much so that the final result stands as a serious candidate for the title of worst game of the year. The reception of the international press has so far been merciless and the metascore of 20 speaks for itself, but our impression is that Ride to Hell: Retribution isn't really that bad, or at least the experience doesn't deserve those numbers. Surely it's a game full of problems, a jumble of good ideas badly done and put together with PVA glue. The early stages are even inexplicable so much the direction has been handled badly, with some flashbacks that spoil the final stages and which in theory should give the title that air of ~we started now, in the thick of the action, but the story has begun ten days ago~. Xbox 360 goals The thirty-eight achievements contained in Ride to Hell: Retribution are obtained by killing leading members of the Devil's Hand, completing the campaign on all difficulty levels and performing certain actions, such as saving a girl in need (to then receive a kind of thank you), collect trading cards, perform a certain amount of motorcycle drifts and so on. What is saved After the first, traumatic levels, Ride to Hell: Retribution even plays the hub card from which you can freely access the missions, with the possibility of replaying already completed phases or continuing with the story which, let's say it right away, can last from six to eight hours depending on how many times you crack in that damn overhead sniper shooter stage (sorry, got carried away). The action, as previously mentioned, takes place in two distinct phases: in the first, our character moves within the scenario hunting for bad guys, who he can kill with his fists or by pulling out a firearm; in the second he rides a motorbike in pursuit of members of the Devil's Hand, trying to avoid obstacles and kicking the other motorcyclists who come alongside with bad intentions. Let's say right away that the motorcycle sequences are by far the worst, with zero challenge and many uncertainties, laughable physics and even worse collisions. Let's put a cross on it. Instead, when Jake is controlled directly, things take on better connotations: the ~thumps~ are felt, although the combinations of shots are always the same (kick to break the guard and two snaps), there are slow motions that render the impacts well and sometimes portions of the scenario that can be interacted with to put the opponent offside. An attempt has even been made to imitate Rocksteady's Batman with the counterattack system, to reiterate the concept of the ~many gooddee on paper~. As for the shooter phases, it is possible to take cover behind a cover and then shoot enemies trying to peck them in the forehead, which also produces a short bullet time and a lot of satisfaction. The artificial intelligence of the members of the Devil's Hand moves between ups and downs: it's not so basic in firefights, given that the positions are often changed and therefore you can't stand with the gun leveled and wait for the opponent to lean over to hit him; however, sometimes ~goes crazy~, with the henchmen who reach us behind obstacles or insist on shooting against a wall. And then oh well, the technical sector in a few but significant words: we are at PlayStation 2 levels as regards the polygonal models, they often occur drops in frame rate (even during cutscenes!) and the environments are the most anonymous and generic I've ever seen in a video game. What's good is that the dialogues (spoken in English) are well acted and that the accompaniment rock has its highs (but also its terrible lows). Ride to Hell: Retribution presents itself as a problematic product, plagued by many uncertainties", "date": "2013-07-09", "grade": "4.5"}
