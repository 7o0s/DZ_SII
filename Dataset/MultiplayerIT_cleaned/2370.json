As we will see in the course of the review, we are faced with a product modeled on the previous version, with some adjustments to the gameplay, new content but essentially the same dynamics. Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Rainbow Studios have made a minimal effort to renew its formula, evidently dedicated to a not particularly large niche of players. On the other hand we are talking about a title that is sold at a really affordable price, so we couldn't have expected much more. Game mode Monster trucks are played very well Monster Jam Steel Titans 2 offers the player a career mode and a series of quick competitions, as well as the ability to play in two on the same system and to compete online. Pad in hand is really played identically to the first chapter, so much so that the few adjustments made to the game mechanics (some improvements in physics and collisions) seem more the result of some patch than a complete overhaul of the various systems. Also in this edition the focus of the production went entirely on the monster trucks, reproduced with painstaking care, while the five worlds from which the game is composed, as well as the twelve stadiums, appear bare and devoid of relevant details, so as to be truly anonymous . The circuits themselves are not ugly and have been designed with a certain professionalism (it is no coincidence that Rainbow knows the genre perfectly), taking up those of the official competitions of the discipline. The story changes for the five worlds, anonymous and uninteresting: as in the predecessor, they are large open areas where you can go hunting for Monster Jam tokens (they are used to unlock trucks) or access the various competitions that form the glue of the career . Of them would also be a good idea, if they were not underexploited. Sure, you can explore them to practice some stunts and enjoy your stable in the various workshops, as well as to participate in some secret mini events, but their function wears out pretty quickly. Monster Jam Steel Titans 2 is not graphically great However, the most substantial section of the experience is the one inside the stadiums, where the various competitions take place. To complete the career mode you need to win a series of races of increasing difficulty, which allow you not only to unlock advanced competitions, but also to get new trucks. Of the latter there are thirty-eight in total and, as we said, they are the most accurate part of the game, reproduced as they are with great abundance of details and equipped with destructible parts that make clashes and acrobatics more spectacular. Don't expect anything at Wreckfest, but seeing these behemoths fall apart certainly does have an effect. In addition there are many famous models, which will please those who follow Monster Jam outside of video games. But let's go back to competitions in stadiums. These come in many varieties: traditional races to see who finishes first, head-to-head races on ovals to see who sets the best time, stunt races where the winner is the one who accumulates the most points, and so on. In terms of the guidance system, Rainbow has done a great job. The experience with the genre, now ten years old, is evident and driving these beasts undoubtedly gives its satisfactions, above all when one discovers aspects of the simulation that are deeper than what was expected at first (after all we are always faced with a arcade, so certain tricks are always nice). Some trucks are really special The trucks give excellent driving sensations, with their ~weight~ that is clearly made to perceive by the player thanks to an accurate interaction between the vehicles and the terrains, net of some inaccuracies, which can cause some problems, especially in the worlds open. In particular, there are unexpected rollovers, which can be compensated for with experience. The opponents' AI also helps, having been honed over the years. Especially in advanced competitions, the CPU really gives a hard time. The problem, as we said, is that everything differs very little from its predecessor and the impression is that of being faced with an expanded version of the same, without much to say other than its nature as a photocopied sequel. Surely fans will appreciate it, also because the offer of monster truck games isn't very wide, but don't expect Monster Jam Steel Titans 2 to evolve the genre or to attract curious but unconvinced players.", "date": "2021-03-01", "grade": "6.5"}
