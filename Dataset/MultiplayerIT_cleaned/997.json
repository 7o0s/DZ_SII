{"name": "Recensione: Oddworld Stranger's Wrath", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-oddworld-strangers-wrath.html", "text": "The first Oddworld without Abe In fact, this new chapter sees the good Abe, the real mascot of the series, put aside for the first time in favor of an absolute new entry, the bounty hunter Stranger, leading us to discover a side of Oddworld with decidedly western tones which, frankly, we never expected. In terms of game mechanics, the novelties are perhaps even more radical, starting with the possibility of alternating a first and third person view at any time of the game, depending on what is happening on the screen (but also on personal tastes): the first is obviously perfect for fighting, the second is more suitable for platform sections and in general for moving around the map. In reality, the vast majority of the adventure is played in first person, given that the frequent clashes with enemies benefit not a little from the greater sensitivity in aiming that this view is able to grant, or due to the not too complex level design, however there are certainly the situations in which the greater precision in the movements of an external view is fundamental, to the full advantage of the game variety. The combat system shows evident stealth game contaminations (just look at the radar that appears in the lower left corner of the screen, which indicates the position of the enemies and their visual cone), and clearly favors a cautious and reasoned approach , rather than incentivizing the player to rush headlong into the fray. The weapon management system, or rather the weapon, is very original, given that the good Stranger will only have his crossbow at his disposal, however being able to choose from a range of nine different types of ammunition, all to be found among the small rodents and insects that the various levels teem. You got it right: the pets are your only war resources and you will have to learn how to exploit their various peculiarities to continue the adventure successfully (for example there are some insects which, when launched against the enemy, envelop him in a sort of cocoon and immobilize it, allowing you to capture it easily, or a species of porcupine that causes damage thanks to its quills, and each enemy is more or less vulnerable to each of them), The weapon management system is very original, indeed of the weapon, given that the good Stranger will only have his crossbow at his disposal dosing their use sparingly since you will have a limited amount available, at least at the beginning of the adventure, and stopping to track them down and capture them in case you run out of water. Given the high specificity of the effect produced by each of these little animals, the developers have also shrewdly implemented the possibility of loading 2 different types of them on the crossbow at the same time, each of which is assigned to one of the analog triggers, so as not to force the player to continuous access to the ammo selection menu during the most chaotic combat. In general, however, the whole control system has proved to be sufficiently comfortable and intuitive, despite the double view to manage, although we did not appreciate the fact that the game automatically selects the third person on the occasion of certain player actions (such as when capturing a thug), generating that moment of confusion which can also prove fatal in the most critical situations. A feast for the eyes In the past, the Oddworld Inhabitants stood out for their masterful use of two-dimensional graphics, conquering gamers not only thanks to their skilled technical skills, but above all for their unmistakable style, capable of giving the settings and characters a very special charm. Finally (after the half misstep of Munch's Odyssee) these capabilities have found the right outlet in a completely three-dimensional context, making this Stranger's Wrath one of the most graphically sumptuous titles available for mother Microsoft's cross console. Everything is made with obsessive care and taste, and the apparent simplicity with which the engine grinds tons of polygons and highly detailed textures is truly incredible, leaving us speechless with lively and luxuriant settings and character models that enchant for their originality and design , and that in motion seem to be able to leave the screen at any moment. We pass from the desolate atmospheres of the desert, with the sparse towns to interrupt the apparent monotony of the canyons and clearings, to the green forests embellished by splendid plays of light, all without ever betraying that unmistakable appeal that made Oddworld Inhabitants so celebrate. the apparent simplicity with which the engine grinds tons ofpolygons and highly detailed textures is truly incredible A feast for the eyes On the other hand, a decidedly less positive discourse as regards the sound sector, characterized by average effects and by an all in all valid musical accompaniment, which goes well with the atmospheres of the game, although it tends to become slightly repetitive, and which adapts in a dynamic with what is happening on screen. The real problem, however, lies in the dubbing, which despite a good interpretation of the dialogues partially compromises the experience due to a very limited range of voices, among other things ~dirtied~ by excessive compression which gives the whole a decidedly unpleasant rendering . On the longevity front, there is a quantifiable duration between 18 and 20 hours of play, certainly a value higher than the average of the other FPS (although this Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is not really a canonical first person shooter) available on the market. however the stimuli to take it back once finished are few, and the total lack of any multiplayer mode is inevitably felt. Comment Oddworld Stranger's Wrath manages to completely rehabilitate the fame of Lorne Lanning's team after the mediocre debut in three dimensions with Munch's Odyssee, proving to be an extremely accurate and valid product from practically every point of view, with some peaks of excellence in the absolutely graphic field noteworthy. Too bad only for some lightness, such as the sound sector ruined by a dubbing that is not up to par, the limited usefulness of the third person view, or the total lack of a multiplayer mode, which inevitably influence the overall judgment, however without affecting excessively the quality of a title that we would certainly like to recommend to everyone, with the caveat of the lack of dubbing in Italian. Pros: Graphically mammoth Original and fun gameplay Inspired and cared for in good Oddworld tradition Cons: Sound not up to par Multiplayer completely absent The third person view could be better exploited Strange fate that of the Oddworld Inhabitants. After contributing to the worldwide baptism of Xbox with Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee, they are now reappearing on the market with the cross console now directed along the avenue of the sunset, ready to give way to the imminent generational change. But if the first title had made people turn up their noses, making most people fear a certain idiosyncrasy of the team led by Lorne Lanning for the third dimension, this Oddworld Stranger's Wrath fully rehabilitates them, managing to transport all the magic and the charm of the universe of Abe and his companions. But without giving up those upheavals and revolutions that Lanning has accustomed us to in the past, both in terms of gameplay and setting and protagonist.", "date": "2005-03-21", "grade": null}
