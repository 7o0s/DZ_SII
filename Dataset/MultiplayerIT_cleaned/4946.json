Given the trend of this type of market, it would have been relatively easy to take the famous sprites and put together a simple and immediate game to build on the success story, and that is indeed what the team has done with Yo-Kai Watch: Wibble Wobble , only that he added his usual class and painstaking care in the refinement of the various elements. The game is based on some classic puzzle game principles and features those hybrid elements that have now become canonized in a sort of separate genre with Puzzle & Dragons and the like, merging the ~match-three~ principle with role-playing and the unbridled collecting of creatures, but everything is dropped in the typical climate of Yo-Kai Watch and staged with a truly unique style. We therefore find ourselves going around the map meeting spirits of various types and fighting with them to solve the problems of the city, possibly also adding the various spirits to our collection in order to enrich the attack possibilities available. During the clashes we have to associate various Yo-Kai of the same color with each other, connecting them with a line to be drawn on the screen in order to make them absorb each other and then launch an attack of different power based on the amount of assimilated creatures and their characteristics. Sprites are also conquering mobile platforms with Yo-Kai Watch: Wibble Wobble Ghost hunter-gatherers In the combat screen, a large part of the shot therefore shows a circle within which the Yo-Kai, evidently of a gelatinous consistency, float in a constant motion. The solution is extremely pleasant and fun in the typical childish spirit of the series, even if the continuous movement of the sprites can often mislead you in looking for the right trajectories to unite them together. The game mechanic pushes to balance between the ability to put together as many similar Yo-Kai as possible and the speed of execution, because everything contributes to the growth of multipliers and attack bars which translate into more powerful attacks and the triggering of the ~Fever Mode~, resulting in special sequences. They are simple and rather classic elements in games of this genre, but once again implemented with excellent balance and style, able to give great satisfaction. If you win the battle it is possible to conquer the Yo-Kai, who joins us of his own free will or must be ~convinced~ with candies and the like, thus also stimulating the inevitable race to collect which is the basis itself of the Yo-Kai Watch series in its various forms. The inevitable grinding emerges after a few games, with the need to carry out the same clashes several times to increase the level (the optimal one for dealing with the various spirits is directly signaled in the game), but it is not a particularly perverse mechanic, furthermore progress is obtained regardless of victory in the clashes, making every minute of the game actually useful for the cause. Being a free-to-play we find ourselves dealing with micro-transactions connected to the timed energy bar which forces us to wait between one game and another or with the possibility of buying new Yo-Kai and boosting them with ease through simple purchases, but it is not strictly a question of forced extortions.", "date": "2017-04-07", "grade": "8.2"}
