{"name": "Blitz: The League II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blitz-the-league-ii.html", "text": "A young promise There is therefore a story, behind all the violence of Blitz: The League II. At the beginning of the game we find ourselves playing a phenomenal young athlete, capable of covering both defensive and offensive roles in football, who has just decided to start his career in the league, playing exclusively for his hometown team. The construction of the character, with all his physical, athletic, attack and defense characteristics takes place through a well thought-out system: facing the debut press conference, all the answers we will give (10 in total) will directly affect the statistics of the player, immediately inserting us into the fictional atmosphere of the game, rather than directly encountering cold tables and numbers. In this way the offensive and defensive roles to be covered on the field are also chosen, while the following step is the choice of the team, with the crest and the characteristic colors of the uniform. The game structure develops on two parallel tracks: on the one hand the managerial management of the main character and the team and on the other the actual game, on the field. Thanks to the substantial narrative substratum, the matches are marked by a certain progression of the story: between one match and another we witness various cutscenes that progressively reveal the intrigues and conspiracies that form the backdrop to the (fictional) world of professional football, and the matches are always preceded by presentation films of the opposing teams which work well as ~spectacularizing~ elements, capable of adding the right pathos to the situation. To tell the truth, these are introductions that would not go out of place even in other more ~serious~ sports games given their ability to create the right atmosphere before the match. For our part, in the preparation phases we can decide the workouts to be performed by the various members of the team, set up tactics and roles for the match, and even ~dope~ some players in turn, with legal and illegal medicines, thus exploiting a significant increase in performance, but with the risk of facing disciplinary sanctions, in the event that these substances are detected by random tests. The management of the protagonist is quite complex: the progression in the game is marked not only by the matches, which must follow a positive trend in order to move forward, but also by a series of objectives that are imposed on us by our agent and sponsors, necessary to be able to evolve the character and ensure a better performance thanks to new equipment. In the field Once on the field, we are faced with what is broadly speaking an American football simulation, but with several variations on the theme: the teams are made up of fewer elements (8 players per team instead of 11), and the game are somewhat unrealistic in execution. The typical tactical structure of the sport in question remains: both in the attack and in the defense phase, it is possible to call a particular formation and strategy, to be chosen from a list, depending on the position in which we find ourselves on the field and from the objective to be pursued, a selection that will be made every time the game is interrupted and restarted. Obviously, the aim of the game is always to reach the back of the field and possibly convert with a kick on goal. Within this apparently normal structure, however, anything happens: the clashes are decidedly more violent than those that take place in real sport, and the game is enriched by the presence of some special powers characteristic of the captains (therefore present both for the protagonist than for the head of the opposing team), which can be summarized in the ~clash~ and in the ~unleashed~. Good plays and accumulated points increase the clash bar, which once filled allows you to activate slowmotion: in this situation we can easily avoid opposing players and reach the goal. The ~dirty~ game and even the various celebrations cause the clash icons to accumulate, which once they reach 6 allow the activation of the unleashed mode. In this situation, the player becomes a kind of killer: both in attack and in defense he will be able to avoid opponents more easily, and hit them particularly hard if countered with the right timing, with devastating effects on the players' resistance and health. In these cases we are witnessing decidedly gruesome blows: sprains, tears, sprains and broken bones are shown with short anatomical cuts in computer graphics, which introduce (in case you happen to be the victim of the accident) the necessary mini-games to limit the damages, simulating improbable masbone assays or rearrangements that variably reduce negative outcomes. Clearly all this substantially modifies the tactical balance of the game, making an excellent dosage of special powers more necessary (consequently rewarding the violent game) than a perfect performance and organization of the team. Online multiplayer It is possible to use your own personalized team, gained during the single player campaign, also in the online multiplayer mode. Clearly, the possibility of characterizing the team at will during the single game makes the possibilities for clashes between the online teams quite varied. There are also some special modes to be enjoyed online, such as games without armor and helmets with boosted damage, and a kind of ~prisoner ball~ conveniently set in a prison courtyard. Not a great show As for the graphics sector, Blitz: The League II does not offer a great show for the eyes. It seems to be in several respects a product rather behind the competition, especially as regards player animations, which occupy a rather important part in a sports game. The polygonal models themselves have a good presence, although we note a baroque abundance of ~next gen immature~ effects, in particular as regards the glossiness of the surfaces, making the characters a bit unnatural (note for example the aggressive cheerleaders who they dance during breaks in the game), but if nothing else the anatomical structures are not bad. The major problems are therefore to be attributed to the animations, which seem to be carried verbatim from the previous version on Xbox / PlayStation 2, and by the almost total lack of applied physics, which makes the contrasts between the characters somewhat rigid and not very harmonious. The scenic presentation of the playing fields would also enjoy a good glance, with strongly characterized stadiums (having the possibility to wander with the imagination, given that these are not real places), but it is in the unfolding of the game that the sector graph shows side to criticism. As far as the sound accompaniment is concerned, however, there is a good audio commentary during the matches (all in English, however, at least in the version tested), rather ironic, and rocking accompanying music as has become tradition, for sports titles of this type. Comment Blitz: The League II essentially suffers from two problems, set at different levels: first of all, the fascination that a game of this kind can exercise in Italy, where the sport in question is certainly not followed as in North America, and where fans probably the most realistic classic simulations on the market can do with it. At a deeper level, the defects inherent in the game must be taken into consideration: essentially a not excellent technical realization and a structure too distant from the simulation to satisfy the enthusiasts, but perhaps too little arcade to be open to all, channeled in any case into the rigid mechanics of this sport. On its side, the game nonetheless boasts an ability to make the user identify with itself that is certainly superior to any simulation, representing an excellent example of a sports title with a supporting narrative structure and a fun factor that goes hand in hand with the liking for a style above the striped and very glamorous. Pros Discreet managerial management of the team The story makes it engaging Amusing at first Cons The fun fades Technically not excellent Style not for everyone Xbox 360 goals There are 50 achievements in the game, for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints. The richest are those linked to the completion of the campaign mode, while most require particular game performances or the achievement of particular levels and statistics, linked to the evolution of both the protagonist and the rest of the team. In general, a fairly long-term commitment to the game is required to achieve most points.", "date": "2008-11-20", "grade": null}
