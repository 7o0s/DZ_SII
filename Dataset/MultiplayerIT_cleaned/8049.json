Made by Imangi Studios and released in August 2011, the game immediately adopted the freemium format, putting us in the shoes of an Indiana Jones-style explorer who finds himself fleeing an ancient temple while being chased by a horde of evil monkeys. However, the race to salvation lasts indefinitely and is made more complex not only by the progressive increase in speed, but also by the presence of obstacles, traps, chasms and rapid changes of direction that require our intervention. With Temple Run 2 the situation has changed slightly, let's say: our adventurer alter ego must also in this case flee from the fury of a menacing creature (much more than the monkeys of the first episode, it must be said) and therefore jump, slide and ~turn ~ if necessary; however, moving in a decidedly prettier scenario than what we were used to, which not only flows very fluidly but offers suggestive panoramas, enriched by good design and a certain attention to detail. It matters little that the drawing distance is modest and sometimes there are obvious pop-up episodes, the improvement in the technical sector is substantial and records a single defection compared to the original game, or a shot that no longer follows the character during the slide , losing some points in terms of spectacularity. All that has changed Clearly taking the first Temple Run and dressing it up again wasn't the only intention of the guys from Imangi Studios, who tried - while making largely conservative choices - to enrich the experience by adding some new elements. In this sense, the brief crossings along rope ~bridges~ should be seen, a connotation of the route much more bumpy and less linear than in the past, as well as the phases in which our character enters a quarry and, aboard a cart, must avoid the blind forks and balance the weight on the rails so as not to fall during the most difficult curves. We are not big fans of the accelerometer control, which moreover cannot be adjusted in terms of sensitivity, but it is one of the cornerstones of the series and the developers rightly did not want to give it up for this second episode. Unjustified absent, however, the ~target shooting~ present in the spin-off based on the animated film ~Rebel - The Brave~, which helped to make the action a little more varied. The only moment in which we are asked to perform a central touch on the screen (double, actually) is when the bar on the left fills up thanks to the collection of a certain number of coins, allowing us to use one of the special powers selectable on the screen of options, accessible as we level up. Furthermore, the impression is that the incidence of the freemium elements is less stringent than the original Temple Run, which allows us to unlock new characters (which, however, are distinguished only by their appearance, in practice) and to improve the their ~skills~ by spending the virtual currency, which is given quite easily. Finally, at each game over it is possible to resume the game through the use of a gem and perhaps aim for the record, but even this possibility is not precluded to those who do not intend to resort to in-app purchases. In short, running on iOS these days proves to be an inexpensive, practically free practice.", "date": "2013-01-21", "grade": "7.4"}
