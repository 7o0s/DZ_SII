After all, this is the closure of the so-called ~first season~, the last piece after the episode set in Colorado of a game capable of creating countless discussions on forums and sites, which once arrived will finally show fans the complete picture resulting from the concept developer initial. However, it is difficult to say whether, in a pounding release calendar like that of the last few months, the episodic nature of the new Hitman has managed to keep the work of IO Interactive relevant. Talking to them, they seemed undoubtedly pleased to have come full circle, but they didn't give away too many sales figures. We can certainly tell you that the developers have greatly appreciated their community's approach to the new nature of the brand, sifting through each map and enjoying it to the fullest instead of focusing on a single - and easy - solution to the various deletions. On the other hand, the episodes are not so alien to the nature of the series: a sort of stealth sandbox with complex maps and numerous interactive elements, where the killings are practically environmental puzzles in most cases. If the content comes out slowly, the player is practically forced to revisit the various locations, therefore the planning work of the development team is appreciated more (although, of course, the defenders of the ~full game~ have their good reasons). But let's get back on track, talking about episode six, which has very little to do with the scariest day of the year. In fact, it takes place in Hokkaido, in an ultra-tech resort covered in snow called GAMA. 47's latest kill is in Japan - here are our impressions of the final episode of Hitman Taking the patient ~to heart~. The GAMA center is not a common resort: it hides state-of-the-art operating rooms, where specialized surgeons operate outside the law. A place that is well connected to our primary objective - whose identity we will avoid revealing - hospitalized there for a heart transplant, despite a very rare genetic condition known as Situs Inversus (practically the owner of a body with the positions of the organs reversed ). Even on this occasion, however, there are two targets: the patient just mentioned and his lawyer, a tireless woman with strong ties to the Yakuza, who walks through the halls of the GAMA as if it were her property. And so far the Hokkaido chapter might seem extremely similar to all the others, but in reality agent 47 is forced to face the task without any tools, as he infiltrated the center in place of another customer. The developers explained that they wanted to make the experience a little more unique, after noting the fans' appreciation of the alternative conditions during the completion of the mission (also specifying that any future chapters could contain even more peculiar situations and limitations major). Obviously, the Hokkaido chapter can still be tackled with the right equipment, but this is fully unlocked only when the right Mastery level is reached. Not that there's a huge need anyway, given that the fusion of luxury SPA and hospital offers a nice assassin countless possibilities. While, in fact, some of the primary kills are still quite easy to obtain, the map in Hokkaido has an edge in terms of alternative options, which - leaving aside the usual poisoning and sabotage - are sometimes really hilarious. Killer Yoga We avoid revealing too many killing methods, just saying that a couple of possibilities take advantage of saunas and yoga, while others are extremely bloody (especially on the main target) and are not even a walk to complete at high levels of difficulty. On the one hand, in fact, it is always possible to easily get around certain situations with the right disguise, but the non-player characters able to recognize 47 are positioned in a fairly strategic way, and it is sometimes difficult to arrive unnoticed in a specific area. The strong point of the GAMA complex, however, is neither the level of challenge nor the extension: the map of this chapter is in fact more concentrated than in other highly appreciated episodes such as Paris or Sapienza, and its primary quality lies in the versatility, as its rooms and hidden areas have an impressive amount of interactive elements that are great for killing extra targets in addition to the main two. Hokkaido, in practice, is a great map for the Contracts that can be approvedcreatively hunt with kills often at the level of the primary ones (all aided by a slight improvement in the ~tree~ reactions of the artificial intelligence, which vary according to the chosen target making it easier to activate the conditions necessary to eliminate it). In short, it is a map that can be played for a long time by perfectionists and by those who adore trinkets and alternative modes to the main adventure, but which in practice does not reach the levels of the best additions to the game. From a narrative point of view, it offers in any case a discreet conclusion to the first season, making this return of the series a product - overall - of excellent workmanship and quality. Returning to the initial question, however, how many of you are still interested in its evolution after all these months?
