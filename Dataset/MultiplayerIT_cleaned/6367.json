When you are looking for relaxation, when you want to smell a little countryside, when you want to go back to being little dreamers chasing insects or brave stream fishermen. The author's game by the Japanese team Neos Corporation takes its cue from many places to create a moment of pleasant entertainment in a Japanese village so sweet and tender that you can't do without it anymore. Why go around with a net or a fishing rod, shoot on the streets, over and under the bridges of Kumamoto it becomes a splendid bucolic routine, one of those that delve into some of our most intimate needs and remind us that yes, that in the midst of nature is the perfect life that perhaps we all would like to have . Splashes of Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon make up a well-made cartoon, seasoned with small touches of gameplay that fill the rural offer with intelligence. In the review of Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation you will find out why this work should be part of your collection on Nintendo Switch. A child walking alone As per good Japanese tradition, eating with the family is a must here too! Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation tells the slightly crazy story of Shinnosuke, a 5-year-old boy who, together with his parents, goes to visit family friends in a remote Japanese countryside village. Upon arrival at the station, however, they are approached by a strange character who gives the little boy a strange camera. This is how Shin-chan sets off to discover the village, experiencing days full of childish discoveries among insects, plants, rivers and country life, until a twist makes his week-long vacation ... a loop from which he cannot you can go out. Not bad, since Shin-chan has precise objectives and if we also get in the way of the arrival of strange dinosaurs, his could soon become the perfect vacation. The logic of the game is very simple: Shinnosuke is a child who walks around peacefully in a cheerful and carefree country village, noting events, discoveries and episodes in his diary. Marking events in the diary is not an end in itself: Shin -chan will be commissioned by the local newspaper to contribute, with his stories of the newspaper, to compose the editorial manifesto of the day, earning money and unlocking dinosaur cards. Exactly, cards: the dinosaurs that history will let you find walking around Kumamoto will be used by the children's club to give birth to 1-on-1 rock-paper-scissors battles, using precisely the dinosaurs - each with its own characteristics - equipped with one of the your cards, which grant stat improvements. This is how Shinnosuke's typical day takes shape: family meals, day and night out collecting species of insects, fish, flowers and plants, planting and following the growth of vegetables, delivering objects and groceries around, earning money . Country life A little morning exercise... get ready to welcome some dinosaurs too! There is no doubt that there are many things to do, but time passes quickly and every now and then you will have to buy food and eat: running around and progressively unlocking areas is a real delight, made even more fun by a story that slowly, albeit in its sweetness and simplicity, intrigues and leads you, at the end of the holiday, to always return to the beginning, in a strange loop that brings with it some things from the previous one (all dictated by history, mind you). The week that repeats itself from the side to advance slowly, calmly, to discover a place that exudes Japan from every pore and takes us back to the summer afternoons of childhood of many of us running free among gardens, little animals, humble but important horizons and discoveries, making Shin-chan the mirror of a fairy tale from other times never like the current one, in a period of intense climatic upheavals. However, there are some small flaws: thanks to a strange game of direction of the intersections , navigation between areas is not the most immediate and getting lost is the order of the day; or the battles between dinosaurs, it's good to sketch them, but maybe making them even faster wouldn't have been bad. Even earning yen soon becomes an easy and almost useless operation already from the ~second~ week. But that's okay, because in the face of all this there is a simple writing, but refined in its childish essence, which helps to experience the summer adventure from the eyes of a nice, weird, cheerful, carefree and in his own way very curious Shinnosuke. There's not much to do, yet there's so much to play: if a quick first glance can give the idea that basically the coif they are always the ones to do, the narrative and visual alchemy implemented by Neos Corporation makes each day different from the previous one, caught up in a mix of routine and discovery that amuses and keeps you hooked thanks also to a deliberately elementary but splendid artistic trait .", "date": "2022-08-23", "grade": "8.5"}
