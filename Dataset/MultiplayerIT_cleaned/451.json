{"name": "Samurai Legend Musashi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-legend-musashi.html", "text": "Back in 1998 the grandiose Brave Fencer Musashi made its appearance on PSX, an Action-Rpg by Squaresoft whose protagonist was a funny ~deformed~ samurai with blue hair, namesake of the very famous Miyamoto Musashi. Probably this is an unknown title for some, given that for unknown reasons the game never made it to Europe, but JRPG lovers who have had the good fortune to try it will certainly have been anxiously awaiting a sequel worthy of its predecessor, which could let them relive the adventures of the little blue hair. After seven years of waiting, finally Square-Enix presents us with the long-awaited sequel to BFM: Samurai Legend Musashi. Considering the high level of Square productions, especially those of the distant past, one would expect a good quality title, capable of captivating anyone with the typical magical atmosphere that only Square can give ... but this time the more Rpg software house world famous failed the spell, and Samurai Legend Musashi not only falls short of the prequel, but also proves to be a mediocre game full of flaws. Plot and surroundings The story tells of a people, the Mystics, who one day saw themselves threatened by an organization of villains, the Gandrake Corporation, who wanted to conquer the world through the use of a precious mineral called nebulite. The Mystics had been targeted due to their ability to extract large amounts of energy from the nebulite, and to defend themselves from their oppressors they had decided to summon a hero capable of countering the organization. It all begins with the young princess Mycella, who in front of a large crystal, tries through the use of powerful magical arts to recall the fearless swordsman from a parallel world ... but it is too late, the Gandrake Corp is attacking the poor people, and the princess is kidnapped. Fortunately the summoning was successful, and Musashi was catapulted into this new dimension to restore peace to the world. Those who have played Brave Fencer will have had a feeling of deja vu reading these lines, since Samurai Legend starts in the same and identical way as its predecessor. I would also like you to remember the first impact with the protagonist of BFM, who immediately gave the impression of a rather bizarre and ironic character, and in fact what captured us from the beginning were his rather hilarious ways of doing and speaking. Now forget everything, the new Musashi has nothing to do with his ~ancestor~, he is not as charismatic and funny, and above all he fails to be appreciated even as events progress. Plot, character development and dialogue drafting are unsatisfactory, and often result in childish platitudes that make you regret the energy and fun that BFM was able to give. Manga and video game The purely aesthetic technical aspect is of excellent workmanship and at the beginning you can admire a nice cartoonish film which serves as an introduction to the style of the game: the imprint that we wanted to give to Samurai Legend Musashi through the use of what Square defines the technique ~Manga-Shading~ (a small variation of the very popular Cel-Shading) is in fact that of a cartoon. Graphically, the work done leaves you speechless, very clean and detailed textures, bright colors, design of the characters and very ~stylish~ locations, probably one of the best cel-shading achievements of the PS2. However, all this ~visual goodness~ was the death of playability, since it is certainly one of the causes for which the game suffers sporadic slowdowns despite having a low framerate in itself ... The audio quality is fluctuating, some aspects have been cured, others barely reach the sufficiency. The music belongs to the first category, they are very catchy and go perfectly with the game situation: for example, during the exploration we will be accompanied by easy listening ambient tunes, while during the events of the plot the music acquires passion and depth. What instead belongs to the second category are the sound effects and the voice acting: the voices are really bad, without expressiveness and not very engaging, the effects instead are bland and repetitive ... in short, nothing that can slightly improve the overall not rosy picture . The art of the sword The objective of the game is to find the five Virgins who possess the five special swords (fire, water, air, earth and darkness) necessary for Musashi to end the oppression of the Gandrake Corporation. To save them we have to explore various types of locations (including forests, mines and temples), in which our only task (besides solving silly puzzles) is thatllo to cut the bad guys on duty through the combined use of our weapons. Musashi uses two swords: one is the simple katana used to make quick attacks, the other is one of the special swords, useful for more powerful but slow blows; it is also possible to mix the two types of attack to create very effective combos. Musashi, just like his 1998 alter ego, has the ability to duplicate enemies' attacks: by quickly pressing a simple keystroke, combined with good timing, it is possible to learn new special shots to exploit in our favor . The main flaw of Samurai Legend Musashi is the fact that it is an extremely slow game, the character moves at a rather low framerate, and even when running it seems as if he were walking. Musashi is also slow in wielding swords, and often the combos end up making us vulnerable in case the blow misses. All of this takes a toll on the fun, as it's like moving a huge piece of wood through a puddle of slime. We also add the extreme stupidity of the opponents, the simplicity of the boss schemes (which significantly lower the level of difficulty and which make learning special skills useless) and a linear level design that requires massive backtracking , and so we get a title that from the point of view of playability leaves a lot to be desired, in which frustration reigns supreme. Unity is strength However, the game is not all about fighting: while exploring the levels, our task will also be to seek out and free the inhabitants of the Mystics' village, Antheum. The village is nothing more than a kind of huge tower, positioned on the back of a flying white whale, where it is possible to buy useful items, upgrade weapons, restore energy and talk to the inhabitants to progress the story. The Antheumians have been scattered and hidden in the various locations to ensure that they are not captured by the soldiers of the Gandrake Corp, but now they must be freed to repopulate the village and help us in our adventure. Their invaluable help is based exclusively on services of various kinds, many are owners of shops where you can buy, for example, healing items or upgrade swords, while others are absolutely useless, except for a chat. There are also a couple of mini-games (which wink at that of the Final Fantasy VII motorcycle) in which we have to make a journey aboard a means of transport and defeat the opponents who will try to hinder us. These are the only notable sub-quests offered by the game, and unfortunately they add nothing to the fifteen boring hours it will take on average to finish the adventure. Comment As it is easy to see from the analysis of the new Action-RPG Square-Enix, the defects are many and certainly do not go unnoticed. For those like me who were looking for a worthy successor to the excellent (although not perfect) Brave Fencer Musashi, they can only be disappointed ... while partially reproducing the original formula, Samurai Legend proposes it again worsened in almost all aspects. For those unfamiliar with BFM, things don't change much, the advice is to leave it on store shelves and wait for Kingdom Hearts 2 to arrive. Pros: Noteworthy graphic style Above average music sector Cons: Too leeeeeento. .. Too easy... Too boring!", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
