The developers have in fact experimented with various solutions, starting with the peculiar graphic style, capable of transmitting an excellent atmosphere, to naturally arrive at the mechanics that regulate the gameplay, all based on looting and crafting, with the boulder of permanent death to consolidate the project and to characterize it in a strong, in many ways courageous way. The release of the ~internal~ Reign of Giants expansion took place in conjunction with the arrival of the game on consoles, and for a few days now Wii u owners have also been able to access this interesting experience. Let's see how it went. Dwarfs in trouble The protagonist of the game is Wilson, a sort of young inventor who one day, inspired by some strange rumors, creates a very particular machine. In reality, the drive to build came from an evil being, a sort of dark spirit which, after starting the device, projects the boy into a mysterious clearing, abandoning him to his fate. Will he be able to survive or will he succumb to hunger and thirst, as well as to the mysterious monsters that seem to inhabit the darkness and that only the light of the fire keeps away? It is at this point that the experience of Don't Starve: Giant Edition begins, which as mentioned includes an ~internal~ expansion, to be activated or not when starting a new game, together with all the rest of the options which, however, we already know and which allow us to shape the (generally random) scenario by inserting more or less types of objects, and perhaps selecting one of the four available seasons from the start, also a novelty compared to the original edition. Each of our attempts in the Klei Entertainment title is a story in itself: the setting changes, as well as the arrangement of the resources that we can collect and the many hostile creatures that at a certain point will begin to show themselves. Permanent death will conclude a different game each time, in short, in an undoubtedly ruthless way but finding ourselves increasingly prepared and aware of what awaits us and what we must do to survive as long as possible. Also on Wii U Don't Starve: Reign of Giants confirms itself as a fascinating, profound and particular title Eat, pray, love We can face the experience of Don't Starve as Wilson or one of the other characters available, which can be unlocked by earning experience points: the longer you survive, the more you get. In Reign of Giants, however, the original roster has been enriched by the introduction of two new figures, Wigfrid and Webber, respectively a sort of ~Viking~ who only eats meat and an anthropomorphic spider. Each character has unique abilities that influence their behavior in certain situations, but even in this case it will be practice that will show us which of them can best adapt to our approach. Once catapulted into the scenario, our goal will be to collect sticks and stones to build a rudimentary axe, then start cutting down some trees, cutting tufts of grass, picking berries or carrots. Primary elements that will be placed in the inventory, visible in the lower part of the screen, and that we will be able to use to build a whole series of increasingly more complex objects, whose menu opens by acting on the left trigger of the GamePad. Not wanting to spoil what in effect are the real surprises of Don't Starve, specifically the marvels that Wilson and his colleagues will be able to assemble from a certain point on, we can say that even at this juncture the imagination of developers indulged themselves and there are some goodies that can make you smile. Suffice it to say that things will change quite a bit compared to the rudimentary rabbit traps or campfires that we will have to build at the beginning to try to survive. Beyond the progression, which as mentioned ends in a cruel way in the event of a game over but which can be saved and resumed later if the character is still alive, the crux of the matter is to always keep an eye on the indicators of hunger, vitality and mental health that are located in the upper right, as well as the rudimentary clock that signals the looming of the night. Darkness in the game is your worst enemy, so make sure you always have what you need to start a fire. Portable survival The peculiarities of Wii U allow you to enjoy the experience of Don't Starve: Reign of Giants in two ways, namely by playing in front of the TV, with the GamePto permanently illustrate the map, or by referring to the screen integrated into the controller itself. Switching from one type of view to another is a matter of a moment, just touch the relevant icon on the touch screen, and the fact of enjoying this freedom with a survival game like this is undoubtedly an interesting bonus. Unfortunately the size of the text and the interface in general don't help, so on the GamePad it's a bit hard, unless you keep the screen relatively close, perhaps while you're in bed. The fact of having to access the map by pressing a key does not constitute an obstacle, but the perplexities that we have encountered in general in the console versions of the game remain: using the backbones and the directions of the D-pad for the selection and use of objects is a solution that requires a little practice, and that in the most agitated situations (which occur in particular in Reign of Giants) can be slow and cumbersome. In short, it takes a little more practice than the mouse / keyboard combination that we originally saw on PC. Beyond this, technically the conversion is excellent, with only a few small uncertainties in the most chaotic moments. The peculiar graphic style, which we have already mentioned, is enriched in this edition by further facets concerning the presence of all four seasons, as well as by the extravagant design of the creatures we will be dealing with.", "date": "2015-06-11", "grade": "S.V."}
