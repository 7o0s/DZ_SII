{"name": "Dalle origini alla leggenda", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/122542-rayman-legends-dalle-origini-alla-leggenda.html", "text": "Released in November 2011, the previous Rayman Origins had shouldered the thankless task of bringing back a character now almost forgotten, moreover relying on a playful structure - that of the classic two-dimensional platform - with which it is a difficult undertaking nowadays reach a particularly large audience, unless one's name is Mario. Despite the obvious difficulties, Michel Ancel's work was able to conquer the critics and made its way through the distrust of the mass public, reaching a volume of sales sufficient to justify a sequel. Road cleared for the present here Rayman Legends, then? Not really: the second chapter of the new course of the aubergine man must now demonstrate that the brand has the strength to stand on its own legs and become a real series. To achieve this goal, the Ubisoft Montpellier studios have done the best possible thing, avoiding resting on their laurels and filling this sequel to the brim with new ideas and content. I unlock everything If Rayman Origins already presented a barely sketched story that could easily be done without, Rayman Legends goes even further, almost completely eliminating the plot from the playful economy and concentrating only on offering a large number of different stages: free from whatever constraint of stylistic or narrative coherence, the Ubisoft title can therefore indulge in the single, very noble purpose of entertaining the player, adopting a basic approach that resembles that of the two-dimensional Super Mario titles. A choice that is also reflected in the adoption of a central hub that allows you to tackle the various levels without rigid succession mechanisms: it is therefore possible to roam freely along this sort of art gallery where each painting represents the entrance to a single stage , with temporarily inaccessible elements covered by a red sheet. One thing that is immediately striking about Rayman Legends is the great emphasis placed on unlocking new content, with different types of collectibles each having its own specific purpose: Lums serve to make new playable characters available, with Teens being saved along the way. along the way, access to more advanced levels opens up, while the cups obtained as a reward for one's performances contribute to increasing the Myticaggine rate, which in turn determines access to the various daily and weekly challenges that can be tackled online. Not only that: by reaching the amount of Lums established for each stage, you receive scratch cards (to be revealed strictly by rubbing your finger on the GamePad touchscreen) thanks to which you can obtain extra amounts of Lums or Teens or unlock bonus levels or cute little creatures that they will crowd a dedicated section of the gallery. While not offering anything really new in this area, Rayman Legends is very skilled in giving the player the feeling of being constantly rewarded, assisted in this sense by the controller screen which allows you to immediately view the items you have just received with simple taps. Whether or not you are a fan of the protagonist, Rayman Legends is one of the best 2D platformers of recent years Running aubergines As mentioned at the beginning, Michel Ancel and associates did not limit themselves to doing their homework on the basis of the work done with the previous Rayman Origins, but rather they pressed the accelerator even further on the level design front, instilling a creativity in the title that many other platformers dream of. The stages are divided into worlds that give a basic stylistic direction, but each single scheme practically makes a story in itself, offering unique solutions and details: gameplay ideas that would be enough for an entire game here are exploited to the maximum for a handful of levels to then be replaced by other inventions, guaranteeing Rayman Legends a truly extraordinary variety and dynamism. An even more striking result if we consider the absolute simplicity of the basic play structure, well represented by a control system that uses only three keys for running, jumping and attacking. Continuing in the adventure we find ourselves facing a whole series of different situations: therefore we pass from stages that offer a more classic style of play to others that result in crazy races in which quick reflexes are essential; again, moments in which one is encouraged to massacre enemies with slaps alternate with sections that even offer stealth mechanics; finally, there is no shortage of tasty contrasts between moments of pure action and situations in which it is advisable to stop for a moment to think to solveenvironmental puzzles or to find one of the captive Teens hidden by some element of the seabed. The discovery of the innumerable gimmicks of the Ubisoft Montpellier developers is a pleasure that we want to leave to the user, but a few words should be spent at least for those that appear to be the most successful moments of the entire production: let's talk first of all about the clashes with the bosses, during the which we are faced with large three-dimensional enemies, spectacular to see - thanks to polygonal models rendered with cel shading that makes them almost indistinguishable from the predominant 2D elements - and also quite demanding to face. Another gem are the musical stages, which flow on the basis of exciting arrangements of famous pieces (Black Betty sung by a handful of little monsters, or Eye of the Tiger in mariachi sauce, just to give two examples) and during which every action performed in rhythm with the background song. Once again, simple ideas but made with absolute care and genuine passion. Lots of stuff Maintaining the tradition inaugurated by the prequel, Rayman Legends can be enjoyed by up to four users at the same time, making use of a very convenient drop-in and drop-out system which therefore allows a player to enter and exit a game in a hurry any time by pressing a button on your controller. As in Rayman Origins, this type of local multiplayer works great, making the title much more confusing but also very fun, with the cooperation necessary to complete the levels spiced up by a pinch of competitiveness relative to whoever wins the greater number of Lums. The main novelties obviously reside in the exploitation of the GamePad, useful not only for playing even with the TV off, but indeed the absolute protagonist of certain levels in which Murfy is added to the characters already in the game, a funny flying creature to be controlled via the controller touchscreen. Acting with simple taps or swipes on the screen, the user who takes on the role of Murfy must help his companions by moving objects, revealing hidden platforms, activating switches and so on, but he can also assist them in various ways, for example by stunning enemies with tickling or dragging distant bonuses within reach of the other protagonists. It is a really pleasant feature, which adds further variety to a gameplay already overflowing with inventiveness, but which inevitably loses a bit of vigor if you face the title alone: in this case, in fact, you have a companion commanded by the artificial intelligence whose behavior is not always particularly brilliant. This situation can lead to some somewhat frustrating passages, an eventuality that is sometimes repeated even in some moments of the adventure in which the proverbial balance of the product lets itself go to peaks of excessive difficulty. However, they are small flaws in an incredibly solid and varied platform, which is also intended to keep you busy for a really long time: if in fact eight hours are more than enough to get to the end of the five main worlds, then the stages of the Back to Origins section remain to be tackled ( or a substantial selection of the best schemes of the prequel, adapted for the occasion) as well as the so-called Invasion Levels, modified versions of already completed scenarios to be faced in a ~time attack~ key. The latter undoubtedly represent Ubisoft Montreal's homage to the most hardcore players, presenting a challenge rate destined to give even the most experienced platform enthusiasts a hard time: the same ones who will enjoy tackling the daily and weekly challenges available online , by completing which you will be able to earn your own space in the inevitable world rankings. Dulcis in fundo, there's even room for a delicious multiplayer minigame called Kung Foot, in which two teams challenge each other to score more goals by kicking and punching a ball, a fun that's as simple as it is effective, especially in the company of three friends. Considering all these elements, the final calculation of the contents of the Ubisoft product reaches a total of about one hundred levels, literally mind-boggling figures especially for anyone aiming to get 100% in every single picture. Quantity and quality are the watchwords that also distinguish the technical realization of Rayman Legends, superior in all respects to that of its predecessor. From a graphic point of view, the introduction of the aforementioned 3D elements and new lighting routines add further luster to an absolutely stunning two-dimensional cosmetics, with masterfully designed backdrops and characters with gracea and fluidity that are difficult to match. Strong evolution also for the sound: where Rayman Origins sinned with jingles that are a little too repeated, here we certainly did not spare ourselves, peppering the product with a considerable amount of music, all very catchy when not downright hilarious.", "date": "2013-08-26", "grade": "9.3"}
