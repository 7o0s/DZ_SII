After recently announcing the first, imminent wave of Wii software released digitally on Wii U, accustomed as we are to insipid trench warfare based on remasters and remakes, the first question to arise is: will it be technical remasters or simple port? Let's settle any doubts: the second, but it was physiological. The Wii retail catalog has been on sale for years under the Nintendo Selects label, at a list price of 24.90: Kyoto is therefore doing nothing but allowing Wii U users to access their old-gen universe via the eShop at a price of 5 less, which is also on offer in the first week of marketing. And Super Mario Galaxy 2, the first arrival of which we had the pleasure of savoring its goodness again, does not have any native improvements. No texture update, no particular GamePad support, no anti-aliasing algorithms applied; this initiative has no other objective than to re-propose the original code, as mom did and - an absolutely fundamental characteristic - at a price that doesn't excessively cannibalize the physical offer and avoid stepping on the toes of retail by proposing exclusive digital improvements. Iwata absolutely does not feel the need for absolute quality triple A titles, up to 55 months old, to be reworked and sold upwards to justify pseudo-technical update works just because they are in low definition. Affordable price, just 1.3Gb of download, expansion of the backwards compatibility chapter, total absence of other human resources employed. Let's look each other in the eyes: can we really blame him? Today's gamers are spoiled, it's true, but Super Mario Galaxy 2 doesn't need anything else to convince them, believe us. After 5 years, we're back talking about Super Mario Galaxy 2... once again, in the best way! Wiimote motorbike In tandem with the digital distribution of the library also comes a more specific general management, which finally allows you to treat everything as native Wii U applications, avoiding that cumbersome process of emulating the Wii operating system. Fast and immediate, in perfect line of thought with the Quick Start Menu implemented last year. But beyond the technicalities, what does it feel like to pick up a product from 2010? Good sensations, and not a few, especially if we are talking about a ~Bigger, Better~ sequel to one of the major titles of the last generation, Super Mario Galay to be precise. The sequel, announced in the E3 of 2009, fully took the graphic engine of the first chapter, expanding its playful offer in terms of ideas and quantities, delivering to the masses an absolutely stellar and convincing creation, capable of making the name of the director Koizumi at the top of the company's internal boards. We do not exaggerate in saying that the level design and vertical construction of Super Mario Galaxy 2 are still absolutely reference and very current, able to look down on - but from very high - any platform production unrelated to Kyoto released in the last five years . The additions of Yoshi and new power-ups are treats to longtime fans, which combined with linear map progression and the incremental enrichment of the planet used as a spaceship to move between worlds create a challenging and capable package bear the weight of the years. By now pointing to the obvious faults of the Wii's not exactly exciting hardware, the philosophy of the Galaxy series has always made a certain limitation to the horizontal extension its only structural defect, a detail that largely distinguishes it from the three-dimensional successor Super Mario 3D world. So get ready to jump from one planet to another, of varying dimensions, in which the introduction of gravity in the first chapter continues to guarantee an approach to the platform genre that is sometimes entrancing, fresh and very enjoyable thanks to the 60 frames per second, still today still a mirage for almost all console software unrelated to the Nintendo world. From the stars... to the stars Canovaccio more than known: Bowser kidnaps Peach, Mario sets off in pursuit and off with the waltz. As many as 242 stars between standard, green and secret guarantee a long, varied adventure and perhaps a true expression of the galactic vision of Miyamoto & Co.; shame about a difficulty factor that only in the end gives emotions and obstacles to completion, but let's never forget the family oriented period in which the original software was released. Affi controlsdata to the Nunchuck do not betray: often underestimated, the analog of the accessory is a true guarantee of precision, absolutely in line with quality standards not yet overwritten by subsequent evolutions of the joypads. It is the use of the Wiimote that can no longer give the satisfactions of the past: deputy for pointing to the screen to collect the Astroshards, in 2015 it is not easy to convince a player to consistently embrace a philosophy clearly derived from motion control. You pass the wrist movement to make pirouettes, but the often almost shooter-like handling is unfortunately a legacy of the past that is difficult to digest by today's standards. However, this factor must not divert attention from an indestructible playful perfection: the title plays very well, the careful study of gravity is synonymous with guarantee and does not betray, as well as the inertia of the jumps - true flagship - still has a lot to teach. Sure, we're playing a work that runs at 852x480 progressive pixels, so don't fantasize about the resolution: everything is as it once was. We still remind you that what you are buying is not remaster content but a simple digital proposition of the retail copy: if you play it on HDTV, be prepared for ladders and aliasing phenomena which, although blunted by the upscaling capacity of the Wii U CPU, still transport you back in time . The textures are much better: the ability of the new flagship to ~fill~ the low definition textures of the Wii gives extreme dignity to a graphics engine that in 2007 first and then in 2010 amazed for the beauty and sweetness of polygonal modeling and animations; thumbs up, therefore, for an artistic picture that pleases the eye despite the luster that separates us from the exit. Given the exceptional work of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, a final mention on the soundtrack is mandatory: amazing at the time, the strength of Kondo's compositions is not trudged a step.", "date": "2015-01-27", "grade": "9.6"}
