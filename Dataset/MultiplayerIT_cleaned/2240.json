{"name": "Wario Land 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wario-land-5.html", "text": "In search of lost treasure An afternoon like many others at the Wario house. He's sitting comfortably on his belly, munching chips and leafing through the newspaper but suddenly his eyes pop out of their sockets! What will he ever see? What could be so exceptional about a documentary about rediscovered pyramids? As a treasure hunter that he is, he immediately senses the possibility of earning money from this lost Pyramid and in less than no time we find him aboard his car ready to enter beyond the mysterious door. As you may have noticed, the plot is not worthy of Final Fantasy or other productions but after all, platformers have always had trivial plots behind them, focusing the focus on playability. Even the bad guys perish now Those who have already tried one of the episodes of the saga will immediately notice a big difference in this fourth installment. For the first time Wario will be able to die, renouncing the immortality that diversified him and much respect to the sagas of his good alter ego Mario. We will have a sort of energy bar (represented by little hearts) positioned at the top of the screen and we will have to be careful not to make it empty otherwise we will have to repeat the stage from the beginning. The pyramid consists of 6 large areas, each of which is made up of 4 levels. In each of them we will have to find and collect four gems, activate a switch and return to the beginning of the level before the time available to us runs out. At the end of each level a boss will be waiting for us, but before facing him we will be able to decide whether to enter a shop to buy power ups or face him directly. The various gadgets will be purchasable after disbursing the money earned during the game by killing enemies or finding them in hiding places. In addition to the gems there will be hidden CDs in each level, and by discovering them we will have the opportunity to listen to extra music tracks. The title stands on excellent levels of playability with a very well calibrated level of difficulty that will make the continuation of the adventure very pleasant, except in very rare cases in which we will be forced to start over from the beginning of the picture because we get stuck. To facilitate everything comes the first level which is a sort of tutorial, in which we will be taught all the moves that our hero can perform: jump, shoulder, run and more. Fabulous 2D This title certainly represents yet another demonstration of the mastery of Nintendo developers in the field of 2D. The graphics have been able to preserve all the elements that had made this saga famous on Game Boy Color, managing to implement greater sharpness and color palette. The result is very pleasing to the eye, with a cleaning of the seabed and a remarkable attention to detail. Just look at the effects of the water in the ice stage or the rain falling in the jungle to understand what I'm talking about. Equally good seemed to me the audio sector, which stands at the highest levels ever reached in a product intended for the portable segment. Never repetitive music and discreet sound effects are the setting for this beautiful game. In my opinion Surely we are faced with one of the best platform so far released on GBA. Nintendo has managed to produce yet another pearl of gameplay, which will be able to give hours and hours of fun, all surrounded by graphics and a variety of noteworthy settings. The only sin I can move to Wario 4 is that it got too close to other productions of the genre from a gameplay point of view but, despite everything, it is a cut above the competition. Pros:: typical Nintendo playability graphics and sound up to the task Cons: lacks originality A sui generis hero On reflection, Wario can be considered to all intents and purposes the antithesis of the videogame hero. He doesn't want to save any queen, he doesn't care about preserving happiness on earth threatened by who knows what danger. He is simply interested in getting rich by discovering a treasure and does not hesitate to get into funny adventures in order to achieve his goal. Although it was the black sheep of the Bros family, which includes great heroes such as Mario and Luigi, this Wario immediately attracted gamers from all over the world, so much so that he came to compete with the Mario Bros saga. It all started a few years ago when for the first time in Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins a cruel character appeared who tried, in vain, to take possession of Mario's castle, it was precisely Wario. Despite the bad reputation,this new character immediately attracted the attention of gamers and his appeal convinced the Nintendo bosses to dedicate a saga of his own to him (Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land). After a few years, we are faced with the last chapter of the Warioland saga, now in its incarnation number 4, which lands on our Game Boy Advance for the first time", "date": "2002-02-19", "grade": null}
