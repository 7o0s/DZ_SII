Yes, of course, it's a phrase that you may have heard many times and that seems to you just doesn't match what are the judgments of the specialized press when it comes to analyzing famous productions that are anything but original. This is because, as mentioned, originality is important but overall quality is even more so. In short, a game already seen but done very well makes it more than a game never seen but done very badly. Let's not digress, though. We mentioned originality because Sky Tourist is an original title, a lot. It is in fact an action game with puzzle elements in which we indirectly control a character within increasingly articulated levels, which develop vertically. The protagonist of the game is a nice little boy who is obsessed with space exploration, but obviously he doesn't like doing it on board a spaceship. His passion is to fix a chain between two rockets and hang there, controlling the progress of the right and left thruster in a completely independent way. This results in a control system that you have probably never tried anywhere, in which you have to touch the edges of the touch screen to make the two rockets go up or down and in this way get the chain to which the character is linked to tilt to one side or the other, sliding it left and right. The point is that the rockets and the chain are intangible with respect to the elements that make up each scenario, but the boy is not and therefore can get stuck or deal with doors that open and close, mechanisms similar to assembly lines, even hostile creatures. Remember those old games where you controlled an inclined plane on which to slide a marble with the aim of going through a maze? Well, Sky Tourist is basically the same thing, but much, much, much, much more frustrating, because the chain we've been talking about, well... breaks in no time. Sky Tourist is an original, full-bodied and fun action puzzle, but it can also be really frustrating Don't pull the chain! Seventy-five levels are not a few, and the developers of Three Legged Egg have done everything possible to diversify them, moreover succeeding in doing so. The pitfalls that characterize the Sky Tourist challenge are introduced little by little, leaving us happy and calm during the early stages but then making life a real hell, it becomes so complex, practically labyrinthine, the structure of the internships. Not only that: right from the first ~zone~ there are mechanisms that make ~trial & error~ a real obligation, in this case panels that open only in one direction and that make up ~passages~ that can be successfully tackled only by following a certain path. The problem isn't even so much that you have to stop, admit defeat and start over, as much as that the checkpoints are questionably placed and you often have to start the level over again to make a new attempt. And the ~vaffa~ spontaneously and abundantly see when the chain breaks, so much so that in those moments it seems to grapple with one of the most frustrating mobile experiences ever. Here, apart from this significant inconvenience, which perhaps could have been solved simply by making the chain indestructible (after all, the other problems would have remained intact, only smoothing out the ~crack the iPhone in two~ effect), Sky Tourist is - we repeat - an interesting and very original product, well packaged, full-bodied, with a traditional ~rewards~ structure (with three stars per stage: one is obtained by completing it, one by collecting all the objects and the last by reaching the finish line without dying) and simple but captivating, fluid and colorful graphics.", "date": "2013-08-07", "grade": "7.5"}
