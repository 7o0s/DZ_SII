Instead of exploiting the winning trail of the title in a sinister way with a patched-up product, the programmers of TT Fusion wanted to reward 3DS owners with a prequel equipped with all the trappings, a direct emanation of the original for Wii U both for storyline and for play structure. So let's find out if such a radical change of platform has affected or not the overall quality of the experience. So small and fragile Anyone who knows the chapter released for the Nintendo flagship (of which you find our review here) knows that the story behind the adventure opened quite abruptly, with the protagonist Chase McCain returning to LEGO City after being forced to leave some time before. LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins arrives just right to plug the holes, turning back time two years and staging our hero's first steps in the police force and subsequently the exploits that will lead him to earn real own crime-fighting legend. It's not essential to have played the original on Wii U to fully enjoy the events that form the backdrop to the action, but certainly having done so allows you to better appreciate certain nuances regarding the different positions of the characters or some variations of the scenario. What doesn't change (fortunately) are the massive doses of humor that enrich the progress of the events, whether they are represented by slapstick-style gags or by jokes that recall the most typical clichs of detective stories. It's just a pity that part of the humorous charge is lost due to the inaction of the dubbing, present only in the main interlude sequences: for the rest, the game relies entirely on text screens that are functional but which do not always prove to be the ideal partners to convey a certain type of comedy. This is one of the various limitations - more or less marked - to which the developers of TT Fusion had to bend to pursue the very noble intention of offering 3DS users a play structure as similar as possible to that for Wii U. So here is that the game remains basically a GTA-style free roam, with an entire city at the player's disposal to collect tokens and bricks, complete missions, drive cars, compete in mini-games, and so on. However, it is evident that the potential of the Nintendo portable is not the same as that of a modern home console, and it can be seen from various aspects that it has not been possible to completely mask, such as for example the significantly less crowded scenario, the reduced complexity of the settings and the fog that mercilessly covers the clipping that reduces the visual horizon. Elements literally cut with an ax from TT Fusion, who preferred to greatly lighten the weight of the driving sections in the playful economy probably precisely because they didn't pale too much compared to the Wii U version, also considering how the frame rate doesn't always hold up hit. The result is an atypical sandbox, which prefers environments limited to the main hub (in this case the city) that contains them, and which manages to give its best in the less open sections. The 3D effect LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins makes excellent use of the three-dimensional potential of the Nintendo laptop: raising the slider to the maximum, the sense of depth of the scenarios is truly convincing, and reaches its climax when wandering through the streets of the city. In this sense, it would have been great to be able to enjoy a wider visual horizon, but even so the game looks good. Been there, done that It must be said that in a difficult area such as that of the control system, LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins behaves very well, delegating the rotation of the camera to the two back buttons and assigning the primary actions to the front buttons without too many worries: occasionally you miss the possibility of moving the view vertically, but in principle you can play quietly even without a double analog. The developers of TT Fusion were then clever in transferring to the touchscreen all the functions that in the Wii U version had been intended for the GamePad screen: so with quick touches you can access various menus, expand screens ofinformation or advice, activate the scanners available to Chase and quickly change clothes. In fact, one of the winning features of the previous title makes its welcome and inevitable return, namely the presence of a whole series of costumes to unlock and which guarantee special abilities once worn. There is some variation on the theme, but in essence these are the same concepts expressed on Wii U, a phrase that could actually perfectly summarize the very essence of LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins. Therefore, if on the one hand it is absolutely commendable for a 3DS product to be able to faithfully replicate the look and gameplay of a home console title, on the other hand it is inevitable to experience frequent sensations of deja-vu when you meet to go around the same settings, unlocking already known rewards and basically completing very similar missions albeit inserted in a slightly different narrative context. Obviously, this is a criticism that should be taken into consideration only and exclusively by those who have already faced the adventure for Wii U: for all the others, however, LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins is an enjoyable product, varied and decidedly long-lived (especially if you aim to unlock and collect everything the game has to offer), which yes brings with it the strengths and weaknesses of the original but which at the same time is an exponent of a genre undoubtedly among the least inflated in the Nintendo portable soft library. Furthermore, it doesn't hurt that technically the work of TT Fusion is much more than decent, with the fog that obscures the horizon and the pop-up of some elements, however compensated by the care placed in the vast scenarios and by the excellent quality of the animations of the personages. Also in this area, the affinities with the Wii U version are manifold, even as regards many of the sound effects and music: and if this is undoubtedly a merit, the same cannot be said of the very long uploads that the user is forced to endure, in fact one of the least enviable trademarks of Chase McCain's adventures...", "date": "2013-04-18", "grade": "7.5"}
