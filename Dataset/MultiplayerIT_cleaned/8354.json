Questions of genetics: inside him there is the very history of the video game, which often, in the past, coincided with that of Mario. Here, in 1985, the two-dimensional platformer as we know it today was born; this is where action games were born. Here, between 1989 and 1991, that genre was taken to heights never reached before, and probably not even since. Here is the noblest and most royal blood that can exist in electronic entertainment, and for this it makes the way Nintendo has taken care of, and is taking care of, its tree of life. Mario, the two-dimensional one, was abandoned for fifteen long years: abandoned because Miyamoto, and therefore Nintendo itself, conceived it as outdated. As if Mario, the three-dimensional one, were its natural evolution. New Super Mario Bros has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the postulate: these are two different shrubs, and in this area the instinct of the mass has proved to be more acute both than the reflections of the journalists and, more seriously, than the ideas of the developers. To err is human, but to persevere, as they say, is diabolical: the Nintendo creatives have never accepted the reality imposed by New Super Mario Bros. Of course, Iwata and the marketing men toasted 2D, because it outsells all the others , because it sells more than everything (52 million with just two games, with an associated increase in the console's installed base), but this was not enough to restore prestige to the brand. It wasn't enough to put the precious little hands of Koizumi, Miyamoto or Eguchi at work on the two dimensions. And so here we are in New Super Mario Bros 2, more produced than created. It's me, Mario! Of course, however uninspired and too derivative, making an ugly Mario is impossible: the precision of the controls, and the quality of the craftsmanship in general, are pure excellence. Years and years of experience cannot be lost, unlike genius, and in this New Super Mario Bros 2 it is no exception: collisions, inertia, changes of direction, jumps, triple jumps and slides, interaction between character and objects, everything is Perfect. It's hilarious. Similar speech for the leaf, which finally returns after years of absence (or rather, generations: we are talking about 1989, and Super Mario Bros 3) and reveals itself in all its extraordinary eternal youth, making the stages multiplanar, changing the rhythm with which they cross each other, proving effective even with polygons and overall reinforcing its candidacy for a privileged position next to the sacred trinity mushroom-flower-star. Compared to the past, flight loads faster, and gliding is easier because you don't have to tap the button repeatedly, but everything is part of the softening and speeding up operation that carries on the design of New Super Mario Bros, and in this if the modifications do not alter the brilliance of the original power-up. In addition to the problems due to excessive conservatism, which we will see shortly, the reasons why this new episode cannot be considered a success are conceptual in nature. Super Mario Bros 2, the Japanese one, was also a ~more of the same~: but it was admittedly so, in the light of the sun it took the elements of the progenitor and mixed them into an infernal minestrone, made on purpose to appease hunger and desire of challenge of the enthusiasts. New Super Mario Bros 2, on the other hand, introduces the theme of coins, which timidly appears here and there in level design, but which does not alter the essence of the game, limiting itself to a marginal role. There isn't a single reason to justify the yellow packaging, nor the other graphic elements that would suggest a new thematic nucleus. There would have been many ways to put the collection of tokens at the center of the adventure, and it is not up to us to list them, but Nintendo has not undertaken even one. 3D effect Despite the lateral scrolling of the work, Nintendo could not avoid giving New Super Mario Bros 2 a three-dimensional effect as well. As is natural in this context, it is more of a fascinating tinsel than a decisive feature for enjoying the adventure to the fullest, unlike when it happened for Super Mario 3D Land. There are some moments, especially in the final stages of the game, which enhance the three-dimensional vision, but overall the experience remains substantially unchanged. Restoration New Super Mario Bros was an attempt, fifteen years later, to bring together the salient features of the successors within the essentiality of the first episode, Super Mario Bros, setting everything up with a polygonal interaction. Experiment not brilliant but fully successful, which would have been egperfected with the successor on the Wii, which gave the project a wider scope and above all a multiplayer dimension that directly touched the soul of level design. New Super Mario Bros 2 is the derivative sequel to an already mannerist project in itself, an element that makes every level, world or event all too obvious. Innovative or experimental situations can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and often they focus only on the search for secrets: the first level that could not have existed in the 80s is found in the second world, and the only world that takes full advantage of the potential offered by the polygons is the one with an airplane theme. A little bit, in short. For the rest, everything has already been seen: you get from point A to point B by jumping over ravines (and so far nothing bad), avoiding already known enemies, facing dangers already seen and settings already crossed. Even the latter is a serious problem: it seems that the creative Nintendo do not have enough imagination to invent new worlds. Grass, desert, water, snow, fire: the same Super Mario Bros 3 that introduced them already offered two less obvious ones, namely the fourth, with a giant theme, and the seventh, based on pipes. The first New Super Mario Bros brought the swampy world and the mountain world, not too interesting but at least new settings. This sequel doesn't introduce even one of them, it has only six worlds, plus three secrets (less vast than the others) which are a sort of anonymous ~free~ themed stage container. The same situation in the effort made to design new mini bosses, dangerously close to zero. Where is the ambition? Don't think that the problems of New Super Mario Bros 2 are the same problems of the 2D platformer. Although the genre has been mistreated for a decade, in recent years it has shown that it can evolve brilliantly in the world of the network, see Little Big Planet, which can still say a lot in the hands of creative developers, like Super Meat Boy, and which can still reach peaks of absolute excellence, see Donkey Kong Country Returns. The fact that a Mario game, albeit on a laptop, is clearly inferior to the three platformers just mentioned, should be worrying. And that Nintendo does not feel everything as lese majesty is the most alarming symptom of all. When will Iwata decide to put his top teams, and his most talented men, back to work on this saga? And above all, how much longer will a 2D Mario be able to drive console sales without the public getting tired? The first New Super Mario Bros, after fifteen years of absence, was mauled by hunger. The second brought the saga back to the home console after three (three!) generations, giving the whole a veil of contemporaneity with multiplayer and novelty through the nice power ups. And this? This proposes nothing new, and is conceptually confusing. Iwata will soon have the first answers, and it is not certain that they will be what he expects: not even on a commercial level. Never underestimate the judgment of your audience. From the WiiU onwards, the Nintendo Virtual Console will be enriched, detaching itself from the reference platform and becoming more like an online archive. It could be a double-edged sword, because it is clear that Super Mario Bros 3 will still sell a lot, for the umpteenth time, just as it had sold a lot between 1989 and 1991. But someone, even among the youngest, could notice that just that old ruin annihilates the polygons of New Super Mario Bros 2 pixel by pixel: try to compare the second world of Super Mario Bros 3 to the second of this new chapter, also with a desert theme. It's not a matter of nostalgia, it's a matter of harmony, genius and quality. All elements present in the DNA of New Super Mario Bros 2, buried by the layers of time, waiting to re-emerge. Waiting for skilled hands, the ones that shaped this saga, the ones that now deal only with the three-dimensional Marios. Waiting to be pulled out, and to lay claim to the throne.", "date": "2012-08-29", "grade": "7.5"}
