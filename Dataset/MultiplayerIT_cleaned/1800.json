{"name": "Onimusha 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/onimusha-7.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] High-profile technique Sony said it over a year ago, when words were wasted on the Xbox vs PS2 technological comparison. They said their machine was immature and required a long study process by the programmers, so the visual quality of the games would soar over the years. Today O2, obviously not alone, is the example to rightly give of Sony managers. O2 pushes the PS2 hardware to very high heights, and immerses us in an exciting frame of colors and feelings. The environments crossed by the player are alive, inhabited by people in continuous movement, beautifully represented and interactable. Everywhere you will notice small details that accompany the people: leaves in the wind, jumping frogs, swaying bamboo and butterflies, to name by heart. Many elements are interactable, others follow predefined paths regardless of you, but really there will be the temptation to experiment, and you will find yourself approaching a dog thinking you can pet it, or something like that. The only title that comes to mind for comparison is FFX, but as unlikely as it seems to you, the Square masterpiece loses out by comparison. Loading from one location to another is definitely optimized compared to the first Onimusha, and considering that the locations are more extensive and complex, it is a small programming masterpiece. The initial CG presentation is a new absolute reference in the console environment for the chromatic richness and the complexity of the animations, as well as some exceptionally successful fire effects. The interludes during the game, on the other hand, are deliberately close to the rendering of the graphics engine, even if evidently not made with the same, and vary from good to excellent, making themselves noticed in quantity. Furthermore, the 50/60 Hz option could not be missing, beautifully optimized for optimal antialiasing performance. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Playability as a yardstick O2 introduces really interesting and not obvious innovations to the game mechanics. First of all, there are some characters who accompany your samurai and who will intervene during the game in your favor or to hinder you. A sailor, a young ninja, a beautiful warrior and more. Their behavior is not predefined, but depends on how you interact and cultivate relationships. This unusual situation is managed through a gift system: you can buy or find useful items to exchange and bring as a gift. If you know how to be generous and above all careful in your choice, the recipients will be grateful to you, otherwise you could upset them and make them susceptible. The long-term consequences are considerable: one day one of them could save your life, or betray you... This new gameplay feature lays the foundations for a much more complex and less linear plot than its predecessor, and here O2 shows the best of himself with a surprising amount of animated interludes, I would say triple than before, which generates a real narrative fabric, pleasant and often interesting. As mentioned, the game locations have increased, and you will often notice with great pleasure that the stairs can be traveled directly without the need for loading and pressing the keys. A small drawback is the management of the shots, which, trying to create a cinematic cut, are sometimes confusing due to the sudden change of point of view distance during the fights. You get used to it, but I think the result doesn't live up to expectations. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] From the point of view instead of the arsenal and combat modes, it is a re-proposition of the same methods tested in Onimusha. You have an inventory of objects that you will find gradually, to be used in certain locations, now enriched by the presence of gifts. There are still medical herbs and the system for upgrading swords by absorbing souls. The weapons, on the other hand, are more numerous, and a system of upgrading the moves that can be performed in addition to the weapons has also been introduced: some attack combinations can only be performed when you have acquired them. Ranged weapons are now easily targeted using the left stick, and overall everything is mastered with great precision and an optimal feeling of control. The save systemlastly, Gio has remained unchanged and therefore requires the identification of some specific locations. A somewhat retrograde system which in any case is not particularly annoying. Conclusions Despite some small artistic details that could be revised, O2 undoubtedly represents one of the best action adventures in the Sony monolith's soft library. Impossible to imagine that this adventure does not involve anyone who has the perseverance to devote some time to it, perhaps overcoming an initial aversion to the control system or his own maldisposition towards the exploratory genre. O2 is a very enjoyable title, bettering its predecessor not only in the sumptuous graphics but in real additions to the gameplay introduced by a development team clearly inspired during the development of the game. If you haven't bought it yet, your playground has a serious flaw.
