{"name": "OffRoad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/offroad.html", "text": "Graphics and sound After a fairly accurate presentation we immerse ourselves in the heart of the game and more precisely in the options: in addition to the vast choice of resolutions to adopt we will also have a certain freedom as regards the level of detail or the distance of the horizon as well as whether to enjoy the effects sounds present in a well-implemented Dolby Surround. As is my habit, I launch the game at 800x600 in 32-bit color with the maximum graphic-sound settings and the first painful notes begin to make their way, inexorably. The means available are discreetly made both by virtue of some textures that do their duty well and for a good number of polygons aimed at assembling these beasts; the terrains where we will compete (whether wet, snowy, dry) have not suffered a different fate but what really doesn't convince is the fluidity that occasionally forgets to be such and is produced in some shots not funny, despite the configuration of my pc (P3 500, 256 mb of ram and GeForce DDR) with which I text many games in maximum detail possible at 1024x768 in 32 bit colour. As if all that weren't enough we also get tremendous pop-up, even if we set the horizon as far away as possible. The idea of being able to compete on the same track day, night, dawn and with many weather conditions is commendable but the fluidity is not perfect and a pop-up that almost reminds me of the backdrops of Daytona Usa for Saturn or the fog of Turok at its release for Nintendo 64 they are defects that are difficult to overlook in 2001, even more so if you look at the racing games for 128-bit consoles, without graphic defects and at 60 fps very stable. Remaining in the PC field to make an illustrious comparison, it is also true that Colin Mc Rae Rally 2.0 is expensive in terms of hardware requests, but guarantees an excellent graphic rendering without counting a (globally speaking) better technical realization. To dispel any doubts from your mind, I can tell you that playing at night, with the rain and the maximum number of opponents (five), it is not possible to go much beyond a scant twenty frames per second, with resolutions of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 32-bit color, with medium or high detail level. During the game there is no music and the few that are playing certainly don't make you cry out for a miracle (despite the Rock, done well, everyone likes it) while the roars of the engines don't seem very well kept to me; the inclusion of Dolby Surround is commendable, perhaps the most convincing feature of the mediocre audio sector (and not only). Playability and longevity The game presents the possibility of taking part in a championship, of having a race in its own right and of doing some healthy time trial; it is possible to challenge a friend via split screen or five of them via the internet, while the championship mode has a peculiarity that I think it is right to describe: it can happen that after a few races a sponsor, impressed by your skills, asks you to change teams and therefore, as a direct consequence, your trusted vehicle (it must be said that although you always arrive last you will always be in great demand). Whatever 4x4 is at your disposal, however, know that you will be dealing with a rather anomalous control system: not that I expected a driving simulator, we all agree, but sometimes, we don't know how, it's easy to lose the control of your vehicle and lose precious seconds (even on dry ground). As if all this weren't enough, the Rage guys have inserted some steering wheel axes (whatever the level of difficulty, indicated there as division to which they belong) and only by sweating a lot of blood (and finding here and there some shortcuts) can you hope to finish in the top three, since, honestly, I've never been able to beat my opponents by finishing first, despite the fact that I consider myself very good. Conclusions The three main flaws of the game are: poor graphics, a game structure bordering on the trivial (topped off with a few game modes, means and tracks available) and a great frustration that takes over after a handful of games. If you want a racing game with off-road vehicles and the like, there is the possibility of choosing between the whimsical Insane by Codemasters and the more canonical 4x4 Evolution by Terminal Reality, since no one, frankly, would recommend buying the Rage title instead of the two mentioned above, least of all the (very strict) undersigned. Maybe next time, Rage. Anglo-Saxon rage There are times of the year where so many video games are presented that it is hardly possible to even remember the name of half (or even a quarter!) of them; E3 or, for console maniacs, the Tokyo Game Show (upcomingspring edition of 2001) are appointments where there are many projects that come to light for the first time or begin to show themselves in the form of inviting trailers or screenshots galleries. The preamble in question is aimed at making you understand the gaze of the editor present here when he has finished unwrapping the parcel just delivered and found this Off Road in his hands honestly the title seemed to me a bit, how to say, poor or, better yet, too common. After a couple of days a flash passes through my mind making me remember having heard (albeit almost zero) about this title and to confirm this I tried to exclaim the name of the development team in my mind: Rage! That's right, just them, the creators of Incoming, Expendable and many other titles. The peculiarity of this prolific English software house is to provide its games with an enviable visual aspect, aimed at squeezing the best computer configurations available at the moment, however at the expense of a too repetitive and sometimes frustrating gameplay ... who among you finished Expendable at least once, having great fun for the whole duration of the game, raise your hand (how desolation...)!", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
