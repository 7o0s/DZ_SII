Nonetheless, as often happens with pioneering titles, the risk of sensitive sacrifices in terms of content and methods is always around the corner, and unfortunately this work too has not escaped the inexorable shears. We will discuss this in the next paragraph. Released later than initially optimistic forecasts, which indicated a launch parallel to the inaugural Melbourne Grand Prix in March, F1 2015 is nevertheless ahead of the traditional release of the series, reaching the hands of players in the heat of real competition, dominated again this year by the English Mercedes-Benz driver Lewis Hamilton, closely followed by teammate Nico Rosberg and, with a wider gap, by the Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel. Eager to get back on board the very fast single-seaters, we were finally able to test the final version of the game on PlayStation 4, and this is our analysis. The series dedicated to the F1 World Championship lands on the new consoles A break with the past The absence of the career mode probably represents the most serious cut in the F1 2015 package, a very hard blow for fans who will have to give up all those features that have been the beating heart of Codemasters racing for years. To further twist the knife in the wound, the fact that we are not faced with the only sacrificial victim on the altar of the transition to the so-called next-gen. In addition to the career, the Scenario and Controtempo modes, the evaluation tests, the shared screen, the online cooperative mode and even the safety car are also missing from the appeal. In short, it is a substantial step backwards compared to the previous chapters, and the only real content novelty, beyond the Pro Season, or the world championship with all driving aids disabled, 100% of the laps and the visual stuck inside without a HUD, is represented by being able to compete in two different seasons, namely the 2014 one and the current one, with all the differences of the case. In this regard, we remind you that this year, after 23 years, the Mexican Grand Prix is back in the circus with the beautiful Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, replacing the German Grand Prix which was canceled in 2015 for financial reasons. However, it should be emphasized that the renewed Season mode is decidedly more televised and engaging than in the past, thanks to the numerous animated sequences that accompany the various test phases, the pre and post-race, with the drivers engaged in interviews (framed only) or intent to listen to the suggestions of the engineers. There are also celebrations in case the podium is hit, complete with champagne poured over cheering opponents and fans. All this is accompanied by the technical commentary of two reporters who, despite not having fully convinced us due to the tone and some blunders in the pronunciation of the names (Lewis Hamilton above all), enriches the sessions with anecdotes on the history of Formula 1, on the champions of the present and of the past and on the tracks, with many curiosities that will undoubtedly please enthusiasts. Beyond the main course, it is possible to participate in the classic Corsa Veloce, challenge the stopwatch in the Time Trial, play online and consult the My F1 menu, where you can adjust some settings. Having ascertained the poverty of content, the latest effort of the British software house still manages to be forgiven when you get on the track. Here because. Playstation 4 trophies The PlayStation 4 version of F1 2015 offers 92 Trophies, divided into 46 bronze, 31 silver, 2 gold and one platinum. Those in bronze are linked to basic objectives such as completing a certain number of laps, winning certain races and various ~firsts~, such as conquering the first podium or winning the first online race. The silver ones are dedicated to winning championships and a certain number of races, both online and offline, while the two gold ones are obtained by winning 14 Grands Prix in a single season (more than Michael Schumacher) and placing pole positions, best lap time and competition victory in a race weekend. The platinum trophy is tied to winning all other trophies. The science of speed While generally welcomed as a transitional chapter, F1 2014 was one of the most significant in profileor the evolution in gameplay, having had to fully embrace the new technical regulation that has literally turned the queen of four-wheeled competitions upside down. Just think of the introduction of the so-called ~power units~, i.e. dual fuel (thermal and electric) engines powered by a 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 engine, replacing the traditional 2,400 cubic centimeter naturally aspirated V8s. This had a significant impact not only in the control of the real cars, but also in that of the virtual counterparts present in Codemasters racing, where through a well-set steering wheel it was possible to appreciate the higher nervousness of the single-seaters, especially in acceleration. This peculiar physical/dynamic model has been further evolved in F1 2015, thanks to the introduction of new parameters and algorithms dedicated to aerodynamics and in particular to the behavior of the tyres, subject with greater fidelity to phenomena such as wear, , the temperature and obviously the atmospheric conditions, the real flagship of the Ego Engine, present here in a totally renewed guise. Naturally, as befits a title that must satisfy the greatest number of enthusiasts, we are not dealing with a real simulation, although the remarkable scalability of the driving model allows everyone to have fun and get great satisfaction. Among the various parameters that can be modified we find assisted braking, the anti-lock system for the brakes, traction control and dynamic trajectory, with immediately perceptible effects on the handling of the car. With the aids disabled, the title offers an intense and satisfying challenge, also in the light of the renewed artificial intelligence, decidedly more attentive to the presence of the player on the track but also more reactive and aggressive, although sometimes there are some moles in behavior. For the more experienced players it is possible to manually set the car's set-up or choose one of the five available presets, we also find the usual control of the DRS, aerodynamic load, mixture through dedicated buttons, with the pit-stops manageable also with voice commands via Kinect and PlayStation Camera. With cold, damaged or simply worn tyres, without electronic aids, it's very easy to lose control of the single-seaters if you don't intervene on the accelerator and brakes with due delicacy, and the difficulties are amplified in the presence of aerodynamic problems. In this regard, the yield of damages is slightly higher than in the past, especially from a visual point of view thanks to the pieces of carbon flying everywhere, but the bridles imposed by the FIA have not allowed Codemasters to give free rein to an even more clear and precise. In a nutshell, the single-seaters are still too resistant, as are the suspensions. Among the most interesting introductions there are new animations related to the bounces of the cars after a contact and specific sound effects dedicated to damage; by breaking the front wing, for example, it is possible to hear the hiss of the air flow which does not pass effectively through the aerodynamic appendages. These are small details that increase realism and identification. Discreet system of penalties and flags; only in some cases did we happen to not be warned or penalized for some corner cutting or incorrect manoeuvre. Unfortunately we have not yet been able to test the game with a steering wheel, however the DualShock 4 behaves quite effectively, net of a slightly too accentuated and non-adjustable sensitivity, which in the absence of electronic aids requires a lot of practice to tame the oversteer. Overtaking Thanks to the use of the new Ego Engine, the technological step forward made by Codemasters compared to previous productions is evident, especially in the effects and in the quality of the shaders, although, at least in the PlayStation 4 version we tested, there is less cleaning of the image, which has always been one of the strong points of the British graphics engine. The slightly dirtier and fuzzier rendering of some textures and the elements of the backdrops, among which we mention the two-dimensional (immobile) public, the distant vegetation and some architecture, is counterbalanced by a decidedly more massive and detailed polygonal mass, which enhances the overall impact of the scene thanks to more solid and realistic structures. Just think of the finely replicated Monaco circuit or that of Abu Dhabi, with its ultra-modern infrastructure. However, it was the Singapore track that benefited most from the new graphics engine, with beautifully rendered night lighting and practically overlayableto the real one. The single-seater models are beautiful to look at and perfectly proportioned, so much so that in some circumstances it seems like watching a race on television, also thanks to the goodness of the anti-aliasing filter and a pinch of blur. On the other hand, the polygonal models of the pilots are less good. Exceptional as always the dynamic weather, with the rain treated both from an aesthetic point of view and in the impact on the gameplay. The puddles of water that form (and dry) on the track to serve the dynamic weather are splendid, as are the droplets of water that caress the bodywork and camera. The variability of the road surface is excellent, thanks to well-kept shaders and HDR which gives each track its own personality. The visual spectacle is enhanced by the 1080p resolution and an almost constant 60 frames per second, a first for the console version of the series and which represents a significant added value to the gameplay. Unfortunately, under certain circumstances, tearing linked to the absence of V-sync is felt, and there are some annoying but limited shots, especially during replays. The audio sector is very good, especially as regards the sampling of the engines and tires, while the dubbing in Italian and the soundtrack of the replays are less convincing. The netcode is solid enough, but the matchmaking has some problems since it may take a long time to enter the preset sessions, and an error message sometimes appears. The private lobbies have a somewhat cumbersome menu but allow you to adjust various settings. The presence of some more or less influential bugs should be noted, such as the one that prevented us from starting the Singapore race in the 2014 season. We hope they will be fixed as soon as possible.", "date": "2015-07-11", "grade": "7.4"}
