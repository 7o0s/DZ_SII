{"name": "FIFA 21", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-21-recensione.html", "text": "It took a little longer than the usual September release, but finally the FIFA 21 review has arrived. Blame as usual the Covid-19 pandemic, which also forced EA Sports to review the plans for its football simulation both due to the consequences of the lockdown that affected its offices like many others, and due to the postponement of the date of start of the major championships. The decision to delay the release therefore forced FIFA 21 to wait a few more days than the competition, which already landed on the market a few weeks ago with PES 2021 in the Season Update version. Deliberately identical in many aspects to that of last year, the Konami-branded title took leave of the current generation, confirming the goodness of its gameplay (here our review), focusing everything on its proven simulation approach to the game of football. With the FIFA 21 review you are reading, the time comes when the EA Vancouver signed series can finally answer its rival. It does so by showing off an impressive list of exclusive licenses as usual, accompanied by a series of more or less significant innovations that embrace all the modes that are part of the game. Finally including the Manager Career in a substantial way, for which FIFA fans have been asking for new features for some time. We have therefore arrived at the final act of the duel between the two football games, waiting for what will happen on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. But that's another matter: for the moment, let's find out what the version offers us of FIFA 21 out these days. The return of Volta mode For the first occasion in a few years now, FIFA 21 has reconfirmed the package of its modes en bloc, without therefore introducing new ones. Last year's novelty, Volta, is also confirmed as part of this edition, bringing with it the narrative component entitled Il Debut. Without exaggerating in terms of duration, Volta's story mode is proposed more as an introduction to the dynamics of FIFA 21 street football, taking us with this excuse around the world and to the fields with the appearance of real-world characters like ex-soccer player Kaka and freestyle star Kotaro Tokuda. The goal of EA Sports for Volta seems to have been to make this mode more attractive from a ~social~ point of view, consequently offering the player more options to customize the appearance of the characters who take the field. To try to open Volta also to those who love online gaming, the developers have also decided to give this mode a complete multiplayer dimension, introducing the ability to enter games via the Internet alone or together with dynamics similar to those of Pro Club to other friends. By forming a possible Volta team it is also possible to try to climb the divisions, as happens in the other multiplayer modes offered by FIFA 21. Coach Career The innovations promised by EA Sports for the Career mode of FIFA 21 have even led in recent months to approach this new edition to Football Manager. Even if the title created by Sports Interactive obviously remains on a very different level as regards the managerial component, FIFA lovers can now find a package waiting for them that undoubtedly makes the whole experience more interesting. Among the various novelties of the Coach Career we find first of all the interactive simulation of the match, thanks to which it is possible to speed up the passage of time of the single match, thus also shortening the time necessary to complete a season. Once the game has started in this mode, the player can at any time take the field to recover from a disadvantage or face a particularly difficult opponent, leaving the CPU to take care of the quieter moments instead. In these phases the only lack that makes itself felt is that relating to the absence of a series of buttons that allow you to adjust the speed of the simulation, forcing the player to follow the standard one which in our opinion is a bit too slow.In he list of additions made by EA Sports also includes a series of elements with which to have greater control over the growth of one's players, including those of the youth teams. As coaches, we can now plan the work activities of the entire team during the week, also indicating any specific training sessions to bring a player to practice in a role other than the predefined one. Similarly the player can set a growth path that defines the suo way of behaving on the pitch, for example setting up a false nine growth plan for a striker, thus improving him in the characteristics required to better interpret this type of role. On the other hand, the lucidity system needs to be reviewed, a little too generous in awarding bonuses to players. option that is also viable in FIFA 21. A novelty that is undoubtedly welcome, even if in the market phases the CPU does not always demonstrate linear behavior. In fact, the managers of the other teams prove to be too fickle in some situations, offering the player openly exaggerated evaluations or not accepting offers initially made by themselves. Playstation 4 trophies FIFA 21 arrives on our console with 37 Trophies, divided between the inevitable Platinum, three of the Gold type, seventeen Silver and sixteen Bronze. In addition to securing the Champions League victory, to conquer them all you have to work hard through all of the game's modes, with particular attention to Ultimate Team and Volta. FIFA Ultimate Team and surroundings If for the single game the Career is to be considered the reference mode, the FIFA multiplayer has already been focused on Ultimate Team for some time. Let's say right away that those who hoped for a revolution will be disappointed, thus postponing any sensational news to the next generation. The elements set up by EA Sports for FUT are still interesting, beyond purely aesthetic additions such as those concerning our team's stadium and its customization through elements such as colors, banners and fan chants. Ultimate Team can now also enjoy a cooperative mode that allows you to face Division Rivals with your friends, obtaining rewards as if you were playing single-player. Always with a view to playing in company that is not too exaggerated in competitive terms, we also find in Ultimate Team the possibility of playing friendly matches with those we know. We welcome the decision to remove the consumables related to physical fitness, thus allowing the player to manage your team in a more streamlined way without having to worry about an aspect that over time had become particularly uncomfortable, even according to the developers themselves. As for the innovations in the other modes present in FIFA 21, we point out the addition of a rewind function in friendly matches against the CPU, similar to the one present for example in F1 2020. Finally, the Pro Club mode has been enriched with the ability to customize CPU-controlled squad members. Moving on to multiplayer, the games played in Ultimate Team gave us different sensations. In the first place, the latency was particularly low, effectively eliminating the input lag even if for the litmus test it will be necessary to wait for the game to arrive in all the houses to see the stability of the connections. Instead, what didn't convince us is the excessive importance that is once again given to the speed of the players, who are difficult to block by the defenders in launching themselves into the open field. Predictably, a goal will emerge once again where the main theme will be the speed of the ten players on the move, with matches marked by counter-attacks from one side to the other and particularly generous results in terms of goals. It's okay that scoring is always fun, but faced with yet another 4-4 you start to understand that something is wrong. We sincerely hope that with the next generation FIFA can make a leap from this point of view as well. Gameplay: A renewed defense The FIFA 21 game framework takes up the philosophy adopted by EA Sports in the last few editions, refining the general experience seen in FIFA 20. There are therefore no upheavals in the gameplay of this edition, which however brings with it some new features to keep in mind before taking the field. To eradicate the phenomenon of those who let the CPU defend in online matches, the ability with which players move in marking when not controlled by the player has been revised. To be able to defend one's goal it is now necessary to pay extreme attention to the placement of one's players on the field, using the jockey command to contain the opponent's attacker without exposing himself to any dribbling. The tackle button should therefore be pressed only when you are sure of being able to catch the ball, to avoid finishing out of time and leaving the attacker free field. Speaking of contrast, one of the dynamics of FIFA 21 that hasn't fully convinced us isjust this: the defender's timing in the tackle is often not sufficiently rewarded, thus leaving the ball between the attacker's legs even if the tackle was made with the right timing and without committing a foul. In a defensive gameplay that wants to reward the player's skill, we would have expected to see such a situation more rewarded in favor of defense. Directed Runs Now let's move on to the Directed Runs that had teased us a lot in the preview phase. The feeling is that their use can actually open the way to hitherto precluded game dynamics, provided, however, with a period of study to be handled properly. It is in fact easy to confuse the commands available to you, as you must bear in mind that the R1 / RB key has also been associated with the new Agile Dribbling. Once you get used to it, however, it becomes possible to create actions in ways that were precluded to us up to a year ago. The possibility of blocking control over a single player is, for example, interesting from the point of view of a possible one-two constructed in a more articulated way, by shooting in the first person while continuing to control the player without the ball, to then have the ball returned by squeezing the button corresponding to the type of pass desired. On the other hand, there are situations in which giving a player controlled by artificial intelligence the direction of the shot can be a valid extra weapon, instead of just making him run straight towards the goal as was the case in the past. In this second case, however, one must bear in mind that the command given is executed a little too literally, also leading the player to leave the field if the direction given through the use of the right stick (it must be tilted and immediately released, remember this !) goes that way. Artificial intelligence The single mode has been enriched this year with a new option, which at the most advanced difficulty levels allows the player to choose whether to play against an artificial intelligence that simulates the style of play of the most famous pro players instead of trying to follow the style of the team on the pitch. Thus, more space is given to skill moves, for example finding himself in front of a particularly acrobatic Ronaldo as happens in online matches. Before starting to play, we must bear in mind that this mode is activated by default, which made us turn up our noses a bit. We decided to continue playing without it, but in case you are not happy with the way the CPU controls its teams it is still useful to know that there is a way to see something different. Agile dribbling and headers Speaking of Agile Dribbling (also present in Volta), the new dynamic that allows you to move the ball between the players' legs proves to be quite lethal if well applied. If on the one hand it adds a further element of the game, it will be necessary to monitor the situation as regards the online sector especially as regards Ultimate Team with its various boosts to the players' attributes. We are pleased to say that they have some satisfaction also given the headers, finally back to assert themselves after a period in which it had become completely useless to try to cross. If well calibrated, crosses can now once again represent a weapon with which to pierce your opponent's goal, provided of course that you have the opportunity and time to make a correct cross. Indeed, the position of our player seems to have a greater influence on the success of his actions on the pitch, regardless of the attributes. Graphics and sound Now at the end of this generation, in terms of graphics, FIFA 21 looks very similar to its predecessor. If you have already played FIFA 20 then you will hardly notice any differences, net of the aesthetic elements of the stadiums included in Ultimate Team. The point where the EA Sports branded production still needs to improve to keep up with the competition is linked to the reproduction of the players' faces, perfect for what concerns the most famous stars of the football firmament but in many cases deficient when moving on to the second and to the third lines of the teams. Even if visibly refined, the collision system continues to cause different reactions depending on the various contrasting situations, alternating moments in which the bodies seem to have their right weight with others in which they perform exaggeratedly blatant movements, also arousing a certain amount of hilarity in the beholder. A similar argument can also be made for the physics of the ball, normally equipped with the right heaviness", "date": "2020-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
