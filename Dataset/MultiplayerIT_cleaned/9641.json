Not so much because he's a superspy created by the writer Ian Fleming in '53, but more because he disappears every now and then, nothing more is known about him for a few years, and then he pops up everywhere, maybe with a new face and a new movie. There was no film this year, but two videogame titles. GoldenEye 007 for Wii was a bit of a surprise, because everyone was expecting a pale remake of the original for Nintendo 64 and instead it turned out to be a small masterpiece. With Blood Stone the situation is a bit the opposite, however, because from the developer Bizarre Creations, the same as Project Gotham Racing to be clear, we expected something more than a simple clone of Uncharted and Splinter Cell... Bond at the wheel... Blood Stone presents itself to the player as a kind of real Bond-movie from the first minutes of the game, the typical all-action prologue that leads to the opening credits, shown through the traditional ~initial~ with an unreleased song, created specifically for this game, just like a movie. And in fact Blood Stone develops just like a film, connecting the various missions with cutscenes with a decidedly cinematic cut. James Bond has the face of Daniel Craig, the last cinematic 007 chronologically speaking, and we also find Judi Dench in the usual role of M, while the Bond-girl of the situation is modeled on the features of the English singer Joss Stone, who also sings the aforementioned opening song. The three-dimensional models are remarkably faithful to their real-life counterparts and are voiced by the same actors (in English of course, as are the subtitles) even if Craig seems a little too robotic and inflexible even for his character. The usual political-terrorist intrigue is the background to Bond's ups and downs, committed as always to traveling halfway around the world in order to avert the usual international disaster. There are some unexpected twists (and even a tad bit forced) and all in all the story can be followed - and played - with pleasure, just as if you were watching the sequel to Quantum of Solace. The variety of settings and locations to visit is remarkable, even if the interior detail leaves something to be desired: 007 will face his enemies in archaeological sites, casinos, secret industries and more. Technically Blood Stone certainly does not make you cry out for a miracle, even if it manages to give its best in the driving sections that from time to time connect some moments of history, whether you are at the wheel of a car or a motorboat: in these junctures the action is surprisingly fluid despite the amount of moving elements and there are no slowdowns of any kind, if not those imposed by the script itself to make the salient moments of the stage spectacular. Playstation 3 trophies Blood Stone is certainly not stingy with Trophies: 37 Bronze, 10 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. In short, there is no shortage of variety and there are Trophies for all tastes: some can be obtained by completing the campaign and satisfying some secondary objectives, while others can be conquered by performing certain actions and reaching certain goals in multiplayer mode. ...constant danger? We've mentioned cars and speedboats, and it must be admitted that the internships aboard vehicles are perhaps the best moments of Blood Stone. In these cases, the skills of the Project Gotham Racing developers are clearly recognized: the design is satisfactory despite the simplicity of the controls and the objective, since everything boils down to remaining ~glued~ to the fugitive to prevent him from moving too far, otherwise the game will be worth it over, sometimes even driving against the traffic and facing obstacles and sudden and unexpected bends. Much less intriguing, on the other hand, are the missions on foot, which try to present themselves as a mix of elements taken from Uncharted and Splinter Cell, with the difference that the control system in this case is much less intuitive and comfortable. The result is a rather identityless gameplay that neither amazes nor conquers, not even through the bizarre use of Bond's multifunction cell phone to solve simple puzzles or gather information: even the ~Mark and Execute~ mechanic of the recent Splinter Cell: Conviction has been reproposed without particular diversifications. As in the Ubisoft title, even in Blood Stone it is in fact possible to eliminate enemies with silent melee attacks, and each assassination will offer us a sort of lethal and infallible pistol shot to be used strategically to get rid of uncomfortable targets, perhaps in order not to attract too much attention. In reality, Blood Stone would like to be a kind of stealth-game with occasional shooting and in fact it is pIt is possible to face most of the missions by hiding behind corners and obstacles waiting for the right moment to kill our opponents. However, this mechanic seems badly associated with the design of the levels which on the other hand offer countless covers to be exploited in the event of a firefight: in that case, the game does not become too different from any third-person shooter in which you have to come out at the right time to fire on the unfortunate. Among other things, the latter do not represent a great threat: the artificial intelligence is rather mediocre and our opponents tend to expose themselves too much and charge us like kamikazes when a single bullet to the head is enough for us to put them out of action. The same vulnerability is also found in the fake multiplayer mode, apparently created in a hurry to offer players a further stimulus once the short main campaign is completed: the online mode of Blood Stone offers nothing different from what has already been played previously, with the usual death-match games, team or otherwise, in which players can earn experience points to obtain various upgrades. In short, it would like to be a sort of alternative to the multiplayer of Uncharted 2 but the limited possibilities and the cumbersome control system make this aspect of Blood Stone decidedly forgettable.", "date": "2010-11-17", "grade": "7.0"}
