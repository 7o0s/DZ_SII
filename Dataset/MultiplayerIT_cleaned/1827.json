{"name": "Everblue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everblue_a.html", "text": "Sea, sea scent... It is a nightmare that pushes the young Leo to explore the depths of the waters of the islet of Daedalus, a must for diving enthusiasts: the disappearance of his friend Cao in the submerged ruins of the city of Geneapolis is tragically relived in his sleep by Leo, who intends to reveal its mysteries at all costs. Thus began, with the help of the faithful Marco, our career as explorers of the sea. The initial impact could be discouraging: the first dives only allow the recovery of small objects lost on the bottom of the sea, given that the duration of our underwater stay turns out to be very short, just as our resistance to the pressure exerted by the various depths. The backdrops, however, don't stand out for their care and detail, and probably won't surprise your eyes much, perhaps accustomed to graphic displays of a very different consistency. However, there is no need to lose heart, since in a short time our skills will grow and, with the money obtained from the sale of the various recovered objects, we will be able to equip ourselves adequately for our increasingly professional dives. Armed with sonar, it will now be possible to move further and further away from the port of Daedalus and discover the treasures and secrets hidden by the sea and its sunken wrecks, among surgeon fish and sharks. For heaven's sake, don't be fooled by the numerous fauna: the action component of the game always stands at very low levels. In fact, it can be said that Everblue has manifest simulative intentions, which translate into a constant slowness and a vague awkwardness (despite the help of the fins) in Leo's movements, hampered by the heaviness of the equipment, obviously accentuated by the water. A doubt arises spontaneously, namely to what extent the player will suffer the inexorable charm of underwater exploration regardless of the flatness-slowness of the action, the very scarce interaction with the environments, accepting this realistic (and boring) compromise. Perhaps the only ones to complete the adventure without a yawn will be fans of this unusual sporting discipline. Yes, because, it must be specified, Everblue will keep you busy. In fact, in addition to bringing to light the mysteries of Cao's disappearance, it is possible to accept the requests of the various inhabitants of Daedalus, who will reward us with coins that depict them. Finally, as the adventure progresses, Leo will be granted the additional ability to take photographs by pressing R2, with the annexed ability to create real albums which, if appreciated in the village, will give access to unpublished bonuses. Technically speaking Technically, the title stands on discrete levels: the interiors of the wrecks are well-kept and very inspired, to forget instead sandy bottoms and coral reefs, which also suffer from an annoying flickering. The textures are generally of good quality even if, given the vastness of the environments, they certainly cannot boast a record-breaking variety. The simulation of underwater light certainly does not stand out for its realism, while the lighting of the torch is really good, useful in the exploration of sunken ships, as are the shadows of fish and other elements of the scenarios. Everblue certainly isn't cosmetically unsightly, but it's also not a good demonstration of the potential of Sony hardware. The sound counterpart is decidedly anonymous, with acceptable effects and low-profile midi music. Comment Ultimately, Everblue is certainly not a bad title, on the contrary, it develops a very original concept in a sufficiently accurate way. However, its simulation ambitions make the game pace very slow, which probably doesn't guarantee it great appeal. Furthermore, if you are not looking for a frenetic game, it should be noted that on Ps2 the presence of notable alternatives is not lacking at all. If, on the other hand, you are really fond of underwater research, throw yourself on Everblue, which is truly the only one of its kind. You have the ball. Pros +Technically decent +It's an original idea +Good longevity Cons +Slow pace +It's a marine exploration simulation +Virtually absent the ~challenge~ factor Comment It's up to Everblue the uncomfortable task of making Playstation 2 users forget the bad work done by Arika in the development of Street Fighter EX3. Although the undertaking is unfortunately difficult, Everblue seems to have what it takes to succeed. It's time to become Leo Delphino and set off in search of the treasures hidden in the depths of the sea.", "date": "2003-01-08", "grade": null}
