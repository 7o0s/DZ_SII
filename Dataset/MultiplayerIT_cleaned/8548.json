{"name": "Manager in vecchio stile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102768-karza-football-manager-manager-in-vecchio-stile.html", "text": "That of football management is a genre now largely dominated by Football Manager, which in its two versions, home and portable, has long been the undisputed king of the market. And yet, there is someone who still misses the managers of the past, often marked by the presence of players' names generated in a totally random way and with that unmistakable retro flavor of the good old days that is still remembered with pleasure today. Karza Football Manager fits into this context, the very Italian old-fashioned football manager, already available for some time for iOS and Android: without many frills, the game puts us in the shoes of a third division coach, at the helm of a team that is now practically condemned to relegation to the fourth series, where in the following season he will have to re-found the team to bring it back to its former glory. In reality, the game begins before the last day of the championship, which practically acts as a tutorial for the mechanics of the Karza Football Manager game: simple, but at the same time profound and well adapted to the mobile platform, as we are about to see. Managerial life As we said, at the beginning of our career we were launched on the bench of a team destined to relegate to the last division, starting a re-foundation that passes through all the main management points of a football club. If a player base is already present from the previous one season, it is necessary to hire all the technical and managerial staff from scratch, with personnel who can cover the various aspects linked, for example, to the management of the youth teams (improving ~promotions~ to the first team from spring), the disciplinary side, that of training and more, for a total of nine components. Even if the team is already made up and the money available isn't very much, it may still be worth taking a look at the state of the market, perhaps selling someone to get to other players of a higher level, managing negotiations with (more hated than love) figures of prosecutors. Navigating the menus is done by pressing the buttons on the interface, thanks to which you can move in a fairly intuitive way between the sections of the game. Although Karza Football Manager's seemingly light-hearted appearance may perhaps be deceiving, it soon becomes clear that the game actually features various elements capable of giving depth, such as the possibility of modifying the movements of the players in the various cases of the position of the ball on the field game, as well as the possibility of giving indications on the style to adopt (long, short passes, and so on) and the balance between attack and defence, useful for dealing with the various moments of a match. Speaking of the match, this is presented with a single screen where the formations are flanked by a mini-rectangle depicting the field, where an animated ball effectively shows us the various actions that are carried out, complete with a written report with which the game is told in a rather good and compelling way. Missing in this respect is perhaps just a little unexpected, like an action quickly reversed: but it is a marginal defect that Karza Games could fix in the future, given the attention paid to player feedback. As usual for titles of this genre, graphics and sound are not among the main points of interest to evaluate Karza Football Manager, except as regards the interface which, as already mentioned, does its job well. The match effects are also good.", "date": "2012-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
