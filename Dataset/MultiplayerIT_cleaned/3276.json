We are essentially talking about a 2D survival horror in which Mina Park, a Sehawa high school student, is guided, who finds herself catapulted into the Coma, a kind of distorted version of our world, full of the regrets and anguish of the past transformed into evil manifestations. during what must have been a normal evening spent at school waiting for a very rare astronomical event, the so-called red moon. Alone and scared, Mina must find out how to get out of the coma, while preventing the creatures that populate it from killing her. Game mechanics In terms of game mechanics, The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters faithfully follows what was seen in the first chapter, albeit with some small changes. The world of the Coma is generally dark and to see the various interactive objects Mina must keep a magical lighter lit which never runs out. Unfortunately the light makes it more visible, with the risk of attracting the unwanted attention of the murderous creatures that roam the corridors of his school first and of the other scenarios in which he will find himself escaping later. Mina's only weapons of defense against enemies are escape, hiding places, which activate interactive events which, if failed, can lead to the girl's death, and vials of chilli pepper which can prevent certain death if she is captured. In truth, walking through the levels you also encounter fixed enemies that work like traps, such as corpses lying on the ground with prodigious claws, which are simply dodged by consuming a little stamina (recovered by drinking water). In the event that Mina is hit, she loses one or more of her energy bars, which she can restore by eating the snacks from the vending machines scattered around the maps. When, on the other hand, she is only wounded, she can use bandages so as not to lose energy. Note that the inventory has very few slots for carrying consumable items (initially only four), so the game often forces you to choose what to take and what to leave. Horror and graphics Survival mechanics aside, the gameplay of The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters looks like that of a normal adventure game, in which the player spends his time exploring long corridors and dodging enemies, trying to achieve the objectives indicated from time to time . In addition to the key mission items and consumables, there are a good amount of documents scattered around the levels that allow you to get an idea of the background of the story. Unfortunately, one of the weak points of Devespresso's game is its narrative side, which is really weak. The plot is full of clichs and in a certain way follows that of many other horror films, so much so that it is really predictable in some of its parts if you are a fan of the genre. That said, the idea of the distorted parallel world, while not original, could also be interesting, but the philosophical framework that supports it is really weak enough to be childish at times. The protagonist herself is characterized in a banal way: she is the classic insecure student who finds the strength to face her fears during the adventure. The dialogues don't help in this sense, because they don't even try to fly high, often stopping at pure captioning. After all, there isn't even much time to delve into some aspects, given that the end of the game is reached within seven hours. Instead, the more purely horror part works quite well: the fact that the stalkers can appear at any moment makes you always be on the alert and turning on the light to explore a scenario conveys a strong sense of unease, which turns into real fear and proper when you perceive the arrival of something or someone. After all, the way in which The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters builds tension is taken from the first episode, where it already worked very well, so the developers really could not go wrong. From a technical point of view, the Devespresso title is in line with the remastered version of the first episode. The visual style is that of a manga, but the quality of the drawings is mixed. There are some excellent ones, while others present awkward figures and movements, especially in the interlude sequences, so as to suggest an amateur work. The same goes for the animations in the game, some very good, some not really. Let's say that in principle we can be satisfied, given that we are talking about an indie sold for around fifteen euros, but the comparison with a title like Detentionby RedCandleGames, always indie, is quite unforgiving. It will be for Coma 3.", "date": "2020-01-30", "grade": "6.0"}
