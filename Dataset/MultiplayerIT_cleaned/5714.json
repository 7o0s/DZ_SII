Like all fashions, even crafting has seen the blossoming of many titles that often turned out to be trivial copying or material that was not up to par, released only in the hope of cheating some naive people attracted by new trends. Here, Crashland is absolutely not like that, it is a title that undoubtedly mentions the great classics but decides in total autonomy to take a different path, paved with irony, nonsense and fun. Considering that all of this is the work of just three people, it's pretty impressive. Crashlands is a fun and absurd action RPG that you can't miss! Overwhelmed by an unusual fate By untying itself from the bond that unites survival and crafting, Crashlands doesn't force us to constantly look for food and shelter, but it's more of an RPG in which to build ever more powerful objects thanks to the resources that we can obtain from the surrounding vegetation and animals. We will therefore not always have to live with anxiety, on the contrary, we are faced with a game largely focused on exploration and combat that occasionally requires us to build weapons and grin at his jokes. Humor is in fact an essential component of the game which immediately sets itself on a tone that is detached from the sad atmospheres of this genre and which represents a welcome breath of fresh air. Flux, our alter ego, is not a brave space shipwrecked in the fight against nature, he is not an emulator of Commander Shepard or a survival expert, but simply a space delivery boy who wants to deliver a package and who finds himself, despite himself, crash landing on an alien planet. In fact, the assignment does not go according to plan and on the way Flux's spaceship is attacked by an evil entity called Hewgodooko. Without everything and accompanied only by his faithful assistant, who acts as a guide and tutorial, Flux will therefore have to roll up the sleeves of his suit and build weapons, workbenches, extraction tools, armor and everything he will need to resume his pack and survive in an environment full of strange beasts who can't wait to kill him. Inside a cartoon With such an ironic tone, Crashlands certainly could not have a realistic look and in fact the artistic direction took a decidedly cartoonish direction. If we really wanted to look for a comparison, the most visually similar things could be The Binding of Isaac, but also Super Cane Magic Zero by Sio. It therefore seems to live inside a cartoon and even the ugliest and baddest monster is not that threatening, at least until it kills us, forcing us to return to our base camp, leaving all the resources we brought with us in place. Fortunately, the monsters tend to attack with a precise movement pattern, signaled by some red indicators that will almost always allow us to dodge any opponent's moves in time. If the situation becomes dangerous, we can always try to escape or eat food that gives us back some energy, as long as we know the recipe and have the ingredients. And if we were really forced to recover what remains of our mortal remains, here and there on the map there are very comfortable teleporters that allow us to magically shorten the distances on the map. Although the enemies are predictable and death is not definitive, unfortunately a defect of Crashlands is the general cumbersomeness of the controls, entirely based on the mouse and keyboard, which will prove to be not very suitable to emerge victorious from the most complex fights, in which we may have to dodge more enemies at the same time. Probably all of this was influenced by the fact that Crashlands is also available for iOS and Android and that the interface makes it much better when you can touch the screen directly. Ah, excellent news for those who want to start playing on PC but are tempted to do so while waiting for the bus: the two versions of Crashlands synchronize automatically, allowing us to continue a game started on our desk at home on the subway. Puppies and crafting Luckily we won't be entirely alone during our adventures. In fact, Flux can not only cultivate a vegetable garden full of plants with various healing effects, but also raise pets that will help him in combat and thanks to which he will be able to obtain materials for thevery rare crafting. To get a pet we will have to hope that a creature leaves an egg, steal it, create an incubator and wait for it to hatch. Technically we will be insensitive monsters who have robbed a mother of her beloved child, in practice we will have made a very good ally. Pets are in fact essential to take our game to the next level, because they will allow us to face the toughest monsters and better collection tools, which in turn will allow us to obtain rarer raw materials and so on. The Crashlands Crafting system is quite simple, much more than Terraria or Minecraft and is often based on the trivial collection of three or four ingredients found around us and basically remains the same for the duration of the game. However to make things more interesting the developers had a good thought. Certain technological advances are linked to the continuation of the story, therefore there will be a real quest that will push us to increase our knowledge and make us understand that we absolutely need a certain object to continue. Thanks to this solid link between crafting and narrative, continuing in the game and unlocking new things is totally natural and in the meantime any bonus or decorative items can be found during the collection phase, small random bonuses that make the game even more enjoyable.", "date": "2016-02-11", "grade": "8.8"}
