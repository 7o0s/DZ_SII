{"name": "Mass Effect - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mass-effect-recensione.html", "text": "Structure The structure is the classic one with the main character controlled directly and two companions in tow. The members of the active team can be chosen from five, which we have the possibility to add to our ranks during the course of the game. Presumably, at least according to a strategic logic, the choice of characters should take into account their individual abilities, but it is a good precaution to also check their possibilities of interacting with the universe around them. Also in this case it is an evolution of the gameplay to which Bioware has accustomed us since Baldur's Gate, where the characters of the group react to known places, facts and people. In this case, the presence or absence of certain characters brings about changes to the main plot and in certain situations it also changes the possibilities of varying the approach to a given problem. This, as already written, transcends the characters' abilities such as burglarizing, electronics and so on and the credibility of the result, once again, draws enormous benefit from the amount of dialogues, situations and possibilities that Bioware has concentrated in a small story whose inner complexity goes beyond the merely spatial one. Furthermore, Mass Effect has lines of dialogue after lines of dialogue (entirely dubbed in Italian), so many that a large part of the speech can be linked directly to the class and background of the character and giving the story an extraordinarily engaging credibility. Although the world of Mass Effect is concentrated within these social and narrative mechanisms, Bioware has done everything to implement a dynamic game engine that allows you to explore the planets aboard a vehicle and at the same time get off at any time and march on the lower extremities. To tell the truth, exploration in Mass Effect is more of an enrichment than a necessity and the dynamic engine has a not too exciting aesthetic result on board the vehicle. But these defects succumb to the emotion of being able to get lost on the moon or to wander on a remote planet in search of an outpost. These small elements help to forget the limits of the videogame medium and keep the atmosphere of the game alive at all times and until the end of an experience that will not be easily forgotten. RPG Real-time combat system Real-time combat. Here is the most evident and publicized novelty of Mass Effect. Unfortunately, the huge number of variables, the chaos generated by the powers and the presence of spaces designed more with RPG in mind than the shooter give rise to fights that are not exactly exciting or rather, to use a fashionable neologism, decidedly ~random~. Also in this case, fortunately, the matter improves on the final with a series of clashes that allow you to appreciate the Mass Effect battle system. On the contrary, the artificial intelligence of the opponents does not improve, on the contrary, the more intelligent they are when they speak, the more incapable they are on the battlefield. We believe that the culprit, also in this case, is the immense complexity of in-game variables applied for the first time to a real-time combat system, which however takes into account all those statistics that usually influence the turns of a canonical RPG . the chaos generated by the powers and the presence of spaces designed more thinking of the role-playing game than the shooter generate some not exactly exciting fights RPG Real-time combat system The slightly sideways and rear facing camera, the sprint and the covers are clearly inspired by Gears Of War. Unlike GOW, the skill and efficiency of weapons depend on the skills of the character, and this is a typical element of role-playing games. Another, predictable, distinctive element of the genre is the variety of increasingly powerful and differentiated weapons that become available as the game progresses and Shepard's level grows. With the character not only weapons grow but also engineering items and armor and each item, including grenades, can be modified with a wide range of upgrades that make it more effective depending on the situation. There are four categories of weapons available, and Shepard can don one of each type by quickly selecting them from a quick menu that pauses the title. The machine gun and shotgun are definitely short range weapons and need a rather high skill to become functional. The pistol, a particular choice, is the weapon par excellence at medium range. The sniper rifle, initially uncontrollable, is the weapon that gives the most satisfaction, allows virtuosity and keeps us out of the dangerous chaos generated by powers and explosives.sivi. Biotic powers, whose origin is an important piece in the historiography of Mass Effect, are selected with another quick menu and this too blocks the game, leaving us time to meditate. The classic powers of defense, block and various upgrades, not unlike those seen in Knights Of The Old Republic, are joined by powers that make use of the game's physics engine and take advantage of real-time combat. Small black holes and force pushes actively act on enemies, crates and other objects even if the variety of the latter is rather thin. Powers and skills, up to the specialization of the class that occurs naturally during the game, increase the possibilities of interaction with other characters, with our surroundings and with technological objects, including weapons, unlocking particular abilities once a certain level is reached. certain level. It all happens naturally, developing favorite skills, without branching trees or incomprehensible skills forcibly dragged from the paper universe to the digital one. Role playing game. Really. Bioware plays with identity, convincing us that our action is fundamental when it's little more than an eyebrow lift, and when we get something wrong, it's often too late. The illusion of choice in all its digital glory. After welcoming us, he puts us in the hero's shoes and, shortly after, confronts us with the impossible. Play with us making us feel infinitesimal even if in command of the most complex spaceship belonging to the most powerful fleet. Finally it makes us feel human. But humans, you'll discover, are fresh to the universe and the previous hosts aren't too happy about the intrusion. Considering Mass Effect from the point of view of the role-playing component, it is clear that the bulk of the work done by Bioware revolves around the dialogues which have 20,000 lines used impeccably. During social interactions, a list of expressible emotions appears: from two to six possible choices depending on the communication skills of the character or the situation. Once a voice is selected, it is translated by Shepard into full dialogue. Often two different choices lead Shepard to communicate the same information, but with two different tones of voice and two different facial expressions. The result is that sometimes it is the attitude rather than the information that changes the outcome of the discourse. Seemingly a small thing but one that without too much frills eliminates the need to invent slapstick or surreal answers that couldn't produce believable answers. All this forms the basis of a complex system of interactions which lead us, after a sum of actions and dialogues, to obtain differentiated reactions according to our behaviour. Reactions, both from our companions and from recurring characters, that are not simply dictated by a value that determines how good, bad or neutral we have been previously. In practical terms it is as if each active character in the game has a personalized faction system that allows him to interact credibly with his companions in relation to their sympathy and reactions and, of course, with the player himself. The characters then react both in the short and in the long run, time of course, falling in love with Shepard, hating him or simply collaborating with him. An increase in complexity almost invisible, but able to raise the credibility of iterations with a playful AI far above what has ever happened before. Obviously everything is linked to what happens in the video game but it still represents one of the most complex goals achieved by digital role-playing games. The imperfect beauty Technically, despite some sadly obvious problems, Mass Effect is a little gem from many points of view. It shows us glimpses worthy of a still distant future yet rooted in the most classic science fiction imagery. Excellent textures, vivid colors, beautifully modeled environments. The models of the protagonists, without a doubt, stand at unprecedented levels, both from an anatomical point of view and in terms of eyes, expressive range and animations. It does not skimp on light effects, shadows, blurs, explosions as well as having a respectable physics engine, although many spaces are poor in objects that can be influenced by powers or detonations. Unfortunately, among the thousand possible running animations for a human skeleton, Bioware has chosen something that could be defined as relaxed jogging and it is probably the only decidedly wrong choice of the Mass Effect project. The exploratory section does not shine aesthetically, but it is a mere addition that is not very invasive and which improves significantly as the plot progresses with aSome planets that will blow your mind. Unfortunately, in some cases the textures take a few seconds to appear on the screen and the game suffers continuous and visible slowdowns, but not so much as to affect the gaming experience. To put the matter in practical terms, using the sniper rifle we have never encountered problems in aiming and during the exploratory phases the attention often falls elsewhere, distracting from the defects. Another advantage of using an engine that loads everything on the fly, even if visibly, is the almost total absence of loads, while the necessary ones have been cleverly masked using dialogues or elevator rides. Manic care for audio. Even in Italian the lip seems perfect and all those details aimed at making the experience credible add up to this with a result that often leaves us amazed. The audio tracks pass from the alienating rhythms of the 80s cyberpunk synth and then explode into symphonies aimed at underlining the epic moments. Among other things, these are excellent quality pieces that manage to create an atmosphere of expectation and then let it explode with a discreet power. Comment Hard to judge Mass Effect. We took the right time to be able to dissect it and to understand if we are faced with a masterpiece or not. The answer is yes, it's a masterpiece, even without a top score. Especially for an RPG player and even those who like classic RPGs or dynamic adventures. In fact, Mass Effect is a bit of all this mixed and partially projected towards the future. In any case, the fabulous dialogue system, the possibility of experiencing a role and being protagonists and a series of interesting experiments make Mass Effect an absolutely recommended title for those who are really passionate about video games. Unless the technical defects and some small sacrifices do not represent obstacles capable of ruining the experience. Pros: Dialogue system Superlative setting Graphics at times stunning ... Cons: ... with problems of fluidity and lod Battle system still young Explorative sections on the vehicles a bit sparse Xbox 360 - Goals 25 points per chapter and 100 per game over. There's no shortage of points based on a set number of kills with a weapon type or power, and they're pretty easy to achieve. In addition there are a number of objectives related to particular events and bonus areas scattered throughout the game. Nothing impossible even if to get them all it is almost necessary to finish the game a couple of times. Indeed, a goal provides just that.", "date": "2008-04-14", "grade": null}
