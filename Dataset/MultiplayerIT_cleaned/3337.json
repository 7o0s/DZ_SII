{"name": "Halo: Reach", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/halo-reach-recensione.html", "text": "Halo: Reach is one of the most closely contested spin-offs in the entire Halo series. It was the last chapter developed, apparently reluctantly, by a Bungie that was already looking elsewhere. According to 343 Industries, the studio that currently has the franchise in charge, it was also the most difficult Halo to remaster, that is, the one that forced the most things to be redone from scratch. In short, although it was originally released in 2010 as an Xbox 360 exclusive, we could consider this Halo: Reach almost a new game for the purposes of reviewing the PC version, also by virtue of another detail that should not be underestimated. But let's go in order. Halo: Reach tells the story of Team Noble and their desperate defense of the planet Reach which is under full-scale attack by the Covenant. The facts told precede those of the main series and should be well known to those who have played the latter. Reach is in fact the planet of the UNSC on which the Spartans are trained and which is used as a secret base for some experiments that will prove vital in the following Halos. Here we return to the detail not to be underestimated which we were talking about above: it is in fact interesting that on PC the series was started right from here, namely that Halo: Reach is the first game included in the Halo: The Master Chief Collection released for this platform. Basically, those who have not played Halo in order of publication on Xbox 360 and those who have not purchased the little remembered PC ports of the first two chapters will be able to follow the entire story in chronological order, experiencing it differently from those who follow it from its origins . Story and gameplay Halo: Reach is a first-person shooter in which the player takes on the role of Noble Six, the sixth member of the aforementioned Noble squad, who is hired right at the climax of the battle of the Reach, at the beginning of the game. It is also the first Halo in which you play within a team and do not play a lone wolf, which at the time determined some big changes in terms of gameplay, such as the diversification of roles during the vehicle use phases , the different conception of battles, inserted in broader scenarios and less prone to individual actions, or the greater freedom of approach to them. At the time Bungie also chose to characterize the different team members in more detail, giving everyone a recognizable name and face, so as to dramatically increase the dramatic effect of some sequences, which we are not going to tell you to avoid anticipations to those who have never played it. Reach was also the chapter in which the Spartans took on a different dimension, in a certain sense more human, going beyond the Master Chief, the absolute protagonist of the first three chapters. In short, we are talking about a game that contributed significantly to expanding the imagery of the Halo franchise, much more than the other previous spin-offs, i.e. the real-time strategy Halo Wars and the first-person shooter Halo 3: ODST. This is why it is much loved by fans, who almost tend to consider it as a main Halo, so many are its facets. Remastering The value of Halo: Reach should be known to any video game enthusiast. After all, we are talking about what we can now consider a classic and which, from 2010 to today, has had plenty of time to demonstrate its undoubted value, even in the face of a certain technological obsolescence. Far more important in this context is to understand the quality of the remastering work done by 343 Industries and that of adapting to the PC platform, which as you know has different needs than consoles. Let's put it this way: we struggle to think of how they could have done better. Incidentally, we are faced with a very fluid title even on PC from a few years ago, which enjoys completely redone high-resolution textures and advanced effects not present in the original version. Of course, the impact of the sumptuous landscapes is no longer what it used to be, despite the fact that they still make an impact in some sequences. We are thinking in particular of those visible when traveling with aircraft. Even some graphic details of the settings and models make it less and completely lack the amazement effect that those who played the original felt, but it is natural that this is the case, given that we are talking about a title from another generation. Be that as it may, the PC version boasts a number of truly excellent exclusive features, such as an option for the 21:9 video format hardly seen elsewhere, even in modern games, complete with the possibility of moving the HUD at will. Mods are also natively supported, thanks to the presence of the anti-cheat system deactivation modeat startup, so as to avoid unwanted bans by trying some of them. Speaking instead of defects, it must be said that there are some limits that have not been resolved: for example it is not possible to move when lowered, which can annoy those who are used to doing it. It is a feature present in the original, so it is natural that it has been maintained, but we imagine that it may be indigestible to the less tolerant. Another characteristic kept from the original is that of the size of the arms, quite generous. In this case it's really a matter of personal taste: it didn't bother us and it didn't ruin the gaming experience in any way, but for others it may not be the case. Furthermore there is the question of difficulty: let's say that with mouse and keyboard Halo: Reach is very affordable at the first three difficulty levels. Select the fourth if you want to get the most out of it. Finally, there are some bugs that seem to be downright annoying. We wrote 'apparently' because we confess that it hasn't happened to us, but we've looked into it and it seems that some people are having difficulty with the audio adjustments of voices and weapons, with the activation of subtitles or with the anti-cheat system , which hangs on startup. These are little things that we imagine will be resolved with the first updates.", "date": "2019-12-05", "grade": "9.0"}
