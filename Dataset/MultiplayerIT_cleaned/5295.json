Of course, the new Kyoto laptop, with its touch screen, lent itself particularly well to a game in which to move forward you had to choose and click the right icons and lines of dialogue, but the very concept of a totally Japanese legal drama, with stories verging on insane and characters so thick that they're sometimes out of their wits, it would have made any location manager shake their legs. How it went is known history, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney proved to be a success capable of catalyzing the attention of a large slice of the public also in America and Europe, giving way to the localization of all the other canonical episodes as well as a series of spin -off, and although the luck of the saga seems to have dropped a bit lately - but absent Italian translations and packaged versions, as well as the total lack of the last spin-off set in the Meiji era are a bit a consequence, a bit ' cause of this disaffection - that the regular series must present itself to us in some form is now practically an obligation. Our review of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice! Another winning verdict? The death of justice Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice is the sixth episode of the saga, and undoubtedly, after fifteen years of activity and the meeting with Professor Layton who had allowed the historical team to dabble with a fresher and more varied gameplay, he brought along an important load of expectations especially in what could be the novelties brought to the field. Since the first announcements then a broader scope was confirmed, with a totally new setting and an unprecedented gameplay mechanics; one quickly realizes, however, that the basic structure has not changed one iota despite the premises being very different from the usual, and although this may leave a little bitter taste in the mouth at first, whether or not it is actually a bad we will see it only later. And the premises are these: a year after the events of Dual Destinies, Phoenix goes to the Kingdom of Khura'in where Maya Fey, another historical character of the series, is completing the path necessary to fully become a medium, what the legacy of her family requires her to be. Khura'in is a country clearly inspired by Tibet: ~far west of the far east~, stands on a very high mountain range and is governed by a monarchy closely linked to the religion of the Holy Mother, in which the role of priests and rulers confuses. A trip that should only be for pleasure soon turns, and Phoenix is soon embroiled in a murder of which his young guide, who is also an apprentice monk at the country's main temple, is accused. Defending him in court, after all it's his job, he doesn't think twice, and imagine the surprise in discovering that in Khura'in trials not only take place without a defense lawyer, even though the category seems totally despised. Defending an accused is not a crime in itself, but the defender will share his fate if convicted under a law passed over twenty years earlier; it is clear from the start that something serious has happened in Khura'in in the judicial system, and, needless to say, the plot that revolves around this core will unfold through the five episodes. Perhaps one of the reasons is that the young princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in is able to recall the victim's last memories in court: the Divination Sance is the new mechanic introduced, and sees Phoenix trying to identify the contradictions between the memories, which involve all the senses of the deceased, and the conclusions Rayfa draws from them, which would normally be considered as law by the judge. The 3D effect The feeling is that sometimes it's there just because it has to be: very well done, however it doesn't always seem to marry well with the decidedly anime direction that the series has taken, and moreover it limits a frame rate that already seems to be a lot occasionally star squeezing the now elderly Nintendo 3DS to the limit. However, it regains its decisive usefulness in the investigative phases: the backdrops to be analyzed in detail with pixel hunting shots are sometimes so overflowing with elements that being able to view them in 3D helps, and not a little, to get organized. The usual suspects At the beginning extricate yourself in the Divination Sance, between two screensi and five senses, it's a bit complicated, but we soon realize that, basically, it's not a mechanic that is so far from those to which the series has accustomed us, which are all present after all. Not only Phoenix's psychic padlocks, but also Apollo's bracelet which allows him to identify witnesses' nervous tics, or Athena's Mood Matrix which identifies discordant emotions with testimony, and even Ema Skye's forensic analysis which detects fingerprints at full blast. Oh yes, because even these historical characters are all present, even if they are not in Khura'in. In fact, half of the game takes place in the very Japanese Los Angeles of the English localization, where the other representatives of Wright's not only legal firm remained: the guest of honor is the prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi, who is also a Khura'inese monk in a sort of cultural exchange that, you understand, can be anything but casual. In short, it soon turns out that behind unprecedented premises, the sixth Ace Attorney is the classic, prudent evolution which simply consists in adding a little new meat to the fire of a tested recipe: but also the slightly disappointed attitude of those who expected more changes consistent with the development of the story fades to zero, because the winning elements are always there, starting from the plot that manages to be more and more exaggerated without ever losing credibility, the characters capable of alternating great comic moments with very intense dramas and situations bordering on horror (in this sense the new nemesis, Sahdmadhi, is a very promising character but perhaps not exploited to the fullest), and above all a gameplay, divided as usual into a trial and an investigative phase, which, always the victim of the usual problems of an all too extreme linearity that provides only one solution and only one right moment in which to unleash it, seems to have undergone a revision as regards the pace, which now seems much faster as regards the amount of game, approximately 25 hours , both in line with previous episodes, and fluidity, with several small adjustments to the aid and record system. Even graphics, sound and aesthetics in the broadest sense exhibit a continuous, subtle but visible evolution. The already excellent 3D models of Dual Destinies have more details and many more animations, the backgrounds (those of Khura'in are wonderful) have more breadth, enjoy small touches of scenic class and the ever-increasing presence of wider shots and movements that remove the sensation of being in front of a series of static screens, all aimed at giving Ace Attorney the status of a true cartoon work, a visual novel in the new sense of the term, in which direction is so important as much as the (excellent) hand of the draftsman. It is no coincidence that the infrequent anime interludes have been entrusted to the same studio that produces the television series, and it is also no coincidence that the music, between returns of well-known motifs but always interpreted in different ways, and the new songs inspired by the tradition Tibetan, are at the same excellent levels as always.", "date": "2016-09-19", "grade": "8.5"}
