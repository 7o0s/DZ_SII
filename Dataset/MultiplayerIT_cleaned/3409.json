{"name": "Manifold Garden", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/manifold-garden-la-recensione.html", "text": "The images and videos can only intrigue but it is difficult to have a precise idea of what it means to actually be inside this game if not simply experiencing it firsthand, as we try to explain in this Manifold Garden review. Escher's impossible figures and relativistic geometries have always been an important starting point for the creation of digital imaginary worlds, which have only recently begun to take shape in a convincing way also as video games, but when physical implications are added to these elements that have a logical sense, then the matter becomes even more complicated and being able to manage such deep features is the stuff of capable developers. Evidently, in William Chyr Studio they have it, considering how this game manages to fascinate with its impossible architectures but also to involve with a puzzle design that works really well. There are few meters of comparison to make it clear what it is, even if many nuclear elements of the Manifold Garden structure can easily appear derivative, having to do with switches, blocks to move and physical implications. It is clear that something from Portal always pops up in these cases, but given the architectural complexity of the level design, the excellent and somewhat obscure Antichamber also comes to mind, one of the first indie productions to address the issue of overcoming the problem in a very scientific way of certain classic limits of geometry applied to videogames, but with an eye to style. Also in this case, one thing that is particularly surprising is the coherence with which the structural solidity of the puzzles merges with the artistic cut applied to the construction of the settings, so that we will probably spend most of the time in this game looking around and contemplating the impossible wonders. A strange puzzle Beyond some simple indications on the controls (the standards for moving the gaze and moving in the 3D space, quite accurate on touch screens as good on the controller), there is absolutely nothing that tells us what to do, because we are in the midst of such a situation or simply because you progress from level to level. Although many titles share this hermetic setting, it seems that Manifold Garden has no intention of proposing some existential question, more or less hidden, but rather to push us to sink into its strange world and accept the relativity of physical laws as an almost natural thing. It is clear that there is also an artistic intent in the construction of the architectures that dominate the strange landscape, but their conformation finds justification in the mechanics of the game, which makes relativity and infinity its cornerstones. And if you please. In Manifold Garden it is impossible to get stuck irretrievably or die in some way: despite the infinite glimpses that are visible in the setting, you cannot fall and crash somewhere, or simply end up outside the expected edges. The continuous modification of the force of gravity allows free management of space and one's own position within that space, but always within the laws established by the game, which guarantees great freedom in gravitational modulation but without running into illogical situations, at least as far as possible to detect in a normal run. At the basis of the puzzle there is therefore this mechanism of modification of gravity and repetition of the same structures indefinitely: the combination of these elements leads to unprecedented solutions for elementary problems, almost abused in video games. In this context, moving a block from one point to another, pressing a key or activating a mechanism require solutions that are very different from the usual, also considering that some sensitive objects respond to specific gravitational laws, which must therefore be combined with the variable physical laws of the surrounding environment. If the deeper logic of the gameplay is very difficult to explain in words, to understand the charm arising from simply looking around in Manifold Garden, just look at some random screenshots. In this aspect lies a good half of the magnetic power of William Chyr Studio's game, which finds its driving force yes in the puzzle mechanics but also in the desire to see new absurd structures and daring perspectives in which to wander.", "date": "2019-10-26", "grade": "8.4"}
