The reason is quite clear: the characteristics of the touch screen of the iPhone/iPod Touch lend themselves quite well to hosting them. Many of them are fun, some not so much. Many are well done, others less so. What wins in the huge competition that reigns on the Apple platforms is undoubtedly the ability to have that ~something~ that knows how to captivate the player, through those strange alchemies that, when they work, give us long moments of pleasant entertainment and a special niche in our memory. Thumpies has that alchemy, without a shadow of a doubt. It is apparently a game like any other, very colorful and only apparently winking at a very young audience. Its protagonists are in fact balls of colored fur, it is true, but balls of fur with teeth. And far from splendid shining, but crooked and sharp. On the whole, those foolishness give more the idea of being ready to bite our faces than to take cuddles and be put on bows. And in fact their diet is quite sacrilegious: they usually eat those sweet, tender little creatures that the world calls butterflies, with a satisfied ~chomp~ if we are not quick to save them. In fact, Thumpies welcomes us with a very colorful and cheerful world in which furballs are not good but on the other hand they know how to make good music. Keeping us entertained, no doubt. Feel that groove! But really, what is Thumpies? It is a title with conceptually extremely simple mechanics, but equally difficult to master successfully beyond a certain level. The game basically consists in having to ~tap~ a series of drums at the right moment when the colored balls, the Thumpies, bounce on them. Each of the sixteen levels available takes place through different stages that can get close to ten, making the game long and challenging enough. Each piece of each level is divided into smaller parts which gradually compose it as they are played: in fact, at the beginning there is a meager basic rhythm which, once finished, will form the musical motif on which the rhythm of the next phase, which then in turn will enrich the base of the next phase until completing the level with the composition of the complete musical motif. Each ~stage~ of the level is passed by filling a bar which progresses by completing itself by tapping the drums at the right tempo marked by the bouncing Thumpies. Things are quite easy at the beginning, but very soon we have to realize that the level of challenge offered by the game is actually really high and that the commitment to be able to complete the proposed levels puts our rhythmic sensitivity to the test . In fact, as long as it is a question of managing a couple of Thumpies on the screen, things succeed quite simply: just use two fingers, even if strictly with two hands and this could be a problem for those used to holding their device with one hand and playing with the other one. The rhythm marked by a pallozza is in fact often completely different from that of the second pallozza and you need to be able to be fairly good at coordinating in such a way as not to get totally confused, touching the screen at random. Things get really complicated when the Thumpies on the screen increase and keeping the pace becomes a feat of great, great skill. Especially if we also take into consideration the butterflies that flutter a bit everywhere and that aren't there just for decoration, but are used to unlock new Thumpies. Even if sometimes you have to choose between performing the song or collecting butterflies if you don't want to risk dislocating your phalanges. All in easy mode, because the hard one must be really difficult. For those who have a lot of courage or are a skilled musician. The game is technically very well done, the screen response is excellent and precise and everything flows smoothly, without uncertainties and with exceptional sound. Its difficulty is never frustrating, retrying levels already faced preserves its fun allowing the game to offer a longevity rarely found in a product of its price range.
