{"name": "La guerra dei power-up", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79659-armageddon-la-guerra-dei-power-up.html", "text": "The allure of titles like Swords & Soldiers has caused the recent proliferation, especially on accessible platforms such as the App Store, of games that mix strategy and action in a linear horizontal scrolling experience. However, there are very few successful titles, since most of these fail to combine a good balance of factions with an audiovisual realization capable of withstanding the weight of a gameplay which, inevitably, remains more or less the same long all levels. Developed by Meridian, the Chinese team already author of the excellent Alive 4-ever for iPhone and iPod Touch, Armageddon tries to have its say, thanks to a good technical realization and a solid growth system of its units. The post-apocalyptic scenario in which the plot comes to life is already announced by the unimaginative title: the player is catapulted into the middle of an epic and devastating war between the nation of Magnus, made up of patriotic and heroic soldiers, and that of Licinius, technologically more advanced. Too bad that the latter are the bad guys to teach a lesson, and therefore the coolest and most visually spectacular units will not be usable by the player, who for a good part of the adventure will have to settle for old junkers and WWII-style tanks. while only later will it be possible to unlock imposing mechs and gigantic flying ships. A war without twists and turns As in the aforementioned Swords & Soldiers, the gameplay is outrageously simple for a strategic one, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work at all: in each level the player will have to use the resources accumulated over time to unleash his own units, which they will automatically move towards the enemy base; the aim is obviously to destroy it, eliminating the opposing troops who meanwhile are heading in the opposite direction to reserve the same treatment. Each encounter on the battlefield sees the strongest or most resistant group of soldiers survive, and more than once it ends up triggering stalemates that could last indefinitely if the player did not have the possibility to unlock them with the special attacks at his disposal. These range from freezing opposing troops to destroying all air units in one shot, from becoming invulnerable for a few seconds to creating, at no cost, three of your most powerful unit. Often these abilities can turn the tide of an entire battle and, unfortunately for the player, are the trump card of the seven bosses scattered throughout the game; only once an enemy commander is defeated will it be possible to obtain its special ability. Unfortunately, however, Armageddon does absolutely nothing to innovate and refresh its gameplay over the 70 levels that make up the main adventure and, once the right strategy has been found, the player will not stop using it again in every battle. The result is a linear and very repetitive experience, only partially saved by the good number of units and the excellent upgrade system. The money won in battle can be spent to make your troops more resistant and aggressive, decrease resource accumulation times or upgrade your base: level after level, the game turns into a race against the CPU to see who is more gifted , prompting repeating old battles to face the next boss with a brand new army. However, it must be said that the steep difficulty curve sometimes makes grinding a necessary option rather than a desired choice; playing the Easy level is in fact the only way to please those who don't have much patience and are looking for a not too demanding challenge, who will still be able to get the most out of the fun from the multiplayer mode via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Visually the developers have done a great job, with good illustrations of the characters, graphic effects up to par and fantastic parallax backdrops, which if they don't make the various clashes less repetitive at least manage to offer a pleasant stay on the battlefield.
