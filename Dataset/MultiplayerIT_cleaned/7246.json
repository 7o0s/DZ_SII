In practice, it is a question of bringing together two (or more) series with related characters and universes in a single product, and if on the one hand it could well be said that the use of this practice serves to cover a certain lack of ideas and propensity for risk by the big bosses of the industry, on the other hand it cannot be denied that with each announced crossover the masses are mobilized, both excited and intimidated by what could come out of the encounter/clash of often very different systems They. In the videogame field, the undisputed protagonist even if not the only one on the scene is Capcom (not surprisingly, we suggest, a house that boasts dozens and dozens of beloved franchises, but which has also often been accused of practices, let's say, a little conservative) : from the legendary clashes with SNK, the 90s rival par excellence, to the improbable crossroads with the Marvel universe up to Project X Zone, the beautiful strategic RPG for Nintendo 3DS that even brought together all its characters in a single package together with those of SEGA and Namco, the House of Osaka has never refused to collaborate with the competition for the satisfaction of the fans. Imagine, therefore, how happy the upper floors of the Big C must have been when Level-5, in the person of Akihiro Hino, CEO of the company and creator together with Jun Suzuki of the Professor Layton series, proposed to Shu Takumi, creator instead for Capcom of the Ace Attorney saga, to merge the two concepts in a single cartridge. Legend has it, or rather, Keiji Inafune narrates, that everyone in Osaka was ready to bet on Takumi's rejection, but Hino was so convincing, entrusting, among other things, the creative direction of the whole thing to Takumi himself, that at the end of 2012 Professor Layton Vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was finally a reality. At least in Japan: after a very long localization phase also in Europe we have the possibility of putting our very greedy hands on it, with the exact same mixed sensation of hype and various fears that is convenient for enthusiasts, and there are not a few, of both worlds. Is this a game for true gentlemen, or will we have to raise a whole series of objections and find numerous contradictions? You just have to keep reading. The best crossover ever made? Let's find out with our review! Welcome to the Labyrinth London, present day. During a typical English evening, with water and lightning as the masters, a car hurtles at full throttle through the streets. Inside are a man and a mysterious girl dressed in red. They are running away from something, but this something will soon reach them forcing them to a spectacular accident, but not before Sebastian Fate, this is the name of the driver, delivers a letter to the mysterious girl recommending her to read it exclusively to Hershel Layton, her old professor of archaeology. And the young woman, who was unharmed, does this: she breaks into Layton's studio while he and his young assistant, Luke Triton, are amiably discussing witches and black magic, occasionally grappling with an enigma, just so as not to lose the habit. . Having read the letter, Professor Layton and Luke decide to welcome and protect the woman, who in the meantime has revealed that her name is Luna Minstrel and that she comes from very far away. They had never done it: we don't anticipate you too much - you'll find out playing! from this book they will be sucked into Labirintia, a city that seems to come out of a volume of medieval fairy tales. While all this is happening, in the midst of the storm an international flight is about to bring to English soil a distinguished American lawyer, a certain Phoenix Wright, and his young and exuberant assistant, Maya Fey, en route to London to participate in an international exchange program of the Bar Association. The two know that they will have to take part in a trial-fiction useful for illustrating to the audience the differences between the American and European judicial systems, but what they are involved in is actually a real trial, in which they defend a mysterious blonde girl charged with no less than theft and assault. Once the case has been resolved brilliantly, as usual, Phoenix and Maya also come across the enigmatic sucking tome, which clearly sucks them up. Who is Luna Minstrel really? What is that book constantly written and rewritten by an invisible hand? And why Layton, Luke, Phoenix and Maya suddenly find themselves in aa fairytale city whose citizens both love and fear the impenetrable figure of the narrator? These are the mysteries we are asked to reveal. And you call this archaeology? In the first two chapters, of the twelve in which it is divided, which we have summarily told you above, the game is very clear: once in the gentlemen's shoes of Layton and Luke and the other in the elegant and eccentric clothes of Phoenix and Maya, anyone If you've ever played one of Professor Layton and/or Ace Attorneys you'll immediately feel comfortable. The two gameplays seem, then we'll find that it's not exactly like that, not to have changed one iota, and the first stages of the adventure act as a very soft introduction to the two different game systems. Thus, at the helm of Layton, one moves through splendid three-dimensional scenarios to be investigated pixel by pixel in the manner introduced with The Mask of Miracles. Once a sensitive area is reached, signaled by the color change of the cursor, the player can go deeper, sometimes even zooming in to get a better view of a specific detail, and thus initiate either a simple comment from the Professor and Luke, or a an important explanation, or, the heart of the game, to a puzzle. There are, as always, some optional puzzles, which can be abandoned at any time or even not undertaken at all without this affecting the continuation, and mandatory ones, usually proposed by some secondary character, and no novelty seems to have been introduced in the conception of the various puzzles. At least it will be like this until about halfway through the game when, from the collaboration with Wright, the Professor will discover that another can easily be enclosed in an enigma. The various types of puzzles present are also not innovative, from the most logical to the most analytical puzzles, from labyrinths to visual puzzles, there is almost nothing that has not been seen in the two trilogies on Nintendo 3DS and its predecessor; fortunately, the average quality of each minigame has also remained the same. Of course, given the variety, it depends a lot on taste: some players will hate the ones others will love, but for the duration of the story we cannot say that we have come across an ugly or poorly made puzzle. Perhaps in someone a little too easy, but it is a topic that we will address later. Both the Helper Coins are also back, but this time they are easier to find, and the Picarats. The Help Coins are scattered throughout the scenarios and serve exactly what they seem, that is to unlock aids, four possible for each puzzle with the first three costing one coin and the last, decisive one, which requires two. The Picarati, on the other hand, are the reward for each solution: each puzzle has a specific value in Picarati based on its difficulty, and you go down by five for each wrong answer. The devil's advocate The first process that we will face has nothing different from the canonical ones of the Ace Attorney series, and will illustrate the basic system to all those who do not yet know it. In practice, various witnesses will alternate with their statements, all generally aimed at confirming the guilt of Wright's client. At this point, the lawyer can either press the witness, in order to try to obtain a more precise statement, or, at the right moment, present evidence among those present in the Trial Register, which clearly contradicts what has just been said in the courtroom. It is in these cases, for the uninitiated, that Wright shouts his famous ~Objection!~ and points his famous index finger. However, each Ace Attorney introduces a particular gameplay twist, and this singular crossover is no less. In fact, in Labirintia, where Wright too will be involved in a series of processes of which we do not want to anticipate anything, the laws of the modern world do not apply (however, who knows why, the curious characteristic according to which it is the accused who must demonstrate to be innocent and not the other way around), nor can one make use of the modern discoveries of forensic science such as the study of fingerprints or vocal analysis; it seems that even the particular powers that Wright and Maya showed off in the previous titles don't work, but on the other hand there is the custom of calling two or more characters to testify at the same time. In the procedural part, unlike the puzzle part, in short, a big novelty is immediately visible, which could easily become part of the regular series: while a witness speaks, in fact, another could react in a particular way, and if the player if he realizes it and exploits this thing to his advantage, he can obtain vital information for the smooth running of the process. To us thisto concept somewhat recalled those ~investigative~ puzzles by Professor Layton, also present here, in which on the basis of various statements one has to find out who is lying or to reconstruct a specific episode, and we seem to be able to speak in this case at least of a influence of one gameplay on the other. Another intervention, in this sense, is that of the Help Coins which can assist you in interrogations, and the Picarati which are obtained at the end of each trial, based on the credibility you have maintained with the judge. The opposite case, which we briefly mentioned in the previous paragraph, is also interesting but strangely very little exploited, appearing only in the middle of the game and a few times thereafter. In every way, Takumi's hand can be seen in the trials: the cases are very intricate and very exciting, but more logical and fluid than on other occasions, almost completely missing those junctures in which, despite having grasped the contradiction, you cannot figure out what evidence to present and/or in response to what statement. The 3D effect Like the rest, made with great care: it gives a very pleasant depth to the already wonderful scenarios, detaches the characters from the rest for a nice pop-up effect (try moving the console slightly sideways while playing ...) and it even proves useful to the gameplay in a few puzzles. Set a little upwards, but in these cases just adjust the lever and you're done. Crossroads between worlds It therefore seems that, apart from those small touches described, the two types of gameplay remain substantially separate from each other. However, the destinies of the two groups of characters are not like this: gentlemen and lawyers soon meet in Labirintia and, contrary to what can be inferred from the title, they begin a very close collaboration that revolves around the figure of Luna Minstrel. We will also see Phoenix Wright solving puzzles and Hershel Layton pointing the finger in court, in a story that is more daring than the gameplay; exciting and coherent, fairy-tale and mysterious as in all Laytons, eccentric and with absolutely remarkable bits of drama as in all Ace Attorneys, the story convinces and involves as never before and represents the point of main attraction of the whole package. The secondary characters are a bit disappointing, especially in terms of charisma, especially when seen from the perspective of Phoenix Wright fans for whom they have always been a formidable attraction, see the various district attorneys. But how is this story told? First of all, with an aesthetic that brings together the best of both worlds: Layton and Luke, with their unchanged characteristic traits, always stand out quite clearly from the rest, which instead seems to veer more, at least as far as the other protagonists are concerned, on the manga style of the lawyer series, but the designers have succeeded in not making the two sagas seem completely unrelated, also thanks to the setting which sometimes lends itself to ~Laytonian~ and sometimes ~Wrightian~ interpretations. What about the animated scenes, often very long, produced by the same studio that took care of those of Dual Destinies? Real cartoons that wouldn't look out of place on TV at all. Excellently dubbed in Italian, moreover: the quality of the in-game dubbing seems to drop a bit, which is understandable given the dubbing methods of the games, but its value remains, and then, you want to listen to Phoenix and Maya in Italian, which of such treatment they had never enjoyed? And the graphics, which ultimately limit themselves to recycling the assets of Professor Layton's two Nintendo 3DS games, especially as regards the completely three-dimensional scenarios, but which as regards Ace Attorney is actually the first polygonal realization, this being game released in Japan prior to Dual Destinies, and is ultimately excellent, with splendid scenarios and very detailed and perfectly animated characters, having to report only the sporadic drops in frame rate during very crowded scenes. To finish with the music, absolutely amazing, in which the mark of the Level-5 game is recognized more than that of the Capcom one, but even here, listening to the classic theme of Ace Attorney declined with profusion of strings will give the shivers to any fan that you respect. We would spend hours, you will understand, talking to you about the very high production values, as well as the fan service lavished with both hands (don't forget, when you play, to take a look at the judge), but this review has already reached a considerable length so let's cut it short by indulging in a reflection: the two fanbases have several things in common, and often a player who", "date": "2014-03-19", "grade": "9.2"}
