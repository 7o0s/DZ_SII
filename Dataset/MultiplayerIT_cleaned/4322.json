It thus happens that among the folds of the mobile offer (and not only), intended above all for that wide range of users that can still be defined as ~casual~, gameplay solutions can emerge that have been codified into real genres of which maybe many don't even know it exists. Honestly, this is a bit what happened to us with Parker & Lane: Criminal Justice and its particular genre, i.e. the Time Management Game, which apparently is now well established between mobile platforms but also PC and which has a sort of institution in the publisher Gamehouse. The most representative Time Management game, by the same label, is probably Delicious, which in fact is mentioned more than any other in the evaluation comparisons for Parker & Lane, which is essentially a sort of investigative edition clone of the previous game on the management of a pastry shop. In this case, however, we find ourselves controlling Inspector Parker grappling with various more or less complex cases, assisted by the grumpy (and somewhat misogynistic, it must be said) lawyer Lane. This introduces a whole series of forensic-themed variations on the classic Time Management mechanics, as well as marking a sort of plot that is also quite constructed, unlike what normally happens with similar games, favoring the continuation through levels that otherwise tend to look alike a little bit of all, one with the other. Unfortunately, the hyper-casual setting is mainly reflected in the aesthetics and in the construction of story and characters, so don't expect interesting dialogues or a plot with notable twists, even if everything flows away in a rather facetious way. Investigations and assembly lines The game mechanics are practically the same as Delicious and the like, but for those unfamiliar with the previous ones, the first impact can be rather daunting. It is a question of carrying out various simple actions trying to manage time in the most logical way possible, disposing of the actions to be performed on the screen until their conclusion. In the case of Parker & Lane, in each level we are faced with a crime scene, with a long series of forensic agents who gradually crowd the environment, forcing us to direct them to the various places of interest to which they are linked and providing them with the various tools they need, trying to make them carry out the investigations with the greatest precision and in the shortest possible time. Each character has a series of hearts on his head that disappear as the seconds pass, so it is essential to try to make them wait as little as possible in the queue by maintaining a constant flow of agents and providing them with the required tools as quickly as possible, often having to combine them various items in the inventory or collecting them around the level, in order to free up the various areas for investigation by the following agents. Parker & Lane also offers some mini-games, linked to standard procedures in collecting evidence, really elementary but still able to introduce short diversions into the action which is otherwise rather monotonous by its very nature. On the other hand, more than variety, this is a game that relies entirely on the ability to organize actions in a logical and efficient way based on the very short time available and despite the apparent initial simplicity it soon turns out to be a considerable challenge. especially if there is a need to complete levels with two or more rating stars. In such a game, the uncertainties of the interface can represent a defect of great proportions, and unfortunately there is sometimes a certain lumber in the response to touches, at least on the device used for the test (Samsung Galaxy S8). Finally, we specify that Parker & Lane: Criminal Justice is a free-to-play game with advertising that can be eliminated by paying the not exactly negligible sum of 9.90 euros to unlock it completely.", "date": "2018-03-30", "grade": "6.8"}
