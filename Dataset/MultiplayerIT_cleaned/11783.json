{"name": "Viva Piata - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viva-pinata-recensione_a.html", "text": "Neighbor's Piatas are always more beautiful We were talking about gardens, and it is precisely with a handkerchief of land to be reclaimed that the season of ~sweet breeding~ opens. From here on you will feel like an executive called to restore a lemon grove in Alaska. Indeed, left to their fate, the Piatas get sick, fight and after a while they leave. To attract them and make them stay you will have to satisfy their eccentric whims. These bastards have a snobbish nose. Some species argue with each other, and then go on with the construction of the fence, while others, for example, only eat certain vegetables. The best thing is to outsource a few tasks to your helpers, deities who also run shops useful for selling Piates, buying tools and garden furniture. Yes it's true, Viva Piata resembles a hippy community, but La Bohme must have stopped a few fences earlier, because even here money buys happiness. In fact, you will end up selling and buying new species, seeds to plant but above all decorative elements. With the progress of the game and experience points you will also be able to open sparkling bodies of water in the ground and sow GMO crops. Bear in mind that the village shops sell all sorts of goodies, from specialty confections to exotic flora. As nice and funny as it is, in the long run it's still tired. Having to take into account whether a Piata eats fruit or other critters and refurbishing our Eden with colored lamps for the night is satisfying, but lacks real long-term incentives. It's a precarious job. maximum respect for the idea of Rare, which is widely diversified from a management point of view, also supported by a gameplay that is only apparently naive Neighbor's Piatas are always more beautiful Sixty breeds are not a few of course, and the evil ones add a little spice to the day, but once you understand the underlying mechanism, the maximum sacrifice will be having to sell docile mini-ponies to make room for the new genetic oddities that Rare has in Serbian for us. Ultimately it all depends on how you decide to approach this adventure. If you really want to put your mind to bigger lands and an ecosystem to present to Piero Angela, then you could find yourself lovingly following the personal diary of each and every Piata all night long. Otherwise, you still don't have to give up because a carefree and disengaged approach repays you, if nothing else, with lots of healthy relaxation. It is also a pity that the mini-game of pairing between Piates is an absolute banality where you limit yourself to following a path without bumping into the flaming bowler hats placed at the edges. Luckily the love dance that follows among the critters makes up for the lost time somewhat. Maximum respect for Rare's idea, mind you, which is widely diversified from a management point of view, also supported by a seemingly naive gameplay. However, all of this ends moderately soon, because the title plays its best cards too soon and within a few intense sessions it shows that the surprises tend to dissipate. Too bad, one could think of the cross between different Piatas or the breeding of evil species, perhaps locked up in protected areas, while as it is they can only be made tame. The lack of forward-looking objectives therefore ends up trapping the player in a delightful and suave routine, we grant it, but in the long run poor in bite. Also good in the oven Rare's graphics team must have been drinking Bach flowers for a month. It is otherwise inexplicable how they managed to draw animals so sweet as to inspire cuddles and protection even if you are returning from a F.E.A.R. session. Ok we admit it, a few times we hit them with the shovel, but it was just to teach them that we can be owners at times severe (to make you understand the level of involvement you can get after uninterrupted hours hoeing virtual mud). Certainly the game owes a lot to the brilliant presentation of every single detail, and in particular to the hilarious animations. The developers' eagerness for perfection has gone so far as to recreate the interior of each individual home, so that you can scrutinize what happens between the four walls. No malice though, this title is innocent and sweetly childish. Viva Piata is a sui generis management software, a visionary, a style killer Also good in the oven Comment Rare deserves a round of applause for the crazy gimmick. It may seem exhausted and it probably is, but cultivating an always pleasant and colorful garden, where raising peevish and demanding Piatas couldn't be more fun. The micro-management is deeply structured and at the same time the free approach opens theand doors to the little ones. It takes courage to focus on gameplay without easy shortcuts, and the result can be appreciated from the first moments of the game. Viva Piata is a sui generis management software, a visionary, a style killer. It's just a pity that you play your best in the first ten hours, then chasing the same mechanisms, which may well be many, but still remain the same. With a few more surprises and a less superficial multiplayer mode it would have been an absolute center. Even so, an hour spent with Piates is an hour well spent. Pros Lots of things to do Gameplay that delves deep Boasts a strong artistic component Whatever your approach, you will enjoy Cons Lots of things to do repeat endlessly The routine of the game leads to monotony The absence of multiplayer shortens the longevity PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: 1.8 GHz RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce 5900 or Radeon 9600 Disk Space: 10 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor 2.40 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GTS with 320MB of memory Viva Pinata is available for PC, Xbox 360 and will be available for Nintendo DS. The tested version is the PC version. During the first hours of the game we believed that Viva Piata was a wacky title for children. Exquisitely designed, but still for children. On the other hand, you start with a tutorial bordering on pedantic and then find yourself baptizing earthworms. Ok, they're cute and colorful, but they're still fishing worms. In reality, Viva Piata is a management simulator that develops from a micro-management point of view, in short, an ambivalent product. It undoubtedly aims at two types of users, but fails to fully satisfy them. If you haven't turned 6 yet, you could indeed get lost in the progress of the crazy breeding, but if you are already the older brothers or sisters, then you risk running out of curiosity too quickly as the game progresses. In any case, your role will be the same, that of a sort of divine hand with a green thumb, obsessed with tending to increasingly complex gardens and raising improbable creatures within them, called Piatas. Although there are external difficulties, such as money thieves and naughty pets, this game ultimately remains an intriguing diversion to play peacefully, without anxiety and aware that no one will attack us with a fleet of cruisers after a few minutes.", "date": "2007-11-29", "grade": null}
