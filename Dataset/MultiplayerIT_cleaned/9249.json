After all, the ~trick~ seems to work: it's all about enticing players to try the product, letting them get passionate about its basic mechanics (without taking away anything or almost from the main components), then pushing them to carry out micro-transactions or other types of payments with which to obtain bonuses of various kinds. The latest MMO that went free-to-play is Global Agenda, a title developed by Hi-Rez Studios and which entered the market more than a year ago in the classic subscription formula. Renamed Global Agenda: Free Agent, the game has recently been converted to the free formula, which we are going to talk about in this article. Before doing so, a clarification: the writer has had the opportunity to try very little the original Global Agenda, so in this review we will focus on what it has become with the free-to-play breakthrough, rather than on the comparison with the version published a year ago. Spy and let spy For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the world of Global Agenda, let's start from the setting, defined by the developers themselves as spy-fi: classic Sci-Fi in fact meets spy fiction, giving rise to a hybrid with secret agents operating on a background with sci-fi tints. We are in the twenty-second century, an organization called the Commonwealth dominates the Earth thanks to the massive use of technology, with which it controls the billion inhabitants left on the planet, grappling with the problem of livable places which have drastically reduced over time. Against the backdrop of this struggle for survival, a handful of people challenge the power of the Commonwealth, to ensure that the world returns to calm and people are guaranteed a lifestyle more compatible with their nature. The player starts from an action scene, in which the liberation of the newly created character from the clutches of the government organization is told, halfway between an introduction and a game tutorial, in order to take him to the city of Dome City, a where all the main Global Agenda social activities take place. Taking a small step back, even before the tutorial there is the character creation phase, in which we are asked to choose between the four classes present: Assault, Recon, Medic and Robotics. The first corresponds to the classic tank, while the Recon class is the one with skills in both ranged and close-range surprise attacks, also thanks to the possibility of becoming invisible. The Medic you can well imagine what he deals with, while the Robotics is a support class, able to create defensive fortifications and to use various gadgets also for the attack. Obviously, together with the class, the appearance of our virtual alter-ego must also be chosen: the character editor fully does its job, letting us decide the amount of physical characteristics that by now we all expect from such a title. A busy agenda The developers' approach to the character advancement system is purely role-playing: collection of experience and placement of skill points through the proven tree system, with three different ramifications linked to the chosen class. Strengthened by such a traditional system behind it, the management of skills in Global Agenda: Free Agent works very well, allowing the player to be able to change his style of play by preferring one skill rather than another and offering a good level of balance between the various classes. As per the script, the title developed by Hi-Rez offers a line of quests which, however, ends soon enough, letting the player savor the tactical shooter nature of Global Agenda, predominant with respect to the role-playing component: there is the possibility of dedicating to PvP, fighting against the other Agencies even in large-scale battles, or to engage in combat against NPCs, always in groups; all naturally through special ~instances~. The various modes offered certainly give ample scope to the possibilities of the player, who at least initially finds himself able to explore various situations: going unbalanced in the choice between PvP and PvE, we can say that the fans of the first type will certainly appreciate the solutions offered by Global Agenda , given that the human component adds that pinch of variability that PvE lacks. It's all about finding a valid group with which to have fun, a real discriminant capable of determining how much a persona can continue playing this game after the initial stage. Free, but how much? Since so far we have talked about freemium and micro-transactions without specifying what Hi-Rez has implemented for the launch of Global Agenda: Free Agent, the time has come to also look at the payment system studied by the developers: alongside subscribers classics and new Elites, there are Free Agents, i.e. all those who download Global Agenda and start playing without paying. From this starting point it is possible to access practically all the most important elements of the game, with some limitations such as the impossibility of using auctions and founding a guild. The ~payers~ are also awarded a double experience bonus, with which to advance faster through the levels of the game. It is also possible to have access to items and gadgets that are not available to Free Agents, or in some cases difficult to find for those who only have access to free content. Hi-Rez also provides the possibility of accessing special bonuses for a certain period of time (the so-called Booster), which can offer further advantages to the characters. It is obviously up to the player to decide if and how to invest some real money in Global Agenda, above all on the basis of the approach he intends to adopt: those who just want to spend some time trying something new will certainly be satisfied with being a Free Agent, while those who if you want to waste a little time getting straight to the gist of the endgame, you'll probably like to spend a few Euros to speed up the growth process of your character. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view, Global Agenda stands more or less on the average of its kind, doing its duty without pointing out excellences or gaps such as to be able to move the balance of the scales. The Sci-Fi nature setting offers some interesting glimpses, generally demonstrating a valid commitment in the design phase by Hi-Rez, the result of those who are obviously a fan of the genre. The Unreal Engine 3 does its job fully, even if here and there in the surrounding environment it is possible to glimpse a level of textures that is not always constant; good job instead on the construction of the characters, both in terms of their detail and for the animations. The audio perfectly follows the line of the graphics sector, offering a fairly normal dubbing in the original language, good sound effects and a series of motifs that make up a soundtrack capable of properly supporting the various game situations.", "date": "2011-06-01", "grade": "6.5"}
