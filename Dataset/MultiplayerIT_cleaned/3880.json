{"name": "Borderlands 2 VR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/borderlands-2-vr-recensione.html", "text": "Borderlands 2 was originally released for Xbox 360, PC and PlayStation 3 in September 2012, gathering unanimous acclaim including that of the review of Multiplayer.it by our Simone Tagliaferri. We are talking about more than six years ago, a real geological era in the video game field, a period in which virtual reality in the living room was little more than a mirage and which therefore not even the most daring of diviners could have prophesied as a possible landing place for a title conversion. Precisely this apparent incompatibility between the Gearbox title and a system like PlayStation VR is the basis of the inevitable aura of skepticism that has accompanied Borderlands 2 VR since its announcement: a sentiment that has even sharpened when it was announced that the game would have lost its fundamental cooperative component and would have been sold at a price that was anything but budget. So here we are asking ourselves a fundamental question: does it make sense to buy a six-year-old game today for 49.99 Euros, without that multiplayer mode that made it so lucky, without the content added at the time via DLC just to be able to play it in virtual reality? Pandora's viewer Short answer: no. In the next few lines we will try to better argue the reason for this laconic verdict, making the necessary premise that the writer has spent dozens of hours in the company of the previous Borderlands chapters, playing them all in a cooperative from the first to the last minute. And here the donkey already falls, because the possibility of experiencing the campaign in the company of up to three friends was the secret of the success of the Gearbox series, which in single player loses almost all of its appeal: needless to say that a version like Borderlands 2 VR without this real vital organ is a lame horse from the start, which would not have stood the comparison with the original even by offering an incredibly immersive virtual reality experience. Which, among other things, did not happen: although the commitment on the part of the developers can be glimpsed in trying to adapt the world of Pandora to the Sony viewer, Borderlands 2 VR gives the user a feeling that can only be define unsatisfactory. The visual system is indeed the one that suffers the least the effects of the transition, also thanks to a cel shading graphics that already at the time were not astounding in terms of definition and complexity: on PlayStation VR the game runs absolutely fluidly, and you can observe the scenario 360 degrees undoubtedly has its impact, but there are some problems such as the rendering of the sniper sights (a sad and jerky on-screen box that shows the zoomed image) and the menu windows that often end up ~stuck~ with the elements of the setting being unreadable. On the gameplay front, several small changes made to make the Borderlands 2 VR experience more tolerable are immediately evident: the enemies are less aggressive, the skill trees of the four classes have been revised and there is a new power called PROT (acronym for Slowdown and Temporal Optimization Platform) that can be activated with a key that allows you to slow down time for a short period. Necessary and welcome filings which however do not solve the basic problem, namely that playing Borderlands 2 alone was repetitive and boring six years ago and even more so today. Power is nothing without controls With a frankly incomprehensible choice, Gearbox has decided not to support the Aim Controller with Borderlands 2 VR, leaving the user the option of playing via Dual Shock or using the Move controllers: an option, the latter, which we found so uncomfortable as to be almost impracticable. The possibility of aiming the weapon by pointing the controller directly at the screen does not in any way compensate for the tragic cumbersomeness of having to move without analog sticks, with a teleportation system and the rapid rotation of the view entrusted to two keys that go very badly with the frenetic shooting of the game. The good old Dual Shock therefore remains the only viable option, and in this way Borderlands 2 VR plays basically like the original, with the most obvious exception represented by the on-screen viewfinder managed by head movements instead of the right stick: a solution that seems a bit stopgap but that does its duty, without however returning the same effectiveness of a traditional control scheme. Still speaking of comfort, credit should instead be given to the developers for having provided a wide range of customization offered by a special menu that allows you to activate or deactivate the jump (possibly replaced by the teleport), adjust the running speedand manage camera rotation and the amount of tunneling. Even trimming the experience around your tolerance threshold with virtual reality as much as possible, Borderlands 2 VR still remains a very heavy title to digest especially in those prolonged sessions that should be the norm for a game of this kind: yet another idiosyncrasy of a conversion that just doesn't make much sense.", "date": "2018-12-26", "grade": "5.0"}
