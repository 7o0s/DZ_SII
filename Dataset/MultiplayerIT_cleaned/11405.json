{"name": "Bobby Carrot 5: Level Up!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bobby-carrot-5-level-up.html", "text": "Among the numerous merits of mobile gaming there is certainly the push towards the creation of innovative products, designed specifically for use with mobile phones. Puzzle games are a genre that lends itself very well to innovation, even if nowadays it is really difficult to invent something new that can stand up to the undisputed classics. With the Bobby Carrot series, whose first episode dates back to 2006, FDG Mobile has proposed a puzzle game decidedly oriented towards puzzles, in which a nice rabbit simply has to eat all the carrots present in each stage. The problem is that the various sections of the level cannot be reached normally, or they allow us to reach them only once... in short, you literally have to solve each picture, finding the right sequence of movements to avoid game over. With the release of this forty-level additional pack, the Bobby Carrot series ideally finds a sequel beyond the fifth episode, even if it must be said that the various releases have all been characterized by the introduction of innovative elements, especially at a technical level, who have been able to differentiate the products. Just think of the way the developers have managed to refine the game mechanics over the years, adding more and more depth to the gameplay. The things to do, however, are always the same: you have to eat all the carrots present in a stage in order to move on to the next. In this Level Up! this translates into facing four different locations (Fairytale Forest, Magic Beans, Downhill Slide and Long Hard Haul), each consisting of ten levels that are unlocked in sequence. Each of them represents a far from simple puzzle to face, and very often the only solution to complete it is through numerous trials and errors. There are the usual items to consider: switches for walls and ramps, hang gliders, seeds to grow plants instantly, and so on. Each should only be used at the right time, or you'll end up unable to make any moves and have to start the level over. Finally, the control system is always the same: with the joystick the character moves in the four main directions, while the 5 key is used only to switch to scrolling the stage, so you can observe everything before making any move. The graphics of the game are very nice, characterized by an excellent design regarding the sprites, which are also well animated. Bobby is very likeable, and it's enough to leave him still for a while for him to clap his paws bored, while the locations are full of elements and, above all, distinguished by an excellent use of colours. It must also be said that each setting is very different from the other, and the level remains consistently high. The most surprising thing, however, is the music: truly beautiful, equipped with an independently adjustable volume, they accompany the action as best as possible, so much so that it is hard to give up. Strange to say such a thing for a mobile game, given that usually the sound is the thing that developers work least on... PRO Very nice and well designed graphics Beautiful music Gameplay ever... AGAINST ...which you may or may not like Really challenging, right from the start An all too special product", "date": "2008-05-22", "grade": "S.V."}
