{"name": "Manhunt 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/manhunt-2-recensione.html", "text": "The project While the first Manhunt portrayed a sort of big, extreme, sadistic and very violent reality show, thus bringing a considerable charge of social criticism, this sequel shifts its focus to a completely different setting, returning to more exquisitely narrative canons but without give up the taste for provocation and some reflections on society. We are in a psychiatric hospital, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, in which the therapy adopted would not be viewed favorably by the more progressive psychiatrists: at the Dixmor doctors and nurses carry out all sorts of violence and abuse, physical and psychological, on patients now reduced to the most extremes of madness, until one night a blackout causes all the cells to open, with consequent escape, and atrocious revenge, of the prisoners. You are, at the beginning, in the role of Daniel Lamb, a ~crazy~ at first sight rather common and insignificant, lost in the face of all the chaos caused by the blackout. It is Leo Kasper, the co-star of the game that you later take control of, who mentors you, pushing you to break out and pointing out the most sadistic and violent ways to kill your enemies with whatever you can find. This is the premise for a story, albeit not very original, fascinating and engaging, above all for its ability to gradually reveal itself in the eyes of the player; and the plot is by far the strongest point of this Manhunt 2, together with the setting and the characterization of the characters who are deliberately extreme, sadistic, perverse, filthy and desperate. However, all of this never assumes the contours of gratuitous provocation and violence, put there just to cause a scandal: vice versa, it is entirely organic to a design of a game certainly for adults, but by no means superficial, and this, nowadays, is a great value. Plot and setting are therefore to be framed: unfortunately, however, the merits seem to stop almost entirely here Bloody Gear Solid Manhunt 2 is a stealth game, and as in all self-respecting stealth games your aim is to go from point A to point B of the level (here in a completely linear way) avoiding enemies, attacking them from behind and, in in case you get caught, hitting your hands, whatever they contain. To avoid opponents you have to be careful to stay in the dark and not make noise: here comes the first difference compared to the first Manhunt, in which there was always that feeling of precariousness due to intelligent enemies and carefully studied level design that doesn't always make you feel put them in a position to find suitable shelters or to be able to quietly avoid making noise. In the sequel, on the other hand, the levels are linear, as already mentioned, and also rather banal: you will always have a dark space nearby, a refuge in which even those who were chasing you, perhaps equipped with torches, will often magically no longer see you and will return in no time at all in a state of scant attention, allowing you to catch your breath and calmly plan another assault. In short, there is no longer the ~manhunt~ of the title, which thus loses much of its tense appeal. Plot and setting are therefore to be framed: unfortunately, however, the merits seem to stop almost entirely here Bloody Gear Solid Once you get behind the unwitting enemy, the main feature that was of the first and that returns in the second episode takes place: the executions. By pushing A you can decide, depending on how long you hold down the button, whether to perform a fast, medium or long and devastating, but always very brutal one. The problem is that, once again for the censorship, when these executions are performed which in theory would be worthy of the best Saw, the image is enveloped by so many and such filters that practically only the audio will remain to make you imagine various fractures: it's not that in the editorial office we are all bloodthirsty psychopaths who have no other goal in life than to see blood, but explicit and disturbing violence was one of the characteristics that made Manhunt unique, the fact that the sequel has a a little lost makes it even more banal and normal. The control system of the performances via Wiimote then, although it makes the experience more intriguingly realistic, it is not perfect, and sometimes it does not read the movements well, forcing you to interrupt a performance in the middle: the result however does not change, given that already after a single blow the opponent is stone dead, and the rest is just to rage. In addition to the predecessor there are the so-called environmental executions, that is, made by exploiting particular characteristics of the level such as a wall or a difference in height between you and the opponent. Nice and nice, ma totally scripted and therefore not at all manageable at will by the player. If then, as among other things it can happen not through your fault but simply because the game sometimes doesn't tell you that you have to press A, the opponent notices you, in a one-on-one you could even do it, but in the minority l he only thing to do is run to the nearest dark spot, because you have no hope. This until, later in the game, you don't recover the firearms: at this point you can also avoid hiding, pistols and shotguns are so powerful that the title practically turns into a third person shooter with a few very stupid enemies. And here too the control system shows its side: in melee there would be different types of moves depending on the direction you give the Wiimote, but you always end up giving those two or three types of punch, whatever the gesture made with the remote control in hand. Hey brother, do you have a filter? Painful and positive notes from the technical sector. Grieving regarding the graphics: at first glance it seems like a very well done and pleasing to the eye game, clean, defined... But soon you realize that it's all thanks to a specific graphic filter, applied to what it is, in everything it is for everything, the PS2 version of the game, which certainly didn't shine on the Sony console either: few polygons, and above all muddy and very dirty textures make Rockstar's work of little value compared to other products of the same software house. It's the same engine as GTA and it shows, only that while in the sandbox games paradigm what was surprising was the incredible extension of the map, here the levels are small, closed and linear and all the engine defects stand out in an embarrassing way . In defense it can be said that, since it is actually a first generation game for Wii, the fact of being a direct conversion from PS2 is more understandable, the fact remains that, having by now seen things like Mario Galaxy and The Conduit, we all know what the Wii can really do and we no longer settle for mediocre, disguised PS2 titles. At least the fluidity is almost flawless It's the same engine as GTA and it shows Hey brother, do you have a filter? On the sound level, however, the care is there, and you can feel it: one can almost never speak of real melodies as far as the music is concerned, but this is only a good thing as the atmosphere is made even better by heavy sounds, deep and full of tension. But the real highlight of Manhunt 2's sound are the effects: terribly realistic those of the various bloodsheds, effective the ~environmental~ ones of the levels which, even when they shouldn't be (such as the normal nocturnal noises of a city sleeping) are disturbing and uncomfortable. Let alone when we talk about the noises of an insane asylum in revolt! The performances of the voice actors are also good. Finally, the longevity, average (low) of the genre: 15 levels that are not long at all and a very permissive save system. The two levels of difficulty and above all the multiple endings should push you to replay once everything is completed, but while the plot could certainly push you to finish the game, you will hardly want to re-face an experience so flat and banal from the point of gameplay view only for a new ending. A troubled birth Nine months, exactly like a birth. Rockstar's effort to be able to publish his work in America and Europe took a long time: and if in America things went in a questionable but understandable way (the game had received an Adult Only rating that Nintendo and Sony did not feel like accepting , forcing Rockstar to censorship which brought the classification to M), in Europe the debate was paradoxical, since the English rating body has also banned the publication of the censored version. The manufacturer appealed and won, and finally we can judge the game for what it is, a game. The discussions and controversies, which have also involved characters of the caliber of the notorious Jack Thompson and our former minister Gentiloni, however leave the sign of a distrust towards the videogame medium that lasts to die, and frankly quite laughable due to the ignorance and carelessness with which it is carried out. Vote In short, Manhunt 2 ultimately disappoints. Plot and atmosphere are rendered with great effectiveness, thanks to an intriguing and skilful script in ~playing with the player~ and to the high quality sound sector, but on the other hand a mediocre graphics and above all a trivial level design, a poor AI , a gaming experience that is not at all tasty, even if almost never even annoying, they bury what could have been a greatthe title. For once the issue of violence, as it should always be between adults and vaccinated people, takes a back seat: we should talk, for example, of executions ~ruined~ by censorship, but when the game is basically so insignificant, that would it make sense? Pros Plot and atmosphere very well rendered Sound compartment of great value Cons Graphically mediocre Game experience banal, already seen and insipid", "date": "2008-11-11", "grade": null}
