{"name": "Porcospino salterino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110210-sonic-jump-porcospino-salterino.html", "text": "From Doodle Jump onwards, there has been a continuous proliferation of jumping games on the App Store (and Google Play), i.e. those titles in which you have to make the character jump from one platform to another, with the stage developing vertically, trying to reach the greatest possible height. A few months ago we reviewed Mega Jump, in our opinion one of the best exponents of the genre (free), which has the merit of having introduced an important element of progression in the gameplay, dividing the experience into various levels rather than in a ~one-off game ~ in which the scenario changes randomly, increasing the degree of difficulty as we go up. Distinct levels, therefore, with paths embellished from time to time by the use of spectacular jetpacks that propelled us up for hundreds of meters, also assuming a strategic value. Sonic Jump, we are pleased to note, does this and more. The SEGA production, which marks the return of the famous speedster porcupine on iOS and Android devices, takes up the spirit of the homonymous title for Java-compatible mobile phones, released in 2008, but adds to the original mix a series of new features, including a system of traditional tilt control and a certain number of bonuses that we can buy by spending the ~rings~ collected during the game. The bonuses in question allow us to complete the stages in a simpler way, perhaps counting on an extra life rather than a magnet that attracts valuables, and in the more advanced stages, taking advantage of it will become a highly recommended practice. Hopping happily Sonic Jump offers two different modes: Story and Arcade. The first is currently made up of three zones (Green Hill, Mountain and Jungle), each with eleven levels plus a boss fight against the usual Doctor Robotnik, but new stages will be added via update. The second modality instead arises as the traditional ~survival~ type jumping game, in which we are therefore challenged to reach the greatest possible height with a single attempt. Both offer lasting entertainment, especially the Story, in which the key elements of the gameplay find an accurate location, in this case the change of scenarios as we proceed, with the appearance of new traps and opponents. Sonic Jump's control system mixes tradition and novelty, with the accelerometer that manages the lateral movements of the character during the jump (automatic) and the touch screen that activates the double jump, a fundamental maneuver to reach the platforms when the distances become wider. However, it is a double-edged sword, because the rules of the genre to which it belongs also apply in the title developed by Hardlight: if you fall, it's game over. And therefore performing a double jump can sometimes mean moving the scenario up just enough to no longer see the foothold we were counting on for the next ~bounce~. To this must be added the possibility of eliminating enemies only during the ascent phase of the jump, therefore while Sonic rotates on itself, and the increasingly numerous presence of traps that recall the classic episodes of the SEGA series, forcing us to calculate the times of the our movements and to carefully manage the trajectories. The connotation of the experience is made even more pleasant by the fact that the levels are not created randomly, but have a precise design behind them, the peculiarities of which must be memorized when we encounter difficulties and we have to make repeated attempts. The picture is completed by a pleasant graphics regarding characters and enemies, while the backgrounds leave much to be desired.", "date": "2012-10-29", "grade": "8.0"}
