Following the studio's bankruptcy in late 2018, only the last season of The Walking Dead was released under the new label. Gearbox's IP-based adventure is emblematic of both the team's talent and its recklessness, unable to see the mistake of acquiring license after license without having the right certainty of returning a substantial profit. the review of Tales from the Borderlands for Switch talks about a game that is still considered by many today as one of the best (if not the best) of the titles developed by the Californian team. These days it arrives on Nintendo Switch extremely late, but going to fill an important gap regarding TellTale on the flagship of the Japanese house. Needless to go around too much: Tales from the Borderlands is still the pearl it was five or six years ago, generating no small amount of sadness for the deplorable end of the studio that made it. Tales from Pandora Tales from the Borderlands: the two protagonists are ready for the adventure The general skepticism towards Tales from the Borderlands was legitimate, we cannot hide it. On the other hand, starting from the base of the crazy Gearbox looter shooter, all based on a crazy plot and billions of bullets, seemed at first glance impossible to reconcile with a milder and totally narrative adventure. Probably this same skepticism was also preparatory to surprise and positive impact, but there is no doubt that the story of the two protagonists, Rhys (Troy Baker) and Fiona (Laura Bailey) - a decidedly inflated but damned close-knit couple - has managed to hit the mark. You will continue to laugh, as you have always done in the Borderlands universe, but without losing empathy, indeed reaching unexplored peaks for TellTale itself. Tales from the Borderlands: The Borderlands universe is always fascinating Between a smile and a madness, the five episodes that make up Tales from the Borderlands will lead you to meet a myriad of characters, to forge strong bonds and really feel great empathy. The variety of characters is so wide as to not leave anyone's tastes aside and the choices, precisely because they are lived in a particularly light-hearted environment, will manage to be even more impactful. It is the power of contrast, well understood at the time by the guys at TellTale and exploited in the right way. In the total fifteen hours of adventure, get ready to laugh and cry almost in unison, forever losing companions and acquiring new ones. All to discover a different Pandora from the one you have known, made up of relationships and a particular humanity. A powerful and unsettling mix, which made Tales from the Borderlands great and still makes it great today. Tales from the Borderlands on Switch Tales from the Borderlands: Rhys will have to deal with really difficult situations To tell the truth there is not much to add on the Nintendo Switch version of TellTale's masterpiece. Thanks to the cel shading style and the fact that we now have an interesting generation behind us, the time we spent again in the company of the opera has also convinced us from a technical point of view. However, we want to be clear on this aspect: Tales from the Borderlands is not the last season of The Walking Dead. At the time of the review of the latter we have repeated on several occasions that it was a clear change in the setting and a step forward in the gameplay. The work set on Pandora is instead anchored to the stylistic features of the past, relegated to that hybrid tending to old-fashioned graphic adventure that leaves little to interactivity. Despite this, appreciable or not based on what kind of player you are, Tales from the Borderlands is still strong in style, dubbing and an amazing soundtrack, capable of amplifying the experience to the nth degree and which is truly a joy for the eyes to see running on the Nintendo Switch screen. Especially in mobility, the porting is successful, even net of a few small hiccups between one scene change and another, a problem that has always afflicted Telltale's works.", "date": "2021-03-30", "grade": "8.5"}
