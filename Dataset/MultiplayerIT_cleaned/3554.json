{"name": "Mutant Year Zero: Seed of Evil", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mutant-year-zero-seed-of-evil-recensione.html", "text": "Mutant Year Zero: Seed of Evil expands the post-apocalyptic world of the title developed by The Bearded Ladies and published by Funcom, freshly arrived on Switch and in physical edition, granting the possibility to explore a new area and face a new mutant threat to all those who appreciated the original, a strategic one on the one hand similar to the legendary XCOM and on the other profoundly different, thanks to a real-time stealth dynamic that enhances the strategic component. On the other hand, this impoverishes the weight of the tactical component and is a factor that has divided critics and the public, partly delighted by the peculiar approach and partly disappointed by the imperfect balance. However, it is a title capable of standing out with its concentration of atmosphere, well-chosen dialogues, psionics and mutant anthropomorphic animals which now also include a moose, an unpublished character introduced with Seed of Evil. A new threat with ancient roots The expansion of Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, which can be started with high-level pre-packaged characters in case you don't have previous saves, does not introduce new mechanics or obvious refinements, contenting itself with offering us a new narrative arc that starts from the ending of the original to take a new path, albeit always linked to the mutant theme. Having discovered the shocking truth about their genesis, the protagonist duo (an anthropomorphic duck and boar) set out on the trail of the elder of the Ark, once the ruler of the last remnant of civilization left in the area. Having been missing for two months, the one who was once the employer of the two, both stalkers engaged in searching for relics and materials to run the colony perched on an oil station, has been driven away by a new threat that has to do with mysterious plant-based mutants. From here starts a path that leads us to face a new disturbing threat, an army led by an ancient creature that awaits us in its cave for the final battle. For the rest, the recipe is the same with a team of three characters, effective dialogues, covers, armor with special properties, ancient and futuristic weapons, levels to accumulate, skills that also allow you to move vertically, useful team perks that can be activated by finding certain rare resources and exploration of the map, limited but functional to mechanics that at first glance are closer to those of UFO than those of other titles inspired by the legendary strategic Microprose. Playing, however, it becomes evident how they are different thanks to the movement in real time combined with a stealth dynamic which, synergistic with the use of silenced weapons, allows you to eliminate enemies one by one by alerting the least number of companions thanks to the interface that shows us the attention area of each unit with a large red circle, wider if we are in stealth mode and smaller if we proceed with the torches off. In this way the experience becomes more strategic than tactical, with the latter component becoming much easier, even in this expansion which for most of its duration is completely faithful to the main title. But this approach is not mandatory and there is no shortage of difficulty levels to spice up the experience, with the extreme one providing only automatic saving and a chance. An expansion faithful to the original, perhaps even too much Although the new narrative arc represents the only important novelty of Seed of Evil, some collateral additions are not lacking, starting with some upgrades that enhance the skills allowing us to spend accumulated points in abundance. The changes are not radical and the skills of the new hero, although reshuffled in a different configuration from that of the other characters, are always the same, but they still affect the gameplay, leading us to experiment in combination with the new pieces of equipment that can be obtained by following the instructions of the new elder who sends us to some areas already crossed in the main game but again populated by the same enemies we have already faced in the past. In fact, to find unpublished ones it is necessary to explore the new game area that expands towards the west, adding to the main map a series of areas full of roots and enemies who can use the skills of the main characters even if they do not shine for intelligence. However, they can count on a whole new resource with infested areas full of vegetable pods that are blind but hear very well and, once alerted, give birth to a new enemy every three turns. Among other things, with each new birth, the unit generated is more and more powerful and although once the cycle is completed, the podstrugga, adding enemies can create big problems in a title where mortality is quite high, even on normal difficulty. All this is clearly functional to push the player to take advantage of stealth dynamics, but it can turn into an additional challenge for those who prefer turn-based action, undoubtedly challenging when there are many enemies or when we are faced with wave-based combat. Among other things, an approach of this type significantly increases longevity, otherwise limited in normal mode to about 5 or 6 hours seasoned with a handful of interlude scenes, intriguing despite being based on drawings, but limited in number and duration. Furthermore, some glitches and bugs of the original remain to annoy while the new areas, except for the last one, bring very little new to the world of Mutant Year Zero which with Seed of Evil expands much less than we would have hoped. Instead, we are faced with the classic more of the same, intended to satisfy, at least in part, those who appreciated the original, disappointing those who expected important refinements or significant novelties from the gameplay point of view.", "date": "2019-08-11", "grade": "7.0"}
