After all, it's impossible not to do it when you have more than fifty years on your shoulders. There is a lot to recover or rediscover, so many developers try the way of recovering some cult title to try to propose something new in a market full of stale masterpieces, so to speak, as done by the development studio Monte Gallo, who looked to the 90s for his first work. Forza Octopus review will clarify whether in this case we are faced with a successful recovery or not. Check Octopus The Octopus Strength levels are very nice Forza Polpo is described very well by its scenario. We find ourselves in a post-apocalyptic world where everything appears frozen in time and forgotten by human beings. We are in a Japan stuck in the 90s, whose places are literally fragmented, as if they were parts of memory drifting in space and time. After playing for a few hours we couldn't help but think that more than a story, that of the developer Monte Gallo is almost a poetic statement, so much is the game careful to take up some Jumping Flash mechanics! cult title released on the first PlayStation, as if to recover a gameplay that has been frozen for decades, reissues aside. So here too we are faced with a strange mixture between first person shooter and platformer in which in the role of a small robotic octopus, the Octopus of the title, we have to find hidden cubes in sixteen levels, to get to defeat Dr. Promethus and his army of robots. At the beginning, controlling Octopus seems quite complicated, between heavy movements, the management of the triple jump, which to be executed perfectly must be paced in the right way, and some systems that are not exactly intuitive, such as that of changing weapons and energy. In the first level there are blackboards that roughly explain all the main movements, but some concepts remain a bit obscure until you have had some practice. Fortunately, it doesn't take much to realize that the initial complications are only apparent and that, in reality, the problem more than anything else is that we are no longer used to getting out of certain patterns... or even just to the possibility that there is a world outside of them. For the mere purpose of comparison we went to see some videos of Jumping Flash! We had played it a long time ago and relying on memory alone is not really the case after so many years. Looking at them we actually verified the many similarities with the Monte Gallo title, similarities that somehow pleased us because they are a sign that there is life outside the rhetoric of the lords of the market. Enemies are the weakest part of the game What made us even more pleased is that Forza Polpo works overall and that, having a few meters of comparison, it turns out to be a refreshing experience in its own way. Entry into the game is a little slow, considering it's an action game, but soon you find yourself performing evolutions that were previously thought impossible, jumping on very high platforms, fighting with enemies while staying in the air and taking advantage of the unique features of levels, which add a lot to a profoundly modern experience, despite its declared look to the past. The graphic style itself, admittedly anime, seems designed to make each level a kind of imaginary slideshow of a world that no longer exists. Conceptually the operation has succeeded really well. Sure, the levels aren't gigantic (only the final ones are bigger than the others), but they do what they have to, presenting themselves as mazes of floating objects in which you have to find your way to reach the cubes, even overcoming seemingly impossible passages , but which are always linked to different elements of the scenario to be deciphered, so much so that, especially in advanced levels, the puzzle component assumes considerable importance in the game economy. Forza Octopus emulates Jumping Flash, but with original touches On the other hand, Octopus's energy management is very present, which consumes energy for jumping, floating and shooting like a Steam Deck used to play triple A. Around the levels there are energy cells which, when collected, accumulate in the octopus reserve. It is the player who must use them when he is low on energy. In the first levels there are many of them, often in plain sight, while in the advanced levels there are fewer of them and they are often hidden. In this way, the experimentation of the game systems is encouraged, with also a lot of waste in terms of energy consumed, preparing the player for a more careful managementof Octopus as he progresses in the adventure. Be that as it may, Monte Gallo has also included a specific mode for those who don't want to worry about energy, the Arcade mode, much more direct than the main one, but also a little more superficial. Energy management is key The enemies of them are the weakest part. Basically they are very stylized robots, which all follow more or less the same attack patterns and which can be shot down using the machine gun supplied with Octopus. There are also bigger enemies, which must be dealt with in a different way (for example using more powerful missiles), but in general, shooting does not produce feedback and interesting situations, also considering the not very high variety of opponents. Mind you that the enemies are not unpleasant, just insignificant. They're a distraction, necessary for the energy management talk, but nonetheless unfocused. Overall, however, Forza Octopus is an experience that is worth having, especially if you are looking for gameplay that has some original ideas.", "date": "2023-06-07", "grade": "8.0"}
