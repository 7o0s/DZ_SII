{"name": "Sunless Sea", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145485-sunless-sea-capitano-mio-capitano.html", "text": "The reasons can be many: we have sacrificed our crew to a sea god in ecstatic rapture, our fuel resources are running out and we are keeping the ship going by burning stores, terror has consumed the faces of our sailors , or we have news as frightening as it is interesting that the admiral would pay fine echo just to know them. It doesn't matter, sooner or later we too, like all the captains who preceded us, men or women, poets or assassins, open the map of the sea explored up to that moment and point our finger at Fallen London, which always means the same thing: it's time to go home. If you've played Sunless Sea, you too know that feeling of relief and nostalgia that comes when the ship lands in the safe waters of our beloved capital. No other port takes the terror out of the hearts of our men, and business is excellent. Of course, thanks to the memories of those who preceded us (read also: of all the captains we played and who died without remedy) we have discovered many other good cities where you can earn a lot of echoes, where fuel is sold at an excellent price and you can count on a hot meal, if you have fresh news to spend in return. But no landing place excites us like that of Fallen London. However, what the capital has in common with every other place in the game is the need to leave something with every transaction. They can be echo, the game's trading currency, or small illustrated postcards. Some of these represent an artifact, others the knowledge of an island, still others are illegal goods to be hidden in the hold. If we have what it takes, even an already visited port can reserve new surprises, sometimes horrific, sometimes hilarious. No transaction is safe, but without exchanging something you can't navigate. And the call of the dark sea takes little to be heard. We must start again, at any cost. We know it and our crew knows it, made up of bizarre women and men, in some cases anthropomorphic and lunatic, but without whom we would be lost, even if if necessary we could eat one. This is because Sunless Sea is the monomaniacal obsession of the duty captain, who cannot rest until he has satiated his ambition. Or he didn't sink in staring into the center of a Maelstrom with a mad gleam in his eye. The thirst for adventure, courageous and desperate, is the coal that keeps the ship of the Sunless Sea moving In dire straits There are two very distinct moments in Sunless Sea, that of navigation, and that of adventure on dry land. The first puts us directly at the controls of our ship. We can decide the cruising speed, fight against sea monsters or pirate ships, or simply maneuver boldly to avoid dangers and reach a safe port. The sailing experience that Sunless Sea offers is one of a kind. You spend long minutes at sea desperately looking for a port to land at. After many games, and it is one of the greatest satisfactions that the game offers, we memorize the location of the main landing places, gradually becoming skilled navigators, of those who drink in silence in port taverns shaking their heads in front of the bravado of the most young people who have not yet experienced the cold of the north and already think they know the sea. One game after another, we thus learn which mistakes would be fatal and which islands must be visited at critical moments. Indeed, sailing represents a constant danger, and our crew becomes more and more frightened the more time we spend away from the shore, even worse if we turn off the lights to prevent any creatures from seeing us. Then there is the food indicator and the fuel indicator. If the supplies run out, the stomach will begin to find even human flesh appetizing (mind you, much worse happens in this game) and without fuel it's the end of us. Once, almost dry, an acquaintance of ours offered us help and a new boat. He had the face of a scoundrel, yet we accepted. So we found ourselves on board a single-seater ship that could not take on even another crew member and with a hold the size of a studio apartment in the center of Milan. Sure, if we'd had pockets full of echoes we could have bought a bigger one when we got to the first port that traded vessels, but then maybe we wouldn't have been in that situation. How did it end? We've made our way to the northern edge of the map. Try it when you're desperate, at least you'll die knowing what's at the end of the universe. So you see that traveling forces you to make many decisionscrucial. Have we already told you about the possibility of overloading the engine? Sometimes it saves lives, other times it blows everything up. But it's okay to experiment. Now let's see instead the other aspect of the game, the one that is put in writing, and which is accessed once you get off the ship. When we thought we'd seen them all... Wherever there is a port, there are stories waiting for us. The developers are continuing to add them even as we write, and will continue for a long time to come, being able to take advantage of all the material created for the prototype of Sunless Sea, a free browser game, still available, which happens to be called Fallen London. These stories are the real treasure of the game. The amount of written text is staggering, achieving levels of style and accuracy usually found only in good literature. The events are told to us through brief descriptions, sometimes lines of dialogue. They are fragments that can illuminate a scene with just a few words, make us imagine a bizarre character or a terrible action, or move us for a remnant of humanity in a sea of ghosts that mingle among charlatans, inventors and captains of submarine empires. Sometimes we have to pay a price to access these stories, and the outcome is always uncertain. It could all come down to a lucky cargo for our ship or a razor slash to the throat. Sometimes we put the second mate back, in other cases we discovered we had a son. Love affairs may come and go in the Sunless Sea, but something always stays, and passes on to the next captain, in the form of a cash inheritance, or a close relative. The stories are often accompanied by a drawing, although the text is the real protagonist. Words chosen with great lucidity ignite the imagination, and the ~z~ instead of the ~s~ in terms of maritime language helps to give an original voice to the narrative of Sunless Sea. As we mentioned in the first paragraph, from these pages of text we leave with objects or anecdotes kept below deck, in the form of figurines. So imagine having playing cards to spend to access new events or to exchange for goods or money. Sometimes the requests are so precise that it becomes almost a burden to remember where to find the right news to collect or what the customs of a certain people are. Accumulating many days at sea helps in this task, but the need to take some notes with real pen and paper could discourage many players. Yet, even in the frustration sometimes felt when the amount of detail seems overwhelming, the power of atmosphere wins over the desire to drop everything. Poe, Dickens, Melville, Lovecraft: they are all at work in the world of Sunless Sea, and the masterful music awakens memories of the hours spent in the company of their pages. When we are alone at sea and the ticking of the typewriter that fills the ship's log is heard, discovering that our comfort depends on those little notes gives us an idea of how much the developers have managed to achieve simply with tiny tiring letters from light. It takes guts, and much more If you have followed us up to here, you will have understood that Sunless Sea has conquered us. It's not a game for everyone, but that's certainly not a fault. In any case, it is good to say that it requires a lot of patience, because it is a very slow game compared to our parameters today. This isn't due to a lack on the part of the developers; it is the very nature of the game that requires it. Going to sea is exciting business, but restless spirits may find it unnerving, especially since it is many games before we are smart enough to afford to buy a decent ship. The game invites you to take risks, certainly, but you are so easily hit a dead end, with no more money to buy supplies, that any gamble beyond the central part of the map is unlikely to bring good results. We must therefore arm ourselves with good will, struggle with the menus, many and convoluted like a bureaucratic apparatus, and learn to manage even the longest crossings. The texts are a delight but require calm and attention, and an extra effort for non-English speakers. However, many elements have been improved compared to the Early Access version. For example, the fights are now in real time: a necessary choice to break the rhythm of the readings, and the difficulty has been properly balanced. More still we are sure will evolve over time, but the setting of the game is the one we have described to you and you have to decide whether or not you are ready to facethe adventure. We hope this has not discouraged you. We only say this to put you in the right frame of mind, so that you can start off in the best possible way. If you feel even an itch of curiosity about Sunless Sea, jump in without fear. It's a one-of-a-kind gaming experience, at least in our age, and it leaves a lasting echo in memories.", "date": "2015-02-23", "grade": "8.8"}
