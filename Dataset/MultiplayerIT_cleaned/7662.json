Only the more elderly will grasp this touch of class, which however definitely put us in a good mood when we decided to deal with the mobile reduction of one of the franchises that made the history of RPGs on PC. Without particular haste, for a precise reason: the first versions of the game published on the App Store suffered from a large number of technical problems, which manifested themselves in particular on non-latest generation devices and resulted in very evident drops in the frame rate, as well as lag and bugs of various kinds during multiplayer sessions, with companions disappearing and games abruptly interrupted. We knew releasing a few updates would fix things for the most part and they did, so let's focus on what's in front of us. Lady British, Queen of Britain in place of her late father, desperately needs heroes to free her kingdom from the onslaught of evil forces. In Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar we are precisely one of these heroes, and we initially have the possibility of selecting the warrior class or the mage class for the character, fundamentally distinguished by the type of attack (close-up or ~ranged~) and for physical characteristics. However, we are given the opportunity, in full Ultima style, to ~discover~ what our alter ego corresponds to by answering some questions aimed at defining our inclination to value, courage, compassion and so on. Once the creation process is over, it's off to the adventure... Are you looking for adventure? In Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar there is plenty of it A touch of fury We didn't expect a faithful translation of the mechanics that made the Ultima episodes on PC famous, it is clear, and in fact Quest for the Avatar, while clearly quoting the work of Richard Garriot in some situations, presents itself as a different experience , simplified, designed for a touch control system that couldn't be more basic: touch a point on the scenario to move in that direction, touch an enemy to attack him automatically. Any evasive manoeuvres, which also turn out to be necessary after a few hours of play, must be carried out simply by moving the character and trying to memorize the attack pattern of the opponent on duty. However, it is fun to play the game together with other people, whether they are friends or complete strangers, thanks to a truly immediate system that allows us to create a party at the entrance of each dungeon to explore it together and thus share risks and booties. Then there are those aspects of the Electronic Arts production that actually stand out and reveal its true potential, i.e. a large number of quests, even fairly articulated, and a world full of adventures just waiting to be grasped, traveling on the world map from one place to another in the traditional way or by moving rapidly at the expense of a few bronze keys. And so we come to analyze the freemium elements of Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar, which bases a large part of its appeal on looting but which allows us to open the chests with three different types of keys: gold, silver or the already mentioned bronze keys. The more valuable the keys are, the better the loot will be, which means that those who want to find weapons and armor of a certain quality rather than low-value items are pushed to buy packages of golden keys. Can you avoid spending? Yes, in the usual way: proceeding with patience and perhaps preparing to repeat some missions. At least things don't work like they did in Dungeon Hunter 4, i.e. the challenge rating doesn't increase exponentially as you level up, which allows you to enjoy the progress you've made rather than cursing its uselessness after a few minutes. What is certain is that on the technical front there isn't much to rejoice about: the technical problems have been almost completely resolved, but the graphics are still not up to the Gameloft title, not even remotely, and even the controls have edges that are difficult to digest by some point on.", "date": "2013-08-19", "grade": "7.2"}
