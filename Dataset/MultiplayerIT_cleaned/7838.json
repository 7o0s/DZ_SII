Many have tried, but the problems are known: in the first place, a universally effective solution has not yet been found for having a touch control system that is both precise and immediate; secondly there are the limits of the infrastructure called upon to manage the traffic generated by a mass of online matches which can reach frightening numbers. In short, the concept is precise and terribly fascinating on paper, but so far it has not materialized. To make a further attempt in this sense could only be Gameloft, one of the most committed companies on the mobile front, which brought Blitz Brigade to the App Store and Google Play, an FPS oriented precisely to multiplayer but also equipped with a substantial single player component , with as many as one hundred and twenty training missions that can prepare for any situation before starting matchmaking and jumping into the fray. To tell the truth, the first weeks of the game's life weren't all rosy, on the contrary: the questionable inclusion of a system of ~tokens~ to play a game, hand-in-hand with the freemium nature of the production, literally cut the legs to experience and many users abandoned the ship as soon as they realized what a devil Gameloft had developed to force them to put their hands on their wallets. Yes, because tokens had to be purchased with real money. Luckily there has been a very rapid come to senses (dictated, in all probability, by the collapse of downloads) and the current presence of IAPs in the game appears relatively limited, with some extra advantages for those who spend (for example immediate respawn, or the possibility of immediately unlocking new classes, or the instantaneous upgrade of weapons) but, in the end, nothing that cannot be achieved even with a little healthy practice. Cartoon fire We were just talking about the age-old question of touch controls with regard to the genre of first person shooters. Well, Blitz Brigade adopts a solution that proves to be fairly good right from the start, with a virtual double stick for character and view movement, as well as a separate fire button which, once pressed, can in turn be ~moved~ to aim and shoot simultaneously. Nothing new under the sun, but the implementation of a semi-automatic lock-on makes this configuration effective and allows you to move with relative ease within the scenarios, engage in furious firefights and perhaps escape because our energy bar (which does not reset automatically) is minimized. To these commands are added the one for changing the equipped weapon, for jumping and for running, which is nothing more than a sort of second left stick for rapid movement: excellent intuition. It is even possible to activate the gyroscope to manage the view in this way, but it didn't drive us crazy. So we come to the core of the offer, namely the online multiplayer. You can access your Gameloft Live account or use your Facebook credentials, but the lack of automation in this sense makes the procedure a little too slow and cumbersome. Once the matchmaking has started, you can choose whether to look for a quick match with random rules or select the deathmatch or domination modes, the only two currently available, which provide respectively for a maximum of eight and twelve players on three possible maps: Fort of Malta, Madagascar and Madagascar Ruins. There are also two immediately accessible classes, Soldier and Machine Gunner, while the others (Sniper, Medic and Guerrilla) must be unlocked by leveling up (or by spending diamonds, if we have any). The action turns out to be fun and carefree, as it was reasonable to expect, although at the moment spoiled by the lack of variety and dependent on the quality of the connections and servers that these days do not shine for efficiency. On the other hand, the technical sector is impeccable: the graphics are fluid, colorful, designed with an excellent cartoon style that certainly recalls Team Fortress 2. With Blitz Brigade Gameloft almost hits the sensational target", "date": "2013-05-14", "grade": "7.0"}
