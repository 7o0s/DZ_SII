Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, with the explosion of the indie scene which also on consoles has led to an invasion of games that are commonly considered ~artistic~, or in any case hybrid solutions and various narrative experiences that have become fewer and fewer alternatives, in the sense of their position with respect to the normality of the videogame landscape. This is because in the meantime the panorama in question has undergone important changes in the reference system, thanks to the wave of independent productions. And yet, although we are certainly more accustomed now to original and even bizarre approaches in terms of narration and interface, Machinarium maintains its original charm intact, thanks above all to the extraordinary talent of Amanita Design. On the other hand, Samorost was probably one of the first experimental graphic adventures to have global success, with what could be defined as an emergent narrative and a gameplay entirely based on mystery and on attempts to understand how the scenario can react to interactions; on the need to enter a mentality that has a lot to do with logic but very little with commonplace. In the same way, Machinarium undermines the classic structure of the graphic adventure by eliminating any type of explicit narration and building the entire puzzle design on hermetic references, symbologies, logical mechanisms and a lot of humour, without however ever falling into the absurd. Beyond how enjoyable it is as a graphic adventure, Machinarium therefore also has a specific importance in having proposed its own artistic interpretation of the genre that also manages to be functional in terms of game, that is, fun. That's not cheap for a video game. The story of a robot Machinarium is to all intents and purposes a classic graphic adventure, of those in point and click style, but its peculiarity lies in the absence of spoken or written text, in the need to understand, simply by observing, what it is necessary to do to solve the puzzles scattered among the fascinating hand-painted screens that make up the fabulous world of the little robot Josef. Thrown as rubbish in a landfill, from here the little automaton will find himself the protagonist of a real epic that will lead him to redeem himself against a series of bullies who have made his life particularly difficult and perhaps even save the whole mechanical world from a possible threat, relying on ingenuity and its specific ability to stretch and shrink as needed, as well as the ability to carry various objects by simply stuffing them into your mouth. All this is not explicitly explained, but illustrated with hilarious comic skits that act as a flashback to the story of the protagonist or simply deduced from what happens on the screen, because there are no dialogues in this mechanical world, just as there are no written words. Clearly, the need to understand everything through drawings and schemes is part of the challenge, but just like in a perfect mechanism everything falls within a certain logic, so it is true that there is often some trial and error but it is also clear how the solution of the different puzzles is never random, beyond the cases in which the objects to interact with are not immediately clear and evident within the richness that characterizes the scenarios. The interface is extremely simple, with the cursor that allows you to move, interact with the elements of the scenario in a contextual way and the ability to combine inventory objects by simply dragging them one on top of the other. The Nintendo Switch version supports both the control system of the console versions, with the movable cursor through the right analog stick and an action button, and the touch screen interface of the mobile versions, particularly functional even if more suitable for large screens of tablets. Perfect mechanism It's not really the story that makes us continue in the world of Machinarium, even if the path of redemption of the little protagonist is certainly a clich that always manages to catch on, especially when the character in question is so charismatic despite its extreme simplicity. The secret of the game lies rather in the composite whole given by the atmosphere, by the irony and tenderness that pervades it and by the excellent construction of the puzzles which, using the absence of text and the mechanical setting in a creative and intelligent way, propose challenging but also stimulating, original without going too faron the abstruse. There is a remarkable sense of proportion in Machinarium, which is reflected in the coherence of his overall vision, derived from a truly high-profile artistic direction. The fact that Amanita Design is a team that emerged more from the artistic and graphic sphere, starting from illustration and animation to arrive at the video game, has determined a positive effect that was glimpsed in the first Samorost but is clearly evident in Machinarium: the having trained outside this environment has led the team to have a different approach from the standard, remaining outside the typical superstructures of videogame development. What appears is a video game that has little of the typical in terms of storytelling and puzzle design, at least seen with the look it could have in the year it came out. The passing of time and the advance of the indie new wave has eroded the disruptive force of this title, which is now necessarily associated with several other atypical graphic adventures, which emerged between the PC and mobile fields. Obviously this does not detract from the original value of Machinarium, but by making an assessment contextualized to the historical period, this difference compared to the original launch emerges quite clearly.", "date": "2018-11-07", "grade": "8.7"}
