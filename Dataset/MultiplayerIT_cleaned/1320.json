{"name": "Conan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conan-2.html", "text": "~...you screw up, imoo..!!!~ Conan, returning from one of his battles, will find the village completely destroyed by the Picts, a wild population of the west, which, from now on, our hero will pursue with all his strength, coming across mysterious labyrinths and hostile territories, in the which will get acquainted with the most cruel and terrible creatures of the world of Hyborea. The beginning of the game is promising and encourages identification with the character, the primitive and bloodthirsty barbarian, actually a man forged by fatigue and battles, who would just like to find peace by finally taking revenge for everything that has been taken away from him. At first glance, the graphics appear discreet, even if seen up close, our energetic man does not boast high-level textures; even the somatic features do not do justice to the cinematic Conan with which, however, the videogame counterpart shares the empty expression, a peculiar characteristic of many interpretations of the legendary Schwartzie. For the rest, we are faced with decidedly evocative landscapes, which, although qualitatively not exceptional, are enriched by discreet environmental effects (above all the snowstorm on the peaks of Cimmeria and the lighting effects of the torches inside the dungeons). With these assumptions, Conan's journey begins, a journey that will take him through various scenarios fighting with wild men, wolves, monsters and spirits with magical powers that the barbarian avenger will have to face with the help of swords, axes, maces and other types of weapons that gradually enrich his arsenal. Getting into the game... Conan is essentially an action game focused on combat and exploration of environments, the latter aspect purely for the purpose of finding health potions, weapons and other objects such as life crystals. In fact, in the game, saves can only be made if you have the magic stones useful for this purpose, a bit like what happened in Tomb raider 3, for those who have played it. These gems can be used at will, for example before facing a particularly challenging fight, or before a series of traps and pitfalls. Without a doubt one of the most interesting aspects is represented by the trials of Crom: if you are killed during a battle, you are not obliged to suffer the frustration of starting over from the last save, but we will be given a second chance. We wake up in the arena of the god Crom, which will allow us to face another test, usually a fight with one or more warriors, which once passed will give us the opportunity to resume the game exactly from where we were killed; failing the test, however, you start again from the last save. The fight The real focus of the Cauldron title is undoubtedly the combat. It is no coincidence that the entire multiplayer section of Conan is focused on this element. In online mode you can compete in arenas inspired by game scenarios, in three different modes: death match, time challenge and body count. These arenas will also be available in offline mode with the same types of combat, but in any case, we will be able to choose different warriors, with consequent diversification of the fighting style, after which we will be able to set foot in the arena to start the massacre. In Death Match mode, needless to say, we will be called upon to challenge up to seven opponents simultaneously, while in Time Challenge mode we will have to try to kill a predetermined number of enemies in the shortest possible time or otherwise try the wildest Body count challenge, in which you will have to try to kill as many enemies as possible in the shortest time. The animations of our hero represent one of the strengths of the game, the clashes with enemies are structured like those of a classic scrolling fighting game with a significant amount of executable moves, about fifty, which vary depending on the weapon in hand. The attack combos are decidedly spectacular, while the possibility of parrying or dodging the blows of enemies is too limited. In this regard, it must be said that the choice to balance the parameters of strength and speed of execution in a different way, based on the weapon in use, should also be reflected in a different approach to battle, to be applied based on the type of enemy. This possibility, however, is not even touched upon by the gameplay of Conan, which is shallow and with a series of further problems that seriously affect playability. It is, in fact, on the front of the controls that the biggest problems arrive: the mechanics do not work properly, the controls are not at all precise and, during the action phases, it is not possible toalise the combos essential to quickly finish off the enemies, who are often really difficult. Furthermore, inside the dungeons, the automatic management of the camera is annoying which does not always allow you to have the best shot, even if sometimes you can recover the situation by pressing the right stick, which brings the camera back to the protagonist's back. To lift our morale comes the audio sector full of more than decent sound effects and well-made music, taken from the whole film saga and enriched by a good dubbing all in Italian. Comment In our opinion, a saga like Conan deserved a better exploitation of the license, especially if we consider that Cauldron has decided to focus his game on the original stories of R.E. Howard, rather than on the film saga. The technical sector is average with few peaks and many drops in quality and a character of such charm deserved much more. The game still manages to make itself enjoyable thanks above all to the fluidity of the fights, which however too often run into difficult management of the shots, especially inside the dungeons, and in cumbersome and imprecise commands. Conan can ultimately be considered a sufficient title, especially for the good intentions of the producers, but it is clear that one of the most beautiful fantasy literary sagas ever deserved much more. Pros: Conan is Conan Smooth animations and decent narrative depth Quite challenging and you can't always save Cons: Sometimes frustrating because of the controls Deserved more from a technical point of view Multiplayer mode not exciting Since too often, especially in the past, we have seen big film brands turn into poor videogame productions, it is good to specify immediately that Conan is not exactly the exception that proves the rule. The Slovak team Cauldron has however tried to transport all the characteristics of the famous saga with taste, focusing its product on pure action, without however neglecting the atmospheres born from the pen of R.E. Howard, father of the Conan comics, and landed on the big screen with the cult Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer, which in the eighties kicked off the glorious film career of Governor Arnold Shwartzenegger. Hyborea, a land sometimes barren and inhospitable, sometimes full of lush forests and enchanted realms, is the setting for an adventure that extends from the icy Cimmeria to the Jungles of Dafar, passing through mysterious tombs and villages populated by primitive tribes , ready to kill our hero just as he passes. Scenarios that give life to one of the most fascinating fantasy worlds ever, thanks also to the inevitable presence of monsters, warriors and wizards ready to stop Conan's path towards the only, inexorable destiny: revenge.", "date": "2004-05-04", "grade": null}
