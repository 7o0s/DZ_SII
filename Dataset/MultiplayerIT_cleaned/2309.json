{"name": "Battlecruiser Millennium", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlecruiser-millennium_a.html", "text": "The version that everyone has been waiting for for years In what sense is Millennium the version of the BC3000 series that everyone has been waiting for for years? Well, anyone who has followed Derek Smart's adventure in the development of this title knows that he has been through all sorts of things and many times he has created enormous expectations in the fans which in the end were not satisfied for various reasons, but often not because of him. For example there were problems with the manual, and the person who had to write it was fired by Derek because he was not up to the task (he caused a delay in the release of the game with his incompetence, so he was fired for a more than legitimate reason)!. Not to mention the problems with the manufacturer of the game box and the galactic map (initially monochrome, then beautifully printed in color!), the delays due to bureaucratic problems with the publisher and the problem with a non-functioning master because the version of Installshield used was buggy. In short, we have sweated to deserve this splendid game that with Directx 8.1 support and a graphics engine capable of dealing with any environmental situation, from deep space to planetary exploration up to first person subjective (yes! you read that right! it's like having three games in one!) seems to offer itself as THE space simulator par excellence! Maximum interaction and depth of play The game universe is incredible: there are around 80 planets and more than 100 moons to visit. Of course, every planet and every moon can be explored in detail, whether in a fighter jet or on foot or in a ground vehicle. The worlds are rendered with remarkable realism and there are the usual environmental effects such as rain. The weapons available are many and would envy the marine of Aliens vs Predator 2! At the beginning of the game you will be able to choose different careers and alien races to play as. Of course, depending on the career, you will be more involved in a terrestrial scenario with a first person subjective or a space scenario with the classic space sim view, but this does not mean that, whatever career you choose, you will be forced to play only in first person or only on board of a ship! The strength of the game lies precisely in the possibility of being able to do whatever comes to mind, in the vacuum of space, or in a desolate wasteland of a rocky planet. The careers As far as I'm concerned, the most interesting career is that of commander of a starship, which can't help but remind me of the atmosphere of Star Trek and the adventures of Captain Kirk! As commander, we can guide our ship through this huge galaxy I mentioned, trade, join one of the factions and fight for it, or simply explore the galaxy and contact the alien races present (there are more than 10 of them, each different it's particular!). In addition to the career of commander of a starship, we can choose many others, such as space marine, scientist, explorer, rebel, trader, diplomat. As I said the interaction is maximum, and you can drive several dozen vehicles, from the aforementioned ship with a crew of thousands of people to star and planetary fighters, up to even some ground vehicles. But do not think that it is a simple shooter because it is not. Simulated strategy or strategic simulation? Despite being a space sim, the game boasts a management system (such as the Battlecruiser's resource management system, for example) that is very complex and will satisfy the hearts of fans of high-level strategists! Therefore, like Captain Kirk, we can give those typical orders that only make sense when managing a ship of enormous proportions, such as the Enterprise or the Battlecruiser which is the star ship of our game: we can, for example, set up scientific or military expeditions and use the famous ~teleportation~ or engage in incredible breathtaking battles with other space giants. Simulated strategy or strategic simulation? A peculiarity of the game is that most of the time we will not use lasers and torpedoes as in Star Trek, but, and this reminds me a lot of Gene Roddenberry's TV series Andromeda, being the Battlecruiser mainly an ~aircraft carrier~, you will make extensive use of your hunt to defend the ship and to defeat the opponents. And of course there's the option to play as one of the fighter pilots! Incredeemable, right? The defects But now let's move on to the ~unpleasant~ part of the review, that is, let's talk about the game's flaws. First there is no multiplayer option. Smart plans to make a future patch that will fix this but we don't know when it will be available. Consequently the only game mode is singleplaying. In this regard, we cannot help but mention the campaign, consisting of 15 missions. It is well structured, although it lacks the epicness of other titles, such as Klingon Academy, for example. Surely what attracts the most is, beyond the campaign, the possibility of exploring an ever-changing galaxy, without time limits, following your instincts and trying to earn enough to improve your ship. The defects As for the graphics, it is certainly worthy of other similar titles currently on the market (and it is possible to select resolutions up to 1280x1024), but it lacks that spectacularity which, for example, is present in Independence War 2 - The Edge of Chaos. The sound is also of decent but not exceptional quality. In short, this is to tell you not to expect the game of the year in terms of graphics and sound but expect the game of the century in terms of interaction, gameplay and depth of game and setting. Conclusions Where do you find another space sim where you can explore the galaxy with your ship, overcome the atmosphere of a planet and explore its continents, choose a point to land, land and get off on foot to take a ride with your faithful laser rifle , ready to slaughter the poor defenseless aliens? (helpless so to speak). It's like having Elite joined Tribes 2! Conclusions Warmly recommended therefore to fanatics of Elite and X-Beyond The Frontier games, but it is a product that I also recommend to those who love subjective games where there is reasoning and in any case all those games where the freedom of action and interaction are at the highest level. In conclusion, it is absolutely a game to have at all costs: thumbs up, then! And now select the route and... have a good trip. Introduction I must be sincere. I've always loved Elite games where you feel like you can do anything and go ~where no man has gone before~ ;). Although the genre is certainly one of my favorites, I assure you that even if I hated this type of game, I probably would have still written a favorable review, as is the one I am about to do. However, reviewing Battlecruiser Millennium is not easy. The game is huge, both in setting and in the amount of things you can do. But let's go in order. Producer and project leader is Derek Smart. He is a highly motivated person who, when he published the first version of the BC3000AD series in 1996 with Take 2 Interactive and received strong criticism, did not let himself be overcome by the negative situation and continued to believe in his (and ours! ) dream: a universal space sim. A couple of years later Derek completed version 2.0 of Battlecruiser and was an instant hit among fans of the genre. Despite the problems of the gameplay and the outdated graphics engine, they did not decree the absolute success it deserved, and therefore the Battlecruiser 3000 2.0 of those years passed a little quietly, without causing great clamor. Recently, Derek and his development team made a third version, this time called Battlecruiser Millennium, and it's finally the version that everyone has been waiting for for years!", "date": "2001-12-17", "grade": null}
