The setting changes - as it is easy to guess from the title, with a pirate background - some nuances of gameplay vary but the structure is fundamentally the same, or rather that of a free to play game that allows you to administer and expand your own base and to fight opponents to rob them of their wealth. So let's see if Plunder Pirates is a simple grog-flavored copy or if it manages to add something new to the genre. Uncontrollable pirates The tutorial that opens the Plunder Pirates dance will undoubtedly appear superfluous for anyone who has a minimum of familiarity with the management systems that have appeared so far on iOS: framed from an isometric view, the island that serves as a headquarters can be enriched with new buildings and services simply by opening the appropriate menu and selecting the unit you want, obviously provided that you have sufficient amounts of gold available. Nothing new under the sun also as regards the monetization method adopted by the Midoki developers, completely similar to that of the aforementioned Clash of Clans: everything revolves around gems - which can be purchased through the appropriate in-game shop - which they allow you to speed up each of the construction processes, otherwise marked by countdowns that get longer and longer as you continue in the game. As often happens with such mechanisms, it is a system that penalizes those who prefer to devote themselves to prolonged game sessions, while all the others can easily exit the application and return later to find completed jobs. More unpleasant and potentially annoying is the fact that it is necessary to pay (always with real money) also to be able to benefit from a shield capable of protecting the island for a certain amount of time from attacks by other users, and thus avoiding the possibility of end up with damages of various entities to their assets. Obviously you can also step into the shoes of the conquerors, and with just a few taps it is possible to select a random player who will be the victim of the raids of the crew that you command in the battle phase of the game. Plunder Pirates is a pleasant strategy game, but too similar to Clash of Clans to leave its mark Speaking precisely of the side of Plunder Pirates dedicated to combat, it almost seems that the developers of Midoki wanted to bring back the mechanics of Clash of Clans en bloc, including also the less positive aspects of the Supercell title. Here too you can enlist units of pirates with different statistics and behavior on the field, paying them in grog and making them land on the preferred side of the enemy island simply by touching it with a finger: at the same time it is not possible to give any indication to your troops, who attack the structures in a completely arbitrary way, perhaps focusing on a building adjacent to a cannon that will have an easy time sweeping them away. The strategic factor therefore ends up being greatly reduced, making the player a mere spectator at this juncture, rather than an active participant. Fortunately, Plunder Pirates compensates for this lack with a much more convincing exploratory component: you can therefore sail the seas with your ship, tracing the route on a special map and discovering what is hidden behind the darkened boxes of the surrounding world. You can come across islands to conquer or to exploit to accumulate resources, treasures and even encounters with sea monsters of various types, and if you are captured by the desire to discover every inch of the ocean, Plunder Pirates can last quite a long time. Moving on to the audiovisual sector, the members of the Rovio Stars series have always stood out for excellent values from the point of view of design and technical realization, and the Midoki title is no exception: the graphics in particular are delightful, very colorful and very accurate in details (particularly appreciable if you increase the zoom to the maximum), and manages to reach peaks of absolute excellence as regards the reproduction of water. The work done by the sound is also good, which accompanies the action without being monotonous or annoying.", "date": "2014-09-27", "grade": "7.0"}
