{"name": "Yager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yager_a.html", "text": "Although we tend to classify this title as a third-person shooter, YAGER is not a flight simulator, nor is it a shooter in flight. If you are familiar with any game in the category, I think the best indication would be that it is a cross between WING COMMANDER and COLONY WARS. The whole game is structured in missions that will alternate situations in which you will have to manage alone with others in which you will fight alongside your allies. These missions are set within a historical canvas which, although not very original, is made with extreme care. The cut scenes (transition scenes that tell the story) were created with the game engine, with no (or almost) apparent gap between the game and the animated interlude. The missions (20) are extremely good: they present a huge amount of situations and every single mission is made up of several parts (checkpoints). Starting a new mission you have three ~continues~, which allow, in case of death or failed objective, to resume from the last checkpoint. Once the ~continues~ have been exhausted, it is necessary to start again from the beginning of the last mission started. Your ship ~Sagittarius~ basically has two flight modes: Jet and Hover. With the first you are always on the move and can only slow down by using one of the triggers. Releasing the trigger will return the ship to full speed. In ~Hover~ mode (slower) you can instead measure thrust and operate maneuvers with greater precision. In both cases you can then shoot with your available weapons, operate a mechanical arm to collect objects / ammunition, decide the game view that suits you best and view a convenient map of the area. It should be noted that neither of the two modes is very fast, just as neither weapon is excessively scenic. The programmers have opted for a very appreciable pinch of realism that takes the title away from being a kind of R-TYPE in 3D. Unfortunately, although you get used to it in half an hour, the ship's control system is still a bit annoying for this particular flight mode management. Even after a few hours, you still won't feel 100% master of the vehicle. It should also be added that each completed mission can be replayed to earn further scores. There are no multiplayer modes. If you are interested in seeing what your Xbox is capable of, you absolutely must play at least 2/3 of this title. It is simply phenomenal! Moved by a very fluid engine (which loses a few frames only in the most chaotic situations) and equipped with one of the best graphic cleaning ever seen, YAGER represents a visual spectacle from start to finish. Before analyzing the technical aspect, it is mandatory to applaud the characterization and design of the whole game. There are rare games that can show off such care in the design of characters, environments, machines and if we consider that this is a western game, it becomes even more incredible. Each spaceship, in addition to being modeled in an impeccable way, features many animated details, from extendable arms, to cannons, hatches that open / close, ailerons, etc ... Obviously in support of this, there is a massive use of effects Xboxes. Light trails, volumetric smoke, particles that reproduce sparks and flames, reflections and so on are part of the potential of the Microsoft console. etc br> The sound is no less: the accompaniment is spot on and very varied. The sound effects are satisfying and everything is supported by an excellent dubbing and by an industrial quantity of comments from Magnus, never repetitive, which very often will make you smile. YAGER is truly a valid game and it rarely happens to find such a well-finished product in your hands. Of course, the type of game makes it a title ~not for everyone~, but even those who have never particularly loved this genre should try it, since its quality alone will be able to convince you to buy. If you really wanted to find faults, I would mention the inconvenience of the control system and the absence of the multiplayer mode which thus link the longevity of the title to the sole experience of the story mode which, however, with its 20 missions, will keep you busy for a long time time. Pros: Detailed graphics Very varied and addictive Excellent characther design Cons: Difficult control system No multiplayer mode The story begins in a far from rosy scenario: you have lost your ship, your money and your avengersyou broke up with your girlfriend. Thus you find yourself facing the life of a Freelancer like Magnus Tide and you have just embarked on your new job which finally puts you back at the helm of your own ship which lights up some hope for your future. However, this positive note is counterbalanced by the presence of an increasingly pressing war, so much so that in the first missions during your training phase, you will be involved in some clashes in an attempt to stop the assaults of some pirates who inexplicably seem financed by powerful hands that allow you to show off incredible and very dangerous flying vessels. What is hidden behind the pirates you will find out only by continuing in the missions. Since it is a fact that it always rains in the wet, when you return from the very first mission, you will discover that your ex-girlfriend, Sarah, will give you the orders from the control tower!", "date": "2003-06-10", "grade": null}
