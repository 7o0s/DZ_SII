In some respects it recalls Journey and not only for the particular appearance of the creature with a fluttering poncho, but above all for that attempt to propose a form of communication between players that could be defined as experimental, given that it divests itself of all the modern technological infrastructure to leave users a few words to try to get in touch with each other and a lot of puzzles to be solved more with sound practice than with speeches. In fact, Dreii is one of the closest things to an old ~board game~ that can be played using a computer, with the difference that communication between players in this case is reduced to the bone and collaboration must be built above all through direct action. It's a bit like playing together with constructions, trying to arrive at a solution through coordinated action which however practically does not pass through a programmed agreement, so the results can be hilarious. In addition to all this, then, there is also a well-structured puzzle game, capable of providing a long series of challenges enriched by various variables, despite the fact that the starting idea is extremely simple, almost Zen, in line with the general style. Geometric figures, physics, words and silences make up the strange and fascinating world of Dreii Search for balance The basic concept of Dreii is very simple: it involves moving, stacking solid geometric structures, building figures so as to touch and cover a sort of luminous point placed at a certain height from the ground within each level, composed from a static screen. The character can pick up and drag the various solid figures around the screen by hooking onto them at various points of choice, with the physics imposing the consequent reaction movements between the structures on the screen. For example, clicking on an edge of a parallelepiped this will be lifted by the fluttering figure from that point, with the natural reaction that a solid of this kind can have if it is jerked by one edge or another, and consequent reactions that arise when hitting other objects on the screen, by stacking them (paying attention to balance and the effects of gravity) or by interlocking them. The difficulty is posed from time to time by different elements, starting from the simple study of the joints and the possibility of overlapping between the figures to reach the pre-set point to arrive at variants that complicate the action such as sudden gusts of wind, rain or the presence of objects that cannot be moved or are characterized by particular behaviors, which therefore force you to adopt the right countermeasures to get around obstacles. What may seem like an extremely simple premise gets exponentially complicated as you progress through the game and in a short time the sequential path of the introductory levels gives way to a real galaxy of puzzles to solve, reachable within a concise map with points that also allows to choose ramifications and alternative paths. The increase in variables and in the difficulty rate fails to overcome a certain monotony that can occur, especially if you really can't get carried away by this particular structure, but there is no doubt that the initial idea has been explored and exploited duty. Physics, collaboration and silences Minimalism is a common thread that is found in every aspect of this title, starting from the concept of the game to obviously arrive at its graphic characterization, but also passing through the interface and menus. The instructions are reduced to a minimum, practically absent, and everything is left to a sort of universal language given by geometry, the laws of physics and a simple graphic code which supplies the basic information on the types of levels and on the basic characteristics of some geometric figures that react differently than the standard. Also noteworthy from this point of view is the degree of abstraction of the map, which although essentially presenting only points and lines manages to provide a large amount of information at a glance.The levels are in fact placed in space like constellations, marked by sectors delimited by particularly demanding tests which act as a rite of passage from one level to another. In this abstract space it is possible to see the activity of other players in real time, appearing as small luminous dots hovering around the levels in which they are engaged and in this way we are able to see where to find a point of contact with other users . Some levels have to be tackled in multiplayer but in general it is always possible to play the game with a companion, who acts simultaneously with us on the screen. In these cases it is possible to experience that strange mediated contact between players which here takes on very particular characteristics, given the possibility of communicating only through a limited amount of words. This obviously prevents us from organizing ourselves in a precise and coordinated manner and throws us into the funny situation of groping and trying in this way to find the solution to the puzzles together, working side by side between sketchy words (those that the limited pre-set vocabulary in the game allows ) and moments of sincere hilarity that can derive from the awkwardness of certain outings. A strange world The simplicity of the elements placed on the screen and the refined but elementary style used to represent them transcends the classic dynamics of graphic representation in video games. There are no particular artifices on this solid and basic 3D, yet staged with disarming coherence and precision, nor references to now codified stylistic elements such as pixel art or things like that. Dreii uses its own language that permeates the game at different levels between gameplay, graphics and sound, and beyond technical judgments on its realization it manages to communicate the message perfectly, while largely exploiting the silence and the absence of text. The enigma, in the sense used by the metaphysical painters to whom Dreii's screenshots also seem to refer, remains a fundamental and unsolved element regarding the presence of the strange floating characters, the purpose of their actions and the forces that drive all the adventure. However, the matter is assimilated as an integral part of the game, while the intrinsic joy that springs from the strange protagonist figures, underlined by discordant sound effects that accompany their movements, dilutes the atmosphere and manages to reconcile what might seem an intimate experience and solitary with the social connections (albeit ~mute~) which also represent a fundamental element in the game. The mouse control system is precise and functional, but it is clear that this is a game probably designed keeping the touch screen in mind, an interface that probably benefits more from a gameplay entirely devoted to dragging on the screen. The mobile versions are therefore probably the most pleasant to use according to this point of view, even if in this case the functioning of the online infrastructure for multiplayer needs to be evaluated.", "date": "2016-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
