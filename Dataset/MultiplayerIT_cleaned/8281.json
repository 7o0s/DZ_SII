Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent.Another running game? On the App Store (but also on Google Play) certain genres are now all the rage and even an expert development team like Simutronics could not help but provide their own interpretation of a trend that sees a product like Temple Run establish itself with tens of millions of downloads. Founded in 1987, the St. Louis has built a name for himself in the MMO field over the years and has now decided to try his hand at iOS devices. The result is precisely One Epic Knight, a free endless run characterized by a slightly different setting than usual: in fact, in the role of a knight we will have to run inside an infinite dungeon, trying to establish new records of distance traveled each time and paying attention to the many pitfalls along the way. Unlike the Imanji Studios title, the control system uses only the touch screen and does not call into question the accelerometer, distinguishing between three ~lanes~ on which the character can move during his run, which brings to mind the mechanics of the excellent Subway Surfers, in our opinion still today a point of reference for the genre (if you don't believe us, take a look at our review). No obligation to tilt the iPhone or iPad, therefore, and in the same way we have tried to create an ~introductory phase~ to make the action more interesting, with scrolling that accelerates very gradually and does not take, therefore, in a situation of immediate danger from the first moments. The rider can change ~lane~ with horizontal drags of the finger on the screen, take the curves of the scenery in the same way, jump with an upward drag and launch into a slide with an opposite maneuver. With the sacred sword he puts everyone to flight... One Epic Knight therefore does not offer anything really new in terms of controls, but introduces some small innovations in terms of objects. While we run, in fact, we can get hold of a shield or a sword and ~consume~ them to eliminate monsters and / or destroy traps on the impact of which, otherwise, we would incur game over. We are therefore speaking of beams protruding from the walls, of ~living jellies~ that block our way, of sharp spikes and so on, while larger obstacles such as walls, closed doors and chasms will continue to represent a danger that can only be escaped with just the right amount of timing. Sometimes not even with that, since the controls are so precise but not reactive as we are sometimes asked: a double lateral swipe to change lanes twice can be done, of course, but not in an instant. The coins collected during each stint can be spent on the purchase of upgrades of various kinds: improvements for weapons and for the special mode (which is activated by collecting four mana crystals) or power-ups that can be spent only once, perhaps to continue the game to game over or to enjoy a particular score multiplier. In the end, to set new records you have to use all these solutions in the right way, and fortunately the game gives out plenty of currency to be able to do it without putting a hand in the wallet. Finally, a few words on the technical sector: One Epic Knight is presented in a much better way than the aforementioned Temple Run, it has more personality, an attractive design (although the use of colors appears a bit limited), excellent fluidity and good animations.", "date": "2012-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
