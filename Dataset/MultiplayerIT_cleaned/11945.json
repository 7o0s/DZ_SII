{"name": "Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Unusual videogame thunderbolt, incarnation of an unpredictable fusion between the platform game and the spirit of a racer with occasional and self-deprecating turns in the pinball machine, in the early Nineties Sonic the hedgehog had imposed a globally successful and multimillion-dollar brand at the hands of Sega, capable to blow consoles, cartridges and merchandise off the shelves. If the strictly playful merits of games like Sonic and Sonic 2 are indisputable and correspond to one of those rare, pure, telluric revolutions in game design, the character's charisma was equally undeniable. Such an interactive and licensed goldmine could hardly be wasted by a company like Sega in the first half of the 1990s. The Sega types were dynamic, rampant, aggressive like the porcupine born from the Sonic Team and raised by themselves. Sega was a company still capable of recognizing the value of the technical and artistic investment to be sustained in order to put talented designers in the best conditions and thus grow turnover and reputation. Or, seeing things slightly less prosaic and more ennobling, to earn a place in history. Sonic 3 thus recovered everything from the original formula of the two previous chapters, and implanted conspicuous, tangible aesthetic and technical improvements, new playful features, a more captivating and accessible presentation thanks to the save options and new game modes ( in the foreground the fantastic bonus mode in pseudo-3D). Dulcis in fundo, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 presented itself with the desire to definitively consecrate the quality of the character design of the characters. With a completely new propensity on the narrative aspect, the path that would have inserted them into a large, fully developed and cohesive universe began, capable of acting as a glue for the levels of the game but also as a retrospective background of previous events. What was it yesterday Sonic 3 further uninhibited the charisma of the characters by introducing the transformation into Super Sonic but also the captivating Knuckles the Echidna, a hybrid attacker halfway between a cut-scenes character and an occasional boss, to whom he paved the way for a future star role in Sonic & Knuckles. On a technical level, it enriched backdrops and visual effects, made the animation frames grow, supported the always frenetic action without slowdowns with accompaniments with a strong groove, very rhythmic and funky, meandering, made of bass lines and discreet refrains that did not pretend to come to the fore. Game design, at an all-time high, skilfully alternated breakneck racing and an exploratory aspect, offering internships that dialogued at various levels with the player, now enhancing their tendency to be sprinters and now boycotting them, forcing them to surrender, traps, negotiations. The backdrops were new, decidedly more varied and decidedly more interactive, with their hollow trunks, compression and acceleration systems, lianas and platforms to be loaded like yo-yos to name just a few of the new ideas. To complete the novelty picture, Sonic's aerial shot, defensive and offensive at the same time as the three power ups of Fire, Water and Lightning that allowed him to resist fire, breathe underwater and attract metal rings, as well as protect him from their respective elements. What is it today Today the quality of the Sonic brand continues to degrade, certainly not revived by the revival of the new ~traditionalist~ episodes and, above all, damaged and sunk by the terrifying episodes produced for the new generation consoles, distinguished en bloc by the chronic lack of investment in terms of design, by the bad aesthetics and by the poor presentation. There is then the risk, paradoxical but concrete, that a contemporary prejudice falls on the Sonic-games of the sixteen-bit era, a risk that is absolutely necessary to prevent. Sonic 3 is still today one of the best platformers in history, the best chapter of the saga in terms of cohesion and variety and a game of those who are at the forefront of the best soft banks. There is no review that can do justice to the roller coaster feel, interactive pitfalls, seesaw of speed and patrol that Sonic 3's design brings into play. Sometimes Sonic 3 voluntarily extremes the gap between the immense speed, let's say, of the conduits of the aquatic level and the slowness of the ford sections that alternate continuously with them. On other occasions the design radicalises the descents, bringing them almost to ninety degrees and then forcing the player to make difficult ascents. Or, after entertaining the player by throwing him like a palthe pinball machine in an eye-candy of guncotton loop-the-loops, then forces him to actions to the millimeter by putting a deadly forced advancement of the level on his heels. The multiplayer with loop levels works, as well as the two-player alternation with Tails, now controllable even in solitary and capable of flying and gliding for short periods. The spectacular bonus mode, in a very successful pseudo 3D and set on a rotating sphere in which to collect only the right colored marbles at increasingly nerve-racking speeds, is simply the most irresistible and dizzying of the entire series. What is it today Sonic 3 therefore has no intrinsic flaws, and dwarfs the pathetic new three-dimensional titles produced by a Sega that is the shadow of the company of the past. Yet a risk awaits at the gate, from the Wii soft library, anyone who wants to experience the maximum that this game can offer. In fact, a few months after its release for Megadrive, Sonic 3 would be followed by Sonic & Knuckles, a cartridge in turn equipped with a slot which, by connecting to the previous chapters of the series, would collect them in turn under the same roof, unifying the narrative unfolding and multiplying cross-overs between games. In the case of Sonic 3, this would have happened by doubling the chapters and offering control of Knuckles, with all the relative distortion and multiplication of the resulting game styles and with a considerable amount of technical and aesthetic improvements. Determining whether whoever developed the Wii Virtual Console is interested in developing a software emulation of this spectacular hardware operation of the past remains the subject of discussion, however. It is enough to note how the simple remapping of the basic controls of the games emulated on the Wii is not possible, or to realize how user-friendly and ready-made the emulation of these classics is at times, to be tempted to bet that Sonic & Knuckles , if it ever comes to Wii, it won't be able to merge with the other episodes as in the past. Glad to see a future denial of this premonition, but it's highly probable that Sonic 3, an already excellent game, won't be able to explode on Wii into the masterpiece that was Sonic 3 & Knuckles on Megadrive, at a time when there were still the cartridges. Which would therefore remain, in this case, to be preferred without any reservations. Good things come in threes: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is also now in the Wii Virtual Console library. One of the most anticipated and most important platform games of the former Sega flagship soft library is thus preparing for the fateful test ~of the dozen years later~. Test passed, but a shadow, that of Sonic & Knuckles, seems to loom over this timeless masterpiece.", "date": "2007-10-11", "grade": null}
