Many of us dream of living in a castle and very few can afford it nowadays, but probably no one stops to think that it can also have negative aspects: first of all, truly ancient castles must be drafty, difficult to furnish and to clean, but above all you never know what may be hidden buried in their foundations or in their centuries-old past. Samuel Gordon, scion of a noble English family whose family tree has its roots in the distant and dark Middle Ages, will learn it at his own expense: after a long absence, the young man returns to Black Mirror, the home of the Gordon clan, which was theater not only of the tragic death of his wife twelve years earlier but also of the terrible and premature end of his grandfather William, who mysteriously fell from the highest tower of the castle on a dark and stormy night. The dynamics of the accident do not seem to convince Samuel: tormented by horrible visions, suspicious of a strange symbol left at the site of the discovery of the body and by the fact that in recent times the old man had isolated himself, obsessively dedicating himself to research into the family's past, he starts a small personal investigation, which will lead him to disturbing discoveries and will involve him in a series of apparently inexplicable crimes. Despite a fair amount of clichs, the plot is quite intriguing and not without some twists, especially towards the end. The mirror reflects the dark faults of the past This morgue wouldn't pass a sanitation inspection... During the six long chapters that make up the game, Samuel will venture not only into the most remote corners of the gloomy Black Mirror castle but also into other pleasant places such as cemeteries, crypts, morgues, abandoned mines, asylums and above all family tombs. . when we say that we all have our skeletons in our closets, we don't always mean it in a figurative sense! Despite a fair amount of clichs, the plot is quite intriguing and not without some twists, especially towards the end. The authors knew what they were doing and studied: the fabric of the plot allows illustrious influences to transpire, both in literature and in videogames, ranging from Edgar Allan Poe to Gabriel Knight. The atmospheres are probably the strong point and help to make the story exciting, although the pace of the game has ups and downs: Samuel, a worthy character from a gothic novel, is depressed at the right point and drags himself around the castle disconsolate, digging up sad memories of the past and commenting everything that happens and surrounds him with a whisper, almost a sigh, thus helping us to immerse ourselves in the spirit; at times his investigations know how to really involve us, but there is much more than one passage in which instead we risk getting lost due to some inconsistency in the game mechanics, which we will examine later. Too bad above all for the characterization, the focal point of any good graphic adventure, which in this case is not very convincing: it is not at all easy to become attached to the protagonists or find them interesting, as they are barely sketched and heavily stereotyped. We've all seen them before somewhere and they can even die in the most heinous ways, without inspiring the slightest feeling in the player, which is quite alarming! Point and click... left and right William Gordon was trying to discover the secret of this altar, before losing his pen. The unfolding of the adventure is rigidly linear and often affected by the need to solve the puzzles in a precise order, to the point of not being able to use or collect some objects before having talked to someone about them or until they are absolutely essential, which is realistic but it forces the player to an infinite number of trips back and forth from settings already combed through. Sometimes you have to wait for a character to do something for you (get an item, fix a problem...) and walk around or talk to others, just to pass the time  this time we won't get away with just walking away from the setting to return immediately and get what we asked for, as if by magic. This too gives an extra touch of realism, but in the long run it proves annoying, especially when there is really nothing else left to do and the progress of the game depends exclusively on the operation to be expected. Another rather unnerving thing is what is usually defined as ~pixel hunting~, or the frantic search for active points on the screen, hidden among the game backdrops with unforgivable skill: for many adventurersi is routine, but here patience and eyesight are really put to the test sometimes. Perhaps exacerbating the problem is the fact (however original) that you can use not only the left mouse button to interact with objects but also the right one, to examine some of them more thoroughly, with the consequence that you inevitably end up clicking on everything not once but TWICE! The unfolding of the adventure is rigidly linear. Point and click... left and right Family reunion at the castle. Our grievances end here, however, since the following should only consolidate the impression in you that, despite some flaws and the anathemas launched by the most critics, The Black Mirror is an adventure absolutely worthy of attention. Starting with the puzzles, which certainly do not sin for lack of variety: they are mostly based on the inventory but also accompanied by riddles, there are several puzzles, a few photos or messages to recompose, a horde of closed doors to overcome and finally puzzles involving the manipulation of more or less complex machinery. The level of difficulty is variable but never prohibitive. Nonetheless, there are a couple of occasions when you can die and even in a bad way! Conversations are the main source of information and the engine of many crucial points of the plot. We also come across several documents to collect and read throughout history (diaries, inscriptions, newspaper articles...), but they are almost always exciting and very well written. The dialogue system presents the topics in the form of icons, which can be selected with the mouse pointer: since conversations almost always have a linear development, the player just has to do nothing but diligently exhaust all the available topics. If it is true that atmosphere, puzzles and dialogues are fundamental in titles of this kind, in the next paragraph you will discover that The Black Mirror is not to be desired even in terms of technical realization  The charm of the horrid Nothing to complain about the game interface, pure point and click: it is streamlined and functional. As is now tradition, the cursor lights up when passing over the points of the screen with which we can interact, but it is appreciable that many of these are purely decorative: once a description has been provided for certain non-essential objects for the purposes of the adventure , these no longer appear as active points, similarly to what happens with other objects already used by the protagonist. The inventory occupies the bottom of the screen and is extremely intuitive to use. The technical aspect for which this adventure shines in a particular way, however, is the graphics of the settings, which are varied, fabulously dark and of great effect: the backdrops, although two-dimensional, appear vivid and very detailed, as well as being enriched by excellent animations (birds circling around the towers of the castle, the fronds of a weeping willow swaying in the wind, leaves falling to the ground while twirling in the autumn gardens...). The use of light and the atmospheric effects are also noteworthy: being able to admire the same settings by day and by night or when a storm is raging is quite suggestive. Unfortunately, the 3D models of the characters are not at the same level, poorly detailed and quite woody: they seem to move in slow motion and in a decidedly unnatural way. The quality of the movies is not up to that of the backdrops, but still decent: they often appear a little faded and out of focus, not even the ~director's~ choices are always spot on. Exceptions are the visions that haunt Samuel and which, as such, show off a more dreamlike cut and are quite engaging. [C] We have moved to Wales but still looking for a family grave!. The well-stocked library of the castle. A chat with the butler: he may not be the murderer but he is so long-winded that he kills! [/C] Music is not omnipresent in the game: it pops up here and there to underline the salient moments of the story but, while not giving us an unforgettable soundtrack, it offers sufficiently disturbing songs, which know how to create suspense and tension as much as necessary. Normally, the player's exploration is accompanied only by ambient sound effects, which are appreciable and contribute to the grim and sinister atmosphere of the game. The Italian dubbers have done a good job: it seems that the English-speaking version of The Black Mirror has been devastated by very uninspired interpretations, but in the Bel Paese we are used to very high professional standards in terms of dubbing and, fortunately for us, in recent times videogame productions also seem to benefit from it. We can then enjoy the voice of trueprofessionals, among all Donatella Fanfani, who had already accompanied us on the Syberia journey. The dialogues, however, would not be what they are without an equally good translation and Jinglebell has not disappointed us on this front either. Comment Finally a fairly long adventure! Over the six chapters that compose it, you will explore a wide range of settings and find yourself grappling with puzzles of the most disparate nature. The slow passage of time in the game and the long dialogues also contribute to its longevity. For these same reasons and for the not exactly fast pace, The Black Mirror is certainly not ideal for the restless by nature. The all in all intriguing story, a respectable technical realization and an excellent Italian localization make it an attractive product for the more hardened and less intransigent adventurers. We would like to recommend it, without too many reservations, to lovers of the genre who have enjoyed titles such as Post Mortem or the first unforgettable Gabriel Knight. Pros: Dark and suggestive environments Various and satisfying puzzles Fair duration Cons: Character models and animations Game structure too rigid Dead times A videogame case This ancestor of the Gordons was very attached to his memories, so much so that he took them to his grave. This new marriage between point-and-click adventure and thriller in a horror sauce was born in the Czech Republic: in reality, Posel Smrti (it's the original title but don't ask us how to pronounce it) is a game from 2003, which has finally come down to us and is available even at newsstands, at a price that all in all makes us turn a blind eye to this interminable wait! While we poor Italians were completely unaware that games of this caliber were developed in the Czech Republic and that there were five-letter words with a single vowel, in the international videogame community they said all sorts of things about this title, defined from time to time as a ciofeca unspeakable or such a masterpiece. Regardless of the fact that this is neither the first nor the only case of its kind and that there is often a certain gap between the tastes of adventurers in the old and new continents, we were eager to get our hands on it and see first person: so let's try to understand together why this Black Mirror is such a controversial title...", "date": "2004-10-14", "grade": null}
