{"name": "Schizm 2: Chameleon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/schizm-2-chameleon.html", "text": "Schizm 2, strong on the basis of its predecessor, does nothing but improve considerably on the work done in the past. The adventure, which chooses the first person to better get the player into the part, unfolds in graphically well-finished levels and worlds with a graphics engine such as the 3D Jupiter, used excellently in No One Lives Forever 2 and in Tron 2.0. The real-time light effects are excellent and the smoke effects are no less. The graphics as I said above are treated in detail (modest and dated hardware systems abstain) the environments are very realistic and we will also have full freedom of movement all reinforced by the first person view in full FPS style that give the user the sensation of full depth and freedom within the scenarios. In fact, with the movements of the mouse we will be able to look around 360 degrees. One cannot fail to notice the accuracy with which the adventures have been immersed in a satisfying soundtrack and good effects that very well recreate the fantastic place where the player will find himself. An absolutely spot-on soundtrack that manages to create different moods according to the situations and environments. The story unfolds on the mysterious story of Sen, who after waking up from a 200-year sleep that erased all his memories, meets a hologram that reveals only two important pieces of information about his now lost past, Sen is a traitor who has ignited a war that erased the world he lived in, and that sleep and the ship he's in are his punishment for the deeds he's done in the past. The story in the bud seems obvious and with little depth but in the course of the game it will fascinate you and acquire considerable relevance. The player will not be disappointed by the flow of the plot, on the contrary, he will be pleasantly surprised. Another novelty that partially revolutionizes the playability factors are the interactions of the non-player characters with dialogues that better explain the story in which the past events that Sen does not remember are immersed. The puzzles proposed in the game are designed very well and will give a hard time even to the most passionate of the genre. You will never find a trivial puzzle but you will have to thoroughly study the mechanisms of some of them. This, which can be a strength, sometimes also turns out to be a weakness since for inexperienced users they can be difficult and disarming in the long run. It's a pity that even in the first episode it was a brake on the full success that the 2001 title deserved. The puzzles that do not find much foundation with the plot are arranged so as to be solved so as not to leave the genre but are not strictly related to the plot, consequently together with the difficulty of the latter make this title compelling for fans but make it extremely approachable to players who want to approach the genre. For the daring, on the other hand, the puzzles will be the starting points for headaches as, as I repeat, they have been devised with extreme masochism as they will not be easy to solve at all. So in the longevity business we have a point in its favor. Final comment Ultimately this title represents a step forward compared to its predecessor but which absolutely does not stand out in the ~bouquet~ of graphic adventures as it does not present any substantial novelty. Fans of Myst and Co. will not fail to play it but for novice players Schizm 2 will be 90% a disappointment. Well-maintained graphics and a decent sound structure combined with complex puzzles make the title interesting but does not make it stand out among the greats of its genre. It was the year 2001 when this title arrived on the market from distant Poland and soon gained acclaim from the people of graphic adventure lovers. The first episode starred Hannah and Sam as two soldiers looking for a missing delegation of scientists on the planet of Argilus. The adventure based on the intuitions of the writer Terry Dowling soon became famous for the winning mix of surreal and technological-fantastic environments in which the characters are grappling with tantalizing puzzles that entertain and amuse the minds of gamers.", "date": "2004-06-22", "grade": null}
