The Nintendo Switch review of Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales is another step forward, for users and the market, of that Polish expansion perspective in Kyotensi territories that began with The Witcher 3. A great leap forward if you take examining how much the Warsaw team is tinting the franchise with portability, pushing it towards a user who maybe didn't even know they could fall in love with it. Here, from this perspective it is perhaps simpler and more correct to say that Thronebreaker is the ideal prequel, to be played before the third episode: appearance, gameplay, body and impact are on a very different level and more suitable for beginners, therefore perfect for those who are Witcher fast and want to gently enter a universe that yes, he knows is huge, but only by hearsay. The reader may not know the setting, or he may have stripped The Witcher 3 and his Gwent, or maybe he has Switch and loves card games. The elements of Thronebreaker are expertly mixed to take anyone by the hand, even the most distant in taste, thanks to a superfine, expert and intelligent artistic and narrative component, elements further enhanced on Switch. Walking with Meve Without spending too much time talking about history and characters, The Witcher Tales has Queen Meve as its protagonist, an extremely charismatic and profound character, ideal as a testimonial for this work of expanding the fanbase and perfect for telling her story just over a month later the release of the television series on Netflix. As per the script, the narrative of CD Projekt Red is dry but fascinating, capable - thanks to an excellent dubbing and localization of the texts in Italian - of fully conveying the soul of a graphic novel. You are therefore immediately captured by the events and transported through a succession of fictitious but realistic situations, with equally real evolutions and consequences, often left to the player to decide. Between the crossroads a map designed with great care develops, inside which non-player characters are waiting to tell us something and resources promptly shown by a cursor are there to be collected. The underlying system is simple: quests marked by points of interest and choices made during exploration increase or decrease resources (gold, wood and recruits), making progress more or less fast but at the same time defining who Meve is, with a whole host of characters who come together and leave. The mother feature of Thronebreaker is that all of this is in the form of cards: battles, characters, objects have their own animated dimension inside the card, giving the player a sense of care and detail that is truly out of the ordinary. Traveling across the lands immediately becomes an opportunity for discovery, told by supporting actors and soldiers who each move in their own rectangle of paper and who in a few frames convey who they are and what they represent. It is an extremely successful technique that allows, even during battles, to give a weight and a dimension to the cards, no longer just options to deploy but perceptible, dynamic, coherent entities. Some of the first clashes come to mind, one against beasts and one against rolling boulders: in both cases, the sensation of movement and struggle of the two sides is crystal clear, the cards seem only a two-dimensional transposition of palpable fights . Witchers in the park Thronebreaker is a perfect title for Switch: the peculiarity of the Nintendo platform creates the ideal partnership for the narrative and structure of The Witcher Tales, finally no longer relegated to the static nature of a monitor but free to fully reward its graphic novel characteristics with from card game, often rapid. CD Projekt Red's cel-shading enhances the Switch screen, leaving the expressiveness of a rich, detailed world and emblem of the development team's passion for this franchise to its dimension. There will be rare instances, both docked and undocked, where the framerate stumbles a bit, but we're sure they'll be fixed. For the rest, playing Gwent on Switch is a natural, fluid and decidedly tailored operation for the Nintendo portable, capable of giving an enviable breath to the sprites, colors and very dry and fast gameplay of Gwent. It seemed to us that the best way is once again the completely portable one, assisted by the extraordinary start-stop function and by the effectiveness of a hardware structure that seems to marry with graphic novels. For lovers of the role-playing part, Meve will need your help to improve his army and structures by spending the resources foundduring the journey even if, as reported in the first review of Thronebreaker, doubts remain about the effective weight of the differentiation of the deck by the player, since the fulcrum will often be - precisely by virtue of its speed - to favor cards capable of striking direct and lethal. Net of this element, perhaps subjective, The Witcher Tales manages to entertain with immediate simplicity, perfecting that path of hooking up the Switch user by CD Projekt Red.", "date": "2020-02-03", "grade": "8.0"}
