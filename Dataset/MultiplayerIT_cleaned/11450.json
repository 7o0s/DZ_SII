{"name": "Grand Theft Auto IV - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-iv-recensione.html", "text": "You would have things to tell, eh NB? Missed protagonist of a film with a Hollywood flavor, Niko Bellic is the perfect example of an excellent narrative vision that the Rockstar guys have managed to pour into every most hidden corner of the endless lines of dialogue that make up the exciting plot of GTA4. Niko's past, his multifaceted character in a thousand sharp edges and his experienced guerrilla mentality of other times is literally diluted in small moments of gameplay. When the player least expects it, here comes a quick change of shot or an intense close-up, a hint of NB's difficult and audacious past that helps to give a sense of growing coherence to his behaviors, his being moody and ready to ~prostitute himself~ for some change, provided he builds a dense network of acquaintances to reach his final goal: a prey so difficult to find and that we can only get to know after many hours of play. Over time we will feel an integral part of the drama of a war past that heavily marked Niko's character, we will discover the difficulties of a family broken by crime, we will become attached to a somewhat inept and clumsy half-brother and we will literally remain entangled in the evolution of a grim, bloody and highly mature narrative plot but with a strange flavor of healthy realism, as if we were grappling daily and personally with the most serious crimes of society. You would have things to tell, eh NB? The strength of the new GTA lies precisely in its sipping a precise narrative framework, with the wise use of dozens of different characters with whom it will always be very easy to get into mental harmony, perhaps without sharing the means or purposes, but always recognizing at once keep an eye on their behavior and, as the game progresses, their voice is always well characterized through the speaker of the mobile phone, our faithful life partner. As in any other GTA, inventor of this style of gameplay called free roaming, we will have at our disposal an entire city, in this case Liberty City, created along the lines (not too false to be honest) of New York, to which we will have free access to carry out all our activities. To be honest, access is partially limited: the city is divided into three islands. The first, made up of the Broker and Dukes districts, will be immediately practicable far and wide from the beginning of the game; continuing in the plot, we will be able to set foot first on the two islands of Bohan and Algonquin (the latter extremely similar to Manhattan) and, finally, we will be able to freely explore the islet of Alderney. To prevent us from going from one island to another, as long as the plot allows us to, there are the classic stratagems already seen in the past: checkpoints or bridges under construction. Overall, the playing area is slightly lower than what was seen in San Andreas but the attention to detail, the mania poured into perfectly reconstructing neighborhoods well distinguished in their poverty or opulence, the wonderful glimpses of Star Junction so similar to Times Square , or the devastated neighborhoods surrounding Francis International Airport to cite two quick examples, repeat the environmental impact offered by GTA:SA in a big way. the strength of the new GTA is precisely in this sipping of a precise narrative plot You would have things to tell, eh NB? Not even for a moment have we ever complained about a city that is too small: when every kilometer is perfectly blended and manages to offer so much to the player, it must be said, size no longer matters. Against this city background, absolutely realistic and pulsating with his own life that Niko will tend to destabilize with his behavior, we will find numerous characters who will take turns in telling us such a thorough and engaging plot. We will have a Jamaican, Little Jacob, always stoned on cannabis and ready to show us his cynical disinterest in society, a Vin Diesel of the poor, a certain Brucie, bulging with muscles and totally brainwashed by the constant abuse of testosterone drinks of shark, a sweet girl from the inquisitorial way in investigating the strange dealings of Niko, the beautiful Michelle. And then again, an Irishman, Packie, who you will never be able to shake off after saving his life or Francis, a policeman interested in carrying on a faade of hypocritical good-naturedness by taking advantage of your ~discreet~ cleaning services. And this is just a taste. What matters is that everyone will contribute to add a few tiles to the exciting mosaic of Ni's past lifeko Bellic and his long journey towards a criminal future that will hang by a thread until the exciting epilogue. We will thus discover his participation, on the bloodiest front, in the war between Serbia and Bosnia, his becoming a smuggler to escape the weight of war crimes, his embarking on a merchant ship with the declared aim of making a new life in the land of possibilities, America, but in reality with a seemingly implacable thirst for revenge. Is there a need to go further or have we already filled you with adequate spoilers? The Italian localization In Grand Theft Auto IV there is an impressive amount of dialogue and text, exceptional for script and transcription. The former are only in English and masterfully interpreted, the texts of the conversations are translated into excellent Italian, which allows almost complete use of the title. However, a couple of problems remain, first of all during the driving sessions, which represent a good part of the experience, it becomes difficult to read the subtitles and drive at the same time, with the risk of missing out on interesting dialogues or revelations or reaching the destination late or bruised by some careless accident. The second note to make is aimed at the texts present on the Web sites to which Niko can access, which are not translated into our language. Fortunately not the parts dedicated to the missions, but for example blogs or news bulletins, which, although not necessary to the plot, are often amusing to read and it is therefore a real shame to miss them for those who do not know the Albion language sufficiently. 360 vs PS3 A topic so dear to those who have to choose which version of the game to get (and to Console War supporters) the 360 and PS3 versions of Grand Theft Auto IV are characterized by some small differences. First of all, the Sony counterpart allows installation on a hard disk, lasting about 7 minutes, and supports the motion sensor of the Sixaxis pad to drive vehicles and reload weapons, support that can be deactivated within the options for those should be more confident with the classic control system. Finally, there is the vibration with the Dualshock 3 pad (standard on the 360 one). Touching on the technical issue, the Xbox 360 version enjoys a different, fuller and ~warmer~ color saturation, while also suffering from fewer aliasing problems, which on PlayStation 3 are more noticeable on angular shapes and in the outlines of the characters . In favor of the console produced by Sony we instead have slightly lower loads between one mission and another, a fluidity that gives the impression of being superior (thanks to an excellent blur filter implemented, which better masks the peaks towards the bottom) and above all a pop in (the appearance of objects and textures delayed compared to the rest of the scene) visibly lower, thanks to the aforementioned installation on the hard disk, which speeds up this type of loading. For the rest, the two versions are practically identical, and while sanctioning a slight technical supremacy with regard to the PlayStation 3 version, the choice of one or the other should instead fall on the basis of preferences on the pad, the importance attributed to the objectives connected to the gamertag on Xbox 360 and obviously to the console already in your possession, which in both cases hosts an absolutely exceptional version of Grand Theft Auto IV which does not justify the purchase of the one for the direct competitor. A Typical Day in Liberty City, aka What's Possible to Do Wake up at dawn, I slept in this crap shelter, plus I have to see my cousin Roman's ugly face every morning, who spouts more bullshit than everyone I know put together. I eat at Burger Shot, I like to stay fit with a nice 2 kg sandwich early in the morning, I'd better take the subway to reach that luxury clothing store, where I can buy new clothes and that ushanka that I like so much. Now I'm ready, I guess I'll borrow that sports car that's parked in front of it, even if it pisses me off breaking a window to get in it... With this car I can certainly compete and win in one of the clandestine races that organizes Brucie, there should be one tomorrow night, I have to sit those rich rich sons of clowns behind. The song that is playing on the radio is really cool, who knows what the heck it's called... what an idiot, just dial the number 948-555-0100 on your cell phone, those myths will tell me the title and author, so maybe I can ~buy~ it somewhere preferred sales channel on the Internet. Speaking of the Web, it's better to spend a moment at the Internet Point, I have to check my emails, I even posted a coupleof ads on Love-meet.com, let's see if someone has answered me, I really want to get away from my woman, she's so boring... These advertisements on the sites are beautiful, I almost buy some ringtones for the new cell phone, I especially like the one of the prostitute who falls. I'm hungry, I eat a quick hot dog in that stall near the pier, but today I'm sitting at home watching TV, especially The Men's Room, that Bas makes me die with all that pent-up anger... I won't have time to sleep dammit, Brucie asked me to steal his car, have it repainted and then washed, the pay is good; my friend on steroids, consider it a done deal. My cell phone rings, who will it be? Michelle! ~Sure, that's fine, I'll pick you up at 7pm~. Michelle is my fiance, she's a very pretty girl, but she must have flushed her passion down the toilet a few years ago...anyway, I'd better hurry, otherwise I won't make it. Better steal a police car and start deploying the sirens, who knows, maybe on the road you will meet some drug dealing cabbage head that I can throw under, just access the logs and see what crime is out there. Here she is, but how did she dress tonight? Michelle hi, where do you want me to take you? Darts, bowling, bar, restaurant, cabaret or a nice strip club? ~Stupid! Let's go have a drink, today was a tough day...~ I drank quite a bit, now I'm completely drunk, the road goes up and down and I can't drive well, I hope I don't run over someone, I usually do only when I want. I managed to accompany her safely, what do I do, shall I try? Bah, I'm completely melted, better say hello and take a ride on the East bridge, the illuminated city is a fucking show... Man, the hangover is over now and I feel like it a bit, you know what I do? I'm going to the east area to take a stroll with one of those nice young ladies, I've read that they do sets for 20, 50 and 70 dollars, not bad. I'm devastated, I can't even drive, better call a night taxi offered by my cousin, I can't stand up. I'm off to bed, tomorrow is another day and I have to go undercover in a drug exchange, sooner or later I will be able to accomplish that one goal that keeps me here in Liberty City... GTA Multiplayer? Grand Theft Auto IV has a big problem, which differentiates it a lot from the previous chapters. As if the eternal component dedicated to single-player wasn't enough, the online multiplayer part appears for the first time (in the 3D versions of the game) in Rockstar's latest effort, and the results are immediately exceptional. Just take out your mobile phone and select the appropriate option, and you are immediately catapulted into choosing one of the over fifteen available modes, which go perfectly with the vastness and variety that a city like Liberty City offers. Already starting from the deathmatch, single or in teams, the variety of situations that can be created is immediately very high and is left solely to the willingness of the players to face direct clashes rather than with the white weapon or in a ~hit and run~ configuration. However, this mode is only the appetizer, because Rockstar has really indulged in making the most of the game map, such as in ~War for the territory~, in teams, where you have to occupy a particular portion of the districts as much time as possible , and thus earn money accordingly. And again, in Mafya Srl (always alone or in a team) you have to complete some missions assigned by the characters in the game, whoever has earned the most money at the end of the time (or the limit) wins. Are you more prone to street racing? Well, choose the path on which to compete and whether to add some spice by allowing shootings and incorrect maneuvers, by choosing another you can enjoy Guardie & Ladroni, in which you can feel like hunters or prey depending on your inclinations and taking advantage of all the means of assault and police that the game provides. In addition to being a lot of fun in their own right, Rockstar has done a great job in the options made available for further customization of what is possible to do online. It starts from the choice of the portion of the map (which in many cases can also be chosen entirely) from at least a dozen different variants, to move on to choosing the aggressiveness of the police rather than the population density, the type of vehicles granted (and helicopter or motorboat races can also be organised...), weapons, number of players (up to a maximum of 16), respawn time and distance, enabling or not of voice chat. GTA Multiplayer? Within the game it is also possible to invite gl", "date": "2008-04-29", "grade": null}
