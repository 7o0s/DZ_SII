With Jump 'n' Shoot Attack the US team has no intention of changing its attitude, on the contrary it increases the dose by presenting itself with an even more extreme product than the previous ones, for better or for worse... Don't mess with Louise The developers of FreakZone Games are decidedly fundamentalist in their intention of reproducing the characteristics of old-school action on modern mobile devices, starting with a very simple plot that is liquidated in two crossed screens and a few lines of text: the president has been kidnapped by mutants, and it's up to heroine Louise Lightfoot to love herself and set out to save him. All this translates into four worlds divided into as many levels that you need to cross by jumping and shooting, as the game's effective title suggests. The mechanics and the control system are very simple to assimilate: the protagonist moves forward independently while the user must touch the left side of the display to make it jump and instead the right side to shoot with the supplied weapon. The rest is pure platform academy, however declined according to the standards imposed by the mobile market: the stages are therefore very short and can be completed in a matter of seconds, but this does not mean that Jump 'n' Shoot Attack is a health walk, On the contrary. In fact, the spot-on level design does its best to juxtapose jumps that require pinpoint precision, strategically placed obstacles and enemies with deliberately annoying movement patterns: all elements that, combined with the frantic speed of the game action, require the user strong timing skills and also a certain predisposition for patience to tolerate all the deaths that will inevitably be encountered. Fortunately, FreakZone Games has been able to stop one step before the border that separates a challenging gaming experience from a frustrating one, and in addition to distributing extra lives with the right dosage, it has also made it possible to start over from the world in which we are after game over stopped and not quite from the beginning of the adventure. Jump 'n' Shoot Attack is an exhilarating hardcore experience that doesn't last too long Still in honor of old school platformers, contact with an adverse element is enough for Louise to finish KO and be forced to start over from the beginning of the level, but even the studied placement of bonuses has a flavor that will be decidedly familiar to older players date. In fact, each stage presents three diamonds to collect (which reward the user capable of collecting them all with an extra life) and as many upgrades for the protagonist's weapon: the beauty is that these are often and willingly positioned in particularly dangerous points, forcing the player to take risks to obtain the desired benefits. The presence of bonuses is also the only (thin) expedient devised by the developers to lengthen the very short life of the adventure: completing the game can take even less than an hour for the most experienced players, who would only have to run up to the best score and a handful of achievements to unlock as incentives to backtrack. It is not excluded that FreakZone Games could add new worlds in the future with a free update, but for now there is no doubt that Jump 'n' Shoot Attack offers too little for a product sold in this price range on the mobile market. For all those willing to turn a blind eye to this lack, however, the game is capable of giving more than a few satisfactions, and not only for the quality of its gameplay: in addition to a tastefully retro graphics that repeatedly recalls that of the first Mega Indeed, Man, Jump 'n' Shoot Attack features a soundtrack that is sure to hit the heart of the nostalgic with its captivating chiptune music.", "date": "2015-04-10", "grade": "7.5"}
