{"name": "Moto GP", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moto-gp_c.html", "text": "The fast flowing scenery! For those who haven't figured it out yet (but I think no one), ~Moto GP~ is a video game that deals with competitions aboard two-wheeled racing cars. Your goal is one and always the same: to win! Crossing the finish line first means not only fame, personal joy or proud satisfaction, but also new tracks, new drivers and so on, up to the maximum enrichment possible and imaginable in such a game (that is, don't expect naked women or stuff like that). The most striking thing about this cartridge is undoubtedly its well-made technical realization. In fact, taking a look at the game, it seems to be in front of a videogame on the Psone! Power of 32 bits. The asphalt runs off like a marvel; the motorbikes as well as the animations of the riders are very accurate and, dulcis in fundo, the sensation of speed gives adrenaline-pumping emotions being reproduced very faithfully. That's right. Forget the games where the odometer shows a speed while in reality you run like snails (I think you get the idea). The color palette is excellent and does its job well, just as the rider's head looks around to make sure he's not being followed in the slipstream. Really realistic! Even the video update is worthy of attention and does not miss out on any phase of the race, even in the most crowded situations. The only criticisms to be raised from a graphic point of view concern only the poverty of the backdrops and the framing. The former, in fact, are nothing short of meager, not so much in variety but in the quantity of details (barely reduced perhaps to gain fluidity). While the view suffers from some angle problems in following the race from the shoulders of your virtual Max Biaggi. Because of this, the camera remains fixed at the center of the track at all times even if the motorcycle controlled by the player ranges to the edges of it. These, mind you, are not major technical problems that heavily affect the technical quality of the product. In fact, from this point of view, the THQ title defends itself very well and represents (at least on a cosmetic level) one of the best products in circulation on the GBA. Unfortunately, everything has its downsides, and this ~Moto GP~ is no exception, on the contrary... A new Hang On? As in any self-respecting serious world championship game, here too we find all the real racing cars with their respective riders who fight each other on the track to the sound of the accelerator and mufflers. One thing you may like (the ~can~ is no coincidence) about ~MGP~ is undoubtedly the way it lets you play, or rather the simplicity of the controls and their intuitiveness. Just like in the games of the past (Sega's ~Hang On~ style). From the first game it is possible to try your hand at good racing performances. I wrote earlier that the gameplay CAN be liked precisely because someone might not like it. In fact, not everyone now wants old-school games in which the arcade setting reigns supreme. Some gamers prefer a greater depth of action and greater possibilities for customizing some in-game parameters. Elements that, in fact, are missing from the THQ product. Proof of this are only two keys used, namely A and B (respectively accelerator and brake); in addition of course to the directional cross necessary to face the curves and to wheelie the bike to give it an extra jolt of adrenaline (after filling the bar at the bottom left of the screen). Easier than that! One aspect that has left me embittered is the absence of the ability to set the automatic or manual gearbox. Throughout the game you will have to face the various competitions without being able to change the engine ratios, an operation left in the ~expert little hands~ of the CPU. Really inexplicable. Another sore point is the game saving system. This does not directly exploit the internal RAM of the software but rather the ~passwords~ that are assigned by the computer at certain times (e.g. end of the championship, end of the race). This seems ridiculous when you consider that often game sessions lasting about twenty minutes are spent before you can save the game. And this, for a laptop, weighs a lot. Another note is moved against the difficulty in tackling the curves, set on the ~5-year-old~ level. In fact, a very simple game of braking and acceleration is enough to get out unscathed and at very high speeds even from the most difficult hairpin bends. But this is not meant to be too significant a criticism. After all, you couldn't expect more from an arcade game. Let's leave aside real collisions, pit stops etc. However adespite these small defects in terms of playability, ~MGP~ plays very well and, above all, a lot of fun for any gamer. Let alone the fans of two wheels! I choose V. Rossi If you want to complete the game in single player, the longevity of the product is not the best. This means that in the long run everything becomes a bit repetitive. It is true that to overcome this inconvenience there are different methods (such as World Championship and Tournament), but it is also true that in the end you always do the same thing and moreover with a bike that remains as it is. for the duration of the virtual seasons. In addition to the aforementioned we find the now well-known Quick Race mode and the classic time trial. Yes, the World Championship will keep you busy for a few days but, once completed, you will hardly put the THQ cartridge back into mother Nintendo's jewel. Fortunately, the situation changes radically if you find yourself competing with other friends (whom I will call ~GBA friends~ for the occasion). In this case, longevity starts skyrocketing and the competitions will be on fire like never before. The only clarification is that each player must necessarily have their own copy of the game to take advantage of the multiplayer mode. A bit difficult situation, you know. The number of drivers (about fifteen) and the number of tracks (sixteen) only partially manages to increase the variety of the product which therefore falls somewhere in the middle in terms of longevity. The audio sector of the game stands at mediocre levels. If on the one hand the racing of the bikes is accompanied by quite nice sound effects, on the other hand the music of the menus and those that are heard during the race (which cannot be eliminated) offer little in terms of quality. In conclusion, this ~Moto GP~ by THQ represents a good title, very nice to look at as well as playable, which will be able to give several hours of avid entertainment to fans of two wheels and not. A title that is very reminiscent, in the structure, of the legendary ~Hang On~ by Sega. Aesthetically beautiful and arcade to the bone. If you want a good bike game this is for you. While if you prefer a more simulative, varied, deep and thicker title, go elsewhere for your friend Mr. EUR~. Pros: Nice to look at Simple and fun Cons: Maybe too arcadey Absurd save system The smell of asphalt As many will have already understood, the title in question follows in the footsteps of the motoring trend that has made its way into the hearts of half-owners of Playsation 2. THQ is not idling by trying to repeat its success even on the small Nintendo portable. Developed by Visual Impact Productions, Moto GP immediately catches the eye for its particular technical realization which stands at excellent levels. Precisely thanks to this, the product immediately manages to capture the attention of the player. Very nice, needless to say. A title that is beautiful to look at but soulless?
