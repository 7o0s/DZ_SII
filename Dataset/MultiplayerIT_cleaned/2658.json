It is an arcade game with multiplayer and single player modes with an automotive theme: in each game you go down to an area and try to tear your opponents to pieces. What are the peculiarities of the game? What are the long-range potential? Find out in our Destruction AllStars review! A driver for every need The Destruction AllStars that gives the PS5 game its name is a worldwide competition in which a group of pilots battle it out for glory and show. Precisely, we will have 16 ~heroes~ waiting to take the field: each of them has its own past, told in a few lines, and above all has its own style. So let's start by congratulating the developers, Liquid Games, for the work done with the visual characterization of the pilots: each of them is unique not only in terms of the costume, but also in terms of animations. Both through the selection menu and in the use in the arenas, we can understand if we are dealing with a playful person, a very serious one, someone shy, insecure or, on the contrary, vain. There is also a conscious work of diversification and inclusiveness that never hurts. Obviously it also matters that the pilots are unique in terms of gameplay. Each character has an ability and a personal vehicle, which in turn has a dedicated ability. We have characters capable of activating frontal shields, there are those who become invisible, those who activate destructive blades, those who inflict an extra blow on each impact, those who disturb the view of opponents with smoke. The sixteen characters are all very different. However, the impact of skills varies between modes. Multiplayer modes Basically Destruction AllStars is a game designed for multiplayer: so let's start from this. Online multiplayer offers four modes. The first is Mayehm: it's a free-for-all where all you have to do is hit and destroy to accumulate points before time runs out. The arenas also feature traps, from simple stakes that rise and fall to giant spinning blades that take us out in one fell swoop. Then we have Gridfall, a free-for-all survival contest in which we have only one life: the terrain of the arena, circular and of limited size, is divided into boxes that disappear, leaving chasms; to fall obviously means to die. Of all of them, we found it the most interesting mode: the tension is growing during the match, the difficulty rises and the clashes with opponents must be calibrated more carefully as they could lead us to defeat together with our enemies. Furthermore, in the last seconds of the match, a cat-and-mouse contest often begins between the last two/three players, with the roles being reversed every few seconds as soon as one manages to obtain a more advantageous position to start a ram and push in a hole in the opponent. Carnado, on the other hand, is a variant of Mayehm in teams (8 vs 8): with each hit inflicted on a car of the opposing team, a bar divided into segments fills up; each completed segment has a value, to turn that value into real points you must launch yourself into a tornado in the center of the arena, destroying your car. The first two segments have low value, the last two instead much higher, so it is convenient to accumulate as much as possible before transforming them into points, but in this case there is the risk that our car will be destroyed by the opponents, thus making us all lose the points. An interesting balance between risk and gain is therefore created as getting destroyed seriously undermines one's success, unlike Mayhem. Finally, we have Stockpile: also in this case it is an 8 vs 8 in the King of the Hill style in which, however, only the destruction of the opponents counts. As soon as half an enemy is eliminated, a series of gears appear on the ground: to collect them it is necessary to get out of the car and approach on foot, and then deposit these gears in three specific points of the arena, called ~Banks~. By depositing gears, we conquer Banks or steal them from our opponents: when the game ends, whoever owns at least two Banks wins. So it doesn't matter if one team dominated the other throughout the match: a final backlash can be enough to reverse the situation. Of the four, it's the only mode that would really require some coordination between the players, clearly not possible when playing with strangers. However, the modes, especially the team ones, currently have a problem: matchmaking struggles to creare complete teams and, in case of disconnections (even pre-match start), the missing players are not replaced by bots. For example, 7 vs 3 clashes are created, with great imbalances. It must also be considered that the arenas are designed exactly for 16 players and decreasing the number means significantly lowering the pace of play since, trivially, there are few targets to aim at and it becomes more difficult to have someone within reach to shoot down. Let's hope Lucid improves the situation soon. Gameplay and match: wheels and feet Controller in hand, however, how do matches and game gameplay really work? Destruction AllStars starts from a rather original idea: you don't start directly in the car, but you start with your character on foot at the edge of the arena. As soon as you enter you have to run towards one of the various cars parked nearby to start driving: obviously the opponents will do the same and could anticipate us. Remaining on foot, however, is not a defeat. Our hero is in fact much more agile than you might expect: he is able to jump, dodge and grab the opposing cars to start a 1 vs 1 QTE (if we win, we can steal or destroy the vehicle, if the pilot wins, shakes us off). Furthermore, the characters know how to climb and run on walls in parkour style: there are in fact a series of platforms on which to juggle and where to find floating crystals that charge two bars. The first is used to activate the ~biped~ power and one to summon our special car (which cannot be stolen). The generic means with which we start are various: some are faster, others have more health, others are small and therefore more difficult to hit. All cars have two cooldown moves: a front dash, perfect for ramming and smashing, and a lateral dodge that does little damage but is used to avoid enemy shots. The latter is in our opinion of little use, given that the displacement is minimal. Both also have a bit too high recharge times: Destruction AllStars would become more dynamic if the two moves were usable more often. The fulcrum of Destruction AllStars is to continue to enter and exit the various vehicles scattered around the arena (new ones arrive regularly) to avoid granting the opponents a ~Demolition~: as soon as we suffer too much damage, it is better to abandon and start running to the arena on foot. It's an interesting idea and in our opinion it works well, but for the moment the modes are all a bit too similar to each other. Each mode then has various arenas, but even these are all very similar. Furthermore, we often find ourselves running around in circles without being able to engage in many fights: the arenas are large and, if most players play defensively, half the match is spent in a solitary circle. When it works, though, it's visually and sensorially satisfying to tear apart and be torn apart, amid flying wreckage, impacts, and spins. While not the game that will define the next-gen standard, Destruction AllStars is technically solid and with rock-solid frame-rates. The DualSense is also well exploited: when accelerating from a standstill or braking while running, we can feel the resistance in the triggers; if the car is low on hit points, R2 shakes wildly. The clashes are perceived on the hands and even just navigating the active menu of the taps inside the DualSense. The PS5 controller therefore once again proves to be an excellent tool for enhancing the game sensations created in the past ~only~ by graphics and sound. Let's also talk briefly about the audio, however: the soundtrack does its job, remaining in the background and accompanying the game action, and the commentary (also available in Italian) helps us by signaling the quality of the impact (also indicated with a screen notification) and above all it reminds us that we have loaded the character's abilities or that we have the possibility to summon our special vehicle. Finally, we point out that there are no Game Help functions (also because the trophies are all easy to understand) and that the game tabs allow you to directly enter the matchmaking of one of the races, without going through the menus (with a time saving of a few seconds , actually). Game as a service Destruction AllStars is structured in a similar way to many other modern game as a service. Online clashes give us experience points and as we level up we are rewarded with AllStars Coins, useful for buying cosmetic items. We then have a second currency, the Destruction Points which are used to buy the most beautiful cosmetics and to access the Challenge Series: these are single player challenges against the AI divided into seven matches (some are online modes).you against bots, others are one-off missions such as timed races and object destruction in arenas without enemies). The first Challenge Series is free, while the others are paid, namely 200 DP and 400 DP. The DPs must be purchased with real money with a ratio of 500 DP - 4.99 euros. The Challenge Series gives a little (very little) context about the characters in the game and why they are participating in this competition. Most importantly, each Challenge Series gives up to 7 cosmetics (skins, banners and avatars for the user profile), some of which are ~locked~ behind special objectives (win a match with certain points ahead, destroy enemies with the unique ability of the character, etc.). Furthermore, the 400 DP Challenge Series is timed: in mid-February it will no longer be available; a choice we do not appreciate. The underlying truth, however, is that cosmetics are of little value. These are not real skins that replace the original design, just a color change. However, assuming that you want to get them, know that the basic ones cost 8,250 AC: each level increase gives 1,000 AC and to level up you need from eight to three matches, depending on your abilities. Of course, every few levels the amount of XP required increases. Cutting it short and coming to the end of the count we have done: to get all the currently available cosmetics (and not including those that require both AC and DP) will take the average player a couple of hundred hours. ACs cannot be purchased for real money, mind you. Finally, there are classic daily missions (~Play 5 games with this character~, ~Win with that other character~) and weekly (~Wall-run 120 times~, ~Ride opponent's cars 50 times~, ...). They award 3,000 and 5,000 experience points respectively, insignificant values given that a Gridfall match in which you lose within 60 seconds awards between 3,000 and 4,000 XP. The current problem is that Destruction AllStars doesn't seem ready to sustain audiences in the long run. It will need new modes or even just timed modifiers, more interesting challenges and better rewards. Paid packages also don't have anything really exclusive to justify regular spending. Lucid Games promises news, sure, but hasn't announced an official roadmap yet.", "date": "2021-02-05", "grade": "7.0"}
