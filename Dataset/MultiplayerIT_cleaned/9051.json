One fine day, the two find curious files in the attic which are nothing more than the directives for a puzzle game designed by one of their ancestor in 1888: once the genius of the project has been realized, the Pickford brothers just have to convert everything into a app for iOS, titled Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint... The hypnotism of magnetism With the exception of the first part concerning the history of the developers, this bizarre story constitutes the true background of the product we are going to analyse, extremely interesting beyond the evident imagination of whoever created it. The gameplay is freely inspired by billiards, in the sense that you have to hit balls with a cue (conveniently replaced here by the user's finger on the touchscreen) within a rectangular game plane: the analogies with pool stop here, however, since everything else is a total reversal of the classic rules. First of all, there are no holes, but the balls must be removed from the table by joining all those of the same color, hence the ~magnetic~ meaning in the app title. However, the Pickford brothers have made everything much more interesting with other ingenious tricks: therefore the best scores are not obtained by clearing the screen with as few moves as possible, but on the contrary by making the most of banks, rebounds and crawls between spheres of different colors, all elements that activate multipliers, combos and so on. Basically, playing Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint you have to try to drag it out, the only real way to aspire to hi-scores. A useful goal not only for one's ego, but indispensable for unlocking new tables, given that the evaluation obtained at the end of an internship allows you to fill in a special icon in the shape of a key. By planning a few games necessary to assimilate the not very immediate play mechanics well, it takes very little to get dangerously passionate about the Zee-3 title, finding yourself repeating the same stage several times to get the coveted maximum score. And if it's true that appetite comes with eating, then all those who appreciate the main mode of Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint will not hesitate to purchase the tasty add-ons. At the time of writing the article, the application is in fact free and allows access to the first twenty game tables: subsequently, the user can choose whether to spend 2.99 Euros to unlock a package containing as many levels, three modes extras and the free right to all future updates, or buy the individual elements that interest them at a lower price. Since these are not large amounts, our advice is to opt for the first option, if only for the high challenge rate guaranteed by the advanced stages, while the secondary sections (called Relentless, Sardines and Countdown) constitute pleasant variations on the theme and little more. A winner in terms of gameplay, Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint also deserves applause for the originality of the graphics: in line with the bizarre premises of the product, the game screen is displayed just as if it were a hand-drawn prototype on paper blue. The extreme functionality of this solution is accompanied by pleasant explosions of color and special effects that underline particularly successful moves or the conclusion of the level, all while deliberately artificial voices mark the user's progress and the Pickford brothers themselves peep out from time to time. just to compliment...
