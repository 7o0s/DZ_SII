{"name": "Winning Eleven 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winning-eleven-6_a.html", "text": "But let's start from the Greek Calends..The introduction is not exceptional, graphically speaking, if it weren't for the splendid sound accompaniment offered by the masterful voice of Freddy Mercury who, with his ~We Are The Champions~, makes it at the same time epic, powerful and exciting. Immediately afterwards we are offered the advertising of the latest ball created by ADIDAS, the FEVERNOVA (which by the way is also the ball of the bitter World Cup) and this also makes us understand why the best textures are precisely those of the aforementioned sphere ..At this point, arrived at the initial screen, the problems begin, or almost: it's all written in jappo and only fans of the series will be able to comfortably juggle the various menus that have remained almost the same as in PES. However, just go a little trial and error to be able to do practically everything without problems. For the less ~willing~ here is a small translation of the items (from top to bottom): Single Game, League, Cup, Master League, Training, Edit, Options. As already mentioned above, the options are almost the same as in past titles (PES in the lead), with some decidedly welcome innovations. Let's start with the training part. The addition of a points mode in which you have to try your hand at a series of tests such as: Dribbling, Bull Bull, Throwing, Free Kicks, 360 Passing and Ball Possession, with finally a test that includes them all in sequence, is great. Achieving a score above 1000 will unlock secret players (such as Valderrama or Savicevic) and believe me, some tests are really tough! Another novelty is the one present in the Master League which, however, I think is halfway right. In fact, now the game has in itself a real transfer market, with transfers, loans, contract terminations, but on the other hand salaries to pay and often very high salaries and above all in the extreme mode where having strong players is more a necessity than a luxury. and therefore it is practically impossible to keep the balance positive if you don't always win (which is equally impossible ... at least the first few games). Very interesting in this case is the presence of youth players who cost very little and can be improved a lot, after being included in the starting squad; in fact, at the beginning, our budding footballer will be a real duffer, but, by making him perform effective and useful moves such as assists or 1-2, it will be possible to add points to his skills later, perhaps managing to make him stronger of Maradona or Pele. Another noteworthy addition is the one that allows you to change the flag, the name and the uniform of a team in a total way; you can also access the official colors as well as the initials! In the match settings it is now possible to choose the degree of rotation of the camera which, at its maximum, makes it equal to that of the old WE3 Final Version for PSX. Finally, you can choose how much artificial intelligence can intervene in assigning the player closest to the ball from a range of ten studs, ranging from total freedom to the choice imposed by the Emotion Engine. Moving on to the aspect that most fans of the series surely presses, i.e. playability, I can only say and reiterate once again that we are in the presence of the current undisputed king of football simulations, even if not free from some flaws here and there, but on the other hand, if they weren't there, how could a perfect product be improved!? The thing that bothers me the most is that, as in the previous episodes, when the computer has decided that a player has to run to one side, nothing can be done to stop him, or else instead of running at full speed he goes like a snail . Then there is the aspect concerning the players who freeze in the penalty area which, although not very frequent, are quite irritating. A small note only for the excessive dimensions of the radar which in the mode with the farthest camera tends to cover the lower part of the field with relative disappearances of players and general confusion. Last, but not least, is the absence of the 16:9 selector and any screen adjustment that would certainly be very welcome in the western transposition. To be honest, we must mention the presence of occasional slowdowns especially in the case of a distant camera but I suppose that the use of the HDD eliminates them completely. Returning to the gameplay, one cannot fail to praise the simplicity with which it is possible to create dense and spectacular patterns of passes, as well as shots and actions of all kinds, almost as if it were a real football match. Describesre the feeling and the emotions you feel driving your virtual alter ego is very difficult but I can only tell you that this is the most realistic thing the market can offer today. The range of animations has been expanded, now much more fluid, which obviously makes everything more realistic. The ~touch~ of the ball is wonderful and not least the new feint that can be achieved with the combo R2 + arrow key near an opponent. The goalkeepers carry out their work admirably without appearing to be crooks or supermen and give discreet security. Finally eliminated the bug that made the GK come out slightly shifted compared to the opponent's trajectory. Up close the polygonal models are quite similar to real players but obviously the further away the view is, the more players tend to look alike. The stadiums and the grass drawings made by the ~skilled gardeners~ of KCET are very beautiful. The old Renderware was still used as a development platform, but if these are the results well done for the next versions too. Unmissable, fortunately, the voice of the legendary John Kabira, who with his ^Shooto^ raised and weaned an entire generation of people. Excellent graphics, high playability, completeness of options, J.Kabira as commentator.. what are you waiting for, run immediately to buy a Jappo console bundled with the game because whatever the release date of the PAL version is, you can't wait any longer! I had a social life, then Winning Eleven 6 arrived.. Pros: Playability Longevity Realization John Kabira Graphics Cons: Radar ~Freeze~ (but will you say?!) of players Occasional slowdowns Once again KCET has hit the mark. Once again it has succeeded in the arduous task of improving a game that is almost perfect in itself. I say almost because after days and days spent with friends doing challenges after challenges, you realize all the little nuances that would make an excellent title a real masterpiece, but programmers are not always able to create a superior product with sequels. previous year, and those who experience the world videogame scene with sufficient diligence know that those numbers (like ~Pinco Pallino 6~) next to the previous year's title don't always indicate a true evolution of the game. This time, unlike in the past, the first impression wasn't at all unsettling, on the contrary, I must say that the work done by the Tokyo group was more than ever aimed at improving the gameplay of WE5 rather than distorting it. When I played WE5 for the first time I was very disappointed by the physics of the players, but now I can't help but bow down to the new command response that simplifies and streamlines the cumbersomeness of PES (Pro Evolution Soccer) players quite a bit.", "date": "2002-07-24", "grade": null}
