Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay a cent. It simply accelerates and decelerates. When your car stays in its lane with just a plastic ~blade~ and a pair of copper brushes making contact with the metal of the circuit, it's clear that it's all about speed. The speed with which you go down a straight in the shortest possible time, the speed with which you enter a corner and the speed with which you exit... if you exit. Dosing the accelerator when you grapple with an electric track is essential, but it's only part of the fun. In fact, before the action there is planning, the one that leads you to put together straight pieces, curves and rises, perhaps taken from different packs but generally compatible, to create a memorable circuit, to be tackled over and over again to memorize every feature and on which to challenge friends. Reasoning that most of us did something like twenty years ago, and which also serve as the basis for the experience of SlotZ Racer 2 HD, which is precisely a simulation of an electric track. Our goal within single races, championships and multiplayer challenges (for up to four players, but only locally via split-screen - obviously best enjoyed only on iPad) is therefore to act on the accelerator , releasing it when the speed is too high and we risk skidding, pressing it all the way down if instead we are going along a straight line and perhaps the curve at the end is one of the raised ones, which can be tackled at full speed. Mother of customization The first impact with SlotZ Racer 2 HD may not be the best, to put it mildly. The starting settings are in fact designed for those who are already familiar with the series, while those who try their hand at the game for the first time will only leave the track, while the other cars in the race will detach it for a long time before cutting the finish line with a wide margin of advantage. It is therefore very important to access the options screen and discover, once there, that practically every single aspect of the experience can be modified to meet our needs. Not only can the speed of the action be decreased in percentage, but it is also possible to increase the grip of our car, select the degree of intelligence of the other drivers and their aptitude for making mistakes, and so on. After some experiments we will find the best compromise and we will finally be able to dedicate ourselves to the races, gradually bringing to light a much deeper gameplay than it appeared at first. The single player offer and the nice multiplayer mode via split-screen, which we have already mentioned, is also accompanied by a powerful track editor that allows us to create the track of our dreams. The use of this tool is quite intuitive, even if the interface is not always very clear: it is possible to lay out straights, curves and rises, determine the height of the track on four levels and also adjust the inclination to fine-tune those sections fast that cannot be missing in a self-respecting circuit. Too bad for the technical sector, which beyond the speed and fluidity of the action proves to be modest.", "date": "2013-02-16", "grade": "7.0"}
