{"name": "Tom Clancy's EndWar - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-endwar-recensione_a.html", "text": "As explained in the exhaustive review of the Xbox 360 version, EndWar brings a breath of fresh air to the RTS genre, providing the interesting possibility of commanding your troops through intuitive voice commands: the main orders, such as attack, movement and conquest , can be imparted by simply speaking into your microphone and the units will promptly perform the task you assign. It is, without a doubt, something never tried before in any strategy game and which, finally, brings some relevant innovation to a genre which, for various reasons, has become fossilized on certain mechanics that are now several years old: it is useless to hide from you therefore that, through this system based on vocal orders, you will inevitably be involved in the action to a much greater degree than in many other titles belonging to the genre. The Ubisoft Shanghai team has done an excellent job to say the least in creating a truly flawless voice recognition component and very rarely will you find yourself giving the same order twice, due to a lack of understanding by the software: after a short tutorial and a few minutes of playing you will have fully understood the new game mechanics and will be able to master them without any problem. The laurels But the developers sat on their laurels too soon: the idea that after a few hours of intense gameplay one has is that Ubisoft racked their brains for months to look for something that would make EndWar innovative and then, once found, has relied on the usual RTS canons, not risking some other innovation. Once the excitement of the moment of being able to issue orders through one's voice has therefore passed, the negative aspects gradually begin to emerge which, in the long run, greatly overwhelm the only real strength of this title; starting, for example, from the impossibility of making clashes with many units on the screen. Managing troops with voice obviously means having to pay continuous attention to what is happening on the battlefield, constantly making small adjustments that, normally, could be done with a simple and quick click of the mouse, now requires you to pronounce the default command in full: which is why, to allow the player to keep everything under control, the developers preferred to limit the number of units involved in the clashes, making them lose the feeling of actually being in a clash of global reach, as could instead happen in titles such as World in Conflict. If, however, the number of units involved is a marginal defect, the boredom that after a few hours of play begins to emerge is much more serious: also counting on a small unit park at your disposal, EndWar falls into the evergreen pattern of the Chinese morra , with the helicopters defeating the tanks, which defeat the mechanized infantry, who in turn shoot down the helicopters with ease. In the long run you will understand that the best way to tackle any single mission (or any multiplayer game) is to have as heterogeneous an army as possible and, when your opponent sets you up against a certain unit, all you have to do is respond with its direct antagonist. A small diamond? As you continue in the game, the excitement of commanding your troops will diminish, leaving the substantial defects of this title increasingly on display: the so-called weapons of mass destruction (basically one-off superweapons) can be of little use ), since they can indeed turn the tide of a clash, but they are not even that indispensable. If you add to this an artificial intelligence which, despite being average, will certainly not represent an obstacle for a slightly accustomed player to the genre, you will understand that you find yourself in your hands what is, to all intents and purposes, a small diamond in the rough. The simplicity of the single player campaign, among other things built around a plot not even up to the height of the famous writer, significantly penalizes the single player experience, making the final evaluation of the title rest on the multiplayer component: the latter it is certainly the most successful, solving the problem of the deficient AI, but it still cannot hold a candle to old-fashioned strategists, but decidedly more profound at a tactical and management level. Apart from that, the build sent to us by Ubisoft for review was affected by some problems, such as the inability to start a single-player skirmish match and sudden, unjustified returns to the desktop: nothing unsolvable, but all this contribow to give the impression of a conversion launched too much, too soon, and then relying on the widespread practice of leaving the task of polishing the title to the patches. Comment The metaphor of the rough diamond fits this EndWar perfectly: the developers dared to move away slightly from the usual sowing imposed by the RTS for years, but then quickly return to it and resume the classic schemes that have been seen for years, sometimes even impoverished from a tactical point of view. Therefore, beautiful graphics and an interesting idea are not enough to transform a game into a masterpiece: EndWar, after all, is penalized due to its almost non-existent tactical depth, its decidedly subdued plot and a general simplicity, even higher difficulty levels.
