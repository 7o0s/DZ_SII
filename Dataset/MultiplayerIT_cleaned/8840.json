So here comes this Batman: Arkham City Lockdown which, not being able to replicate the mechanics of the original, focuses only on bare-handed combat, borrowing some gameplay mechanics from Infinity Blade and the taste for a sumptuous visual impact. The city of blows Although it was developed by the NetherRealm Studios themselves, authors of the latest Mortal Kombat, Batman: Arkham City Lockdown is not a real fighting game, but rather a reinterpretation of the Infinity Blade mechanics applied to the Batman universe masterfully recreated by Rocksteady with the two titles in the series. In this case, however, the exploration components of the Chair product are completely missing, and also the storyline is a rather unjustified absence: the game simply resolves itself in a sequence of stages in which Batman finds himself facing a certain number of enemies in succession , with the simple aim of punching the henchmen first and then a boss in the face. An idea that - however slender - could still have easily held up an iOS title, but which in this case has to deal with a far from exciting implementation. To get the better of the opponents, the user is asked to perform a series of movements on the touchscreen that correspond to as many moves of the bat man: a touch on any part of the screen to dodge, a touch on the appropriate indicators to make a counterattack, a swipe down to parry and a series of side swipes to start a combo. Familiarity with Infinity Blade in terms of control system is evident, but the parallelism unfortunately cannot be extended to the overall quality of the gameplay: Batman: Arkham City Lockdown is in fact a decidedly repetitive action, penalized above all by largely harmless enemies, by a too limited set of shots and by a character progression feeling really thin. In short, all the playful elements that have contributed to the success of the Chair product are hidden in the work of NetherRealm Studios, to the inevitable detriment of the enjoyment of the experience. With the exception of the bosses that require a minimum of extra effort, the opponents can be liquidated easily (and several yawns) without even making efforts in dodging, parrying and counterattacking, but simply continuing to throw punches and kicks repeatedly. The presence of various gadgets that can be activated with a touch - including a first aid kit that restores most of the vital energy - then makes the risk of a game over impossible, at least at the standard difficulty level. Again, the upgrades that can be purchased by leveling up produce almost always impalpable changes in Batman's performance, further flattening an already very elementary game structure. An unreal Batman It is a pity that Batman: Arkham City Lockdown offers so little from a gameplay point of view seeing the care placed by the developers on the technical aspect and on the side elements. Let's start from the graphic design, the only true flagship of the NetherRealm Studios product and yet another demonstration of the Unreal Engine's strength on iOS. The game amazes in particular for the goodness of the polygonal models, all of very generous dimensions, defined in every detail and animated with skill: the backdrops, even if not as spectacular, do their duty in a more than excellent way thanks above all to the excellent definition of the textures and a wise use of colors, offering a glance is certainly among the best found on the iPhone and iPad, although Infinity Blade remains a couple of heads above. The sound is good as regards effects and the few lines of dialogue (in English), while the fact that the music is borrowed directly from Arkham City can only please. Even the front of the extras has been treated with kid gloves, and in the appropriate section accessible from the main menu you can view the biographies of the characters, download wallpapers and even read a couple of comics connected directly to the story told by the original game. There is also the possibility of buying - with real money, of course- alternative costumes for Batman, but the already rather high price of the application combined with the scarcity of contents of the playful offer, make this feature something extremely superfluous, destined exclusively to the most ardent fans of the bat man.
