On the other hand, the project starts from solid foundations and from a design that demonstrates a certain seriousness, starting from the names involved: Masato Kato for writing the story and Yasunori Mitsuda for composing the musical accompaniment. These are people who have worked in prominent roles on games such as Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy XI, to name a few, which are enough to make us understand how Another Eden's starting points are at least solid , as far as sticking to JRPG lore is concerned. And this emerges very clearly in all elements of the game, both in its positive aspects and in the negative effects of the rigorous proximity to the canon, which necessarily involves some derivative characteristics and a lot of clichs applied to the construction of story and characters. However, there is very little to complain about the structural solidity of the game, which seems to all intents and purposes a real JRPG created from scratch for mobile platforms, as one might expect from productions with a purely ~neoclassical~ taste such as those by Tokyo RPG Factory. In short, the story is rather trivial, but this falls within the rules of the game: the young and heroic Aldo, whose origins will be defined during the adventure, sets off to save his sister Feinne from the clutches of the Beast King, but as always initial is just the pretext to set in motion the usual training journey which then reveals further recondite aspects, including twists and further insights into the characters and events involving the fate of the whole world. All inclusive also of sudden changes in time and a cat capable of compressing space / time, or something like that. Nothing shocking but everything is extremely accurate, well written and composed, as befits a Japanese role-playing game built according to the classic criteria and not as a money-eating machine, even if some negative aspects of the gacha sector still emerge in the distance. A special mention should also be made for the graphics, which make use of a beautiful style drawn in 2D by the mangaka and illustrator Takahito Exa able to integrate very well with the particular style used for the scenarios, building settings that look like theatrical wings and recall in some respects, given the essentially two-dimensional scrolling setting, the style of Valkyrie Profile or the productions of VanillaWare. Another Eden is quite a sight to behold on smartphone screens, even managing to stand out with some originality from the flood of mobile RPGs on the market. The soundtrack is also excellent, which completes the picture of a truly high-profile audio-visual experience, further underlined by the enormous storage space required on the smartphone, which reaches almost 4GB. A classic JRPG with modern elements Already the fact that the home screen is not a hell of menus, banners and sub-menus, with pop-ups and advertisements appearing everywhere, makes us understand how Another Eden wants to end up in areas quite different from mobile RPGs for how these have come to be configured in recent years, simply recovering the spirit of the high caliber single player game of a while ago, ~console~, one could say. In fact, the style is fully the classic one of the JRPG: the reflective moments within villages and cities stand out quite clearly, with dialogues and the opening of new quests, and the exploration and combat phases within the missions, in more or less open ~dungeons~, characterized by a rather free movement even through different crossroads and roads. The combat system is obviously turn-based and this also draws heavily from the historical tradition of the genre, with the possibility of different types of attack to be performed with the various party characters and each one's various fighting styles. The group of fighters is made up of 4 front-line characters and two substitutes who can be called into the field in problematic moments, while loading the appropriate bar it is possible to launch the Another Force attack which mixes the powers of everyone present in the party . Character management is where micro-transactions come into play, of course, both in terms of character progression and party expansion throughthe classic gacha dynamic. There is a certain honesty in the use of these systems, which confirms how the gacha is substantially an added element to the structure of the game, rather than its founding pillar, while the wild grinding that is required to maximize the power of the various characters can return to an almost normal dynamic for a JRPG, although it is clearly designed to push the use of some shortcuts through in-app purchases. The biggest problem, in this sense, seems to be the rather low drop rate that characterizes the summoning of high-level characters: considering that the medium-low ones are essentially useless and have little use, the excessive rarity of the characters actually valid it becomes a problem. However, it is not something that affects the standard progression within the story that much, also because through this the characters essential to move forward are still unlocked, even if collectors will probably want to aim for the discovery of all the fighters with their respective in-depth quests.", "date": "2020-04-23", "grade": "8.5"}
