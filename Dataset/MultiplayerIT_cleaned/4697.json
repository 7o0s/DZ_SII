We're not just talking about one of the most important survival experiments of recent years, but also about the first exponent of the genre to come out (albeit a year late) from its Early Access version and embrace a launch on the shelves, on three consoles and with lots of of Collector's Edition. You understand well how judging ARK means judging years of work on a business model that has established itself on the market, with the disdain of a large portion of players and insiders. What can be said with confidence is that today it is an extremely enjoyable and ~complete~ game in its sandbox nature. On the contrary, not everything is as it should from a technical and optimization point of view, with all due respect to what on paper should be the foundations of a title at its definitive release. It could be argued that, in the current state of the market, there are few even well-optimized great games, but ARK: Survival Evolved is representative of a movement, and as such should present itself at its best. It's judgment time, so let's go! The Ark of no one knows who Point 0. You wake up on an island inhabited by creatures that come from a distant time, too distant to be part of it. On the wrist, an object, like a graft, which eerily recalls those large columns that you see scattered throughout the moor before your eyes. Where am I? What is my purpose now? When you decide to jump into the fray of modern survival titles, you don't even have the problem of what you're going to experience from a narrative point of view. ARK: Survival Evolved has always reversed this trend, only to leave everyone in suspense about the nature of the ~arks~ themselves. Over the months, more and more content, documents scattered in the depths of the map and details deriving from some dungeons, have hinted that Studio Wildcard would have answered this question and, absurd as it may seem to you, it has also done it well. The ~mission~ (if we want to call it that), finally reaches its goal and we have an answer, left to the interpretation but in the same way quite clear, of what happened to our world. We're not going to spoil the only truly narrative element the title has to offer, but know that, despite all you might have believed, ARK will even be able to give you a cinematic, however very brief. Yours will be a long mission, which will require hundreds of hours (if played on non-speeded up official servers) and which will go through the search for a long series of artifacts and bosses to defeat; up to your final goal. With the addition of a real end game, consisting of an amazing last dungeon, and a rather scenic final battle, we will all be able to have our answer, one of which, linked to the supply crates falling from the sky, very nice and choreography. The pickaxe and the hatchet For those who still don't know the basics of a survival game, go here for a summary of the various iterations currently on the market and here for basic advice relating to ARK: Survival Evolved itself. For all the others already tested or more lazy, we can reduce survival to the concept of ~serial accumulation~. After creating your character and choosing the map you want to play on, you find yourself naked in the middle of a rather hostile world. Your goal will be to accumulate as soon as possible a number of resources such as to be able to create standard tools, to be used both for the search for further material and for hunting. What makes this environment unpredictable and anxious are the indicators of your vital state. The first hours of the game will inevitably be dedicated to stabilizing your physical situation, concluding only and exclusively when you will be able to embark on some expedition without the almost total certainty of staying dry. That's where ARK opens up and becomes everything it's been incredibly successful at over the course of its two-year Early Access run. Since day one, Studio Wildcard has been adding content, never leaving their players without new content for more than a few weeks. This type of support and product management meant that player turnover was always present and fluid, so much so that we never had a real server population problem. The idea behind which the internal gameplay is based, but which has much more to givelare, is the ability to stun and then tame dozens and dozens of creatures from the past. Both the more or less faithful one of the world of dinosaurs, and the less realistic one of mythological creatures, such as dragons, golems and various King Kongs. Since its sandbox nature is the keystone of the experience, what ARK will offer you is an infinite series of possibilities for customizing the characteristics of your character, and a large number of recipes that you can unlock as your level rises. Each of them will allow you to unlock, in turn, ever-improving recipes until you go from caveman to space pioneer. Herein lies the essence of ARK: Survival Evolved. More than any other sandbox (let's leave Minecraft aside which is a story in itself) ARK will put you in the position of being able to create your tribe and, through teamwork, decide exactly what type of elements to become. Among those who will decide to stick to the primitive world (there is also a mode dedicated to this type of game), those who want to create their own personal Jurassic Park and those who, on the contrary, will think of taking only the most powerful creatures. All in the name of absolute freedom and the total desire to ~create~. It goes without saying that not everyone will appreciate this type of gameplay and, for this, be careful to understand what you are in front of, but for the supporters of the genre, few titles tend to be as complete and varied as ARK: Survival Evolved. PVE or PVP Choosing which type of server to launch into is one of the most pressing issues for players of ARK: Survival Evolved. Over the months there have been complaints of players who could not establish themselves in a PvP server, as all already ~ruled~ by tribes who thought of nothing else than limiting any kind of experience of other players. Whether or not this occurred, it cannot be denied that the choice of server type is required precisely for this reason. This writer does not appreciate the average player who arrives while you are sleeping, destroys your base and supplies and then leaves you there, passed out in the rubble of what you have been building for hours. On the other hand, PvP servers are used for this and, if one wanted to limit situations of this type, it would be enough to enter a server dedicated to ~role-playing~ or with raids enabled only at specific times of the day. For all the others, it will be enough to choose a very comfortable PvE server, which will put you in front of the only hostile creatures in the game and will certainly make it easier to make alliances with the other tribes stationed on the spot. The advice we can give you is to start with the latter type (rather than with the offline single player mode, dedicated to more experienced players looking for the improvement of their alter ego), so as to have a clear understanding of the basics of the game and have fun saddling your first dinosaurs. The moment you feel mature enough and ready to jump into the fray, nothing will stop you from choosing a modded server (with such high multipliers that you can reach the maximum level in a matter of minutes) and try to carnage the other players on the map. Once you find your way in the world, you will see how easy it becomes to figure out how to get around better and survive as long as possible. Is it really a triple A? We've talked so much about ARK: Survival Evolved over the course of two years, that the only thing we really care about is this. Now that the title has been released in its 1.0 version, it is difficult to objectively decree whether or not ARK is a triple A title. It is certainly not difficult to give a value to the product and if it were only about this, then we would be talking about a small miracle for the genre. Distinguished by an impressive graphic detail and a truly amazing completeness of content (the next expansion just announced adds another alien biome and many new creatures). What is really hard to understand is a business model that certainly does not reward those who decide to buy it now. What until a few days ago was available for a scant twenty euros, today requires sixty. This element further loses its consistency given the certainly not finished nature of a multitude of elements. Putting aside for a moment the collisions and interpenetrations, which are the order of the day in such a large sandbox, it really hurts to see that Studio Wildcard hasn't bothered in the least to ~mix~ the texts on the screen with a graphic dedicated. The same goes for the optimization which, despite the giant steps compared to the releases, still remains a difficult title todaybody digestible by medium configurations, so expensive that it hardly maintains only 60 frames per second on an I7 with a 1070. Forewarned is forearmed, if you want to play ARK, avoid doing it with a 386.", "date": "2017-09-05", "grade": "7.8"}
