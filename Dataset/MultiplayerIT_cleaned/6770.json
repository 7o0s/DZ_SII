Ubisoft certainly represents one of the major exponents of the emancipation process of the videogame medium, and although on certain occasions it does not shine in terms of communication, its ability to offer many diversified products and its being one of the few non-American ~powers~ is to be commended to drive this market. But let's get straight to the point, the French producer invited us to Paris for four days to review Assassin's Creed Unity, together with another thirty journalists with whom we were able to meet and play together in coop on dedicated servers. In practice we had a dedicated workstation on Xbox One available, every day from nine in the morning until nine in the evening, which we could manage in the way that best suited us and without anyone telling us what and how to do, just as if we had been in our little room with the good fortune to try the title before it leaves the shops. In this configuration we have completed the main campaign, completed various extras and, as mentioned, played together with other colleagues, in such a way as to have a complete overview and express a judgment with all the trappings of the case. Assassin's Creed Unity is the first game in the series to have been developed solely for the new generation consoles and PC - freeing itself from some technical constraints - and is set in a suggestive setting like that of Paris during the First French Revolution. Perhaps it is the most ambitious title ever by Ubisoft, which carries a burden and some questions on its shoulders: it is truly the turning point of the series, capable of exploiting the increased computing power to offer advanced gameplay and a exceptional technician? The answer is not so immediate, and there is all the rest of the review to deepen it. Assassin's Creed becomes next-gen only in splendid Paris: is this the chapter of the turning point? nothing is real, everything is permitted The main protagonist is Arno Dorian - pronounced Arn Dorin in French also in the Italian version - whose deeds can be retraced from his initiation as an Assassin in order to take revenge for some deaths that we do not reveal to avoid spoilers. Inserted in a context, the Parisian one of the storming of the Bastille and the First French Revolution, highly fascinating and potential theater of some events unfortunately not fully exploited. As with every chapter of Assassin's Creed, impersonating the protagonist allows you to investigate key characters and moments that have characterized the story over a decidedly wider period, a further reading plan that lightly reconnects to the previous chapters, and opens up new scenarios for the inevitable sequel that is winked at the end of the game. Arno recalls ~our~ Ezio Auditore in character and in some vicissitudes, although without reaching the same heights of charisma due to somewhat more obvious events and focused primarily on revenge, as mentioned, then in the search for the conspirators who pull the strings of what is happening. Among the key characters there is in particular lise de la Serre, with whom he will share various moments of the narrative but also some missions, while the historical period chosen by Ubisoft has allowed characters such as the Marquis De Sade, Napoleon and Robespierre to be thrown into the cauldron , which participate in the narrative even if they are deepened much more by the secondary missions than by the main ones, appearing a bit forced in the context of the main adventure. Paris is simply fabulous, obviously on its own merits but also for a masterful realization by Ubisoft Montreal. The streets are alive and teeming with hundreds of characters like never before in the previous chapters, the polygonal complexity of structures and objects gives that sense of fullness necessary to immerse yourself completely in the setting, and the context allows you to witness ~quarrels~ between revolutionaries and conservatives, people protesting in front of public buildings or burning flags. The improved lighting system is reflected, it must be said, on the impact of the whole scene, the synchronization in the observation points allows you to appreciate some really beautiful views of the French capital. Particular mention must be made of the interior design, fantastic in terms of texture, detail and complexity, even when walking (or killing!) a corridium or pass through a simple house on the run. The making of the clothes of Arno and the other characters is also very detailed, with many small details that are pleasing to the eye. However, there are some compromises: with the excuse of the murky water present at the time, its realization is not in line with that of Black Flag, for example, and there are not even the beautiful reflections of the buildings on the water that already characterized the second chapter on the previous generation of consoles. Although the day one patch was applied on the Xbox One version, the one we tested, we encountered several bugs such as interpenetrations or other - nothing that affects the use of the title - and above all a frame rate often lower than 30 frames per second, with rather conspicuous drops in some situations such as inside the Notre Dame cathedral, perhaps in the presence of different light sources. Such a shame not to have consistently good fluidity, our quick look at the PlayStation 4 version made us appreciate similar dips in the same points, but we reserve the right to try it in more detail. The Italian dubbing does its honest job and is excellent in the lyrics, the voices of passers-by remain in French while the soundtrack has less personality than in the past but always accompanies what is happening well. A smoke bomb is forever We finally arrive at the beating heart of Ubisoft production, which in this chapter sees some changes aimed at improving the control system and making it more contextualized to what happens on the screen: when you find yourself running with the right trigger (RT) and you encounter a obstacle, it is now possible to press the B key to jump it without incurring climbing animations, in such a way as not to slow down the run and make it more fluid. The same combination is very useful when you have to go down from a building and in general from an elevated position: by holding down RT + B you go down without particular interruptions, even if the camera sometimes gets tantrums and has to be repositioned manually. All the rest is entrusted to the classic control with the left analog and the combination of RT + A; having done due practice, these novelties go well with the rediscovered verticality of the game map after the previous two chapters, within Paris at the end of the 1700s. However, these modifications have also brought some problems as a gift, because the system sometimes ~goes crazy~ in the presence of passages or obstacles at the limit in terms of height or positioning: entering a window in a building can turn out to be a nightmare and compromise some (for fortunately few) escape or infiltration missions, as a result Arno's movements can be equally a little more cumbersome. We have mentioned the stealth/infiltration component because it is actually an important part of the missions present within the game, and modified compared to the past. With LT you can put yourself in a lowered position, with A you can ~attach~ to the covers: when the enemies are suspicious, they first of all display an orange exclamation mark, then possibly the red one when completely uncovered. In the first case you have to quickly escape from their field of vision, literally leaving a white hologram which indicates the last position in which we were seen. If you are fast enough it is therefore possible to lose them, or to lurk nearby to kill them cold from a cover. The structure that revolves around Arno Dorian provides for a lot of customization, almost like an RPG, supported by a rather complex currency system at least at the first approach. We have the money obtained from the missions and from the chests, which allows us to buy gadgets, clothes, but also weapons of various types and equipment for the head, forearms, chest, belt, legs. Each object is made up of four values dedicated, for example, to health, ranged attacks, melee and stealth; with the Credo Points, which are obtained following killings or athletic skills of a certain style, it is possible to upgrade weapons and armor with additional perks; with the Synchronization Points, which are obtained at the completion of each mission, new skills are bought for the main protagonist, such as mastery with weapons or the ability to break open doors and chests. In reality there is a fourth currency, called Helix Credits, which allows you to ~violate~ the system to immediately obtain equipment or objects for the coop, its natural accumulation is rather limited and in practice represents the ~premium~ currency to be purchased with money true: in practice we have never felt the need, due to an imbalance in favor of the main protagonist whoand we will illustrate later in the review. Each object is classified according to a rank from one to five dots; the combination of weapons and equipment restores this rank also for Arno and allows to have a reference for the difficulty of the missions, which is indicated following the same system. A very high level of aesthetic and functional customization, therefore, on which we are sure many will spend time to improve their character using the gadgets and weapons that best suit their style of play. Also because the combat system has finally undergone some interesting changes, at least on paper. The rhythm of the clashes has been slowed down and finally you are actually attacked by several enemies at the same time, according to an evolution that is close to Batman's system, even if not with the same precision. The moment in which the best parry can be performed (with the B key) is indicated on the opponent's head with a yellow bar, the toughest ones and perhaps equipped with heavy weapons instead need to dodge with the A key: actually when you are overwhelmed from many enemies it is very hard to come out unscathed, at least in terms of pure combat with white weapons. This is because these interesting premises unfortunately collide with a widely revisable balance and with artificial intelligence deficiencies never highlighted as this time by the types of missions available. First things first, in Assassin's Creed Unity there are quite a few tasks that require the infiltration and killing of a particular character, in buildings perhaps overflowing with enemies and bells that they can use to summon more. Well, especially in indoor missions it is really too easy to ~cheat~ the artificial intelligence, and witness situations bordering on the comical. In a game like Unity we absolutely do not ask for realism, mind you, but neither do we ask for the possibility of killing enemies by simply crouching and passing by us, while those in the next room do not notice anything and not even a few meters away. Worse still when you find yourself with so many non-player characters who start running screaming, and no nearby guards are suspicious of what's going on. There would be many more examples of this kind: just simply change your plan and find out how often no one follows you, not to mention that on more than one occasion it doesn't take much to find a way to eliminate important targets in a few minutes (even a few moments), when instead in the mission it is presented as difficult, difficult to reach and well hidden in huge buildings. Shortly after starting to upgrade Arno and obtaining the first gadgets, including the infamous smoke bomb, even combat goes a bit to hell: in the event of clashes with many enemies, your weapon is rather relieved, in cases where you need to escaping is quite simple to do and if you are not happy just throw a few smoke bombs to kill a large number of enemies in the meantime without a shot being fired, even leading to favor this strategy rather than wasting too much time trying not to be discovered. The reality is that the artificial intelligence has not changed or worsened compared to the previous chapters, which in itself can be considered a defect, but its shortcomings are amplified by the choice to propose many infiltration missions that clash with the numerous defects that we have listed a few lines above, and which do not provide for penalties of any kind that perhaps would have mitigated this search towards the easiest way to complete the proposed mission. There are some challenges that suggest a more reasoned approach, but completing them doesn't give particular benefits and even collecting money in a few hours is easy, but we'll come back to it shortly. Xbox One goals To get the much coveted 1000G in Assassin's Creed Unity you have to complete everything and more within the game, nothing too complicated beyond the hours needed, many, to get everything. After finishing the main campaign and doing a few more side missions we unlocked just over 500 points, with more at hand and related to collectibles, clubs, online, items, primary and secondary challenges. A sea of opportunities The rich dish of Assassin's Creed Unity is actually represented by the impressive amount of things that can be done within the game, perfect in terms of fun and far from the times in which they were all identical to each other and in some cases not even pleasant to deal with. The main adventure unfolds through a total of twelve sequences, each of which com", "date": "2014-11-11", "grade": "8.0"}
