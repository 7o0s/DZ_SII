{"name": "Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-budokai-3.html", "text": "The fights Whichever game mode you choose, you will always have to deal with fights. Apparently, the number of moves per character has decreased compared to the previous episode of the series, but there are still many attack and defense maneuvers at your disposal. Indeed, the latter have increased exponentially: it is now possible to use the parry key to dodge the opponents' attacks (pressing it the instant the blow is delivered) and even move at supersonic speed to hit the enemy from behind when this attacks us, just like it happens in the manga. And the beauty is that this maneuver can be performed repeatedly, with a sequence of moves and countermoves that will end only in the consumption of spiritual energy. If you add to this the clash between energy waves, which was introduced for the first time in Budokai 3, you will realize the efforts that the developers have made to make the game's action absolutely faithful to the way the fights take place in the world of Dragon Ball. The fights themselves involve the use of a certain strategy to achieve victory, especially when facing powerful opponents. It is necessary to raise the spiritual energy bars, transform the character (in order to obtain greater attack power) and exploit any indecision of the enemy. Our vital energy and that of the opponent are shown through the scouters, power detectors created by the Saiyans. Managing spiritual energy wisely is a fundamental factor, in Budokai 3 much more than in its predecessors: the character is stronger if his aura is strong, vice versa he becomes weaker or even is forced to stop to catch his breath when this it runs out. A system for making the most spectacular moves has also been added to the game: at the right moment all four standard joypad buttons are pressed, in order to make the character momentarily boosted. In this state, the spiritual energy bar drops quickly and we have to quickly carry out the final attack, the outcome of which is decided through rather particular methods: a sort of ~lottery~, in which the attack wins if the button pressed is different from that of the opponent, or the filling of a bar by pressing a button at the right time. The Dragon Universe The game modes available in Budokai 3 do not make any changes to the already proven structure of previous episodes: it is possible to organize a duel between two characters (between friends or against the game's AI), participate in the Tenkaichi Tournament (translated as World Tournament ), train to familiarize yourself with the control system, enter the Lunch shop to buy/modify character skills or try your hand at the Dragon Universe mode. The latter has been changed compared to the second episode of the series, in favor of greater longevity and a closer relationship to the events narrated in the cartoon. In fact, each selected character takes part in the clashes that actually took place in the original story, and during this process other characters, skills or locations for the fights are unlocked. This is an intelligent change, given that in Budokai 2 it was necessary for certain events to occur to obtain, for example, a new usable character: now, however, all this happens in an ~automatic~ way if you face the mode with all the characters . Which will take a really long time In addition, our alter-ego will be able to increase his skills at will, winning battles and earning experience points. Unfortunately this function has not been translated into practice in the best way, given that the mechanics of the fights often reward only the increase in attack capabilities and not in the other characteristics. The graphical interface of this mode has also changed profoundly: in Budokai 2 the characters were represented as super-deformed pawns on a tiled map, while now the character moves as in any action game, with the only difference being always fly and land only near key locations for the continuation of the story or when he finds an object (money, skills or Dragon Balls). It's nice when a license is exploited in a creative and intelligent way, and in Budokai 3 this also happens for the details: our character will be able to sense the presence of friends or enemies nearby by pressing one of the back buttons, and use the Dragon Radar (if possesses it) to find the Dragon Balls. [C] In the mode D's universerago, as in RPGs, the character gains experience and is upgraded. There are some really spectacular moves. You will fight everywhere, even inside Majin Buu's body. All the internships are very well done. [/C] Technical aspects As anticipated, the aesthetic value of Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 differs little from what was seen in the previous episode: the characters are always in cel shading, extremely faithful to the originals, and are equipped with good animations. The graphics engine manages everything in the best possible way, without ever hinting at an uncertainty, even during the most spectacular sequences. Speaking of entertainment, I would say that Budokai 3 in some moments is really something extraordinary to see: try to catch Cooler's (Frieza's brother) Supernova Attack and you will see a huge explosion occur on planet Earth, with a shot from space. Incredible. Try to catch Cooler's Supernova Attack and you'll see a huge explosion occur on planet Earth, shot from space. Incredible. Even the sound defends itself well: there are valid music and convincing effects, too bad that the voices are in English instead of Japanese In any case, the Italian text localization is done quite well, so the game is perfectly enjoyable in all its aspects. [C] There is also an excellent animated introduction, complete with an ~official~ song... Frieza can; transform exactly like in the original series, even passing through the intermediate stages! Yamcha vs. Android 17? There is little hope of victory... [/C] Comment A great job was done for DBZ Budokai 3: the game is certainly one of the best tie-ins ever made, especially if you think about the adherence to the original work. In the desolate panorama of Bandai productions, which until a few years ago reserved nothing for the most demanding gamers, it is a real miracle: instead of resting on the laurels of Budokai 2 and limiting themselves to increasing the characters, the developers have taken into account of the criticisms of Dragon Ball fans and have filled in all that was missing, creating a product that perfectly recreates the atmosphere of the series, including the humorous aspects. Furthermore, the change of course for the story mode completely changes the approach to the game, which has now become much longer lasting and less ~complicated~. If you are a DBZ fan, Budokai 3 is an absolutely unmissable title, from every point of view. The exaggeration of Dragon Ball turns into exasperation in the Z and GT series. If during the first Tenkaichi Tournament Master Roshi discovers that the moon is responsible for transforming the young Goku into a sort of gigantic ~were gorilla~, and destroys it with one of his energy waves, in Dragon Ball Z and GT the characters become strong enough to make the entire planet tremble under their blows, or even create resonances throughout the known universe when they fully express their power. All this translates into pure entertainment in Akira Toriyama's manga (and in the anime based on it, despite a disconcerting slowness of narration), a show that the Bandai developers have been able to translate on the screen with the Dragon Ball Z Budokai series. If the transition between the first Budokai and its sequel was quite strong, with a complete renewal of the graphics in favor of cel shading (right choice), a considerable increase in the characters and a new story mode, the road that led to the birth of Budokai 3 is equally full of changes: aesthetically the game is almost the same, with a few exceptions, but the story mode has been renewed again and there are practically all the characters from the saga, including feature films.", "date": "2004-11-08", "grade": null}
