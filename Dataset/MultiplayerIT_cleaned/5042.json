Just a week after the release of the first paid add-on titled Confidential Movies Vol. 1, Capcom has in fact published Vol. 2, thus offering further material to those who have had the opportunity to enjoy the company of Jack and his merry family. As in the first package, three different contents await us to offer us as many gaming experiences, more or less related to what we saw in Resident Evil 7. But let's not waste any more time: let's find out what the developers have in store for us this time. Resident Evil 7 Confidential Movies are enriched with three modes in Vol. 2: are you ready? Blackjack with dummy As in the case of its predecessor, Confidential Films Vol. 2 presents two of its contents in the form of VHS video tapes, similar to those found by Ethan in the Baker house during the main adventure. The first tape of this second volume is called Twenty-one and sees the return of poor Clancy, already forced to face Mycomorphs in the Baker's basement and deal with Marguerite's dinner in Vol. 1. In this case the show operator Sewer Gators is prey to Lucas's sick games, also widely known within the base mode of Resident Evil 7. Once again following the ruthless line drawn by Saw - The Riddler, this time the young Baker has decided to organize a game of very special blackjack, in which the very life of those who take part is at stake. In fact, together with Clancy we find another masked protagonist, to be beaten to save his life: each lost hand corresponds to an increasingly bloody corporal punishment, until the final act is reached which puts an end to the life of the protagonist or of the other controlled player from the CPU. The combination of Resident Evil 7 and blackjack therefore offers bread for the teeth of those who love this card game, to which Capcom has however decided to add a little more spice. Compared to the basic rules of the game it is in fact possible to obtain special cards, which if played allow you to obtain various types of bonuses such as winning on 24 instead of 21, drawing a card with a certain number or forcing the opponent to return to the bank the last card obtained. By completing the twenty-one mode several times it is possible to unlock additional difficulty levels, thus obtaining a little more longevity from a mode that still remains confined to itself from a narrative point of view. Daughters Beyond a few small elements dedicated to Clancy and Lucas, Twenty-one does not reveal anything in particular about the plot of Resident Evil 7. In the Confidential Films package Vol. 2 this role belongs at least on paper to the second VHS, bearing the eloquent title Daughters. Eloquent at least for those who have had the opportunity to complete the story of Resident Evil 7, which we obviously recommend you do before approaching this additional content. In fact, Daughters tells us about Eveline's arrival at the Baker house, and the progressive spread of the horror among the family members. Even if only for a few moments, we therefore have the opportunity to get to know Jack, Marguerite and Lucas before they become the monsters we saw in Resident Evil 7, while the player takes on the role of Zoe, daughter of the Bakers who in Resident Evil 7 offers the own support to the protagonist Ethan. The game mechanics are different from the series of puzzles seen in the second VHS of Confidential Films Vol. 1, entitled The room, even if as in the latter, Zoe has no weapon she can count on. While the rest of her family seems prey to a strange madness, Zoe can do nothing but try to escape the grasp of Jack and Marguerite, hiding near the house to plan their moves. Depending on the choices made during the story, it is possible to unlock two different endings, both ~bad~ but in a single case actually linked to the story told in Resident Evil 7. The only replayability elements are offered by a series of details that accompanying the story of Daughters, which unfortunately is not as memorable as we had hoped on the eve. The short duration (about a quarter of an hour) in fact makes it seem a bit drawn out, too much if we consider the attention to detail placed by Capcom in a main adventure which in this case is not equaled. Those who on the eve hoped to be able to go further into the setting of Resident Evil 7 will therefore be a little disappointed, even iffrom a qualitative point of view Figlie still offers an experience that deserves to be tried. Happy birthday! Continuing the similarities between Confidential Movies Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, the last mode offered by this second pack is the one celebrating Jack's 55th birthday. In it, the player controls Mia, who is busy feeding the breadwinner of the Bakers within a certain amount of time. To do this, he has to cross various areas of the house located in Dulvey, collecting various types of food but above all dealing with the numerous Mycomorphs present in the rooms and corridors, dressed up for the occasion with hats and other party hats. In practice, Jack's 55th birthday looks like a fun encounter between the previous DLC Nightmare and Ethan must die, from which he inherits the possibility of obtaining bonuses between one attempt and another to complete everything in the shortest possible time. By killing enemies it is possible to buy time so as not to make Jack angry, unlocking access to additional areas where you can go and collect food. In conclusion, we can say that we were satisfied with this Vol. 2, even if a little less than Vol. 1. The latter also has the economic aspect on its side, given that the price of Vol. 2 was increased to 14.99 euros compared to the 9.99 euros needed to take home the first premium package. Inexplicably in our opinion, also considering the completely similar offer in terms of quantity. While waiting to find out more about the third and final part of the Season Pass, the full payment at 29.99 euros remains the most convenient way to get all the content of Resident Evil 7.", "date": "2017-02-16", "grade": null}
