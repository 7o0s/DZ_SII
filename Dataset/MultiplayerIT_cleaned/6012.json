{"name": "Roach Race", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/roach-race-recensione.html", "text": "The story between Geralt of Rivia and Rutilia is perhaps the tale of the greatest affection that can be found in the raw world created by Andrzej Sapkowski for The Witcher. Therefore it seems appropriate that this too could be at the center of a video game and it is also sacrosanct to find ourselves in front of a review of Roach Race, to evaluate the spin-off dedicated to the Witcher's mare. As a kind of nice joke, CD Projekt RED launched this Roach Race as a game within a game inside the arcade machines in Cyberpunk 2077, but it turns out that it is a real title, also available on smartphones as free- to-play. In this form it is not connected to the issue of shared high scores in the sci-fi world of RPGs or even to the rewards that can be unlocked in this one, but finds its full realization in the mobile form of a very classic endless runner, what which curiously works quite well, to be a joke. On the other hand, the idea is not lacking in charm: lost in the thousand adventures of Geralt of Rivia, has anyone ever thought about Rutilia's feelings? That poor beast that, recalled at any time, shows up within minutes wherever the Witcher is, what kind of life will it lead outside the scenes? How is he always within whistle range? Well, Roach Race probably won't answer these profound questions but it can, if nothing else, shed some light on this elusive supporting actor in Geralt's adventures, staging what could be his aspirations and dreams of freedom, among unbridled racing at full speed and lots of carrots. Infinite gallop, or almost Roach Race: The Rutilia fair challenges a griffin with its typical bipedal pose The story is poignant, but told with extreme hermeticism, to imply an epic that has no need to explain itself in words. The initial scene is enough, with the horse proudly standing out on the roof of a stable and Geralt looking at it from below, to make us understand how much the poetics of Roach Race is based on a bold reversal of perspective, which sees the modest coadjutor become finally protagonist. With leaps and heroic poses, the mare seems to want to forcefully take the stage, but it is only for a moment, because at the push of a button, her mad run immediately begins, driven by an unprecedented desire for freedom. Or maybe just carrots and apples, hard to say exactly. All we can do, in terms of gameplay, is support Rutilia's gallop and try to make her avoid obstacles by jumping and going as far as possible to get the maximum score. Crows, fences, chasms, griffins and various creatures meet the protagonist and it's up to us to find the right timing to make jumps and double jumps, at the same time collecting apples and carrots capable of giving further accelerations complete with aggressive poses. Roach Race: Geralt desperately chases his mare Here we reconnect to the more classic tradition of the endless runner, returning to the elegant simplicity of Canabalt, but with a scan in levels that somehow reminds us of the settings and stories of The Witcher, despite the obsessive repetition of the usual mechanisms. The pixel art graphics are minimalistic, but manage to be even expressive in some cases. Beyond the crazy heroic poses of Rutilia, who seems to want to fully enjoy her moment of glory by flaunting frankly unsuspected agility and power, even just seeing poor Geralt desperately chasing his mare can be worth the cost of the download (ie zero EUR). Not to mention the moving scene of the Witcher who runs worried towards Rutilia as soon as she crashes into an obstacle, presumably to console her (or to beat her, it's not clear, but we want to lean towards the prettiest hypothesis).", "date": "2022-09-16", "grade": "7.0"}
