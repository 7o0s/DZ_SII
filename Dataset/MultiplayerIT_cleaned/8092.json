{"name": "Lu Trine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/112754-trine-2-directors-cut-lu-trine.html", "text": "In December last year, the guys from Frozenbyte launched Trine 2 on the market, a sequel to a fairly successful puzzle that originally came out only on PC and PlayStation 3 but which, with its successor, also arrived on the Microsoft platform. In both cases, they were small projects created by an independent team that gained acclaim thanks to immediate but very deep mechanics, all completely based on the physics of the objects on the screen and a particularly accurate and very colorful graphic aspect. On the occasion of the review of Trine 2, edited by Aligi Comandini and available on Multiplayer.it at this address, the only problems that emerged were an excessively short duration of the campaign and a few too many bugs as well as a poorly calibrated difficulty in some points and which tended to make the puzzles of the more advanced levels frustrating mainly due to the sometimes imprecise controls and a certain inertia in the movements of the three protagonists. All these imperfections were at the heart of the development of Trine 2: Director's Cut, a real re-edition of the sequel, created once again by Frozenbyte but this time published exclusively on the new Nintendo console, Wii U in digital format through the eShop. So let's find out in detail what's new in this version and how they behave in the test of facts to try to understand if the title can really be considered the best among those available at launch. Between expansions and new controls First of all, the Director's Cut contains the Goblin Menace expansion already released in September exclusively on PC and able to offer a series of unpublished contents collected within a real additional campaign consisting of six brand new levels linked together by a new plot. Furthermore, the add-on offers a handful of new puzzles mainly related to magnetic and gravity forces and some new skills that the three protagonists can acquire and enhance through the skill system already seen in the original title. The interesting thing is that these new abilities can be acquired immediately not necessarily by playing the expansion which, on the contrary, is only available once the original game is finished and cannot be played from the beginning. To further increase longevity, in fact already enhanced with Goblin Menace, there is another level, this time completely new and exclusive to the Wii U version which can be reached by collecting ten pieces of a map scattered within the six schemes of the add-ons. In terms of content Trine 2: Director's Cut, with its almost 2 GB of downloads, stops here and in itself represents a re-edition of great value of the Frozenbyte title especially in light of the very low selling price (at least until the end of the year). But obviously the other great protagonist is the almost completely revised control method to meet the functionality of Wii U. First of all, as was also the case on PC and console, the title can be played entirely in cooperatives with all three protagonists simultaneously on screen, effectively lightening its difficulty, very often linked to the correct management of the characters. Multiplayer is available both locally and online. In the latter case, unfortunately, the absence of voice chat support is strongly noted, which severely limits any form of collaboration and organization between the players who will have to go ahead by dint of trial and error in the hope of coordinating and synchronizing to perfection. In the case of local cooperatives, on the other hand, the developer's ability to support practically every controller of the console in any arrangement should be positively noted: from the GamePad to the Wiimote + Nunchuk combination via the Classic Controller Pro and the brand new Wii U Pro Controller. In reality, to be precise, the latter is not currently supported yet but a patch, which should also implement voice chat, is practically in the pipeline as can also be read in this news. Going into more detail on the use of the GamePad, in addition to the fully configurable key layout, the use of the touchscreen comes into play which can be used by the player to change the controlled character on the fly through a small icon in the upper left corner or to use a variety of skills. Both Amadeus, the magician and Zoya, the thief can in fact be controlled in their skills through the Pad screen. In the first case we will be able to create the platforms evoked by the sorcerer in a much more natural way; as far asfrom the archer instead we will have the possibility to aim arrows and grappling hook at specific points of the screen without having to go through the viewfinder. In reality, the greatest limitation of this Director's Cut can be seen precisely with Zoya, i.e. the need to continuously glance from the GamePad to the TV to use the touchscreen correctly and very often it will happen to use the ~classic~ controls sacrificing precision to have a much greater speed. Except for this shortcoming, the controls work perfectly and their total customization is certainly appreciated. To behold with wonder Technically this Director's Cut looks like the best version of Trine 2 released on consoles. We don't risk being contradicted with this statement since the game on Wii U runs with exceptional fluidity and with a graphic rendering very close to what was seen on PC. If you want to look under the microscope, you can see some textures that are not of the highest level and a slightly ~muffled~ light management in the lighting of the environments but in terms of overall graphic rendering, we are at high levels. Obviously, a lot is also due to the artistic sector of the game, extremely pleasant to look at and full of particularly accurate details that literally stand out thanks to the very flamboyant color palette. The title can also be played entirely on the GamePad, obviously increasing its graphic quality thanks to the reduction of the screen. In this way the touch controls react much better and we are sure that several players will prefer to enjoy the title in this mode. The only note we feel like making in conclusion of the review is the absence of the partially competitive Magic Mayhem multiplayer mode, long heralded by the developer for this edition of the game but in fact excluded at the last minute from the release and which, we hope , will be launched on the market in the coming weeks through a patch.", "date": "2012-12-24", "grade": "8.5"}
