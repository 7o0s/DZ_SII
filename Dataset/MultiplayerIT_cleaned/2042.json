{"name": "Tony Hawk 3 : lo skate su pc", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawk-3-lo-skate-su-pc.html", "text": "4 wheels and a board (and a lot of imagination) THPS3's modes don't make any noticeable changes to the structure of the game. In addition to the Single Session and Free Skate modes (which are basically used to set records or train) there is the usual career mode. By tackling this mode you will have to pass objectives to unlock the next arenas. The objectives are also very classic: recover the SKATE letters scattered around the arena, perform particular tricks, reach certain scores or interact with the arena to make something happen. Each map has very nice and particular objectives: in the forge arena you will have to open 5 valves (grinding them), in the airport arena you will have to stop the muggers or in the Los Angeles arena you will have to stop the chase between the police and a van. They are trivial expedients for the player's entertainment, which however portend the care with which the product was created. I almost forgot that the career mode is interspersed (every 2 arenas) with a competition mode with medals against tall skaters: you'll have 3 rounds of one minute each to ~impress~ the judges, who at the end of the three rounds will give you 3 votes. The best two votes of each skater will be added up and a ranking will be drawn up: only if you are in the top three will you be able to advance to the next level. The multiplayer (also present in the PS2 and XBOX versions) is the most innovative thing you can find in this simulation: there are many game modes. There is the ~king of the hill~ where you will score points by keeping control of the crown, while the other skaters will come looking for you to steal your crown. Or you can try your hand at ~graffiti~ in which you will mark the obstacles of your color and you will be the winner if you have marked the highest number of objects. Last but not least there is the ~Capture the Flag~ which works exactly as you have seen it in your First Person Shooters. There are a total of 8 multiplayer modes and (although it won't be easy to find Italian players) it will guarantee you a truly remarkable number of hours of play. There are 8 game levels, all beautifully made, full of obstacles and designed to offer an impressive continuity of tricks (the more experienced will have no difficulty in completely crossing an arena with a single combo). In addition to the singleplayer levels there are maps designed for online play (I think there are 3 or 4 maps). The number of arenas is not very high, but we must consider that each arena is extremely vast and that within the game there is a 3D editor that allows you to create customized maps without too much effort. Who do you want to be? The characters you can choose are 13 (Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, Chad Muska, Elissa Steamer, Kareem Campbell and others). Once you finish the game (unlocked all the arenas and completed all the missions) a movie will unlock which from time to time will let you know the characters included in the game. Needless to say, the cutscenes are gorgeous and worth buying the game on their own. Then there are the anthology movies that show, for example, an infant Tony Hawk making evolutions that you can't even imagine or the movies that were shot inside Neversoft and that show how crazy these guys are (who from time to time compete in skate competitions or in improbable challenges such as the ~game of the chair~). The 300 megabytes of movies contained in the CD are a real pearl. It's not all; unlocked the ~real~ characters you can play with other special characters: Darth Maul, Demoness, Neversoft Eyeball, Officer Dick, Wolverine (and others). The special characters, in addition to being different in appearance, have particular tricks and different styles of play. If this multitude of characters is not enough for you, you can create a character with the very comfortable and complete editor inserted directly within the game. With ~Create Skater~ you can decide all the characteristics of your custom character (physical appearance, clothing, stats.. there should be around a couple of screens that testify to the ~disasters~ that can be created). You no longer have anything to envy to consoles The graphics are immersive and practically perfect. The game engine requires a PC powerful enough to be able to play without slowdowns at high resolutions (for those like me who have an old PC, just actfogging which allows you to maintain a high framerate even with the minimum system requirements, a Pentium 500 or equivalent). The gameplay is the strong point of the game and proves to be perfect even with the use of the keyboard (reconfigurable at will) (for those used to consoles you can also use the gamepad, which can also be reconfigured if needed). Without a shadow of a doubt this simulation is the best on the market (also considering that similar titles do not exist for PC) and although there are no terms of comparison, Activision could not bring us a more successful and entertaining game on the PC (which in America is one of the most popular games on any available platform). The only sore point: the multiplayer game is strangely buggy and to play online some of the buyers are waiting for a patch that is late in coming out. A first step into the world of Tony Hawk is the demo that you find in the files area, download that and you will never go back. Restricted comment Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series is, in my opinion, one of the best ever proposed in the videogame field (as regards sports simulations). This third chapter brings improvements to an already perfect and fun game. At Neversoft they weren't satisfied with implementing new tricks, inserting new arenas, new characters and new options, but multiplayer has been added, which manages to infinitely extend the time you can spend skating on the PC (at least until the fourth chapter will not be released). The graphic richness is astounding and perfectly customizable thanks to the possibility of enabling fogging, which will allow THPS3 to be enjoyed even on non-latest generation PCs. As in the previous chapters, the soundtrack is first choice and includes the Ramones, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Motorhead among the artists (a total of twenty very wild and adrenaline-pumping tracks). What's most amazing about THPS3 is the learning curve: it climbs gradually for novice players and keeps climbing without stopping. The beauty of this video game is that you will never stop learning and perfecting yourself. With practice you will learn every corner of the arenas and every trick available to your character. Even once all the maps are unlocked, your fun will continue in refining your technique and trying to make those stratospheric combos that you have seen from online players or from your neighbor. Whether you are a fan of the series or have never ~piloted~ Tony Hawk's virtual alter-ego on your monitors, know that this is the game for you.", "date": "2002-07-27", "grade": null}
