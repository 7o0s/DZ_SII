{"name": "Gli orfani di Wipeout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146507-ag-drive-gli-orfani-di-wipeout.html", "text": "It is curious to note how, with the closure of Studio Liverpool (formerly Psygnosis) author of Wipeout, and with Nintendo's now historic reluctance to re-propose the F-Zero brand, futuristic racing games have practically disappeared from the home environment console. Anyone who cannot live without gravitational shuttles traveling at thousands of kilometers per hour is therefore forced to dust off the masterpieces of the past or to look into the mobile sector, an environment so varied that over the years it has also guaranteed some more than discreet exponents of category in question. The latest in the series responds to the name of AG Drive, the first work of the Finnish team ZORG Entertainment, founded in 2012 by veterans from Housemarque, Bugbear Entertainment and Remedy Entertainment. Not a bad premise, right? While better to look at than play, AG Drive is still a great value racing game AG Drive is a 3.99 premium title which - fortunately - does not include any type of in-app purchase. The inspiration towards the two masterpieces of the genre mentioned at the beginning, namely Wipeout and F-Zero, is quite evident; from our point of view it is probably towards the Nintendo title that the Nordic developers must show greater gratitude, both for the general feeling and for the choice to center the focus of the action on the element of driving their own shuttle. In fact, AG Drive does not offer any type of weapon to collect, and the only bonuses present on the courses are therefore the boosts thanks to which you can obtain a strong temporary acceleration. A minimal exception on the theme is given by the special ability supplied with each shuttle, to be loaded as the race progresses, and which, depending on the vehicle, can guarantee an additional boost of speed but rather a negative effect against the opponents. The variety of competitions is quite good, since there are classic races, challenges against a single driver, time and acceleration races, elimination races, tournaments and so on. In any case, it is still a rather conventional racing game in terms of mechanics, without particular hints of originality. However, where AG Drive excels is in the technical component, undoubtedly among those with the greatest impact of the entire App Store. The team has in fact exploited the iOS8 Metal libraries alongside a truly remarkable proprietary 3D engine: the result is an image composed of 15 million polygons per second moved at 60 fps, something truly extraordinary considering the mobile environment. However, rather than reading its qualities on paper, AG Drive must be seen in action to be able to realize the goodness of the work of ZORG Entertainment: futuristic settings flow with exceptional speed and fluidity in front of the eyes while crossing tracks that look like a roller coaster designed by a schizophrenic lunatic, with continuous ups and downs, loops and rotations from stomach to throat. The feeling of being at 3000 km/h is then well returned, increasing the involvement during the races. If from a technical point of view there is really little or nothing to complain about, possibly from an artistic point of view some more personal choices would have been appreciable, so as to provide greater character to settings that instead follow very faithfully the clichs of the type. The defect is then amplified by observing the shuttles, very unattractive and characterized by a design that is not at all incisive. AG Drive is however a game in which the balance between its components is somewhat lacking: beautiful to look at, not as satisfying to play. Let me be clear, we are still talking about a product with gameplay that is undoubtedly more than satisfactory, but some defects that are difficult to overlook reduce the final evaluation. Firstly, the control system, not fully able to accommodate the frenzy of the action both in the default variant based on the accelerometer (a bit slow and imprecise) and in the one with virtual keys (too small and badly arranged). If all in all with practice you can come to terms with this aspect, it is more difficult to turn a blind eye to the really modest presence and consistency of the opponents in the economy of the race, also thanks to the absence of effects deriving from the impacts between the shuttles. It's a shame about the few circuits available, with a track design that isn't always spot on. Finally, the soundtrack deserves mention, created by a group of musicians led by Ari Pulkkinen, already author of the accompaniments of various titles such as Resogun, Super Stardust, Outland and Trine. The result is a series of electronic tracks with a very high number of bmps, very interesting and undoubtedly fully suited to the context.", "date": "2015-03-10", "grade": "8.0"}
