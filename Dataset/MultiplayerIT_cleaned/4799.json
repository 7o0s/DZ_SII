All this laid the foundations for an obvious sequel, which took a long time to arrive but finally arrived in the best way: the past years have been invested by the team to enrich the original formula and improve pace and structure, making Framed 2 a substantial evolution of an already excellent game from the start. The brevity and some cumbersomeness of the first chapter have been improved, making the action between the puzzles more fluid and increasing the content within it, which seems to make the first Framed a sort of big tutorial for this second chapter, where the formula seems to have achieved an extraordinary balance. It is a ~more of the same~, as it continues to be based on the same concept of Framed without substantially adding anything really new, and in cases like this the impact of the original idea is inevitably attenuated in the second iteration, but the mechanics left room for further interpretations and Framed 2 certainly makes the most of it by proposing new situations and eliminating a large part of the dead times and weaker elements that emerged from the puzzle design of the first chapter. There is still something that could be filed, such as the fact of having to go through the entire animations for each cartoon to be positioned at each attempt, which in the long run leads us to think of a desirable streamlining of certain mechanics to act faster. but these are still rather marginal elements. Framed 2 develops the excellent initial idea in the best way in a well-balanced video game. Vignette yourself The mechanics of Framed 2 is very particular, in case you haven't tried the first chapter: it's about moving, rotating and arranging the cartoons in order to create a sensible action sequence, building a sort of storyboard that tells the story of the protagonists . The latter continues to be rather cryptic, precisely because it has to be revealed through the game itself: these are daring chases and escapes by some figures visualized as dark silhouettes within various urban scenarios, which revolve around a briefcase with mysterious but evidently very important to everyone. There are no dialogues or accompanying texts, therefore the unveiling of the story is an integral part of the mechanics of the gameplay, since in the construction of the sequences which form the basis of the game, one also discovers at the same time what happens to the protagonists. The question is not exactly immediate: in addition to moving the order of the illustrations, it is often necessary to change their orientation and angle, in some cases even repeating them to try to build a sequence that leads the protagonist to emerge unscathed from the situation without encountering obstacles. If the early stages of the game will be almost obvious, things get complicated quickly and getting to the end won't be easy at all, often also relying on the typical ~trial and error~ trend, which may not appeal to lovers of more fluid and dynamic experiences . Framed 2 is also an excellent example of style applied to the video game, with its particular noir characterization that makes everything even more fascinating, together with the lack of explicit dialogues. The accuracy of the details, the excellent animations and the contrast given by the shadow elements and the silhouettes of the characters help to create a truly particular atmosphere, underlined by a soundtrack perfectly in line with the noir tones.", "date": "2017-06-29", "grade": "9.0"}
