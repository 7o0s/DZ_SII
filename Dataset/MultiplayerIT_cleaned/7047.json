At the same time it has never made his life easy. Killzone 2 had to deal with a trailer that set the bar high, too much for those who had to rely on the legs of PlayStation 3 to jump. The third chapter had the advantage of not being expected as the messiah, on the other hand it was chosen as a showcase for mid-last generation discoveries, such as Move and the rapid adoption of stereoscopic 3D technology. Shadow Fall has ultimately followed the path reserved for new console release titles, often blessed with a longer sales cycle than other products but with the burden of sky-high expectations and the inability to fully test online features. The developer from Amsterdam, after the release, focused precisely on the multiplayer component: eighteen patches have fixed, revised and corrected where necessary, while new free content, on all three extra maps, have held the hand of a community that largely has also paid for the Season Pass. Those who have spent a few tens of extra euros to get their hands on the premium additional content have already experienced Insurgent for some time and have had the opportunity to download Intercept for a few hours, the second DLC that changes the cards on the table and introduces a non-revolutionary, yet interesting co-op mode. Shadow Fall - Intercept brings a cooperative mode to the world of Killzone The Killzone Horde The four members of the VSA elite team, already glimpsed in the Shadow Fall campaign, are the protagonists of this Killzonian reinterpretation of the Horde, a mode that has become very popular in recent years. There is a micro story to support Intercept but, really, knowing that you will have to ensure the transmission of some sensitive data by repelling enemy assaults will not add anything to the gaming experience. In the four maps present in the package, it is necessary to protect three control points from waves of opponents, taking them back if they were to be conquered and accumulating enough points to reach the limit chosen as the finish line to decree victory. Complicating things in Intercept is the need to grow your score not only by controlling designated points on the map, but also by performing kills, assists and helping your teammates. However, the credits obtained in this way must be ~downloaded~ in a precise point of the base, an operation which cancels any multiplier achieved up to that moment. Hence the dilemma: continue to accumulate, risking losing everything in the event of death, or settle and put them in the bank? Interesting dynamic that involves a team reflection on what to do, to avoid any friction and play as one man. Coordination which, in any case, also and perhaps above all passes from the presence of four distinct classes, equally fundamental for reaching the end of the match. The Assault is the classic good fighter from medium to close range, equipped with a machine gun and a shotgun, capable of wielding the enemy's muzzles and equipped with skills that make him temporarily stronger, faster or that allow him to be accompanied for a short period of time by a battle drone. The Marskman is similar in special powers and philosophy, devoted to the attack, but acts from a distance and its basic equipment reflects this fundamental difference. The story is still different for Tactitian, who shoots when necessary, but who is also capable of putting his three turrets into action, perhaps properly placed in strategic points, and placing a very useful shield on the ground. Finally, the Medic, as the name suggests, heals, supplies the team with ammunition packages but above all brings dead comrades back to life. Operation that otherwise costs a small but precious part of the loot obtained up to that moment. Looking for alchemy Apparently there isn't much new to discover in the Intercept that hasn't already been seen elsewhere. In fact it is a product firmly anchored to the canons of the (sub) genre, derivative, yet overall it works and entertains. The so-called AI Commander, the enemy artificial intelligence that reacts to our style of play by pouring hordes of different opponents on us, draws from a rather vast bestiary of twenty different enemies, including some bosses and old acquaintances from the series. Game after game, experience is accumulated which is needed to unlock new weapons, including those introduced by Insurgent, and to complete the Challenges that give access to customizations.aesthetic oni and other goodies. The four environments have been taken from the main campaign, so they will be familiar, but they have been revised just enough to adapt them to this new context. By playing as a team and moving well, you also get special points that can be invested to unlock temporary upgrades that are as useful as they are tasty: jetpacks, damage multipliers, heavy artillery attacks from above, powerful machine guns and the possibility of being reborn without Penalties are bonuses that are as useful as they are able to add some variety to the action. In all of this, we appreciated the decision not to simplify things too much, making the challenge quite tough at times, which will certainly help increase longevity which should still guarantee a few hours of fun. Without forgetting that after the release, another six maps will be released free of charge. Not bad considering that the sale price, for those who already own Shadow Fall but not the Season Pass, is 9.99 euros. Intercept will also be released in August in stand-alone form, independent of any other previous purchase, for around twenty euros. In that case a separate discussion will probably have to be made, but for now it is all in all reasonable to overlook the lack of originality and the standard offer by virtue of the good realization, the quantity of content and the honest price. Especially since support has been guaranteed that will extend its life in the months to come, at least until the next DLC.", "date": "2014-06-25", "grade": null}
