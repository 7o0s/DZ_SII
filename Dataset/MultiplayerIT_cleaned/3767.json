{"name": "King of Crabs", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/king-of-crabs-la-recensione.html", "text": "Sometimes we would like to know how certain ideas can emerge and establish themselves within a development team, until they become the subject of hours and hours of development, when they focus on such strange premises. This is the case of King of Crabs, the protagonist of this review, which stages a fight to the last claw between crabs (and other types of crustaceans but to a lesser extent) for domination of the seas. It is probable that the Robot Squid team took a cue from the most popular multiplayer games of the moment, such as battle royale, to come up with such a strange idea, while trying to maintain strong originality for their game. From this point of view, the mission seems really successful and King of Crabs, if nothing else, can boast of being something actually little experienced elsewhere in the vast sea of digital stores for mobile platforms. Not that the basic elements of this game are particularly new, in any case: it is in fact about surviving in a hostile environment, strengthening oneself as much as possible and fighting against rivals within an online multiplayer context, but it is the way which all this is presented is striking. We therefore find ourselves growing our crab, which increases in size visibly as it feeds on creatures and knocks down rival crabs, while becoming increasingly stronger and more resistant and being able, in this way, to progressively face the more experienced players and powerful. It is probably precisely in this sense of constant progression, made evident by a clearly visible growth in size and strength of the protagonist within short periods of time in the arena, the secret of the addiction that King of Crabs can exercise on the player, reinforcing with clear feedback and a certain sense of satisfaction deriving from the excessive growth of one's crab, the mechanism for managing the ~characters~ at the base of the entire game structure. The hard life of the crustacean King of Crabs stages a ruthless reduction to a smaller size of what is, in fact, the real life of the crustacean, subjected to the relentless food chain and natural selection. In essence, the ~big fish eat small fish~ to the nth degree and concentrated in a few minutes of action: we find ourselves moving our crab within a large shared online arena that reproduces a coastal setting as a habitat natural for shellfish. The aim is to eat the smaller creatures in order to recharge the energy that constantly decreases due to hunger and at the same time grow in size and fight with other crabs, acquiring experience points and coins to invest in the evolution of the creatures. Around the map it is also possible to find special chests containing weapons and shields capable of providing temporary bonuses to be used in clashes, although the combat system (super-simplified, since it simply requires you to run into your opponents) is based on much about the mathematical application of the odds of success based on the power level of the contestants, beyond a little skill in dosing the energy to make evasive sprints. This all boils down to building a good fighting crab, because no particular skill is required to win in fights, beyond stats. Here is the other fundamental component of King of Crabs, outside the battlefield: the management of crabs. Each game session involves a progression in terms of experience which leads, once the set objectives have been achieved, to the unlocking of new creatures, of progressive rarity and power. Being a free-to-play, it is clear where all this can end up: it is in fact also possible to win new crabs through the casino, or the classic gacha based both on the coins conquered in-game and on the pearls, which are instead the currency that can be purchased with real money. It goes without saying that the rarest crabs can be conquered more likely by spending money, but it is also true that the game is quite well balanced and allows for an important evolution even starting from the simplest and most common crabs. Each creature can in fact be enhanced by applying the experience points and skills acquired, as well as possibly being adorned with more or less rare accessories.", "date": "2019-03-15", "grade": "7.2"}
