{"name": "Scarlet Nexus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scarlet-nexus-recensione.html", "text": "The Scarlet Nexus review projects us into a world of the future where the human race has evolved, acquiring special brain abilities that formed the basis for the development of a society where information is conveyed through the mind, against the backdrop of megacities stylistically inspired by 90s Japan: a fascinating mix of illuminated signs, giant screens and cel shading. However, there is a terrible threat looming: the Strangers, creatures as pathetic as they are dangerous, who seem to come from outer space and who cyclically attack people in order to devour their brain, evidently made more greedy by the evolutionary step taken over the years. The only defense against these monsters is represented by the Foreign Suppression Forces (ESF), a special division in which militate subjects with psychic abilities capable of making a difference in the desperate fight for the salvation of the Earth. History The plot of Scarlet Nexus unfolds through twelve chapters that we will be able to face in the role of Yuito Sumeragi or Kasane Randall. The choice of the character takes place at the beginning of the campaign and influences it in a substantial way, going not only to add unpublished narrative elements on one side or the other, but also allowing us to manage a different team of fighters. Although both protagonists are gifted of the same power, psychokinesis, which allows them to lift any object and throw it violently against the enemy, they are opposing figures: Yuito is a recruit of the FSE coming from a family of important politicians, who has decided to enlist as a volunteer to defend the world from White Walkers following a traumatic event, while Kasane is an elite warrior with a cold temper and mysterious origins. Scarlet Nexus, Kasane Randall and his teammates. Both are faced with situations that quickly become complicated, a violent invasion of enemies that forces them to fight and in the background a subplot made up of machinations, secret plans, long hidden truths and governments that are guilty of the most ruthless atrocities in the name of progress and social stability. In such a confusing and controversial picture, staying true to one's principles won't be easy for the characters of Scarlet Nexus. The game requires to be completed with both Yuito and Kasane to fully express its rich narrative component, which in some moments appears excessively dilated, but undoubtedly falls within the canons that many Japanese anime have promoted over the years, and which include many dialogues and a certain degree of NPC characterization so that certain situations are represented effectively. Scarlet Nexus, a look at the accessible shelter between one mission and another. There are certainly two supporting actors who initially deserved more space precisely in order to make sense of what happens in the course of history <, but in principle the authors can reproach themselves very little from this point of view. In fact, it is possible to deepen the knowledge of one's teammates within sequences and missions which, once completed, reward us with extra maneuvers and advantages on the field.As regards the way of telling the story of the game, we appreciated the solutions adopted by Bandai Namco: semi-static anime-style sequences for the numerous dialogues present, however characterized by a direction capable of adding great dynamism, in concert with traditional scenes used to give more strength to the topical moments of the campaign. The Japanese dubbing is excellent as always, the English one is valid and surprisingly spot on, both supported by Italian subtitles. The Strangers Scarlet Nexus, the first boss gives an insight into the insane design of the White Walkers. The creatures that we will face in Scarlet Nexus certainly deserve a separate paragraph, given that they are among the craziest and most original enemies we have ever seen. There is no doubt that the Strangers are inspired by their incredible strangeness by the angelic fleets of Bayonetta, but if in the case of the PlatinumGames title everything started from ancient illustrations and biblical references, here we find an imaginary that came out of nowhere and really crazy From basic units to huge bosses, monster design is something special, an eerie patchwork of everyday objects, arms, legs, metal structures, even toys and miniatures. The Strangers seem to come out of a blender, it is as if a new Dr. Frankenstein had torn apart and stitched together parts of different animals and humans, plants and insects, food and architect elementsnici. Scarlet Nexus, Yuito and Nagi face the threat of a Stranger. Some enemies will literally blow your mind, with a promise: the bigger and weirder they are, the stronger and more resistant they are. You don't run away. The Scarlet Nexus bestiary is incredibly rich in types of opponents who not only boast a twisted and disturbing appearance, in a sort of Picasso on acid, but also have different attack maneuvers and resources, which must be memorized in order to counter effectively. All these aspects are part of a clear exercise in style that becomes the protagonist of an exciting crescendo in its own way, involving us in frenetic fights against several bosses at the same time and arriving at the end of the campaign to rattle off frankly absurd visual solutions, which will remain etched in your mind even if you have many years of video games under your belt and thought you'd already seen everything there was to see. Gameplay Scarlet Nexus, one of Yuito's special abilities in action. So let's get to the gameplay, because we'll have to eliminate these damned Strangers somehow. Well, the mechanics put in place by Scarlet Nexus are those of a very fast action RPG, undoubtedly slippery and dated in environmental interactions, which in the first stages certainly does not express its potential and can leave you a little dumbfounded, but which grows evident from chapter to chapter. We have previously mentioned the possibility of establishing bonds with one's teammates, in the context of narrative sequences or short missions that have the useful advantage of unlocking extra maneuvers. Well, all these elements contribute to the enrichment of a combat system which in the initial stages pays duty precisely because of the limited combinations and moves, but then precisely expands dramatically. Scarlet Nexus, a pyrokinetic-based fight sequence. Our character can perform two attacks with the sword, but the management of the combos appears a bit defeatist, the lock-on is handled in a weird way and you never get to chain the blows as in the best Japanese action. However, there is the whole repertoire linked to psychic powers (and the relative enhancements, which can be carried out by unlocking the elements of a rich skill tree) which changes the cards on the table, gradually adding greater thickness to the counters and introducing alternative tactics to lead to home the result even in the most complicated situations. By pressing the right trigger we will be able to lift rocks, light poles or even vehicles with the thought and hurl them with force against the Strangers, preferably at the end of a sequence of blows to be able to give even more vigor to the telekinetic attack. With the left trigger we will instead be able to activate more complex mechanisms, which give rise to highly spectacular scenes: tankers that are made to shine, barrels raised and then crushed on the enemy, stone columns used to hammer the monster on duty and even walls on which to jump to try a sort of mix between flying carpet and bumper cars. Scarlet Nexus, Brain Drive mode allows you to solve very complicated situations. Then there are the powers of our teammates, two of which will actively follow us into battle on the basis of specific tactical indications (attack the same target, attack different targets, give your best, act with caution, etc.), which we can take borrow by pressing the right backbone (or the left one, if we have developed the bonds enough) and selecting them with the main buttons on the controller to be able to use their abilities for a few seconds. This is where the gameplay of Scarlet Nexus really opens up, delivering us offensive possibilities so varied that at the end of the campaign you will be spoiled for choice: from pyrokinesis to super speed, from teleportation to invisibility, from clairvoyance to identify invisible opponents to supplementary psychokinesis, from electric shocks to doubling, from invulnerability to all a series of special shots that can be activated during the most agitated moments. Added to this is the Brain Drive mode, which transports us to a sort of virtual dimension where we dictate the law, but which cannot be sustained for long. What do you want to buy? The RPG component of Scarlet Nexus stands out in the amount of objects that can be bought or sold at the inevitable archivist's banquet, where we will also be able to save progress and see our vital energy restored at the same time. Don't be afraid - the enemies won't come back to life when we do! With the money earned from missions and the sale of data collected around (which thoughit could have been made faster, instead of requiring the selection of each individual item) we will be able to obtain health recovery jellies, plug-ins that are used to improve the characteristics of the characters and of course more and more powerful weapons. There is also no shortage of gifts, to be delivered to one's companions between one mission and another to further strengthen ties. Structure and scenarios Scarlet Nexus, the huge Tokyo Tower in the main scenery - spectacular. We have so far exalted several positive aspects of Scarlet Nexus, but it must be clarified that the new production by Bandai Namco is not without defects, which can be found almost entirely in the context of its structure and in the use that is made of the scenarios, often and willingly recycled in order to increase the amount of missions available and artificially extend the duration of the campaign.How long does it take to complete the game? Proceeding straight, without dying too much (even on the normal difficulty level some enemies will give you a hard time), ignoring the optional missions and without completing all the events relating to bonds, it took us just under eighteen hours to get to the end credits with Yuito. By doing all there is to do, however, one easily breaks through the thirty-hour barrier. Scarlet Nexus, Yuito and his companions during a cutscene. It is also possible to replay the campaign from scratch with the second character, perhaps using the New Game Plus to not have to unlock all the upgrades and skills again. As mentioned, this is not an end in itself: facing the story in the role of Yuito or Kasane allows you to discover a whole series of additional narrative elements, as well as to count on the support of different companions, with the relative powers, during the fights. Having said that, in terms of settings Scarlet Nexus proves dangerously similar to God Eater (even the interface for transferring from one area to another is very similar, in truth) and this entails the fact of returning often and willingly in the same places to fight new groups of Strangers or to start unexpected clashes with our potential allies, based on some implications that we are not here to reveal to you. Scarlet Nexus, the highway scenery. This expedient, while justified by the need to characterize the characters we have already spoken about, unfortunately takes away from the solidity of the experience, making it repetitive and sometimes even exhausting, all the more so given that the creation of the scenarios appears very dated in terms of interactions. Some glimpses are literally wonderful, see the urban sections of the initial map, where a gigantic version of the Tokyo tower stands out above the ESF headquarters; but there are an abundance of invisible walls, you slip into the setting and can't ~live~ it in any way. More attention to locations would no doubt have elevated the Scarlet Nexus experience, but it's clear and it is clear that there were sacrifices to be made on the budget front and the developers identified a possible compromise precisely in the way in which the characters move in the game's fascinating futuristic world, which is thus reduced to a series of corridors that are sometimes anonymous, with a strongly old-gen connotation, which are recycled a little too often in relation to the duration of the campaign. Technical realization Scarlet Nexus boasts excellent use of cel shading. Let's dwell on the locations for a moment, because as you have certainly seen the main city of Suoh (but also Seiran) is a truly splendid, inspired and fascinating setting, which thanks to cel shading gains a lot and looks like something out of a Japanese animated film . Through the use of a combination of cubemaps and screen space reflection, the developers have also managed to create convincing reflections on the glass and glossy surfaces, adding further thickness to the visual sector. Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, most of the other scenarios it doesn't boast the same level of care and inspiration, but it is above all the interaction that is too limited, giving the feeling that the characters are whizzing around the maps without some contextualization. There are certainly shots that do justice to areas that seem really trivial in-game, such as the motorway, but in principle the alternation of ups and downs appears quite evident. Scarlet Nexus, another look at Suoh. Fortunately the same discourse does not apply to the characters, who are undoubtedly among the best ever seen in the field of cel-shaded graphics productions.
