{"name": "Chi vuol essere un... vampiro?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76461-scene-it-twilight-chi-vuol-essere-un-vampiro.html", "text": "Scene it? presents the new chapter of the series, this time monographic and entirely dedicated to the first episode of the saga created by Stephenie Meyer. Although at this juncture the attention is focused on a single film, the game aims to follow the same outline of the previous editions: once again the multiple choice quizzes are the masters, some of which are based on short films taken from the cinematographic work. However, the player is not only called upon to answer the many quizzes proposed, but will also have to come across different types of game, such as recognizing a character through a blurred image, searching for the missing detail in a frame of the film or even rearranging of some scenes in chronological order. Also in this Scene it? time is money: the fastest will in fact be able to collect a few more points and climb the general classification. In a dark and mysterious atmosphere you are thus called to dig into your memory to remember even the most minute details of the events experienced by the dark vampire Edward and his beloved Bella, earn maximum points and unlock new content in the Bonus section. Dedicated to the fans From the beginning, the intent of the game is clear, that is to test the most ardent fans of the series, even if here we only talk about Twilight and never refer to the second chapter, New Moon. In fact, the proposed questions are so specific, asking for even the most unthinkable details, as to be complex, if not downright impossible for those who have ~limited~ to seeing the film only once. Being a die-hard fan could also be the key to not suffering from the fact that the two game modes presented are almost identical. The first proposal consists of five rounds plus the ~twilightning round~, where points are lost for each wrong question; in the second, Flexible Game, the only difference is the number of questions to be addressed (10, 20 or 30). However, both choices lead to the same types of quizzes: at this point, the distinction between the two seems superfluous, indeed redundant. In the relative monotony that characterizes the title, one must recognize a certain attempt to make everything more varied; in fact, although some of the topics discussed often become more and more recurring (after all, it is a single film, not too long or complicated), the approximately 500 questions try to range as much as possible between the various details, also involving absolutely secondary scenes and characters . Finally, after answering countless questions, it is possible to unlock bonuses: one would expect something interesting, like some fun mini-game or special content, but none of this. The unlocked bonuses are nothing more than a collection of images of actors and scenes from the film which, although very rich, does not add anything new to the title. Those who aren't that passionate are better off heading towards the emergency exits... Minimalist or stark? Not even the aesthetic aspect of the game manages to ~handle~ the situation. As a backdrop to the proposed quizzes, there are a few repetitive, albeit pretty, drawings inspired by some locations in the film. While on the one hand these have the value and ability to recreate ~dark~ atmospheres thanks to the use of dark colors and the rain effect, on the other they only fuel the monotony of a title that is all too equal to itself. On the other hand, the presence of clips taken from the film is decidedly positive, which manage to wake up the drowsy player from time to time and allow, if nothing else, better concentration. In this panorama, the worst aspect is perhaps that represented by the sound elements. The music that tries at all costs to catapult the player into the Twilight story is so short and almost left to chance as to be absolutely superfluous. A further note of demerit goes to the narrator's voice: he tries his best to interpret the very few jokes in a melodramatic tone, but unfortunately it is repetitive to the point of being boring. To conclude, the absolute lack of multiplayer mode establishes once and for all the repetitiveness of a game that just can't add even a healthy pinch of challenge. All things that perhaps a true fanatic would never notice.", "date": "2010-04-23", "grade": null}
