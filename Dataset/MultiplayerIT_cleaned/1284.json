{"name": "Gun Metal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gun-metal_a.html", "text": "The walking shadow The mechanics that regulate the action are equally simple and can be summed up in one word: console. From the first moments of the game it is clear how Gun Metal is expressly designed for an audience that loves action above all other aspects... in fact it is much easier to play it with a joypad similar to the PlayStation one than with the classic combination for PC, mouse / keyboard. There is even an automatic aiming system available that allows you to disengage quite a lot eliminating the need to be precise. But let's take a step back and go back to the menus. By starting a game you will be able to choose the armament of your mech both in ground mode (when it is transformed into a robot) and in air mode (when it becomes a fighter). Each mode will have four weapons available divided by functionality. From the first moments of the game it is clear how Gun Metal is expressly designed for an audience that loves action above all other aspects The walking shadow Each feature will have three different choice options (unlockable as you progress through the game), for a total of 24 different weapons. A rather simple system but given the type of game it turns out to be quite adequate. Choosing our mission in a linear list (in the sense that finishing a mission always unlocks only one more) we arrive at the briefing phase which is rather indicative: generally a few lines of text and a map with a handful of symbols are enough above to explain all of our tasks. Once you have started the first mission / tutorial and taken control of the robot, you are immediately thrown into the action, where the only task will be to shoot frantically destroying enemy tanks. After a ground battle and an air battle, the first level is successfully completed. You immediately notice the frenetic and non-stop action that makes up the gameplay and which will be even more adrenaline-pumping in the following levels. The beauty is that this simplicity is fun. A candle too short Gun Metal is divided into 14 missions of which only 4 took more than 10 minutes to complete, the others, in some cases, lasting just under 3 minutes. No full motion video or cut scenes created with the game's graphics engine were inserted between one mission and another. The cut scenes are not present even during the unfolding of the levels. The result is a narrative poverty that hasn't been recorded in a PC title for a long time. A little more effort in this sense could also be put to eliminate the impression of playing a sequence of levels with no narrative links between them. The total duration of the whole is around 3 hours calculating the times that you are killed and that you are forced to replay an entire mission (there is never a way to save but given the brevity of some levels this is not exactly a bad thing) . A little bit compared to current standards and also compared to games considered very short anyway (such as Max Payne). The replayability factor is also very poor given that, having successfully completed the 14 maps and seen the final movie, nothing is unlocked that makes repeating the levels attractive. However, it must be said that if you accept the fact that you don't need to do anything else but shoot and that your brain can go on a holiday for a few minutes during games of Gun Metal, then you will have fun and a lot too, especially in battles with larger ships that in many cases resemble another completely action-oriented title: Incoming. Lights and colors Gun Metal shares something else with Incoming: the continuous and almost obsessive search for the spectacular. The plays of light are continuous, the explosions follow one another without stopping and in some cases the frenetic search for visual beauty creates some problems in terms of gameplay; like when you find yourself looking at the sun and the screen goes completely white or like when in the middle of battle explosions don't allow you to understand what's going on generating a certain sense of confusion. The work done by Yeti Studios is still excellent and does not admit too many criticisms also because everything is very fluid even on computers that are not exactly very powerful. The models of the enemy vehicles and above all of the mech piloted by the player, are well done and pleasant to look at, as well as the scenarios which are equipped with well-designed textures and many elements which determine very beautiful and never monotonous scenarios, even if decidedly little ones. From the sound point of view, little to report: there are some accompanying songs that do their job without infamy and without praise and there are good sound effects suitable for the occasion. Conclusions Gun Metal is a fun game but not a masterpiece. Yesdefinitely better than some pure action games released recently (for example Bad Boys II) but still unattractive for those used to FPS of the quality of Far Cry or Painkiller. A fun game and nothing more that can pass a few pleasant hours thanks to its undemanding action and its inherent spectacularity. If you are looking for something a little deeper and more long-lived, leave it alone. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a fun, unpretentious and well-priced game, Gun Metal is for you. Pros: Spectacular Fun and never boring Good variety Affordable price Cons: Too short Superficial in many aspects Confusing in some moments The unbearable lightness of being There are games that keep you busy for weeks. Some even for months. They are complex games that require attention and attention to many details, allow the player to prolong the gaming experience almost beyond the game itself by offering unlimited expansion possibilities (think of a last generation random FPS), or they are so vast that they guarantee a very high longevity thanks to the amount of possibilities offered (think of Morrowind). Gun Metal does not fit into either of the above categories. It flows like a breath of wind and leaves little or nothing behind, making it simply ~easy~, without pretending to be anything but a ~pyrotechnic~ pastime. The story told by the game could alone summarize the philosophy of the same: on board a particularly powerful mech you must be able to win a war that has reached a stalemate.", "date": "2004-06-15", "grade": null}
