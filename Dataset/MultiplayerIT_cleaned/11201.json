FaceBreaker winks at a young audience that seeks a carefree pastime in video games without expecting depth peaks or overly complicated titles. The learning curve is rapid and reaches its peak after very few games, as the game is simple, too much. Parry, direct hit, special hit, grab, very few combos, everything is learned right away and almost nothing else is learned with experience. Our character can duck, parrying and counterattacking, with a mix of stone-paper-scissors strategy and execution speed. The real pity is the balance of difficulty that undermines the structure of this gameplay: the CPU is too fast, too strong, even at the lowest difficulty level its combos will enter our defense devastatingly, with no possibility of dodging blows . The learning curve is rapid and reaches its peak after very few games, as the game is simple, too much Smashing faces can be fun in a video game. On the contrary, our attacks will most of the time be thwarted by a frustrating opposing intelligence that leaves no way out. The main mode is the one called ~Brawl For It All~, a classic elimination tournament. First of all we start with the editor of the characters, in which it is possible to set our face through the webcam of Xbox Live, taking a frontal photo and another in profile; then we move on to the body, giving a tone to the muscles and choosing the body we prefer; finally the details are adjusted, a name is assigned and we jump into the fray. The fighters are all well characterized and differentiated in terms of movements, animation and moves, as well as the style that accompanies them in clothing and background music. The major work was evidently done in the design and customization phase, however leaving out the actual playability of the title, which is the most important part. In FaceBreaker it is possible to create videos of your performances, edit the replay, cut it and share it with our friends, in order to make our athletic feats public. Bread and work, bread and work, they said. Yes, but the salami? The animations, just as already appreciated in Fifa Street 3, are extremely fluid and varied. A large part of the work has been done precisely in this, refining the motion capture, linking the movements and giving convincing facial expressions (which, however, are only noticeable in still images and replays). However, some problems arise with the timing: often the CPU seems to have a consistent - and inexplicable - advantage on the blows landed: while using the parry with caution, many of the opponent's attacks still hit the target. With more than excellent but poorly calibrated animations, the feeling of helplessness arises spontaneously. When playing multiplayer against a human opponent (via Xbox Live or live) this factor is automatically eliminated. In this case, letting himself be played, the essence of FaceBreaker finally comes to light. In any case, while disputing fights on equal terms, no type of depth emerges other than continuously pressing the usual two attack buttons and occasionally the block button. no kind of depth emerges other than continuously pressing the usual two attack buttons and occasionally the block one Bread and work, bread and work, they said. Yes, but the salami? FaceBreaker ends there, without pretensions and without offering anything else. Inheriting the Fight Night graphics engine, the settings have been created with the same graphic quality: warm colours, lots of polygons and plays of light that enhance the realism of the ringside. The athletes on the game dial are modeled in an equally compelling cartoon style, with good use of triangles and hair, clothing and face animations. Some sporadic defects such as polygonal interpenetrations and clipping (minor) are noticed from time to time, obviously without damaging the gaming experience. The audio sector includes a good soundtrack, as per EA tradition, but a quantity of effects and voices that can be counted on the fingers of two hands. Apart from a short initial curtain before each match, the wrestlers almost never open their mouths to speak, and the noises coming from the ring are limited to a minimum. Regardless of all this, FaceBreaker does not have a story mode, there are no secondary objectives, it does not include special options or any other diversion. Basically, it's all about creating matches and challenging opponents. Definitely little. Comment FaceBreaker is a very gameor simple, perhaps banal. Delving into what it has to offer, we discover nothing that cannot be learned in the first few minutes of the game, and moreover it is stingy with modes, options, tournaments and sub-games that could lengthen its life and make it more attractive. The AI is frustrating and always seems to have an advantage over the player, even on the lowest difficulty level. FaceBreaker's good animations therefore don't seem to have consistent timing, helping the CPU with attacks and combos. The graphic sector is well-finished and well-characterized especially in the settings, and with many wrestlers very diversified in style and look. Of note is the possibility of creating new ones thanks to the good editor which includes the use of the Xbox Live webcam. Other than that, it's a missed opportunity. Pro Look and character animations Character editor with Xbox 360 Live Vision Annoying and poorly balanced AI No fancy story and modes Simplistic gameplay Xbox 360 - Goals FaceBreaker provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock. By completing the tournament mode with excellent performances and with all the wrestlers, 525 points are unlocked, all in a few hours. 65 points comes extra for creating a player with Live Vision and completing the same mode. The remaining ones are obtained by winning online multiplayer races or by fulfilling special requests, such as making the opponent lose consciousness 15 times. Definitely a generous game, from this point of view.", "date": "2008-09-12", "grade": null}
