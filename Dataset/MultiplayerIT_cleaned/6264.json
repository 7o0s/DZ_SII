Here, Chaos Rings III is the mobile equivalent of a plate of eggplant parmesan with a sea view: it is perhaps too big and heavy to be a smartphone game and perhaps it would be better to exploit it in other venues, but it is also too good not to take advantage of it. Despite having a three in its name, Chaos Rings III is actually the fourth installment of a saga designed by Square Enix to bring the plot and complexity of a jRPG to Android and iOS devices that clearly go against the trend of today's fashions. Chaos Rings III condenses the beauty of a jRPG into a great mobile title A triple A done and finished While everyone is ready to churn out yet another free RPG weighed down by repetitive mechanics and in-app purchases, the developers have decided to create a game that is undoubtedly more expensive for the sector, but which can stand perfectly on its own feet, offering hours of dialogues, fights and quests without even asking you for a penny, despite the fact that some game mechanics seem to be made also thinking about any microtransactions. Chaos Rings is a triple-A title done and done, with dozens of hours of gameplay waiting for us, only instead of playing it on a big screen using a pad we'll be playing it on the tablet or phone and using our fingers. The story of the game takes full advantage of the classic jRPG themes: a boy, Nasca, raised by adoptive relatives on Neo Pascal's space station dreams one day of following in the footsteps of his parents, indomitable explorers who lost their lives on the planet Marble Blue to seek access to a magical and beautiful place called Heaven. To get to his destination, Nasca will have to become a Hunter, a soldier trained in all types of battle and equipped with the necessary license to land on the planet. It will be just starting the course to become a Hunter that he will meet his most important travel companions: the beautiful Leary and the arrogant Daisuke, with whom he will share most of his vicissitudes. During the adventure he will obviously discover that he has powers and abilities of which he was totally unaware and there will also be enemies who become friends, friendships as solid as a rock, mourning, funny scenes, betrayals and epic moments. In short, think of any of the situations you've experienced in an RPG and you'll find it here too. The power of cards The whole mythology of Chaos Rings III revolves around the Gifts, or objects that can be combined in various ways to create artifacts endowed with enormous power. The main use of the Gifts is the creation of Genes, i.e. cards that contain the spirit of the greatest heroes of Marble Blue, which are nothing more than the classic spells and evocations based on various elements such as fire, water, ice, air and earth. There is also a neutral element, which is not affected nor does it affect the damage based on the possible element of the creature we are attacking. Being the geniuses of the cards, they are obviously collectible and interchangeable at will. Each card has a rarity index and a level, which will increase as we use it. We will have to try to collect as many as possible, both to level up (each gene discovered will in fact allow us to gain a level), and to literally have an ace up our sleeve for every situation. The possibility of using and exchanging various genes, even during the fight, unties the characters from a very specific class, we will decide who will be the healer, who the tank and who the damage dealer, obviously trying to set up a strategy that also takes into character stats account. The genes can also be merged with each other to generate new and powerful mutations, also sacrificing any Gift in the process, with a system that will sound familiar to those who have played Persona 4 and the previous chapters of the saga. To get new cards, upgrade them, increase inventory space and buy more powerful weapons Chaos Rings III has a special currency that can be obtained in two ways: with side missions or by waiting for a token to be given away every day. A system that seems to have been borrowed from free-to-play games and which may not bode well, but which fortunately proves to be minimally invasive. It is enough to carry out a few secondary tasks to find yourself full of tokens and in any case the game has such a difficulty and pace that we will hardly be able to face the enemies in front of us. The combat system starts from quantor already seen in previous chapters to further expand the possibilities. Compared to the past, in fact, we will be able to control more characters, which will allow us to create even more powerful combined attacks. Instead, the familiar ~break~ system returns, that is an indicator that tells us if we are winning or losing a fight and which will increase the damage of whoever is in the lead at that moment. Maintaining a good level of break and setting a high pace to the fights is essential to win the most difficult battles. In fact, even the toughest opponents, once they have achieved a good level of break, will prove to be much easier when they find themselves back against the wall. For the rest, the system is very reminiscent of all the other Square Enix productions, with a real-time turn system in which it is possible to delay the opponent's moves with critical hits or spells that distance the moment in which he can decide what to do. As far as the structure is concerned, after a fairly substantial introduction we will finally be able to decide how to move within the game universe and choose whether to follow the main story or do some side missions. These assignments usually involve returning to a previously visited spot and killing a certain monster, retrieving an item, or talking to someone. Few side quests are related to the main thread but almost all of them offer interesting points of view on the world of Chaos Rings III that will delight those who love to get lost in the game world. An interesting aspect is that the side missions change every day, so it's very easy to completely forget the main story and get lost in them, as if the world wasn't waiting for your intervention to save it. As already happened in the previous chapters, every time we visit an area we will be able to decide the level of challenge, so as to never risk finding ourselves faced with fights that are neither too boring nor too difficult. Thanks to this system, even the side missions that require you to return to the first areas of the game will still be fun to play. Side quests aren't the only way to increase the game's already high longevity. In addition to the Story Mode there is a so-called ~Battle Mode~ in which we will be able to submit our party to various challenges with which to obtain experience and some interesting drops. Within this mode there will also be challenges available only at certain times of the day which will obviously allow access to the most interesting equipment. This represents an excellent addition that allows you to avoid ~grinding~ in case there were no interesting assignments within our reach and we felt the need to enhance our cards. Vast and fascinating, but not perfect Visually, Chaos Rings III is truly a fascinating game. The landscapes are vast and colorful, an unusual aspect for an average dark series, with monsters and characters full of details. Of course, if you don't like the typical jRPG character design, you might turn up your nose at yet another kid with strange hair and dressed in an absurd way who wields swords of impossible shapes, but for anyone who loves the genre Chaos Rings III is a real style guide. The interface is also extremely accurate and able to present all the information without adding too much weight, providing only the information and buttons needed at that moment. Obviously there are some small flaws: the game is in fact in Japanese, subtitled entirely in English, so if you don't know the Albion language well you can also forget it, the same goes if you are looking for a quick bus stop game, Chaos Rings III it's a title that requires commitment and dedication and is likely to give you a stiff neck. Then there is the obstacle of the price, 20 is a figure that not everyone is willing to spend on a mobile title, even if the expense is amply repaid by the longevity of the game. Finally, even if the title is divided into separate modules that we can download separately and delete when finished, we are still talking about 3 GB of memory space.", "date": "2015-06-12", "grade": "9.0"}
