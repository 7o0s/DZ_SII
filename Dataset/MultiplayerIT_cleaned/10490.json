From Fps that retrace some of the most salient phases of this tragic conflict to RTS (strategic in real time) passing even through some platforms, every videogame genre has seen the protagonist, sometimes even in a humorous key, at least one product dedicated to the aforementioned historical period. Including those focused on the air battles of this war. This is the case of Ubisoft's Heroes Over Europe, a natural sequel to that Heroes Over Pacific released a few years ago on PlayStation 2 and Xbox where it enjoyed some critical and public success, perhaps also thanks to the relative lack of diffusion of titles on the subject on consoles. which has recently appeared on the shelves of Italian shops. The game allows you to relive in the role of one of the three protagonists (the American Tom Forrest, the English Danny Miller and the New Zealander Will West) the most important campaigns of the Second World War of which he retraces some of the most significant battles through several scenarios and different missions ranging from the ~pretend war~ in the months following the German invasion of Poland, characterized by few military operations in continental Europe, at the beginning of the French campaign in May 1940, up to the defense of the British coasts and the fall of Berlin. Given the type of game, the settings and the release period on the close market, the comparison between this and the other genre title recently released in stores, namely Il-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey, becomes inevitable. Pure arcade But while the aforementioned 505 Games-Gaijin Entertainment title focuses almost entirely on the wildest realism, that of Transmission Games, the product development team we are analyzing, focuses its gameplay on a typically arcade immediacy, aiming straight cloche, it is appropriate to say, towards those players who do not want to waste too much time learning complicated commands but want to dive right into the game. The control of the aircraft in game is therefore very intuitive and satisfying, sacrificing the typical realism of other productions of the genre in favor of a certain simplicity of maneuver and consequently of a greater playability. And this also by selecting the ~pro~ option (the product in fact offers two types of control, the other being arcade). Even if characterized by the classic statistics such as agility, speed and firepower, which prove to be decisive depending on the objectives of the mission, the various aircraft present in the Heroes database, about forty between fighters and bombers, do not present particular differences between them in check. One analog stick is used to adjust the engine's power input, the other acts as a yoke and thus pilots the aircraft. The use of weapons is reserved for the console pad triggers. Simpler than that... With these few inputs, the gamer can control his aircraft to face missions characterized by different environments and objectives that are not limited to the usual combat between aircraft, especially in the main single-player mode which consists of a campaign that it winds through more than fifteen very long scenarios. In addition to the canonical firefights, there are in fact missions of reconnaissance, patrolling of key areas of Europe, escort of large aircraft during long crossings or operations in which one is called upon to destroy positions, factories or columns of enemy tanks in movement, obviously avoiding the flak. Hunting the enemy That the game is more a shooter than a real flight simulator is also confirmed by the specific feature implemented by the developers called Masterstroke, a particular game situation that exploits the hyper-abused bullet time of Matrixian memory. How it works: once you frame the opponent to hit a circular bar begins to fill up around the crosshair. When it reaches the limit, it is possible to slow down time and frame closely the enemy vehicle you are trying to shoot down by pressing the L1 key to identify its weak points, indicated by a particular luminescence. Once these have been identified, the viewfinder turns yellow and moving it precisely on these points you have to fire to destroy or force the opponent to make a crash landing with a single ~shot~. By performing more Master Strokes in a row, a series of combos can be generated which, in addition to being very useful for taking down more enemies perhaps within aan entire squadron launched to attack, allow you to increase the user's score and unlock some bonus objectives present in the missions, as well as increase your ranking at the end of the same. To complete the gameplay picture of the game there are a good dose of action, practically unlimited ammunition, a fully automatic targeting and targeting system, aircraft managed by the gamer resistant to dozens of shots, and everything you can expect from simplified gameplay. But don't be fooled by what you've read up to now: the level of challenge is still valid thanks to a well-calibrated enemy AI that adapts to the game system according to the missions. In addition to the various missions in single mode, there are four options for online multiplayer for up to sixteen players at the same time. These modes are the one called Duel, which represents the classic challenge in which everyone fights against everyone in several rounds. Then we have the team Duel, which differs from the previously mentioned for the team arrangement of the players, and finally Survivor and team Survivor, where the main objective as suggested by the same title for both is to stay alive alone ( or with members of their squadron) until the end of the game. These game options do not shine for originality, it is true, but they are extremely fun to play and can also count on an excellent realization since there is no lag or latency of any kind. Playstation 3 trophies Heroes Over Europe offers the player 43 Trophies, of which 21 bronze, 20 silver, 1 gold and 1 platinum. The prizes are linked as always in these cases to various aspects of the game and to unlock them all it will be necessary to complete particular events. These can be related to the number or type of enemy planes and vehicles destroyed, to the completion of various game modes or a certain number of objectives in all available options, to particular aspects of multiplayer missions. While to receive the coveted Platinum it is necessary to obtain all the Gold, Silver and Bronze Trophies. Graphics and sound From a visual point of view Heroes Over Europe has an engine that appears to be discreet but which in reality shows some defects on deeper analysis. In particular, there are annoying pop-ups and a sometimes unstable frame-rate, elements which do not affect playability but certainly make players turn up their noses and clash profoundly with the non-optimal definition of the environment in which the textures used for the ~coverings~ are certainly not particularly complex and therefore do not justify the above defects. However, it must be said that if you limit yourself to an overview and if you do not descend too much in altitude while remaining in flight, the graphics of the game are pleasing to the eye, with the aerial models created with great detail even though they do not reach the level quality of the usual IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey, and particle effects of excellent workmanship. Explosions, flames, tracers, everything is rendered quite well. The original vintage videos used to explain to gamers the events involving the protagonists and the evolution of the facts are beautiful. Final notes for the sound sector. It features a well-made Italian dubbing, an effective and insightful soundtrack, that is, suitable for the purpose it is intended for, and audio effects which, although not very varied, adequately perform the task for which they were included in the game.", "date": "2009-10-06", "grade": "7.0"}
