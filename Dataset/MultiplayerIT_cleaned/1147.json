{"name": "Crash Bandicoot Twinsanity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-bandicoot-twinsanity.html", "text": "Twinsanity is an adventure set in a freely explorable 3D world, and which sees our crazy marsupial allied for the first time with his eternal enemy, Doctor Cortex, to try to stop the insane conquering plans of a new common enemy, such Evil Twin. It goes without saying that this gimmick is above all a pretext to motivate the presence of the dynamic duo as a couple, and the consequent launch of a new type of character control. It is therefore easy to understand how the thing was conceived to create a theoretically innovative gameplay (at least for the series) which takes advantage of the aforementioned alliance to try to bring a breath of fresh air to a title that is now too linear in concept, rather than for needs of plot. Controlling Crash and Cortex will certainly not be easy and the constant quarrels between the two rivals will give life to a whole series of gags and absurd situations that will serve as a comic interlude between one phase of the exploration and another, but will also be the premise for new challenges in the various levels to explore. If in the hottest phases of the exploration, that is when enemies are encountered, poor Dr Cortex becomes a real weapon used by the smiling marsupial against the opponents, in others the rivalry between the two and the various fisticuffs that will follow will return useful for example to overcome certain particularly difficult scenarios, such as when in a certain section we will witness the evolution of the two characters intent on fighting each other in a rolling tangle of bodies that will make them look almost like a crazy sphere to be managed through underground tunnels. Old-fashioned... The controls appear rather simple and immediate, as per tradition, and the things to do, despite the novelty of 3D, tend to be the same as always. Jump, break crates, collect items. But then, you're wondering what's new, relevant about this CT? Little. Unfortunately, Crash's new adventure brings to mind all its predecessors right from the start. It is the classic title that can entice you to play only if you love the character and are not looking for particular innovations in a platform. Otherwise it gets tired in the long run and monotony reigns supreme. A couple of years ago it could have been fun to run left and right collecting apples or breaking objects while spinning like crazy, but today, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, videogamers are too well used to other similar but qualitatively better productions to settle for this old-fashioned way to play a platformer. Among other things, the 3D stage's to explore are not very vast and consequently do not offer the size that one would expect from a product of the kind released in 2004. Finally, a very serious programming error should be noted: when you return to certain areas already explore, not only will you find the enemies from before happily wandering around the area, but also the respective Bosses defeated just before, complete with CG movies, which you will have to fight again! In fact, you will therefore be forced to redo and relive the same thing over and over again if you find yourself returning to the same scenario several times... Technically, speaking of graphics, the Traveller's Tales title remains in line with everything else: nothing exceptional. If in some points of the adventure the scenarios appear well defined even though they don't leave one crying out for a miracle, in other points the same appears bare and not very detailed, above all when the camera, not always stable, approaches the objects, bringing to mind some productions for the old psx. In short, to have a clear idea, just think of a very nice Playstation game run on Ps2 (where some applicable filters tend to blur and ~spread~ the pixels). The result is a nice hybrid but nothing more. Luckily the color palette used is good, at least it visually ~covers~ some imperfections (for example, the sea is chromatically splendid). The same thing can be said for the audio sector: the jingles that will accompany you for the entire duration of your adventure will appear amusing at first, but after a while they will make you want to throttle their ~composer~ by pushing the less frantic between you to mute the volume of the TV and turn on the stereo. On the other hand, the Italian dubbing of the characters, especially in the CG interludes, are as always of excellent workmanship and more than discreetly characterize our virtual friends. Conclusions Despite his 36-tooth smile, poor Crash has little to laugh about this time. Fun, immediate, but unfortunately outdated, especially when compared to other products of the genre that are much more refined and varied, Crash Twinsanity perhaps pays for having arrived on the shelveswings of the shops in its new guise clearly lagging behind the competition, which on the other hand did earlier and better in terms of quality what the guys from Traveller's Tales set out to achieve in this project. What until a few years ago might have seemed the ne plus ultra of platformers, today appears only a simple alternative for those who, from a similar title, are not only looking for fun without frills, not caring about the depth and variety of the gameplay. Of course, Crash's sympathy has remained intact, but the feeling of already seen, of hackneyed situations, immediately diminishes the desire to play Twinsanity to the end. At least for most. Ultimately recommended only to the most ardent fans of Mr Smile, perhaps the target audience of the developers of this game. Pros: Funny and ironic. Crash always retains its charm. Four playable characters. Cons: It's the ~usual~ Crash... Graphically not up to the Ps2. Level design not always inspired. Pretty linear. He was the first real mascot of the Playstation and undoubtedly one of its symbolic characters, as well as one of the ~heroes~ of the most popular video games of recent years, as demonstrated by the many games inspired by him, and the large number of gadgets that they have always accompanied the release on the videogame market, where all sorts of objects that bore its brand were literally snapped up in a short time. We're talking about Crash Bandicoot, the very nice marsupial with a dazzling smile who entertained us so much with his bizarre adventures at the time of 32 Bit. Yet, today, despite everything, its popularity appears to be waning, both because the proliferation of increasingly beautiful and sophisticated platform titles are tough bones to face in a hypothetical challenge for the scepter of leader of the genre, and because while the aforementioned titles have been able to adapt to the new quality standards offered by the Sony Monolith in the technical field, on the other hand our ~spinning marsupial~ has not done so, it has remained stationary, almost folding in on itself, failing to fully exploit its enormous potential, probably even at due to the abandonment of the series by its original creators, the brilliant Naughty Dog, not for nothing the authors of the excellent Jak and Daxter trilogy, on the same console. In fact Crash Bandicoot has remained as if in limbo, that of the games that more than others have struggled and suffered the leap from one generation of consoles to another, fossilizing on an old and stale style and gameplay. But let's proceed in order and let's go now into the intricacies of this Crash Twinsanity, trying to analyze and understand if this second episode is finally up to its fame.", "date": "2004-11-09", "grade": null}
