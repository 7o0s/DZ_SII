{"name": "Great Legends Vikings", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/great-legends-vikings.html", "text": "Scrolling fighting games and shoot'em-ups are probably the two favorite genres of videogame nostalgics, either for the strong emotions they were able to give during the 80s and 90s, or for their progressive abandonment by developers with the transition to polygon graphics. The current mobile gaming scene is reminiscent of that period, so a reference to classics like Golden Ax and Final Fight was absolutely a must. None other than a Swedish company, GlobalFun, has taken charge of this task, which with Great Legends Vikings has not only called into question the genre of scrolling fighting games on mobile phones, but has also tried to increase its depth by multiplying the modes of game: in addition to trying our hand at the story mode, we will be able to directly select an already unlocked stage, face the bosses in sequence or access an exciting survival game. As a mighty Viking warrior, good old Odin can slaughter his opponents with a series of powerful maneuvers. Repeatedly pressing the FIRE button (or the 5 key on the numeric pad) results in a devastating combo, doing it while acting on the joystick activates some alternative moves such as the headbutt or the trip. By pressing left or right twice, the character starts running and can charge opponents by pressing FIRE. During a combo, you can push the joystick in the direction of the enemy to grab him and perform a grapple. Suddenly going in the opposite direction and pressing FIRE instead, the character will begin to spin on itself, smashing any enemies in the vicinity (but then remaining stunned for a few moments). Each successful hit raises the fury bar: once filled, we can hold down FIRE to call down very powerful flashes that eliminate all opponents on the screen. It is clear that we will also have to pay attention to another bar, that of our vital energy: each attack immediately causes it to drop a little, and it can be restored by breaking the barrels found in the locations and collecting the huge steaks that come out of them. An energy indicator is also present for each opponent we will face, and for the bosses in particular we will have to pay close attention to it: as in the most classic of scrolling fighting games, this type of enemy has a precise modus operandi that must be studied to understand when it is the right time to attack. Technically, this new GlobalFun title is truly exceptional and we often forget that we are playing with a mobile phone: all the sprites are drawn really well, with a high level of detail, but above all they boast convincing animations. The surprising thing is not so much having achieved these results for a single character, but the fact that in Great Legends Vikings there are so many sprites: in addition to the protagonist, we will be able to see a large number of different enemies and bosses. A similar argument can be made for the scenarios, characterized by excellent color choices, which boast three levels of scrolling in parallax, some interactable elements (the barrels to be broken) and succeed in the arduous task of not being visually repetitive. As far as the sound is concerned, the developers have done everything to put it on the same level as the graphics, missing the target only due to the known incompatibilities, in this sense, between the various terminals: the introductory music gives way to individual sound effects during the game, which however do not shine in quality or quantity. The control system manages to be immediate and intuitive despite the large number of actions that can be performed: everything can be done by combining the joystick and the 5 key, which is truly a respectable result.
