{"name": "Breathedge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/breathedge-recensione.html", "text": "You've probably forgotten the name, but Breathedge was a fairly talked-about project during 2018 when its Early Access version hit Steam. Two and a half years and a good amount of updates later, the title is finally ready for its 1.0 version and we got to try it a few days early. Between a stellar journey and an immortal chicken, Breathedge attempts to go beyond the appearance of a minor work created by a small team, trying to approach pearls of the caliber of Subnautica with great respect and ability, to which it is no coincidence that it has been repeatedly compared. Let's try to explain in detail everything we think in this Breathedge review. The hard life of space funerals Breathedge: getting familiar with Space Breathedge, and with him his team, make things clear from the first moment: there is no desire to offend anyone or any creed and they are absolutely right in declaring it openly, because these days you never know. In fact, right from the start the irreverent and politically incorrect tone of the game is clear and in no uncertain terms. We are a nobody who is facing a long space journey in order to say goodbye to his grandfather, in a space funeral that promises to be daring. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned, and within a few seconds we find ourselves catapulted into the cosmic nothingness of Space, in the company of an immortal chicken, radiation and an infinity of wreckage around us. Relief is expected to arrive within a few thousand years and it is soon understood that it will be necessary to take action and rely only on one's own strength. On these assumptions opens a title that makes the narrative its highest and lowest point at the same time, in an almost paradoxical way. Anyone who has played the early access version in recent years knows well how the story is a backwards story of the protagonist who, now a prisoner and interrogated by two robot guards, enjoys telling the story in his own way, fictionalizing and retracing his steps, the story of his peregrination in space. Breathedge: studying strange escape plans The importance of narration becomes increasingly central as you progress through the game, almost changing the balance in the gameplay with the three new chapters included in version 1.0. Where for years it was an excuse to put the player in front of an infinity of jokes (not always of great quality) and a bland survival gameplay all devoted to exploration, the new addition pushes the accelerator on the story, making everything more linear, short and able to close the circle in a dignified way. Its dual nature denotes a change of course in development and it is precisely here that your perception will change. Appreciating or not the choice is what will lead you to accept and experience the new section of Breathedge with pleasure. On the contrary, you could still think of continuing to travel deep space in search of every single resource available. Subnautica in space Breathedge: An immortal chicken is forever Subnautica has set the standard, there is no doubt about this. Where the market was totally saturated with classic survival and all the same, the latter played its trump card. Combining a calm narration and a good amount of lore with a similar survival gameplay, but which focused above all on discovery and exploration. All seasoned with fascinating and certainly original seabeds. Breathedge takes more or less the same step, replacing the horror hues with irony bordering on the demented and swimming in water with those in space, and then seasoning everything with an insane amount of elements to find, merge, build and destroy . The exploratory part is what works wonders and allows Breathedge to give free rein to the creativity - sometimes even a little too much - of a team of developers clearly eager to have fun. And that fun we assure you that you try it all, even net of some smudges that make clear the inexperience and the lack of a certain balance. In Breathedge there are few elements on the screen, and even fewer are the ones to keep an eye on. We told you that it is a survival and like any worthy member of the genre there are a series of values that indicate the hunger and thirst of the protagonist. On the standard difficulty level - what should be the best first experience for a player, at least according to the team - we have never found ourselves, not once, with the feeling of dying of hunger or thirst. Already from the first seconds out in thespace it is possible to find resources in quantity and this makes this element really superfluous. The same thing cannot be said for oxygen, the real enemy of the player, which in the initial hours will give you a lot of trouble. Breathedge: a pinch of normality Every time you go out into space your oxygen meter will start to drop rapidly and initially you will only have a handful of seconds available for your outdoor trips. It goes without saying that advancing, finding projects and building new equipment will allow you to exponentially increase this value, to the point of making it almost superfluous and allowing you to go around for hundreds and hundreds of meters before having to return, use a tank or hook up to an air station. 'oxygen. It is precisely when you have become familiar with this system, with the myriad of menus and submenus and with some borderline creation logics, that Breathedge will give its best, placing you in front of an almost boundless space where you can discover new schemes, new little stories of characters now lost in infinity and also produce means and instruments that are truly on the verge of madness. We don't want to spoil the surprise with regards to all of this, but the advice is not to stop and carry out only the missions that the game will put in front of you, but also to go further, giving free rein to your imagination and that of the team, whether ever that you may find yourself traveling around space with a vehicle halfway between a beetle and a 500, or building a house with a view of a supernova. Extremism and freedom As now happens in all works of this type, the developers have made available a series of modes that totally change the experience. One is an extreme that simply exacerbates whatever dynamics are already there, while the other two represent each other's opposites. In the one dedicated to the story it becomes almost impossible to die of hunger and thirst, pushing everything on the success of the hero's journey. The free one, on the other hand, disables narration and values, to give free rein to creativity. All blueprints are unlocked, you can build anything right away and the only goal is to feel like a skilled architect or engineer. Technicalities Breathedge: improve your green thumb From a purely technical point of view Breathedge performs well. It is true that our test was carried out on a top-of-the-range configuration, but we are not talking about a rather expensive title in terms of features. Stylistically then it seemed successful. Obviously everything tends to the surreal and ironic, always pushing in the direction of a world bordering on the paradoxical and always wanting to try to elicit a laugh, sometimes succeeding, others leaving you colder. The sound is without infamy and without praise, as is the English dubbing, which does not give great peaks but which chooses flat and functional tones for the type of story and the characters, almost all robotic. Too bad for the total absence of adaptation in Italian, which will discourage the less savvy, above all due to a truly immense amount of texts and vocal notes.", "date": "2021-02-26", "grade": "7.5"}
