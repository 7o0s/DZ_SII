It was ultraviolence incarnate, a product in front of which respectable and right-thinking Sunday parents tore their clothes screaming ~Anathema!~ and capable of making kids feel like little anarchist punks. Innocent masses of pixels torn apart in metal-topped car racing, the game didn't offer much more than that, but its excessively splattered and impossible to take seriously brutality made it unique, an adrenaline rush for a generation that had yet to discover all kinds of wonders. In an era like ours, where the old classics are reborn thanks to Kickstarter and the wishes of the public, the return of the brand was therefore practically established: too many emotions experienced by the older section of gamers, too much childish fun that that perfectly fitting name he still manages to evoke in the minds of those who have passed the age of 25/30, to forbid themselves from spending any money on his reboot. Stainless Games easily understood this, and after years of survival thanks to minor digital titles and card games, they decided to take advantage of their most powerful brand to return to the scene in a big way. The result, Carmageddon: Reincarnation, has therefore reached the homes of fans, between the thumbs down of critics and the happy cries of nostalgics (or at least those equipped with PCs powerful enough to run the first version of the game). Leaving aside the questionable quality of the product, Reincarnation must have been a moderate success (we didn't like it very much), because today Carmageddon: Max Damage arrives, its console version. We tried it on PlayStation 4, hoping to see some concrete evolution compared to its direct predecessor. Get ready for a hard frontal with the reality of the facts. Like a nice frontal in full face, our review of Carmageddon: Max Damage! The old lady is worth 100 points Even if with some extra cars and areas, the package offered by Max Damage is extremely similar to the one seen in Reincarnation. It starts with a rather simplistic tutorial - which indicates the basics of the game in the ~Carma Classic~ mode - and once completed you can face the real career, structured around the events necessary to earn the game currency. This currency is not optional, the points obtained in the races accumulate to unlock the following zones and, although obtaining a large number of them is a fairly quick process, it will take you a while to have all the tracks in the list of free events. There is no underlying plot, nor a motivation that really pushes you to advance outside of the game elements to be unlocked: the possibility of upgrading your car or obtaining new ones by destroying specific opponents during the races can be tantalizing, but well soon you will fixate on a single machine and even this justification will lose meaning. Fixing oneself on a single medium, in all likelihood, won't even depend on aesthetics; you just want to hold on to a controllable car at some point. After all, Carmageddon Max Damage's driving system is far from being a gem: the vast majority of the cars at your disposal skid as if their wheels were made of soap and the somewhat phony physics of the title doesn't help you control them at all. duty. Rather heavy cars are less affected by this problem, but driving the fastest four-wheelers is often a hellish experience. It was also in Reincarnation obviously, yet some adjustments to the driving mechanics were more than due. Instead you will have to try the testable, understand what you can bend without cursing at every obstacle touched or bump received, and embrace the stability of your new friend with all the love in the world. I don't need nitro, I have spikes The gameplay has probably remained unchanged because it well represents the general chaos of the modes available in this reboot. Not that that's a justification for a control system that could be improved upon in a million great ways, but at least its problems are less noticeable when dealing with competitions that have very little to do with typical racing. Classic Carma, which we already talked about at the beginning, is the well-known multiple-objective mode of Carmageddon, where the player can win both by diligently following the checkpoints and by eliminating all opponents or pawns on the map. It is still the core of the experience, the most fun type of event, but it is still accompanied by a race with variable objectives where the first runner to touch a pre-established number of checkpoints wins, by speed races,and other hilarious goodies like a free-for-all deathmatch and a fugitive pedestrian massacre. It's a nice variety of options, plagued by an artificial intelligence that has very little ~intelligence~ in it. Opponents are clumsy, often unnecessarily aggressive or prone to vapid accident; that they are fallacious is understandable to favor the freedom of Classic Carma, but their shortcomings make the single player game not very fun and the career in general boring. With the strengthening of the cars, then, things get even more irritating, and certain clashes really go on for too long if you can't systematically eliminate your opponents. And let's be clear, the essence of Carmageddon, its ~caciaronissima~ formula made up of free massacres and demolitions has remained, as have the many random upgrades of the cars, ranging from electric weapons to giant soap bubbles; it's just that after all these years the mix isn't as fun anymore. The good old days Now the end, nostalgia gives way to boredom triggered by the obvious shortcomings of the Stainless title. The mix of imprecise controls, slow unlocking of cars and tracks, and poor AI becomes really hard to tolerate for someone used to more enjoyable arcade racing titles or even more successful car battles. The latest Twisted Metal for example - although more focused on weapons - made the delirium of clashes between armored vehicles much better, and the beauty is that that title wasn't even that bad graphically when compared to Max Damage. Yes, because we have listed many defects, but the technical sector of the game is the poorest element of the package. We are facing a video game that would look good on PlayStation 2, and runs at 30 frames per second (not always stable), with textures that sometimes load late and some annoying bugs. The addition of some particle effects does not save a backward and poorly managed graphics engine, which will be more stable than the one seen in the first PC version of Reincarnation, but it remains very far from sufficient. The pedestrians themselves are quite disappointing from a gore point of view: they break into two or three parts at most, are crudely animated and entertain more for the clumsy sound effects than for the variety of their deaths. The cars are much better, which at least boast a well-done damage system and a nice self-repair effect when you spend points in the race to undo the damage received. Finally, the soundtrack is weak, which would certainly have benefited from heavier sounds and more tracks. Said down to earth, the game even in this console version seems to be programmed in a crude and superficial way. It is only the multiplayer experience that saves the shack, because against human opponents Carmageddon Max Damage takes on a completely different value and its modes, its absurd power-ups, and its exaggerated cars work. Don't expect, however, that the online (because not even the shadow of split-screen) is good enough to give this reboot the same value as the historic ancestor. Times have changed and Carmageddon has gone into reverse.", "date": "2016-07-08", "grade": "5.5"}
