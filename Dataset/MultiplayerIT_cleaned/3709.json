{"name": "AFK Arena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/afk-arena-la-recensione.html", "text": "Mobile RPG with gacha mechanics is usually built to absorb the player, attract them with a relatively simple start and then capture them in their coils requiring constant commitment and dedication in order to achieve significant results. All this has little to do with skill but rather, simply, with the constancy of returning to the game on a frequent basis and perhaps - possibly, for the developers - even spending some money on it regularly, so as to be able to obtain those rewards that otherwise they are practically closed to those who manage to make only normal use of them. From this point of view AFK Arena presents itself as a positive and correct proposal towards the players, as we see in this review. In his attempt to combine the gacha with the idle game, he manages to mitigate those obsessive drifts of the former while avoiding the alienation of the latter, in the end staging a hybrid that manages to keep together and also propose something new. We have seen how this kind of game tends to be channeled into a narrow path made up of now codified rules, a canon from which it is difficult to get out with some innovative solution. AFK Arena has the merit of being able to stand out from the crowd, not so much for its basic structure but rather for its rhythm and for the modification of some basic mechanics that are presented here more generous towards the players than in many other cases. The sense is always the same: it is a question of putting together a large cast of characters, making them evolve and deploy them in battle, with the story essentially presented as a sequence of fights, with bosses at the end of each map. Being idle, the combat system is not particularly demanding, requiring only to deploy the characters on the field between the first and second lines with a minimum of criterion based on their class, possibly activating the special moves at the right time but even this task can be entrusted to autoplay. The difference with the other standard mobile RPGs is that in this case, as the name itself suggests (AFK is used for ~away from keyboard~, i.e. the acronym used when moving away from a device), even staying away from the game our characters continue to fight, without proceeding within the story but gaining experience and various rewards that are particularly useful for their evolution and the possibility of summoning new heroes. Ethical gacha The idle mechanic necessarily makes the whole RPG apparatus lighter, because the progression is structured in such a way as to require less effort, being able to be carried out even while away from the game. In short, it is undoubtedly a more casual title than other exponents of the genre to which it refers, but this can easily be a strong point, given the good balance that characterizes it and perhaps makes it suitable for those who have no intention of investing time and money in reaching the highest levels in a gacha mobile RPG. The same management of the characters reflects this greater simplicity and general intuitiveness: the pressure of a button is enough to make the fighters evolve, as well as to equip the best weapons and armor, provided obviously they are conquered first. The combat system, which given its repetitiveness should be carried out autonomously, is based on the evaluation of the overall combat value of the teams facing each other, therefore all there is to do, essentially, is to conquer increasingly rare characters and powerful and make them evolve as much as possible so as not to have particular problems advancing in history. All of this brings us to the management of in-game currencies, because everything from the summoning system to the ability to upgrade characters revolves around gems. Being a free-to-play there are obvious tricks that make life easier for those who want to spend some money, in particular a VIP system that ensures high-level items and characters, but the ability to collect rewards in the background makes it much more relaxed and a growth at your fingertips even at no cost. Then there are various game modes in which it is possible to try our hand, such as the labyrinths that give us different paths to take in a path made up of consecutive fights with the final boss, or various timed missions with particularly rich rewards. AFK Arena does not have the advantage of relying on the universe of some RPG known in other fields but finds a strong identity in the particular graphic characterization adopted, similar to that of classic cartoons. The stretch and the general atmosphere bring you back to the more traditional fairy tale, but inside you will find itdifferent veins such as steampunk and some bizarre derivations of fantasy.", "date": "2019-04-20", "grade": "7.2"}
