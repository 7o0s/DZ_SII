Among the space debris left on earth stands out a substance that is soon called ~Toxium~ due to its horrific effects: it is capable of transforming any living creature into a bloodthirsty zombie. Soon a large part of the population ends up being infected and the survivors lock themselves up in camps and base all their hopes of survival on technology, war and otherwise. BioDefense: Zombie Outbreak looks like a classic tower defense, in which we have defense positions that need to be upgraded, generators that need to be safeguarded and a particular emphasis on the management of light sources: given that the world is now completely dark and it is in the dark that the zombies move, you must always place lights in the ~strategic~ points. Without them there is no possibility of survival, since we can no longer count on the structures that are left in the dark and in this case we must immediately restore the lighthouses. A simple tutorial explains these and other elements of the gameplay, after which we can try our hand at an ~infinite~ survival mode or with one of the ten missions that are unlocked as we resist. When hell is full... Relying entirely on the touch screen for controls, the game provides a small ~construction~ phase in which we have to place Toxium factories (a substance that we use as money, to buy new devices and to make technological upgrades), the aforementioned lights and energy generators to power all the stations (the more we have, the more generators we need); followed by a ~defense~ phase in which we see the hordes of undead arriving on the radar and we have to prepare for their assault by organizing the arrangement of the turrets in the best possible way. The latter are divided into only two types, machine guns and missile launchers, and placed in series they constitute an excellent line of defense. The methods of engagement are completely automatic, so our job is only to organize the units, but there is a close correlation with the presence of the lights, without which even the range of the weapons ends up being severely limited. As for the enemies, the roster is quite well nourished: the classic zombies are joined by zombie-dogs, rather robust mutants or even large undead sperm whales that crawl on the ground in an almost unstoppable march, capable of inflicting a lot of damage on our facilities. As in any tower defense, the central base must be preserved at all costs. In ~survival~ mode, defending the base is the only objective and we must try to resist for as long as possible while the zombie assaults are becoming more numerous and insistent. The missions, on the other hand, often revolve around a specific period of time, perhaps asking us to survive until a certain condition has occurred. Unfortunately, in the latter context, the time necessary for the development of one's systems is lacking, technological progress is often set aside and one ends up not fully enjoying all the facets offered. ...the dead walk the earth The BioDefense: Zombie Outbreak interface is very clear and well organized, with the screen vertically and in the lower part the icons relating to all the objects that we can place on the map (in order: lights, Toxium plants, turrets, missile launchers and power generators). In the upper part of the screen, on the other hand, there is a radar that informs us of the origin of the danger, a pause button that allows us to save the game (in case of sudden closure of the application, moreover, the game will resume when you start where we left off) and a button for time management, which can scroll at normal, half or double speed. The arrangement of the objects is very simple and intuitive, you can control everything with your fingers and the system is immediately quite precise, also thanks to the usual invisible magnetized ~grid~. While the sound leaves something to be desired, especially from the point of view of the effects, it must be said that the graphics of the Resolution Interactive product are really good, with a respectable bestiary, lots of blood and a convincing realization of the scenario. It's just a pity that the setting always remains the same, with only some random changes in the arrangement of the Toxium deposits.
