For all the details, we refer you to the review of the PC version (it was also released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3): link. By reading it, you will discover many of the elements that also make up Rise of the Owlvelord, an expansion that can be played without having the base title. Clouds and flying ships. What does it remind us? We're talking about expansion and not DLC because the developers, the German Black Forest Games, have chosen to put a lot of content into it and enrich it with a completely new and independent storyline compared to that of the other episode, despite the fact that the launch price is really competitive . In reality, the gameplay has remained unchanged, with Giana who can change her personality (one angelic, the other let's say punk), changing her powers and the world around her accordingly. The whole gameplay revolves around the dual personality of the girl, now a teenager, which requires you to continuously switch from one state to another to overcome obstacles, chasms and enemies, and solve some puzzles, more or less complicated. We immediately see the out of tune notes: there is no news. None at all. But then let's ban the hypocrisy and say clearly that if you don't expect innovations from games that cost seventy euros, have a billionaire budget and repeat the same gameplay year after year, until commercial death do us part, it becomes difficult to be picky with the expansion of an independent title that costs a handful of euros. The offer of Rise of the Owlvelord is clear: seven new, lengthy levels, which can be tackled at different degrees of difficulty ranging from the affordable Normal, to the almost impossible ber Hardcore (to be pronounced with a certain awe). It doesn't take long to finish it once, but completing it for real, obtaining maximum stars, even only in the second difficulty level, is another matter. Password: design Black Forest Games has done a superb job with the levels of Rise of the Owlverlord, solving some of the problems that afflicted those of the first chapter (mostly that afflicted some players) and generally improving the design, a sign that the experience gained in development it was of some use. If you remember, the first Twisted Dreams had very particular maps, with a design that we do not hesitate to define as ~rough~. Let's try to explain: they weren't bad at all, but they risked putting some non-expert players in the genre in great difficulty (indeed, they did). The situation gets complicated Above all the advanced levels were really difficult and presented excessive lengths that could lead to complete rejection by gamers. The maps of Rise of the Owlvelord have a much more refined and fluid design, with very few dead moments, which guarantees a greater speed of the action. Thus, identical game mechanics often correspond to different and better elaborated game situations, such as for example the initial chase, or the best use of the bouncers, used to create real puzzles and to hide some secret areas in an original way. Let's say that if we can't talk about real news, we can however tell of a big job in trying to meet some requests from the players, while responding to many of the criticisms received at the same time. From a technical point of view, however, nothing has changed. The graphic elements are always the same, as is the nice elastic effect that accompanies the transformation of the game world from one state to another. In fact there is not much to say from this point of view. The soundtrack has also remained unchanged, with songs by Chris Hlsbeck and Machinae Supremacy accompanying the action. Let's try Rise of the Owlvelord, expansion of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams with excellent content", "date": "2013-10-11", "grade": "8.0"}
