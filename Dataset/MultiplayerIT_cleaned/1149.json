Let's get to the actual game, and ask ourselves, what does Alpha Black Zero have to offer and what kind of dish does this dish offer us on? In essence, as already mentioned, it is a third-person action shooter, which despite being strongly influenced by the futuristic setting offered by the game's complicated plot, closely resembles a well-known title such as Rainbow Six. The cornerstone of the gameplay is team coordination, which can be managed here through a practical and simple interface that contains in a single bar the characteristics of the team members as regards their state of health and the action they are performing at that moment , and through which it is also possible to give them, via radio, orders and instructions (reduced to a skimpy list: Hold fire, Hold position and a few others). The cornerstone of the gameplay is team coordination Each mission is preceded by an extensive briefing which, combined with the videos (well done, especially in the attention to the models of the characters and the faces of the latter) constitute a truly remarkable background capable of giving the game a thick and complex story, worthy of the best Tom Clancy (although Clancy has never written science fiction, only political fiction). Once on the battlefield, the objectives, while based on the complex structure of the story, always lead the player back to the same script. These are largely objectives aimed at flushing out the opponents, and eliminating any possibility of resistance and counterattack which almost always corresponds to the total elimination of the enemies. The outdoor maps then reduce the tactical aspect of the game even further, always forcing the same ~advance, send, eliminate~ scheme which in the long run can appear extremely repetitive. TO THE? Hey hey hey... Artificial intelligence does not shine for innovation. During reconnaissance actions, for example, it happens that you have to turn around and retrace your steps, perhaps to recover a member of the team who has been ~entangled~ during the journey and is unable in any way to recover his way towards the rest of the group. The enemies in the same way do not seem to shine for initiative during the clashes, on the contrary, we often find ourselves faced with enemies who, rather than engage in battle, run away without even reacting to fire. However, realism does not cease to be present in this title, and it does not transpire only from the graphics, which, although not astonishing, do not disappoint expectations at all, but also for subtleties such as the reaction to shots from enemies, who sometimes collapse at ground wounded, but who can also get up and continue fighting if the wounds inflicted were not lethal. The possibility, at the beginning of the mission, to choose the combat set-up (although not being able to go into specifics and not allowing the detailed choice of weapons and equipment) gives a decidedly tactical tone to the preparation of the mission. What is certain is that the choice of a ~stealth~ type of action sometimes proves to be completely useless, because the vast majority of maps do not allow any type of stealthy intervention, but only battles that are almost more pitched than strategic, where the impact force of machine guns often trumps long-planned and perfected action. The only limit to Rambo-like bravado is set by the limited number of ammunition which forces the player to deal with the need to be thrifty when using weapons. The graphic response The graphic apparatus does not show particular signs of demerit, but still remains on the ~without infamy and without praise~, perhaps too crushed by very fierce competition, which, especially in the FPS field, is giving us and will give us more and more surprises. But if a criticism can be made, and an important one, to the aesthetics of the game, it can be underlined the lack of accuracy in the physics of the movements and in the management of the clipping that afflict this title like a deadly plague. In the ~outdoor~ maps, in fact, the almost total absence of accuracy in reporting the physics of falling bodies and the related consequences on the models of the characters immediately catches the eye, who fall from rocky slopes as if they were made of butter, sliding like snowboarding champions (without table) on apparently very steep slopes and certainly not without bumps. Not to mention the corpses that, as unfortunately we've been used to seeing for years in games that make massive use of three-dimensional graphics engines, are literally sucked up from the ground disappearing behind the textures like ghosts. And to think that those who knew physics engines like Havoc thought that clipping belonged to other times. Ultimately we cannot speak of Alpha Zero Black as an insuccit, but we are not dealing with a masterpiece. Comment It is clear that even the major titles can learn from games like this, which while remaining on mediocre levels where the most acclaimed software houses excel, knows how to combine a gameplay that has been established for a long time, a truly remarkable background and a film plot. Who loves Tom Clancy and all his video game transpositions and at the same time can't help but hear about terraforming, colonization of planets and battles between rebels, why should they miss the appointment with Alpha Zero Black? Pros: Good realization of the models and faces of the characters Very complex and well-maintained plot, supported by good level movies Cons: Sometimes boring and repetitive The stealth component too often gives way to a ~breakthrough~ approach Qahira, ruler of GovSol. Let's get familiar with Alpha Zero Black, a third-person action shooter that projects us into a remote future dominated by corporations, espionage, galactic politics and of course, lots and lots of war. In an extremely science-fiction scenario, mankind, forced by the overpopulation of planet Earth, has decided to plan a systematic colonization of planets from other solar systems. The initial plan for this colonization was that the planets chosen by the Terran Commission to be inhabited by humans would undergo a gradual process of terraforming. Terraforming, one of the concepts dearest to modern science fiction, is the artificial process that allows a planet to assume the atmospheric characteristics of the Earth to thus make occupation by man possible. Having reached this decision, the colonizing humans established that each planet should be colonized by particular delegations made up of very distinct ethnic communities. The planning envisaged that the colonists, following a precise procedure, would undergo the necessary social and economic expansion within a few centuries to pay a sort of ransom and obtain the most total and unconditional independence from the central control of the planet Qahira (originally called Mars , capital of GovSol), which in turn, while losing control of the colony planets, would have acquired enormous wealth in raw materials. But the plan soon proved to be ineffective, leaving the planets, governed mostly by retrograde and warmongering societies, in a state of total abandonment and unspeakable barbarism. In this scenario on the border with the apocalyptic and the post-nuclear typical of the cyberpunk tales of a couple of decades ago, the player is called to take on the role of Lieutenant Kyle Hardlaw, commander of the Alpha Zero Black, an assault team of soldiers from the 'elite. The task of this team is to defend the interests of colonization, intervening anywhere in the galaxy to defeat dissidents and rebels. As in any self-respecting political thriller, however, Hardlaw is framed and tried for treason before the Court Martial of Olympus City, the capital of Qahira. The game therefore starts from one of the first missions carried out by the Lieutenant, under the pretext of retracing the events that led Hardlaw (thinking about it, cryptic name for a man who ended up in prison unjustly ~Hardlaw alias Duralegge~. Dura lex, sed lex.) to run up against a wall of counterintelligence and treason.", "date": "2004-11-09", "grade": null}
