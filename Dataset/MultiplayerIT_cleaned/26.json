Therefore, there couldn't have been a better occasion to test our skills on the track and compare them with the best real and virtual drivers. Codemasters, for the first time under the supervision of Electronic Arts, has had the opportunity to complete the work on the official video game dedicated to this splendid sport. In a year in which the new regulations and the structure of the single-seaters have remained almost the same as those of the last world championship, the developers have concentrated on other aspects to enrich the experience offered. Starting from the new career mode called Braking Point, up to the refinement of the gameplay with a new driving model and a better feeling behind the wheel of our single-seater. This F1 2021 pleasantly surprised us both for the general quality of the production and for the new modes present. Despite the many similarities with F1 2020, it is still an important chapter for the series, also because it arrives on the new generation consoles for the first time, where the video game manages to express itself at its best together with the PC version we tested. Surprised by the amount of content to explore, we immediately prepared our steering wheel, put on the gloves and hit the track to try out all the new features of F1 2021 that we will describe to you in our review. Formula 1 at 360 in Braking Point The real and important novelty in F1 2021 is represented by the career mode called Braking Point in which we play the role of the young driver Aiden Jackson. Through three seasons of Formula 2 and Formula 1 we will experience the growth of the protagonist, both on the track and in the paddock. In fact, it will be important not only to demonstrate our skills on the track, but also to collaborate with the team and our teammate, as well as knowing how to deal with the pressure from our rivals and the press. Braking Point therefore wants us to experience the world of Formula 1 at 360 degrees, taking a cue from the exciting episodes of the Netflix TV series ~Drive to Survive~. In fact, we will face various exciting situations, created specifically to convey the joy and satisfaction felt by the pilots. There will also be classic dramas and complex situations in which our protagonist will have to bring out his character to grow and overcome any difficulty. All this has been enriched with the presence of carefully crafted CG cutscenes, which pleasantly break the pace between the race weekends. Braking Point allows us to choose three different levels of difficulty, leaving the player full freedom in selecting the classic driving aids such as traction control or ABS on the brakes. There are also five teams with which we can start our career: Alpha Tauri, Aston Martin, Alfa Romeo, Haas and Williams. Choosing one of them will also influence our future in Formula 1, for example by racing with the Alpha Tauri we would be observed with greater interest by Red Bull. Our adventure in Braking Point will begin with the last race of the 2019 Formula 2 world championship, in which we will have to conquer the first position to be able to win a seat in Formula 1 where we will continue with Aiden Jackson's career. Filmed between races in Braking Point The entire mode has a chapter structure, each of them linked to a particular race weekend. The arrival in Formula 1 will take place in the 2020 season, where we will have to support our teammate Casper Akkermann and withstand the provocations of rival Devon Butler. In each chapter we will go to face a specific race situation with specific objectives to be achieved. Once the challenge is completed, an interlude will be offered to us which will continue the story of our driver and the chosen team. The objectives proposed on the track are quite varied and will test all our skills behind the wheel. We had to fight to overtake our rival a few laps from the end, help our team-mate defend the position or react to accidents and car breakdowns. Between one race and another, the protagonist will be busy answering press interviews and learning to live with our teammate and other riders in the paddock. On board the Formula 2 car Overall, the work done by Codemasters on Braking Point satisfied us, especially for the variety of challenges proposed. The characterization of the characters and the situations experienced off the track seemed solid to us. The goal of the developers is undoubtedmindfully to let us experience the most common situations within the paddock, even if perhaps we would have liked to see some more original episodes. The computer graphics movies excel in situations on the track, while when we move to the garage or the interview area, the quality drops due to the not-excellent facial animations, as well as due to only fair dubbing in Italian. The classic ways, perfected Pilot Career mode main menu The classic modes such as the ~Driver Career~ and the ~Stable Career~ are also back, already seen in the previous editions of the Codemasters title. While the experience remains as played in the past, the developers have added small refinements and new menus to increase the depth. We especially liked the change in the user interface within the menus. For example, in the progression tree of the research and development division we can visually admire each component our engineers are working on. Numerous options have also been added to customize the experience such as the amount of resource points obtainable in free practice, the difficulty with which we go to develop the single-seater and the frequency of breakdowns of the power unit. In F1 2021 we are given the opportunity to tackle career modes with a friend, both online and offline, joining him in our team as a partner or challenging him as a rival. Furthermore, Codemasters allows us to start the Driver Career mode based on the real Formula 1 season. For example, if we want to replace Bottas in Mercedes starting from the race in Spain, we will be able to do it with the same scores and results obtained in the Formula 1 championship as in this 'year. A pleasant addition that links the video game to the real sport even more. After last year's success, Codemasters has also brought back the Team Career mode in which, in addition to having to fight on the track and develop the single-seater together with the engineers, we will have to manage the team by hiring the drivers, sign contracts with the sponsors and carry out other typical jobs of a sports director. During the career mode each driver will receive detailed scores in real time based on their performance on the track, which will then determine the driver market for the following season. Pit menu during career mode practice The classic fully customizable ~Quick Race~ mode could not be missing, as well as the evergreen ~Time Trial~. Even the multiplayer modes have not been distorted compared to the past, with the return of the ~Online Leagues~ (customizable championships to do with other players), the ~Classified Races~ and the presence of the ~Friendly Races~. Given the low amount of players connected before the game's release, we were unable to further explore these modes to experience any improvements in matchmaking and lobby management. Following last year's debut, the section dedicated to eSports events returns once again. Here we will be able to try our hand at arduous challenges and compete with other riders in the world to be able to compare ourselves with the amazing performances of the Pro Series riders. The gameplay gives satisfaction to everyone TV Pod camera on Alpine single seater in Bahrain The Codemasters series has always had an important goal to achieve in terms of gameplay: to create a title suitable for Formula 1 fans with little driving skills in video games, but at the same time satisfy the needs of experienced drivers racing in eSports championships. On the one hand, therefore, a simplified control system is needed with adequate driving aids in order to enjoy a genuine and fun experience even with the classic pad. On the other hand, there is a need for a complex physics engine to create a driving model that is as close to reality as possible. After trying it with both the pad and the steering wheel, also experimenting with the facilities available for less experienced players, we can say that Codmasters has not disappointed our expectations. The amount of options in the game can adjust to any skill level of the player, as well as the choice of difficulty of the artificial intelligence. On board the Aston Martin in Belgium Having done the necessary tests on the driving system with active aids, we deactivated all facilities to experiment with the physics offered by the single-seaters in F1 2021. Compared to last year's chapter, we found a better sensation in controlling the car at low speed, as well as in braking phase where it is much easier to avoid locking the front wheels. In general the single-seaters risultan be very understeer, so we will have to balance the downforce on the front wing well in the set-up configuration. The rear end of the car, on the other hand, seemed more stable to us, allowing us to have better grip under acceleration even at low speeds. However, it is difficult to manage the single-seater in traction, especially driving without aids: in an instant we could lose control of the rear and fly into the barriers, compromising the race. Overall, driving difficulty has decreased, thanks to a better response from the single-seaters in the various situations on the track. Although we have never experienced a real Formula 1 car, we discovered from the interviews with the drivers (who contributed their feedback to the game) that the driving model needed to be improved in terms of control of the car. Many may turn up their noses reading these words, because they expected a more complex and less arcade game. However, we can assure you that, despite the higher perceived downforce, the driving model is still challenging when you want to give your best on the track. The superior control of the single-seater translates into a more enjoyable experience and a decidedly better driving feeling being able to react better to unexpected behaviors of the car. After some initial difficulties, mainly due to a non-optimal standard configuration of the steering wheel, we immediately felt at ease in the 2021 Formula 1 single-seaters, which were able to give us an unprecedented feeling corner after corner. F1 2021 therefore remains a mainly arcade game, which however also offers satisfying satisfaction to players looking for a more simulative title. Pit stop at the Red Bull Ring Following the regulatory change that took place last year, in F1 2021 it is no longer possible to manage the type of blend used in the race. This means that we no longer have any control over fuel use, except through less aggressive driving in terms of braking and acceleration. At the start of the race we have to carefully plan the amount of petrol in the car, based on our driving style in order to be able to reach the finish line. On the other hand, the management of electric power commonly called ERS returns. In the race, by pressing a button, we will in fact have the ~Overtaking Mode~ available, which will offer us several more horsepower to exploit on the straights. In F1 2021 it is much easier to accumulate this energy in braking and then exploit it with the delivery of the ERS. It is therefore essential to learn how to manage the ~Overtaking Mode~ well in the various sectors of the track, trying to achieve the best race pace from our single-seater. Remaining on these more technical aspects that are certainly interesting for more experienced riders, we would also like to mention better management of temperatures, both for the tires and for the power unit. We don't have to worry so much about the engine temperature in the race, since, having only the ~Standard~ fuel mixture available, the heat is dissipated more easily. The new car damage screen Another important novelty in terms of gameplay is the new damage system. Now our car can be damaged in several sections, causing permanent breakdowns for the duration of the race. In the past the only part of the car at risk was the front wing. It could break with a contact on the track, but through a prolonged stop in the pits the mechanics were able to replace it. In F1 2021, additional elements of the car capable of breaking in an accident have been added. For example, it is no longer possible to shoulder opponents by hitting them sideways, because we risk permanently damaging the underbody of the car or other aerodynamic appendages. Even the rear wing can suffer serious and permanent damage, which could jeopardize the entire race. Speaking instead of artificial intelligence, the developers have perfected the behavior of our opponents on the track. While offering a great level of challenge and realism, the AI still suffers from some minor imperfections. For example, we have often seen an opponent defend himself from our attack, going himself to attack another extremely distant driver in a dangerous and useless move just to keep the position. Technical sector for the first time on next-gen Wet race in Brazil on F1 2021 F1 2021 is the first video game in the series to land on next-generation consoles. The developers have welcomed the power and other features offered by Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X", "date": "2021-07-12", "grade": "8.9"}
