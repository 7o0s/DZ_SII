Not only did it prove that jRPGs aren't dead as many believed, but it also flexed the muscles of the underrated Wii, in defiance of the trillions of soulless polygons in the most hyped triple-A titles. Xenoblade Chronicles was also the fulfillment of a dream for its director, Tetsuya Takahashi, who for the first time was able to transform a story into a video game without having to omit anything at the last moment and without pressure from above, unlike what happened at The release of Xenogears and XenoSaga, the other two jRPGs that made the developer Monolith Soft very famous anyway. Today Xenoblade Chronicles also becomes the first exclusive title for the ~new~ portable console from Nintendo, in the face of Mario, Link and Kirby. In this review we will briefly explain the main aspects of the game, focusing on the effect that the conversion has had on them: if you want to learn more about the subject, we suggest you read the very long review that we published at the time of the original release. The game, in fact, is practically identical ... but will it be good or bad? Xenoblade Chronicles is still one of the best jRPGs in the history of the genre even in a portable version A long story for a small console The stories of Tetsuya Takahashi (and of his wife Kaori ~Soraya Saga~ Tanaka, in some cases) are far from trivial, even if they border on some of the most widespread stereotypes of Japanese animation. They often tell of the conflict between spirit and matter, faith and science, men and machines, and do not offer precise answers to insurmountable moral dilemmas, even though they draw a line that, in most cases, puts everyone in agreement. It also happens in Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, when the young Shulk wields the legendary Monad sword to face the Mechon who have attacked Colony 9 in which he lives: the weapon gives him precognitive abilities that Shulk initially thinks he can use to his advantage . Unfortunately, however, fate seems to be written, and throws our protagonist a real trick, starting a long journey that will lead him to explore the Bionis, the body of a gigantic deceased deity on which biological, human life has blossomed. and not. Too bad the Bionis killed each other with the Mechonis, and that ancient conflict holds more secrets than Shulk and his friends realize. Their adventure, in fact, will lead them to get to know other civilizations, and to discover the true history of the Mechon and their world, in a riot of twists and revelations that leave you breathless. The very long storyline of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is completed in about fifty hours, but more than double it can be spent exploring the game world, completing every side mission and defeating every monster. Given the extent of the adventure, the ability to save in any area or moment goes hand in hand with the stand-by state imposed by closing the New Nintendo 3DS, making the game particularly suited to the portable nature of the console. It is not the only advantage that the game design offers, however: despite having four years on its shoulders, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D remains an extremely innovative and user-friendly title for the genre to which it belongs. The ability to teleport at any time to already discovered areas or the mere fact that there is no Game Over, and that the party reappears at the nearest checkpoint when defeated, speak volumes about the developer's mentality. In short, from this point of view, the conversion of Monster Games does not betray the spirit of the original, if anything making it even more suitable for mobile use without limits of any kind. Four dimensions to manipulate On the small screen, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D's interface stifles the action a bit, there's little you can do. Fortunately Monster Games has diluted its density, moving the minimap and the party member portraits, including vital indicators, to the lower screen of the New Nintendo 3DS: the touch screen is therefore slightly sparse, from a purely aesthetic point of view, but it lets you breathe more the upper screen. The skill bar remains on the upper screen, where it should be since our gaze will often be fixed on it: those who have already played the Wii version will know that the combat system of Xenoblade Chronicles intelligently mixes real-time and turn-based , allowing for complete control of the character being used while others fightThey are driven by a decent artificial intelligence. Each character has different abilities that drastically change the way you play them, and more than three branches of specialization that allow you to significantly alter their role in battle. Some of these abilities, such as the powers of the Monad in Shulk's possession, are reactive in nature, and must be used at the right time to repel the enemies' most powerful attacks: in this way Monolith Soft has intelligently integrated the precognitive abilities of the Monad into the gameplay. legendary weapon, for example, but also the talents that define the splendid characters who will join Shulk's crusade, from the sorceress Melia to the swordsman Dunban, passing through the funny Riki and so on. Nothing is left to chance or, to be clear, outside the gameplay: even their interpersonal relationships play a decisive role in the clashes, prompting us to often change the formation of the group to unlock more and more options and skills. The level of customization is very high, even if many features - such as gems and the bonuses they confer - require great dedication and a good understanding of the game mechanics. In short, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a jRPG for everyone, very rich in content: there is not only to fight, but also to explore, and the hundreds of secondary missions to be undertaken ensure that the player is urged to peek into every corner of the immense maps, even if only to discover a secret objective or a new collectible. Unfortunately, in the conversion Monster Games didn't even touch the secondary missions cataloging system, already confused and superficial in the original version. It's a shame, because this was an opportune moment to fix one of the game's few problems. The developer, on the other hand, has worked to integrate an extra mode that allows you to listen to all the songs of the amazing soundtrack and admire the various polygonal models: unfortunately this is a negligible feature, as we had suspected, because it relies on the amiibo of Shulk, in-game coins and the StreetPass to unlock - randomly - the various contents to collect. In case you want to aim for a specific content, however, you have to spend up to three game coins, but in any case it becomes a kind of ~grind~ suitable only for the most ardent fans. The 3D effect The suffix would not have made sense if the conversion had not offered a stereoscopic effect worthy of the name, and in fact the 3D of Xenoblade Chronicles leaves you speechless. Of course, it doesn't add anything to the gameplay, nor can one expect to better judge distances from enemies during fights, especially on such a small screen, but it further enhances the game's already beautiful sceneries. Those who have already admired the Makna waterfalls from the highest peaks of the jungle, for example, will easily understand the added value of the third dimension. The elephant in the room Here we are at the long awaited moment. In short, this unexpected conversion of Xenoblade Chronicles came out well, yes or no? The answer is an enigmatic ~no,~ but allow us to elaborate. Indeed, upon closer inspection, the Monolith Soft title has taken a few steps backwards. The resolution has decreased, and it's not that it already made a miracle cry, especially as regards the textures, and the color palette appeared a little faded compared to the original one, even if after a while you get used to it . The frame-rate is stable enough, stumbling around the same moments as it slowed down the action on Wii too, when multi-enemy fights get particularly frantic - again, we can't complain too much. The C-Stick guarantees a decent control of the camera, although its sensitivity leaves a hair to be desired especially during clashes. The point, however, is that Xenoblade Chronicles has never been a jaw-breaking title, visually speaking, and those who have played it on a Full-HD TV without resorting to component cables or other solutions know what we mean. The merits of the Monolith Soft game were practically all of the artistic direction, extraordinary and always attentive to the smallest detail, from the drastic settings based on the day/night cycle to the equipment always visible on the bodies of the characters, passing through the seamless immensity of the areas explorable, in some cases truly gigantic. However, all this goodness has been compressed into a cartridge (or about 3 GB of download, if you prefer digital) and the small size of the screen in a certain sense mitigates the technical problems listed above, making them less evident. Sorry to note, if anything, that Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is efeffectively a direct conversion, and that nothing has been done to improve the game where possible, even if there has always been talk of porting and never, of course, of a remake. The only defection, in this sense, is that of the Japanese dubbing: this time it is not selectable and you have to be satisfied with the good English-language dubbing. However, the wonderful soundtrack composed by Yoko Shimomura, Manami Kiyota and Yasunori Mitsuda has remained intact, for which we suggest you put on a nice pair of headphones so you can fully enjoy the most memorable songs, starting with the of opening.", "date": "2015-03-25", "grade": "9.0"}
