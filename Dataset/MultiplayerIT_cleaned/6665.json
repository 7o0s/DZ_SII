After having delighted the players with the sunny coasts of the Ligurian Riviera, the marvelous typically Tuscan bucolic glimpses and the splendor of the Cte d'Azur, PlayGround Games have decided to send them, through a very comfortable virtual ferry located in Nice, to the menacing Storm Island, a paradise semi-uncontaminated for the offroad that recalls Sicily but also stretches of the Greek islands, despite being scratched by monsoon storms, as the name suggests. We put the new racing cars of the package to the test and our ~old~ cars updated for this purpose, and after having traveled the fifty roads - mostly dirt roads - that make up the island and, above all, having conquered the coveted final of the unpublished Festival Horizon, we can confirm that it is an exotic ~holiday~ absolutely not to be missed by enthusiasts. Low visibility The not exactly gargantuan extension of the map (but still satisfying) and the less accentuated characterization of the landscape, whose personality emerges from some sparse Hellenic-style ruins, small tropical glimpses with palm trees, cactus fields and a volcano in the background, when the weather is sunny give overall feedback not dissimilar from the basic experience; the ~problem~ of the Storm Island climate, however, is that here the delicate downpours of Montellino and surroundings, in addition to being the order of the day, are transformed into real tropical cyclones, with significant effects both on the visual impact about the gameplay. Observing the crowns of the trees tormented under very violent gusts of wind, between volumetric clouds of water at the mercy of the storm, fog and very poor visibility, permeates the scenario with a decidedly apocalyptic flavor, especially during the night races of the new Gauntlet mode, real flagship of the Forza Horizon 2 expansion. The narrow dirt roads that characterize a large part of Storm Island, sometimes nestled in the heart of lush forests, are particularly difficult - as fascinating - to deal with due to the continuous variations of slope, which often lead to crazy jumps and spectacular accidents, with chain rollovers and ruinous emergency landings. The result is a gameplay reinvigorated by the extreme conditions, which enhance the goodness and scalability of the excellent driving model borrowed from Forza Motorsport 5, forcing the player to reinvent himself as a real off-road driver, since the excellent excursions around Sisteron and San Giovanni, by comparison, are little more than a comfortable outing. To get the better of these impervious conditions, the developers have added a new series of Storm Island branded components to the modification package: among them we find off-road tyres, particularly raised springs and shock absorbers and a new gearbox, to be equipped both on cars already prepared for the continental festival (with the need to process or download the relative assets), and for the jewels made available by PlayGround Games for the occasion. The new cars are the 2013 Robby Gordon #7 Speed Energy Drink Stadium Super Truck, a very fast S1-Class competition pick-up that closely resembles those seen in Codemasters Dirt, the MINI X-Raid All4 Racing Countryman victorious at the Rally Dakar 2013, the similar Ford Ranger T6 RallyRaid, an old but enjoyable 1981 Ford Fiesta XR2 and finally the Mitsubishi Galant VR-4. To these must be added a ~Forgotten Jewel~ to be found on the map - this time without any indication - which we will not reveal so as not to spoil the surprise. In Storm Island there are the beauty of ninety new events, and in the various championships of the festival, divided into six so-called Tiers, there are five new types of off-road themed races, namely Rampage, Brawl, Extreme Cross Country, Cross Country Circuit and the already mentioned Gauntlet. With the exception of the latter, however, from the point of view of the actual competition there are no major differences with the already popular competitions in the basic package; in Brawl, for example, the obstacles on the track should dominate the explanation, but more often than not it is a matter of a couple ofbottlenecks or detours surrounded by pins, to be approached carefully. The topography of the territory and the ~nastiness~ of the aforementioned atmospheric agents, however, gives a whole new flavor to most of the races, which can also be held under a very thick fog at dawn, rendered in a truly realistic way. Within the six Tiers that make up the new Festival Horizon, most of the championships are dedicated to Rally cars (both modern and vintage) and off-road vehicles, but there is no shortage of dangerous challenges between Hot Hatch and real nightmares aboard the Muscles American cars, which if not suitably modified make life practically impossible for the driver, between spins and unrecoverable ~straights~. In Storm Island you will be forced to activate the Traction Control (TCS) and the Stability Control (SCS) even with the fast off-road competition vehicles, especially if you drive with the steering wheel and with the internal view, as you suddenly lose control and crash at due to the very poor visibility, under certain conditions, it is an almost constant risk. Measured with the new hardcore approach, however, this Forza Horizon 2 expansion manages to get the best out of the gameplay prepared by Turn 10 and reworked in an arcade key by the talented British guys from PlayGround Games. To complete the offer of Storm Island we find the inevitable signs to be destroyed, which in this case give a discount on modifications to enhance the cars, and new highly appreciated Unmissable Challenges, where you can launch yourself at full throttle in events with specific cars and objectives, without forgetting the online structure that works for this expansion exactly as it does for the base game. In Forza Horizon 2 comes the storms of Storm Island, new wet expansion Xbox One goals Storm Island adds 23 Objectives for a total of 500 new points to conquer, a further incentive for the completionists who will be able to get satisfaction from the first hours of the game with a good dose of unlocked points. The perfect storm From a purely aesthetic point of view, Storm Island enhances the good things that have already been appreciated in the enormous Forza Horizon 2 map, thanks to the fury of the atmospheric agents that upset a generally relaxing landscape. However, there are also some minor limitations. The impetuous quantity of water unleashed by the storms, in fact, should create real rivers of water and mud on the winding dirt roads that characterize the island, nevertheless only large muddy puddles are visible, the yield of which, in certain circumstances, it is also a bit flat as regards the textures used, without detracting from the splendid overview and the rendering of the effects (both particle and lighting). It would undoubtedly have been spectacular to be able to ford rivers and have to deal with dangerous bumps full of mud, a bit like in the spectacular Spintires of Ovee Games Studios, also because some ~ferocious~ off-road vehicles made available would have the potential to face the aforementioned obstacles. Even the water that should arrive ~buckets~ on the windshields is attenuated, but these are subtleties that probably would have influenced the driving dynamics of the title too much. In some rare particularly chaotic circumstances we have noticed some small slowdowns, and there are some recycled assets, such as the Tuscan cypresses, despite everything Storm Island is a real feast for the eyes in almost all cases, underlining the capabilities of the new Microsoft flagship. Too bad not being able to reach the Dormire and Attuna mountain complexes with the aforementioned volcano inspired by Etna, which are simply the backdrop for raids on Storm Island. Overall we are faced with an appreciable expansion, full of content, new modes and able to give a more complex driving experience than the base game; shame about the rather high price, i.e. 19.99, while those who have purchased the VIP Pass can enjoy it for only 9.99.", "date": "2014-12-22", "grade": null}
