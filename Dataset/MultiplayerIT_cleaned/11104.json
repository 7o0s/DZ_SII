{"name": "Pipe Mania - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pipe-mania-recensione.html", "text": "Pipe Mania has the same title as a puzzle game (also known as Pipe Dream) released for many 8 and 16 bit systems, which had the same concept and the same gameplay (we talk about it in a special box). As a young plumber you have to build a pipe to make water flow from one point to another on the map. Each level, rectangular in shape, is divided into tiles and a piece of pipe can be placed on each tile. The latter can be of various types: straight, curved, bridged, slowing down, accelerating and so on. The main difficulty is to be able to build the pipe by reaching the required number of pieces in each level. So, it's not enough to go straight using the fastest possible route, but you need to develop a long enough one that allows you to reach the set goal. At the end of each level, points will be awarded based on the length of the pipe and various other factors that vary according to the map (for example, in many there are treasures hidden behind tiles), minus malus points due to the number of pieces wasted, i.e. placed outside the pipe in which the water flows. the risk, when an old puzzle game is brought back to life, is always to exceed its limit and, by adding superfluous elements, to weigh down the formula instead of improving it It is precisely the flow of water (or the variations introduced, such as little trains and the like) that is the main difficulty. Summary: a mission fails if a pipe loses too much water or if time runs out (where present). There are two reasons that can cause leaks: the pipe is not well connected or not finished, or it is broken due to the intervention of a rival plumber. Yes, a kind of competition between plumbers has also been included among the innovations compared to the original formula, narrated throughout the game. The plot is as interesting as an episode of the Island of the Famous, but it serves to make sense of the presence of the competition whose only role is to try to break the pipe that we have put together with so much love. Pipe Mania aka Pipe Dream Pipe Mania has its own history. The first version of the game was published in 1989 for the Amiga, to then be converted, the same year and the following year, on various systems, including the eternal rival Atari ST, the immortal Commodore 64, the Apple II, the NES and so on. The game basically consisted of just the pipe creation phase, with the difficulty determined by the time available and the speed at which the water flows. In 2000, an unsuccessful 3D version was released for the first PlayStation, called Pipe Dream 3D. Shall we coo? The risk, when exhuming an old puzzle game, is always to go beyond its limit and, by adding superfluous elements, to weigh down the formula instead of improving it. We can call it the ~Tetris syndrome~ or the need to justify the new incarnation with additions of various kinds that are of little use and in the long run prove harmful to the game economy. Pipe Mania has the advantage, compared to any Tetris, of not having enjoyed many sequels or remakes (at least official... something is found in the indie scene) and, therefore, can present itself as a novelty for the mass of players who have tried or haven't heard of the original at all. Even in this case, however, there is no escaping the rule: where the basic formula (building the pipe) is the best and most engaging part, the novelties add variety but soon turn out to be a mere surplus. All this speech to say that the best mode of the game, the one that manages to capture for hours and to which you return from time to time to play a disengaged game, is the classic one, i.e. the one without frills, and certainly not the campaign mode , fun while it lasts, but less addictive than the other. Too bad that the classic mode is not available immediately (you have to go through the campaign before you can unlock it). Wait though, even the campaign has some worthy features that make it long enough. The most stimulating one is certainly the awarding of medals at the end of each mission: overcoming some levels is not at all difficult, but often obtaining the gold medal requires a lot of commitment and a good ability to plan the pipeline, which must be lengthened as needed but without exceeding, in order not to risk having to manage dozens of useless pieces. Obviously in the advanced levels the situation becomes more complicated and getting the coveted medals becomes even more difficult. Lack of style From a technical point of view, Pipe Mania is very simple and offers well-designed, if slightly bland, 2D graphics and a series of musical accompaniments.to boring that in the long run you want to turn off. Nothing compromising for a puzzle game, even if the genre has been able to offer, especially over the last few years, stylistically exceptional titles such as Lumines or Meteos, just to mention two names which, while not requiring large resources, have managed to stand out for their character. A character that Pipe Mania completely lacks, having aimed at a generic cartoon look with limited appeal, too copied from other sources and essentially not very original. Moreover, the graphics are practically identical for all versions, apart from the different arrangement of the menus, a fact that penalizes the major systems above all. If you like puzzle games, however, you will pay little attention to the technical problems and will undoubtedly get hooked on the game. We are facing a good reissue of a classic of the past and nothing more. If you like puzzle games you should definitely think about it, especially by virtue of the budget price (PC version). In short, a recommended product that can give many hours of play.
