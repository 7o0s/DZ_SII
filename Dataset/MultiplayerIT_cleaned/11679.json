{"name": "3Style Snowboarding", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/3style-snowboarding.html", "text": "Despite being a very young company, Gameleons can count on a rather varied catalogue. This 3Style Snowboarding isn't the first ~acrobatic~ title the developer team has tried, having already gained experience with the Ski Jump series, but it's certainly the most ambitious one. In fact, it boasts a more complex technical realization and convincing numbers: fifteen races to try your hand at, each characterized by different rules, and a dozen tricks that can be performed in the air or while sliding on the snow. The structure of each event sees us launch ourselves from a more or less steep descent using our snowboard, with the aim of scoring a certain number of points to earn a bronze, silver or gold medal. Conquering one or the other allows us to unlock the next races, in fact as we progress the game will have increasingly exorbitant requests to allow us to continue, such as to transform us into expert players whether we like it or not. In some stages you can perform all the tricks to reach the set score, in others only some of them will be accepted. In any case, the control system allows us to perform each maneuver in a rather simple way: by holding down and releasing the 5 key, we can leap, preferably near a trampoline. Once in the air, the 4 and 6 keys will make us rotate forwards or backwards, and at the same time we will be able to act on the remaining keys of the numeric pad to perform grans, rotations and anything else that is synonymous with spectacularity. Some tricks take a few seconds to perform and finish on their own, while others need to be turned on and off because the score goes up depending on how long you stay in that position. It is clear that upon landing we will have to be aligned with the slope and not have active tricks, or we will end up crashing on the snow, receiving a penalty. At the beginning we will find ourselves falling often, but a few games will be enough to understand when to move and when not to move, to get the maximum possible score. The ~rewards~ structure obliges us to become quite good in order to continue in the competitions, and it is certainly an extra not to be overlooked: being able to try all the events immediately would certainly have shortened the life of a product that makes slopes unlock one of its strengths. The technical realization of 3Style Snowboarding is of an excellent level. The game isn't as fast as Freestyle Moto-X, indeed the descent on the snow is rather slow and ~reasoned~, but it still manages to be spectacular thanks to the large number of maneuvers that can be performed. Just like in the Xendex title, the character is made up of an extremely simple polygonal model, which however has the advantage of moving in a fluid and convincing way. In the background, the landscape moves slower than the track in the foreground, and in both cases it boasts a good level of detail. The use of colors is good, and the number of elements on the screen is such that it never leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Unfortunately the sound sector is not up to the situation: equipped with an independent volume control from the telephone, it consists of a few music that is far from unforgettable, which you soon end up muting. The game has a multiplayer mode via bluetooth, nice even if not essential. Finally, the control system is quite simple and intuitive, but once again its effectiveness is closely related to the terminal in your possession: if you have a good joystick, you can control the character and his rotations with it, to recall the trick on the number pad. Otherwise, it will be better for you to remain anchored to the numeric keyboard only, with all the necessary inconveniences.
