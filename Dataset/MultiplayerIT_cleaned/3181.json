If you don't know the game, a clarification is a must: we are not dealing with a real sequel to the excellent Enter the Gungeon, but a spin-off that takes up characters and settings after the conclusion of the original campaign , entrusting us with another particularly complex task. Where previously our goal was to enter the Gungeon, in fact, now we will have to try to get out by referring to substantially different gameplay mechanics. Putting aside the twin stick shooter formula of the beginning, the new title pays homage to classics such as Super Crate Box to immerse ourselves in challenging challenges to the last bullet that take place first in rapid elevators, then in static environments. The rules are simple: one button to shoot (directing fire with the right stick), one to roll and one to jump, both maneuvers that allow you to avoid shots from enemies. The rest? A lot of readiness and determination for a short but intense experience, widely replayable. Characters and gameplay The story of Exit the Gungeon, in truth barely sketched, very often recalls elements and supporting actors of the aforementioned original episode, Enter the Gungeon, putting us in the shoes of one of the four characters initially available (three more can be unlocked by completing the game) and launching us into the action after a short tutorial in which to familiarize yourself with the control system. Where on iOS it was possible to opt for touch or physical commands via Bluetooth controller, which produced real differences in gameplay in the form of aids, on Nintendo Switch the only options present allow you to adjust the aim assistance (never automated, anyway) and change the fire button by choosing between the right bumper or the right trigger. Once we enter the first elevator, within a procedural path that changes from time to time and presents different situations depending on the selected character, we will have to use up all our resources by eliminating an ever-increasing number of enemies that will appear from every corner , which will spur us to shoot in any direction with the weapon equipped. The latter undoubtedly represents the most relevant peculiarity of the game, given that it changes approximately every minute in a random way, putting us in clear difficulty if we find ourselves with a slow loading rifle and instead providing us with an advantage in case a machine gun with a large range appears. Cross and delight of experience, this aspect implies the need to also have a good dose of luck in order to be in the best conditions to face the various bosses. Enemies and technical achievement As mentioned, the progression of the short but intense Exit the Gungeon campaign uses some random elements and places some dangerous bosses in our path, selected from a relatively large list. These are much more resistant enemies than normal, but above all they attack by releasing myriads of projectiles that almost entirely cover the screen, in full bullet hell style but without slowing down to make things a little easier. It therefore becomes essential to memorize the patterns of movement and attack, as well as mastering dodges (both rolling and jumping) to perfection, resorting where necessary to a consumable ~smart bomb~ which however only makes the bullets disappear and does not cause damage to the opponents. Both the bosses and, in general, the creatures that we will have to face during our desperate attempt to get out of the Gungeon are characterized by a successful and interesting design, which makes use of a very well done pixel art and offers a great variety of aspects and behaviors : from animated bullets to wizards that appear and disappear, from slimes that double to mini-bosses armed with a lightsaber, the bestiary put together by Dodge Roll does not miss practically anything, giving us a fascinating lore that consolidates the excellent work done with the original game. A discourse that extends to the scenarios, albeit limited, static and characterized by the inevitable recycling of assets due to random generation. The music is beautiful, the effects a little too artificial: the retro style also extended to the audio sector is perhaps not always a good idea.", "date": "2020-03-22", "grade": "7.5"}
