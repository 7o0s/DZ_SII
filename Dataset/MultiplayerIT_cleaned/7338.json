Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Some interesting ideas, a good technical realization and a concept full of potential, albeit very far from the thickness of the original for PC. A judgment that was valid for Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar and which is even more valid for Dungeon Keeper, the new mobile reduction by Mythic Entertainment that takes one of the most famous strategy games ever, precisely that Dungeon Keeper developed by Bullfrog and released in 1997 , and transforms it into a product basically within everyone's reach, which not only adopts a freemium model (fortunately not particularly limiting) but substantially simplifies the original gameplay, making it a casual experience for iOS and Android devices. It is clear that such an incipit can only make nostalgics and those who know the reference franchise turn up their noses, however defining the operation desired by Electronic Arts (which will soon claim new ~victims~, we suppose) as a failure on the whole line would be ungenerous, precisely because the renewed ~simplified~ formula of Dungeon Keeper works, entertains and has so much to give in its small way. But let's start from the beginning. In the game our task is to build a dungeon, make it impregnable and then try our hand at an action phase in which we take turns attacking another dungeon to appropriate its resources or defend our home from the assault of the other ~keepers~. be it artificial intelligences or human players. This last feature is completely ~asynchronous~, in the sense that it is managed automatically by the servers and we will not therefore find ourselves directly opposing our opponents. Dungeon Keeper for iOS and Android is nothing like the original, but it's fun and entertaining One slap and everything is fine Having adequately motivated our imps with a slap that will improve their production capacity for a certain period of time, the management phase of Dungeon Keeper sees us crumble the blocks of rock available on the map and place rooms of various kinds, from those for the collection of resources (rock quarries and gold mines) to those for unit training, or traps designed for when someone comes to visit us. Once the buildings have been adequately upgraded, we will be able to use the money collected to summon various types of orcs, sorcerers, necromancers and warriors of all kinds to put together a small army and move on to the strategic phase, which as mentioned will see us attacking in some missions and defending in others . If in the first case the mechanics simply lend themselves to our needs, with the units following different priorities with respect to the resources of the dungeon we intend to assault and a system that allows us to conquer checkpoints to field further pawns, in the case of defense missions things become a little more difficult and sometimes frustrating, given that it is not possible to manage the troops as we would like and perhaps tell them to leave the area in which they are to move ten meters further on, where the enemies are intent on destroy our hard-earned possessions. Fortunately, incurring a defeat does not translate into zeroing the progress made, which means that we will still be able to use the resources to continue to grow and patiently accept the expectations that the freemium formula inevitably imposes. Unless you want to reach for your wallet, of course. In short, in the end Dungeon Keeper has nothing to do with the original, as already mentioned, but represents an interesting experiment in the strategic / casual field, with many elements to unlock, a good technical sector and fairly precise touch controls. even if the ~lightness~ with which it is possible to move objects often clashes with the simple operation of moving the view, which however is not very functional.", "date": "2014-02-01", "grade": "7.2"}
