It's hard not to be banal because all this is damned true: starting from the announcement up to the arrival of the game in stores and beyond, each edition of Football Manager is experienced as a real religion, waiting for the final appointment with the a purchase that we incurable football enthusiasts find ourselves making every year. However, like all the sports series held annually, this one too does not escape the usual rule according to which it is important to distinguish between what is really new and what instead constitutes a simple add-on to something already seen, case in which to carefully evaluate whether or not to buy the current chapter. Even with FM 2012 obviously this problem continues to recur: so let's find out what Sports Interactive has reserved this year for our hard work as coaches. Between tactics and psychology The history of Football Manager teaches us that Sports Interactive has always paid enormous attention to the criticisms made by its fans, introducing new elements into the game and improving others thanks to the feedback received from those who spend hours and hours designing tactics season after season. We have rarely witnessed revolutions and many times evolutions, the latter in any case capable (except in very rare cases) of justifying the expense. Contrary to the cover, which has been more or less identical for some years, the English development team has therefore been able to add elements worthy of note: this is certainly the case of FM 2012, in which a renewed graphical interface goes alongside new elements of rather interesting game, with which the thickness of this title reaches levels never seen before. If the tactical aspect, knowing how to put the right men in the right place and the ability to deal with various game situations always remain decisive elements for success, now we also find ourselves having to deal with people and their characters, getting to know them to ensure that relationships go well. At this point, someone will say that this component was already present in the past, which is certainly right, but as we said, the ability of Sports Interactive has historically been precisely that of taking already existing aspects and giving them a renewed utility: thanks to the addition of new phrases for speeches, but above all the tone of voice with which to pronounce them, speeches during the match (just to give an example) in fact take on a completely new dimension, giving the player the opportunity to express himself as if he were really present in the locker room, or to let your deputy do it. But the interpersonal relationships to be preserved in FM 2012 do not only concern the players, given that the presence of their agents has become increasingly invasive (as in reality), forcing us to compromise to preserve the possibility of counting on the same agent for any business future. Management will also need a good level of interaction with the coach, to get along well with, which is known to be very difficult with some presidents. Particularly interesting is also the possibility of convening real locker room meetings, perhaps to face all together a bad period of the team before the irreparable happens: also in this case you have the usual series of choices linked to of voice and phrases to say, accompanied by the possibility of asking key elements of the team, such as the captain, to have their say, starting real discussions in the group and giving rise to injections of confidence capable of really improving the league's fortunes (or further scuttle morale, depending on the reaction). Life as a Mr To accompany the innovations just described this year we find a general redesign of the various game menus, both in terms of graphics (which we will see later) and in terms of functionality: if in the past some operations, even among the most frequent, required several mouse clicks to be completed, now everything is almost in front of our eyes. It starts with the all-important tactic screen, rhymesssa also with the addition of a left sidebar, where it is possible to keep an eye on the confidence of the team with a certain module: if you intend, for example, to always play with 4-4-2 you will soon find a full level of knowledge, but if you consider yourself among those ~chameleonic~ coaches, then it will be good to educate the team on other formations as well, to find it ready to interpret them when necessary. The component linked to the preparation of the game has also been inserted in the same bar, while the graphic part on the right has also undergone a renewal: in fact, alongside the classic elements, a series of other options now appear, with which to keep roles, attitudes and statistics of players on the pitch quickly and effectively. These last two adjectives can only be combined with the new section of the game dedicated to the transfer market, unrelated to the part linked to the team and enhanced with ~new~ elements on the main screen, first of all the indispensable filters thanks to which you can navigate within the huge database of players in the game. We previously talked about parts of the game that have been somewhat neglected over time: one of these continues to be represented by the training sessions, which have only apparently changed slightly thanks to the general redesign enjoyed by FM 2012, but which have remained essentially very similar to the past with the well-known slider system. On the other hand, those who have undergone a significant change are the Primavera team: finally, in fact, the coach is given much more control over his composition, especially starting from the late stage of the season. For obvious reasons, in fact, we find ourselves starting with already trained youth teams, but as the game progresses, new players will gradually be offered to us, with the possibility of putting them to the test through matches to be played against our Primavera, choosing after having analyzed the potential whether to include them in the team or not, relying on our scouting ability to find the new Messi. If desired (like most of the elements) it is possible to delegate the operation to one's second, or even take a radical decision: ask the club not to invest in young people, thus obtaining more funds for the transfer campaign. However, if you plan to create a new Barcelona project, know that this is highly discouraged. Remaining on the subject of youth teams, even the so-called newgen (footballers generated by artificial intelligence over playing time) have seen some changes, linked above all to their geographical area: for example, technical and elegant talents will be able to arrive from Brazil, while from Spain players accustomed to the phrasing, thus responding more realistically to the various football schools in the world. However, this aspect requires hours and hours of play to be properly evaluated, so we have to rely on the promises of the development team. On the bench like on TV The technical aspect has never been the flagship of Football Manager: the sound is practically absent, even if during the matches it is possible to feel a few steps forward from the point of view of the so-called ~stadium effect~. However, as far as audio is concerned, everything stops here, leaving room for considerations on the technology developed by Sports Interactive (for some years now) to show matches in 3D. The new visual director created by the developers allows you to enjoy the match with television-style shots, thus closely appreciating free kicks, corners and millimeter offside replays. The animations have been improved to make the men on the pitch a little less woody, even if it will certainly take time to reach certain levels of fluidity: slightly different speech for the commentary sentences, which certainly already know too much view. One aspect that historically worries fans of the series regards loading: on the test configuration there were obviously no problems, but even on a less performing PC with Dual Core 1.6GHz and 3GB of RAM we did not encounter any slowdowns capable of lose patience. From this point of view, another option introduced in FM 2012 comes to our aid, very useful in practical terms: if in the past the championships chosen and the workload for the system consequently remained unchangeable, now we have the possibility to add and remove nations and leagues more or less playable during the game itself, thus adapting the game's ~hunger~ for computing power more effectively to the configuration in our possession. We have already had the opportunity to talk about the layout of the menus from a functional point of view,instead postponing the purely aesthetic one: the graphics of FM 2012 are quite different even for those who grew up with this series, requiring some time to be properly digested. The biggest novelty consists in the ability of the menus to adapt to the resolution of the PC, thus offering a greater number of information where possible, instead reducing the data to the bare essentials in the case of small screens.", "date": "2011-10-20", "grade": "9.0"}
