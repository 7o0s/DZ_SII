A success evidently confirmed by the two sequels Mikey Hooks and Mikey Boots, which have been able to integrate new mechanics (in this case the use of a grappling hook and boots useful for making the protagonist float) while keeping the framework and spirit of the game intact. original. With Mikey Jumps here, however, the developers have decided to deviate from the usual path, adopting the free to play model for the first time and compressing the experience into a rapid succession of much shorter and more linear stages. So let's find out if the road taken is the right one... Mikey Jumps works by combining old acquaintances with a new model for the series Ugly but good Let's start by talking about what - unfortunately - hasn't changed in this Mikey Jumps, i.e. a graphic design so poor as to be almost annoying: pixel art is fine, the prevalence of substance over form is fine, the old school attitude is fine but frankly it is not tolerable to see a game so poor from a technical and stylistic point of view considering the performance of modern mobile devices. BeaverTap Games evidently cares about all this and continues undaunted on its way, proposing for the umpteenth time a fourth-rate browser game cosmetics, complete with limited colors, bare-bones animations and almost non-existent effects. As always happens with Mikey's titles, however, it is difficult to sulk for a long time thanks to the qualities that the series is capable of bringing out from a playful point of view, fortunately far superior to appearances. At the beginning we mentioned a change of course marked by Mikey Jumps compared to the past, which manifests itself in various aspects: the first and most evident concerns the structure of the stages, which abandon the classic platform style to adopt a formula closer to the standards of modern mobile gaming. Each scenario is therefore made up of 10 micro-levels that barely occupy the space of a screen, with the protagonist starting from the left end and who must reach the star on the right side unscathed in order to move on to the next scheme. Another substantial difference is reflected in the control system, orphaned of the virtual keys as it requires the player only to perform a tap on the display to make the character jump and automatically run forward. In this unprecedented context for the series, the familiarity is found in the elements of the gameplay, taken from the previous chapters and appropriately adapted for the occasion: the protagonist must therefore avoid enemies and obstacles, overcome danger zones with the grappling hook and float with the appropriate boots, all condensed into a level design that does its best to make each segment different from the next and challenging enough to keep the challenge rate up to par. The result works, I must say: Mikey Jumps is even more immediate and fun than the previous ones, and this particular structure makes it even more suitable for those quick and impromptu games that are typical of the mobile format. What is certain is that in this process the challenge factor linked to speed runs has been lost, replaced by another component which however does not give the impression of working in the same way: here the rankings are in fact based on the number of stages completed without losing a life, an aspect that could make fans of the old guard turn up their noses. The little hearts that represent the attempts available to the user are also the fulcrum of the monetization mechanisms of Mikey Jumps: the application therefore requires the disbursement of  1.99 in order to have an initial supply of six lives forever (instead of the canonical three) or allows you to enjoy this same one-off bonus upon viewing an advertisement. A balanced and more than acceptable solution, which combined with the 200 levels that make up the campaign, make Mikey Jumps a platformer that won't write history pages but that entertains without great pretensions.", "date": "2016-11-16", "grade": "7.9"}
