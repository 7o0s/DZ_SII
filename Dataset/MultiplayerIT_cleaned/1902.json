{"name": "Big Scale Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/big-scale-racing.html", "text": "Simplicity and Immediacy The creation of the game is very clean, the menus are easily accessible and very clear, quick to consult, all designed to remove as much dispersion as possible from the user, often in many games ~drunk~ by too many options and submenus. The single player mode offers us three race possibilities: we can play a championship from a list of 11 total, which winds through all the tracks present; the number of championships is not given so much by particular settings, but by the fact that every time you will race on the same tracks with a different vehicle. To move up the ranks and unlock all (initially locked) championships step by step, you have to win the competition or hope to get on the podium in three different competitions. In addition to this mode we find the simple race, which can be set according to a few but essential choices (the most salient is the typology: ~championship race~ is a race restricted to opponents with your own car or an ~open race~, open to all types of means, a real mess! ); finally, a free practice session could certainly not be missing where you can become familiar with the routes and means without fear of making a bad impression or sadly ending up in the grass... The limited number of routes, just 6, of which one is the classic pure Nascar-style oval. Fortunately, the layout of the tracks is good, as they have been designed in such a way as to balance, I would say, excellently long straights with wide hairpin bends. The style is typical of Formula 1 courses, in perfect dark asphalt with numerous curbs where you can perform overtaking at the last meter (well, in this case at the last centimetre!). As for the vehicles, we have 5 ~standard~ ones, with 18cc power that do not exceed 10,000 rpm, and their 5 hopped counterparts, which manage to give us 22cc with accelerations over 18,000 rpm! I can assure you that the difference in the race is felt, and how it is felt! You will start with the standard base model and by winning the various championships you will eventually be able to unlock all the cars as well, arriving at the latest models that are practically uncontrollable so powerful are they. Doing the math we have 5+5= 10 vehicles, but which I said earlier to be 11... there's a final surprise! Even in this case, however, I was personally perplexed: there are 5 models, whose characteristics were then changed to obtain another 5 ~fake~ new ones ... perhaps in the long run too many models create confusion, but at first glance one remains somewhat annoyed. However, there is good news: it seems that work is underway (both by fans and staff) on future implementations and creations of new courses and new cars, so in the not too near future these defects could disappear, perhaps along the lines of Need for Speed, with a huge range of cars downloadable from the Internet. What you can now find are just the various skins to apply to your racing cars to give it a much more aggressive look than the colors that are offered to you. Speaking of the Internet, BSR offers (obviously) the multiplayer mode, which consists of LAN and Split-Screen games for two local players. Alas, therefore, no support for games via the network and it is a real shame not to exploit the full potential of this type of game. The split screen is now a consolidated mode and always very funny, especially for the laughter and the nudges that are thrown at each other! Games via Lan are obviously amusing, because they manage to integrate well both with the frenetic, light and fun game, and with the high number of people present, up to 8. The other side of the coin The learning curve of the game is really high, as after just a few laps of the track the management mechanism is immediate and natural. Confidence with the machines is excellent at the beginning, but continuing and checking different models decreases drastically. On the one hand, the BumbleBeasts have created a product with instantaneous impact, quick both to understand and to implement: cornering braking, drifting, counter-steering succeed quite well, also helped by a highly realistic and very spectacular physical model of the cars; from this point of view they have succeeded where other more famous houses have failed, that is to create a system that immediately creates a feeling with the player without being ~cumbersome~. On the other hand, however, with the increase in engine power and the greater amount of ~simulation~ present in the races, one has the sensation of not being completely masters of the road: the cars break up a lotwhen cornering, decisive entries and Gran Turismo-style counters become very risky, as we are the ones who lose out at 80%, minimal corrections under full acceleration in the straights almost always lead to a disastrous exit in the middle of the meadows, with a restart absolutely tough. This ~sporting realism~ could discourage some young players, perhaps more inclined to an arcade and dynamic style but not to a more meditative and technical one; expert users, on the other hand, could give great satisfaction since it requires not so much grit and decision as precision and strategy: you need to know when to brake, when to enter corners, know how to control skids and manage your opponents without making mistakes. It seems strange to say, whoever wins is not so much the fastest, but the one who in the end committed the least mistakes and kept a cleaner and clearer driving behavior than the others; alas the aggressiveness and the spectacularity of the maneuvers pay little at the end of the race in this game. The world seen in 1/15 scale Graphically, BSR is bare but essential, devoid of unnecessary frills in the various menus, but with attention to the details of the race. The cars are well made, with excellent textures (although not very elaborate), only ruined by 3D models that are a little low in polygons (but that's not a big bad thing). The circuits are excellent, and the various weather effects (especially the wet) contribute to giving a particular atmosphere to the matches, reflecting menacing black clouds in the sky or showing a beautiful sunset. Driving is actually affected by the climatic effects (as if the rest weren't enough!) in a different way, but not so strongly as to upset the regular progress of the race. The game is always fluid, it doesn't weigh excessively on our computer and this makes it even more appreciable by all those who want to enjoy a fun and non-invasive pastime. The environment surrounding the track is good, but not great; the usual bitmaps instead of fans and 3d constructions of the surrounding environment. Always remaining of immediacy, a quick mention for the audio that is quite anonymous, without infamy and without praise; the hisses of the car are good as well as the background music, which includes dance, rock and mixed pieces, without however leaving a strong trace ... on this in fact we could have worked better, but evidently the programmers have decided not to spend too much energy in a sector that was of little interest to them. Final conclusions Summing up, BSR looks like an excellent game born in silence, from an unknown software house, without great pretensions and without too many refinements, but which has found the videogame audience strongly interested, you want for the so linear and ~practical~ realization, either for the ease with which each person can play and access it (same reasons why solitaire and windows pinball are among the most used games in the world), or for the immediate fun it transmits. However, the price to pay for all of this has proved to be considerable, and in some fields the game denotes shortcomings that leave a bad taste in the mouth because they taste like a missed opportunity. The small number of cars and tracks, the sound gaps, the non-extreme graphic details, are the moles that weigh on the final judgment, which however always remains satisfactory; I hope, however, that they don't cut the legs off this game too soon, which is quietly making a lot of talk about itself. A new challenge Surely when we talk about sports car races, the first things that come to mind are engines with exaggerated displacements, aerodynamic and highly elaborated bodies, demanding and tortuous tracks, fierce and tenacious drivers, hot asphalt and lots and lots of crowds. Well, Big Scale Racing is none of that!! The brand new BumbleBeast software house has produced this new game by focusing it not so much on the great world of engines, but on that of small radio-controlled cars. In fact, this videogame sector has been orphaned for a long time of significant products and the one who still holds the scepter of best game is the unbeatable Revolt. Of course, the latter favored more the arcade spirit of racing with radio-controlled cars, while Big Scale Racing was born more as a realistic simulation of the world of mini four-wheelers.", "date": "2002-11-29", "grade": null}
