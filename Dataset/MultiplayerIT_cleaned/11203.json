{"name": "Super Jewel Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-jewel-quest_a.html", "text": "The importance of the puzzle game genre for mobile gaming is universally recognized: in the era in which mobile phones did not have particular technical capabilities, in fact, it was one of the few avenues that could be followed by those who developed video games. If at first we saw the proliferation of various versions of classics such as Tetris, with the technological development came the first original products, which in some cases met with great success and were transformed into series of several episodes. Super Jewel Quest, created by I-play, is an excellent example: it is, in fact, the last chapter of a long sequence of puzzle games of excellent quality, which are based on effective and fun mechanics: the player finds himself managing the boxes of a board, on which there are numerous different jewels, and of course he has to put the same objects together to make them disappear. As mentioned above, Super Jewel Quest doesn't put us in front of a mere sequence of levels to face, but acts on the basis of a storyline that is narrated during the loading phases: our young adventurer (clearly inspired by Indiana Jones in appearance) is looking for ancient relics, and to find them he will have to face a series of characters in challenges to the last jewel on the game board. We are talking about a hundred stages, characterized by a structure that alternates the ~standard~ phases with the challenges: in the first case, we will have to trigger eliminations (by putting together three or more identical jewels) along the entire surface of the board, which becomes golden as a result ; in the second case, it will instead be a question of eliminating (and therefore collecting) a certain number of jewels before the opponent, or of taking possession of a certain percentage of the board. The action takes place in a rather simple way: using the mobile phone's d-pad, we move a pointer on the board to select a box, which by pressing the 5 key is ~swapped~ with an adjacent one. If the maneuver leads to the meeting of three or more identical jewels, these are eliminated, causing the vertical boxes above to ~fall~. It is clear that even a single elimination can lead to long and spectacular combos, since moving the board can create other combinations. There is also a sort of ~game within the game~, because to complete the stages you need to achieve certain objectives, but the elimination of jewels still translates into the collection of useful points to build our records... The technical realization of the new I-play product is really good. Apart from the sound, which unfortunately doesn't make a difference and on some terminals it produces annoying slowdowns, we have very nice graphics, full of colours, with the various jewels well differentiated and therefore without the possibility of confusing them during the game. Management of the board is always ~agile~, the effect of eliminating pieces is good as well as the drawing style, in general. The control system is simple and immediate, everything is done with the d-pad and a single key, whereas the function keys are used to take advantage of the help (you can make a single box disappear, but only three times) or to recall the options menu. PRO Play structure rich in thickness Fun, engaging and long-lasting Well done graphics AGAINST The action could have been a little faster Subdued sound Very similar to the other Jewel Quests", "date": "2008-09-12", "grade": "S.V."}
