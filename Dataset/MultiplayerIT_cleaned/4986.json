The experiment can be said to be successful even with several negative elements that undermined the game to the point of not letting it reach the coveted goal of 9. The universe to explore is immense but plagued by too many forgettable secondary quests and almost at the level of the so-called ~fetch quests~ from MMOs, the narrative arc lacks that epic tone that has always distinguished the series and it is above all those who pay the price the antagonist and the six companions who will accompany you during the adventure. Even technically, the game is capable of surprising in its incredible visual horizon and in the excellent variety of scenarios, but it clearly fails when you look at the details, in particular the body and facial animations of all the humanoid characters. In short, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a title dedicated to a dualism that will probably be remembered above all for the excellent reactivity of its combat system, for that flow of action dynamics that make it a fun, immediate and frenetic title when you start shooting. The shooter mechanics work perfectly and are, among other things, enhanced by a very customizable and deep skill system that gets rid of the rigidity of the old class system. We do not want to go further with the details and rather refer you to our review if you want to learn more about this huge title. In fact, in this review we want to focus on the PlayStation 4 version of the game, spending several words on the quality of the conversion and on the purely technical aspects of this edition. It will therefore be a short and direct article to the point but we will not fail to be present in the comments if some element does not convince you or if you still have doubts about the product. BioWare has done a really good job with the PlayStation 4 version of Mass Effect: Andromeda Playstation 4 trophies Mass Effect: Andromeda offers 56 trophies. Apart from the inevitable platinum, we find two gold ones that require you to reach the maximum degree of livability on the five explorable planets and complete the game at the highest level of difficulty, or to complete five multiplayer games with the gold degree. Then there are five silver trophies split evenly between completing the single player campaign and achieving certain milestones in multiplayer. Finally, the 48 bronze trophies are rather easy to collect, being almost all linked to specific battle conditions and only minimally to the degree of completion of the campaign. Pro or non pro, that is the question Let's start immediately by saying that Andromeda supports the additional power of PlayStation 4 Pro. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no type of option that can be configured by hand: in short, we are not given the possibility to opt between a higher resolution or a frame rate more stable as happens for example with Horizon Zero Dawn or NiOh. The game configures everything automatically to aim for the best compromise between graphic fidelity and frame per second retention. Precisely for this reason both versions of the game, PlayStation 4 smooth and Pro, run at 30 frames per second even if the latter is extremely more stable and shows some problems only in the most crowded environments especially in terms of vegetation and sometimes when there are many on-screen explosions with resulting particles. If we had to trust our eye exclusively, putting the two versions next to each other, we feel like saying that the smooth one never actually reaches 30, but you lose a few frames along the way, probably around 25-27 and then go down more conspicuously in the situations mentioned above. As far as resolution is concerned, the basic version renders the game at 1080p while on the Pro we reach 1800p through the usual checkerboard rendering. So you never touch the native 4k (2160p) but on PlayStation 4 Pro we get very close. Then there are numerous graphic artifices and post-processing effects that are decidedly cleaner and more aggressive on the enhanced version of the Sony console but, before going into details, we feel we can state with confidence that to an inattentive eye or in the typical scenario in where you can't have both consoles close together for a direct comparison, it will be quite difficult to notice the differences in detail between the two editions.There is no doubt that BioWare has done a truly excellent job of trying to make the most of the Sony flagship, offering incredible artistic glimpses, a very wide visual horizon and often also numerous elements on the screen. The work done on the management of the lights is excellent and even if, obviously, the Pro version can boast HDR support which literally makes the more airy scenarios of Andromeda shine, even on smooth PlayStation 4 the lighting behaves admirably with believable shadows and excellent management of light sources. The artifices and dirt typical of the interpenetration of the elements are reduced to a minimum and ambient occlusion also works well with both versions of the console even if the effect on the Pro is slightly higher in terms of rendering. Then there's the anti-aliasing issue. As is well known PlayStation 4 struggles to apply filters on transparent objects and this factor is evident in the more open spaces of the game where very tall buildings can often be seen silhouetted in the distance. On PlayStation 4 Pro the classic phenomenon of jagged edges is very muffled but it is never completely absent. In closing we can then underline that on the most powerful Sony machine there is a higher quality for everything concerning the textures, the vegetation, in particular the leaves, and some elements of the characters, especially the clothes and the hair. Unfortunately, the latter are never animated in a credible way while as regards the clothes it is possible to admire a higher resolution than the normal mapping. On the other hand, we were a bit surprised to notice various pop-up phenomena on PlayStation 4 Pro especially in the citadels or in any case when there are many characters on the screen: it does not happen infrequently to see some appear out of nowhere as if the game wanted to load them in a few moments lagging behind the rest of the scene. It is probably only a problem of optimization of the code since on PlayStation 4 smooth the phenomenon does not occur with the same frequency and when it does, it affects all the elements of the scenario without distinction, not just the humanoids.", "date": "2017-03-21", "grade": "8.0"}
