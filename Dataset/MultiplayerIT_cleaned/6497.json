The very stylish soundtrack, the pixel art graphics with ultra acid colors and the deliberately excessive use of violence so exaggerated as to become almost comical, made it one of the most interesting excursions into the independent scene of that season. Three years later, Wrong Number arrives with some postponements and many expectations on its shoulders, a burden that hasn't prevented Dennaton Games from working in full freedom and autonomy on a successful, fun project that is undoubtedly worth the fifteen euros required to the purchase, despite some shady spots that don't make it comparable to the progenitor. Neither for freshness and originality, but this was to be expected, nor for the success of a gameplay that takes a partially criticizable direction. Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is the successful sequel to a masterpiece Bigger and louder You are hiding behind a door waiting for the right moment to strike. The top view helps you to see beyond the walls, to follow the movements of the enemies ready to take you out. At the right moment you make your way into the new environment, knocking out an opponent and killing the others with a couple of well-aimed pistol shots, before smashing the head of the poor fellow who collapsed on the wall after your action-movie entrance. Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number works much like the original, it swaps the mechanics almost perfectly and this is certainly a good thing. With the analog sticks you move and aim, with the backbones you change weapons and use them. There's not much else to know, the only task is to dodge every single bullet, avoid all the blows because it only takes a moment to die and start over. The pace is fast, the loading instantaneous and although you end up going back to the same scenarios several times before completing them, the experience never ceases to be fun. In reality, something has changed, first of all in terms of level design: larger spaces, more numerous enemies and a seemingly secondary change of perspective in the way the levels are tackled, which makes the gameplay less strategic and more frenetic. Unfortunately, having to rely more on reflexes in a rather demanding game increases the sense of frustration, which is felt in certain passages. It happens several times throughout the campaign to try to face a certain situation in the most spectacular way and to try it about ten times, before losing patience and starting to play hide and seek with the enemies to lure them to you and take them out from behind a wall. Among other things, there are some bugs - the relationship between dogs and doors is dramatic - which make certain situations really boring. Although the progression of the original was smoother and overall better, Wrong Number still manages to do well and takes advantage of a longer campaign, which takes at least ten hours to complete, to transport us into more varied environments and variegated. No longer just buildings and apartments but also prisons in the midst of a riot, war zones, sheds and garages. There's a surprise with every new scheme, and while in many cases the variety is mostly cosmetic, this constant change of environments helps keep the experience game after game fresh. Ambitions In Hotline Miami the plot was just a pretext to stage over the top, ultra-violent situations. In Wrong Number Dennaton Games does not intend to abandon that surreal tone but at the same time try to make the narrative more structured. The events of the game take place on three different time planes, ranging from the 60s in a setting to the ~Vietnam War~ and the United States of the 80s and 90s. There are more characters involved, a lot more dialogue and the will to unite a cast of psychopaths and criminals by a logical nexus. Unfortunately - but here personal taste comes into play - the result is confused and one gets the feeling that the writing is too obsessed with finding ~cool~ moments and mother scenes. In a context where the amalgam of gameplay, music and two-dimensional graphics is the absolute protagonist, we have probably focused too much on an aspect destined to remain secondary anyway. Rather, the presence of a dozen protagonists opens up an interesting scenario: there is less choice because now, unless you return to levels already done at a later time, you almost always have only one playable character with certain charactersstiches, but the variety has benefited. Alex and Ash, for example, move as one but are a pair of cruel killers, one equipped with an electric saw and the other with a gun. Having the two types of attack always available opens up new options and difficulties, given that it is more cumbersome but also more lethal at the same time. Evan, on the other extreme, doesn't want to kill anyone and only fights white ama. Unless he loses his temper. In many cases, one is forced to master these differences rather than being free to decide how to deal with the difficulties that arise from level to level, but the intrinsic qualities in the gameplay sustain all these differences. Among other things, once the adventure is completed the first time the so-called ~Hard Mode~ becomes available which among other things removes the possibility of hooking up to enemies, proposing an even more intense and from a certain point of view sick challenge . More interesting for the average player is instead the presence of a score and an evaluation at the end of the level, a stimulus to improve and go back to the schemes a few days after the first completion. Impossible not to conclude by mentioning the soundtrack: the electronic notes are once again the masters, they mark the rhythm and integrate perfectly with the effects that underline every shot exploded, door smashed and body quartered.", "date": "2015-03-12", "grade": "8.2"}
