{"name": "Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disneys-tarzan-return-to-the-jungle.html", "text": "In the Jungle, the mighty Jungle... Produced by Activision through the work of Digital Eclipse, Tarzan: Return to the Jungle conveys the path of the King of the jungle in an excellent platform structure, from childhood to adulthood, through 20 well-made and fairly varied levels. The first world we find ourselves exploring is the natural habitat of the ape man. Here, still a child, each internship becomes a continuous discovery of the skills in his possession thanks to the wise advice of his friend Terk. In a handful of levels (used as a pure but effective tutorial) the primordial gymnast skills of the good Tarzan are acquired and refined: from different types of jumps to the sinuous twirling from one liana to another, from climbing techniques on any surface up to diving and so-called ~grinding~. These last two skills also represent the most spectacular and fun pivot around which the game revolves with simple and intelligent speed. It is possible to use every inclination provided by the trees of the jungle to glide over them in a big way, gain speed and thus reach otherwise prohibitive heights or to quickly escape rather difficult enemies. Obviously, the cases in which to flee should be rare, in favor of a more appropriate and fearless attitude. To further all this, young Tarzan has a boomerang on his side as a weapon which, once he enters adulthood, is abandoned in favor of elegant spears. As we have already underlined, the monkey man's childhood represents the very well structured and never boring tutorial that helps to immerse yourself in the pleasant reconstruction of the world that we are slowly discovering. The 20 game levels are divided into several areas, very different from each other: ancient ruins, the lost city of Opar as well as the temple of Queen La, the land of fire of Pellucidar, ancient ships to visit and deep sea. Only some levels maintain an exploratory matrix (in some cases it is possible to move, without restrictions, in any direction) in order to discover secrets, power ups, extra lives and collect bananas (the latter with the mere purpose of raising the end-of-level score ); in most cases, you fly from vine to vine with a very specific purpose such as saving the ever-present Jane, helping friends in danger or thwarting ongoing oppression. ...The Lion sleeps tonight! A simple, effective and fairly varied platform like this Tarzan: RTTJ is enhanced by a good technical realization. If the backdrops and settings show off ups and downs, passing from a beautiful reconstruction of the jungle (with deserving parallax effects and skilful use of colors) to other less evocative moments such as the ancient temple, the creation of the protagonist sprites is of absolute first order . Faithful to the spot-on Disney characterizations, each character is beautifully animated, never static and able to show off different stand-by movements (as when Tarzan throws curious expressions towards us, breathing with awkward movements and scratching himself shamelessly). Elements that give the whole a bit of that essential soul to involve in the adventure. To enrich the aesthetics, there are also various movies (decidedly compressed but still pleasant) extrapolated from the cartoon, strictly to be unlocked from level to level and enjoyed separately, through the options. Comment What can argue against this title is its not excessive longevity (even if some sections require some more effort to be completed) as much as an improbable replay value in search of secrets. The only real flaws in a more than decent platform that deserves, however, the dutiful ritual ~look~, offering a massive dose of playability, beautiful visuals and a classic story revised from the perspective of the Disney world. Pros: Excellent playability Various environments and different game situations Convincing animations Localization in Italian. Cons: Stages, graphically, with ups and downs. Longevity not excellent Disney and tie-ins. Cross and delight for those who follow, consume and describe the world of video games. If the delight of chance can easily be associated with the beauty of the characterization and fantasy inherent in the heart of every Disney production, a myriad of dubious titles capable of waving excellent licenses ended up being immolated on many inevitable crosses. Known stories. Very often, what separates a disappointment born from this combination from a pleasant discovery is kept in the very claims of the title. When the simpleity and purity of the Disney idea becomes complementary to the linear solidity of gameplay in an immortal concept like that of the platform game, here some delights end up being revealed in a clear way as in the case of this Tarzan: Return to the Jungle for GBA .", "date": "2003-01-24", "grade": null}
