There would be dozens of examples in this sense but, thanks to the potential of the web and the numerous nostalgics scattered throughout Italy gathered on the occasion of fairs and conferences, it is possible in part to go back in time and relive those moments, catching nuances that perhaps as a child you one was able to fully understand. One aspect that should not be underestimated when thinking back to that period now concerns, for example, school furniture, the first real status symbol in a child's life. In those years, before the advent of the most famous brands, the only way to be ~trendy~ at school was for girls to have a Barbie satchel or backpack and, for boys, strictly something from He-Man and The Masters of Universe. He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe is therefore the iOS revisitation of a truly historic saga, which has remained in the hearts of millions of people but which today, despite attempts to re-propose it, could no longer be as successful as it was then. Paradoxically, in fact, the message full of values and good recommendations for children, always present at the end of each episode, would end up making everything seem hypocritical and good-natured, considering the average amount of violence, nudity and junk TV that kids find watch for the rest of the day. I have the power! In He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe we will play the protagonist, He-Man, the ultra-strong alter ego of the prince of Eternia Adam. We will pass over how Adam and He-Man, apart from the absence of the shirt, are identical but despite this no one has ever discovered them (except the lifelong friends Orc, Sorceress and Man at Arms) to mention instead the plot of the game, which then recalls that of the cartoon. The powerful sorcerer Skeletor, with a skull suspended in the air instead of a face, wants to conquer the castle of Grayskull to understand its secrets but above all its power and thus dominate, unchallenged, the whole universe. He is aided by a series of beefy and stupid henchmen but standing in his way is He-Man, the strongest man in the universe, supported in turn by a team of legendary heroes. Prince Adam becomes He-Man thanks to the power of Grayskull, enclosed in his sword, capable of increasing his strength and courage to excess. Characteristics that, when transmitted to the fearful Cringer, transform him into the terrible Battle-Cat, a ferocious but obedient transport and combat tiger under the orders of He-Man. The title is essentially an old-fashioned scrolling platformer, with enemies to hit, crates to break and obstacles to avoid, enriched however by the original settings of the series. The first negative note, however, is given by the fact that He-Man will always be used in any case, thus lacking that splendid feeling of omnipotence that gave Adam's transformation in the name of Grayskull's power. As a bonus, which can be purchased with in-game coins, you can call on Man at Arms for a few seconds, He-Man's trusted partner. The control system is simple and intuitive, which does without keys or virtual levers and relies on common sense: holding the device in ~landscape~ mode, you go back and forth with your left thumb, moving it horizontally, with your right you go up or down, for single or double jumps. The right thumb tap gives input for sword attacks. In addition to the normal enemies, He-Man faces a boss battle at the end of each level, always interesting and never trivial, at least until you understand the ~script~ that regulates the monster's behavior, thus defeating it mercilessly. Although in theory he doesn't need them, even He-Man can buy upgrades thanks to the crystals collected throughout the story. These are new shots, increasingly destructive, and defensive elements, such as an extra life heart (Zelda style). Nice then the mini game that appears with every death, in which by interacting with Orc you can win bonuses to spend immediately. Finally, He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe can boast a technical sector of excellence, with well-made two-dimensional animations and a deliberately ~deformed~ character creation which, however, does not diminish the strong charisma of the protagonists.", "date": "2012-11-09", "grade": "8.5"}
