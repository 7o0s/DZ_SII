{"name": "Dragonshard - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragonshard-recensione.html", "text": "It is therefore truly atypical to have to note the absence of D&D from the RTS genre to date D&D and real-time strategy Eberron was so dear to me... For the purposes of D&D connoisseurs, let's say right away that the game is set in Eberron, one of the last (chronologically) created universes and that Dragonshard tends to follow the rules (as far as possible) of the paper role playing. There are three races available to us, which we know immediately through a splendid introduction: the classic ~good~ ones made up of humans, dwarves and paladins, the much more original and sensual ~Lizardfolk~, gigantic lizardfolk - reptiles and finally the mysterious Umbragen, available, however, only for skirmish and multiplayer modes (which we will discuss later). Meltin Pot Choosing one of the two factions available and consequently one of the various ~heroes~ of the two races (excellently differentiated, not only from an aesthetic point of view but also from their peculiar characteristics), we can begin our single player experience and after a few minutes we understand that there will be a main objective to accomplish and then a good number of side quests. So far nothing particularly original you will say but things start to get interesting from the first mission when we discover that Dragonshard is not just an RTS. In fact, you should know that the ludic action takes place at two ~depths~ in the most literal sense of the term: on the surface we will be able to deal with the classic real-time strategic dynamics but in the dark Dungeons, Liquid's work turns into a real hack'n'slash. The most interesting element is undoubtedly the symbiosis that will be created between the two game planes: therefore, the clerics or warriors generated on the surface will immediately go to give a hand underground to our troops decimated by monsters of unprecedented ferocity. In a genre like that of real-time strategy, inflated by a disproportionate number of titles, Dragonshard thus manages to mix elements that are already known in the best possible way, but with a completely new alchemy that reaches peaks of absolute excellence in some situations. Dragonshard manages to mix already known elements in the best possible way, but with a completely new alchemy that reaches levels of absolute excellence in some situations Meltin Pot If regarding the RPG component (which in any case also contaminates the RTS part given the upgrading of the characters that will take place with the experience points to be gained with the battles won) there is very little to say given its rather ~standard~ nature, it is only right spend a few lines to note the characteristics of the strategic part. The most appropriate reference under this profile is that of the latest productions of Timegate Studios (Kohan 2 and Axis & Allies the most recent titles): in fact, at a logistical level we will not be able to choose to place our village everywhere but there will be pre-established points in which to build our settlement. Another predetermined element is the size of these buildings: there will always be 16 ~slots~ available to which we can then add outposts (whose location is also already decided on the map) which can only contain 4 buildings. As you can understand, the absolute determination of the place and size of our strongholds requires a higher degree of management than usual also because, as you may have already imagined, the number of soldiers available will also be limited. Another similarity with the productions of Timegate concerns the units recruited: in practice we will have at our disposal small autonomous companies made up of a captain and various complementary soldiers who, however, will not follow their commander when he embarks on underground adventures. Fantasy aesthetics Judging the technical component of Dragonshard is not an entirely simple thing. Certainly there is a three-dimensional graphics engine on which the graphic representation of the game is based, capable of managing many units on the screen without excessive frame rate problems even with the latest generation PCs. On the other hand, however, also pushed to high resolutions and with all the graphic parameters active, the Atari stock remains at discrete levels but does not reach those peaks of excellence that we have seen in products of the same genre (remaining in the house of the software house French, an Act of War is characterized by greater attention to detail and a much higher polygon count on screen). The musical accompaniment could only be characterized by very epic compositions that perform their duty to the fullest while the splendid interpretations of the characters (remained in English but subtitled in Italian) are to be commended. Even at high resolutions andwith all the graphic parameters active, the Atari stock remains at discrete levels but does not reach those peaks of excellence that we have seen in products of the same genre Fantasy aesthetics Finally, regarding longevity, Dragonshard is characterized by two single player campaigns both made up of seven main missions. They are certainly not many but they are characterized both by a duration and above all by a decidedly above average difficulty as well as having a large number of additional subquests. Inevitable multiplayer (both in Lan and online through Gamespy services). Liquid has paid attention to the point without any variations on the theme but proposing battles in which up to 8 players can participate. Finally, different maps were prepared according to the number of fighters. In a genre like that of real-time strategy, inflated by a disproportionate number of titles, Dragonshard manages to mix elements that are already known in the best possible way, but with a completely new alchemy that reaches peaks of absolute excellence in some situations. The real-time strategy thus meets the role-playing game and the ludic action will therefore take place at two ~depths~ in the most literal sense of the term: on the surface we will be able to deal with the classic real-time strategy dynamics (which remind near the latest productions of Timegate Studios) but in the dark Dungeons, the work of Liquid turns into a real hack'n'slash. The most interesting element is undoubtedly the symbiosis that will be created between the two game levels in an incessant change of perspective which initially could even leave you a little dazed but which then becomes a decidedly successful interactive play experience. Major weaknesses, Dragonshard has none. Some limits are encountered in the technical component (not at the top of its kind) and in the two campaigns for the single player that are not excessively long. However, these elements do not lower the qualitative status of a title that lovers of real-time strategy and role-playing games must absolutely take into consideration. Pros Excellent and original contamination between RTS and RPG Innovative gameplay It has all the charm of Dungeons & Dragons Cons Technical realization below other RTS Campaigns in single player not too long No variation on the theme for multiplayer D&D and real-time strategy That Dungeons & Dragons is one of the ~brands~ that has most directly inspired (Eye of the Beholder, Neverwinter Nights, the next MMORPG also from Atari, just to name a few) and even more indirectly (and here there would be titles galore ) the world of video games is an established fact. It is therefore truly atypical to have to note the absence of D&D from the RTS genre to date. Absence that Atari remedied, entrusting Liquid Entertainment (credentials: Battle Realms, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Ring) this Dragonshard that we are going to discover immediately.", "date": "2005-10-10", "grade": null}
