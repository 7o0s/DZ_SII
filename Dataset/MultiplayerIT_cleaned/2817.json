At some point in your gaming experience you may wonder if the one developed by Japan Studios is a complete product ~relegated~ to cadeau status or a demo that has been promoted, which has made a leap forward. The substance, however, changes little: pulled PS5 out of the box and turned on the console for the first time, the game will be there waiting for you, pre-installed and ready to be started with a click. Difficult if not impossible to resist, all PS5 owners will play it. And it's a good thing, not so much for the playful values which, as we will see, tell of a good but certainly not stratospheric product; rather because at the end of the 3 or 4 hours of play needed to try everything you can try, you will have an idea of the potential of the Dualsense, the new Sony controller. Inside a PC The friendly Astro is an old acquaintance of all PS VR owners: he made his debut in 2018 with Astro Bot Rescue Mission and, still today two years later, that remains one of the best VR experiences available on the PlayStation platform. The robot returns in this second appearance with a very different formula: a classic platform, without particular ambitions, divided into four areas of as many levels each, connected through a hub. Once the stages are completed, you will have to see a very fun (and perfect for the nostalgic) final surprise, complete the time trials and collect the many collectibles. The four worlds take us from sunny beaches to snow-capped mountains to futuristic cities, there is all the most classic repertoire of the genre to which Japan Studios adds a slightly more technological theming: Astro in fact moves inside a PC, therefore the idea is that you are crossing CPU, cooling system and so on. Let's say that the work on the setting does not leave you spellbound for its originality, even if we have to admit that we were impressed by the stratospheric number of quotations present within the game. Astro's friends (the astrini?) improvise skits dedicated to the best known titles, not only to the exclusive PlayStations, practically in every corner of each level, giving away a few memories, a few smiles and the constant desire to go and see what they are combining. Even the collectibles, all collected in a trophy room, are numerous and make us retrace more than twenty-five years of memories dedicated to the PlayStation world. Classic gameplay with an extra Dualsense Astro's Playroom brings back the basics of 3D platforming. Each world alternates some more airy sections with other guided ones, 2D moments with passages to be completed on unstable platforms. Nothing really new and the same goes for the controls: jump, double jump and then, thanks to the thrusters mounted under Astro's feet, suspended in the air for a few seconds, to which is added the punch and the loaded version of the same, which makes twirl our little hero for a few seconds. In five minutes of the game you will have complete control of the character. Astro's Playroom is designed to be played by anyone and if you are looking for a bit of a challenge you will necessarily have to turn to the time trials that are unlocked as you complete the levels. The interesting part is obviously the one related to Dualsense. We talked at length about the new PS5 controller and here you can find our review, the most important innovations are those related to haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, functions that are exploited to the fullest in Astro's Playroom. As you walk and jump around levels, for example, the vibration will constantly change to give you an accurate idea of what material you're stepping on. On some occasions Astro can use special suits that transform him, for example into a spring to be controlled through the triggers: the more you press them and the more resistance you encounter, it seems like a detail but the effect at first is amazing. In other passages you'll use the gyroscope to make Astro fly and spin, or the touch pad to slide him when he transforms into a pinball machine. They are not very original ideas, but they give an excellent smattering of the potential of the Sony pad. And the power of PS5? As with any launch game for a new generation of consoles, you'll be looking for a taste of the visual experience that PS5 has to offer in Astro's Playroom. There really isn't a lot of jaw-dropping here, you have to be honest. Lightning-fast loading and some nice effects, yes, but otherwise there's nothing that couldn't be done on PS4 too. Disappointed? In reality it would have been difficult to expect anything different, even if it is a bit surprising that Sony has created a showcase of theits controller and not one of the graphics capabilities of the console. What remains of Astro's Playroom once the experience is completed? Not so much, a few fun hours but certainly not unforgettable. On the other hand, the free game cannot be ignored and when you invite a friend (one of those who was unable to pre-order PS5) you can use it to let him taste the experience offered by the new controller. All in all, it can go well like this, even if the regret remains because a fun and successful character like Astro, who comes from a small VR masterpiece, would have deserved to play his chance to become a recognizable mascot with a slightly more articulated title . We'll see if Sackboy, protagonist of A Big Adventure, will have a different fate...", "date": "2020-11-06", "grade": "7.0"}
