Knowing the author of that game, or Kotaro Uchikoshi, is then an even rarer eventuality, but not because of the quality of the title in question but because of its very particular nature: Uchikoshi's works are fusions between classic graphic adventures and Visual Japanese novels, with very strong roots in science fiction and in the works of authors such as Vonnegut and Asimov; from a purely narrative point of view we are talking about frighteningly complex works, whose notoriety within a small niche is half a miracle (and does not correspond to an equal commercial success). Yet someone 999 bought it, leading the developers of Spike Chunsoft to produce two sequels despite the fact that the series had not taken root on Japanese soil. The result? A cornucopia of preposterous twists, puzzles, complex characters and tangled events known as the Zero Escape Series, made up of three games spread across different platforms (DS, 3DS, PlayStation Vita and PC), which a select few have had the opportunity to enjoy over the years in full. Perhaps due to its historical importance - Uchikoshi is believed to be the initiator of series such as the Danganronpa, and the influence is noticeable - or perhaps due to the simple desire to revive a saga that deserves more notoriety than the one it has achieved, now comes against all expectations in the homes of PC, PlayStation 4 and Playstation Vita owners a remastered collection of the first two titles of the trilogy, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, called The Nonary Games. Of course we have tried it. Two notable and little-known Japanese titles return with The Nonary Games: here is our review! Mathematics is a matter of life and death Opinions on the quality of the three games in the Zero Series differ greatly from person to person. The first is almost unanimously considered the one with the best storyline, but the refinements to the gameplay of the following chapters have been appreciated by many, not to mention that the many connections resolved in the last title, Zero Time Dilemma, make it difficult to understand all the elements of Virtue's Last Reward due to its extreme complexity. 999, simpler and self-contained, is therefore the one most usable by the general public, and this re-edition only improves its already remarkable characteristics. Let's go into a little more detail: in 999 you play the young Junpei, who wakes up trapped in the cabin of a ship with a strange numbered watch on his wrist and soon discovers that he has been involved in a sort of sadistic game together with nine other people, called Nonary Game. The identity of the other individuals is not known, apart from a childhood friend of the protagonist, nor is it known why they are on the ship; on the other hand, the ultimate goal is to escape by trying to gather as much information as possible and to understand what gave rise to that strange situation. Many of you, at this point, will inevitably think of Saw, but in 999 there are very few horror influences and the plot delves into science fiction themes which then explode in the following chapters. We are faced with a terrifyingly branched game, which in its original form had to be completed several times to reach the various endings and obtain all the pieces of the puzzle, with all due respect to those who cannot bear repetition. In this new version, however, 999 is practically reborn thanks to the inclusion of elements that were part of its sequel, Virtue's Last Reward: the interface has changed to better match the new platforms after the abandonment of the dual screen of Nintendo DS, not to mention that a very comfortable narrative scheme has been inserted that allows you to play the chapters individually in order to enter the various crossroads of the story. Add in a noticeable acceleration of the texts (complete with the ability to make them scroll quickly) and you get a much more enjoyable experience than its basic form. Read better It must be said that the scheme in 999 works significantly worse than the one present in Virtue, since structurally the first game was not designed to support it, but its addition is still very important and goes alongside notable technical improvements, including a redesign of almost all the still screens of the game, of the characters (they are drawn and animated in a rather basic way), and the inclusion of the complete English and Japanese voice acting that was only missing from this chapter. So many nice touches, which clash when you notice the unchanged three-dimensional models of certain objects from the Nintendo DS era, but certainly cannotto be criticized as a whole. Understandably, Virtue's Last Reward has undergone less significant changes as it is a game with 3D graphics, and its limitations appear evident ... yet the Spikes have still done a passable job, capable of not distracting the player too much from the quality notable of the plot and not to distort the functional gameplay (always divided between ~escape~ phases full of puzzles and purely narrative moments with multiple choices). Having said that, offering these two games without the third chapter, Dilemma, doesn't seem like a very sensible choice for the relaunch of the brand: as already specified, from the second chapter onwards, the narrative of the series takes unexpected and very complicated paths, which would certainly create less friction if instantly reconnectable to Uchikoshi's third child. Offering only the first two pieces has the flavor of a ~half gift~, despite the fact that these are titles that are very worthy of being played by all lovers of good stories and adventures. On the other hand, it is difficult to be particularly critical of the other elements: the price is not very low, but we are talking about video games capable of offering many hours of entertainment thanks to their complexity, and the only annoying technical flaw that we have found concerns the precision of the cursor in the selection of objects, obviously far from that of the stylus. Apart from these easily ignorable problems, we are talking about an excellent collection, which has been able to amaze us with its overall quality.", "date": "2017-03-27", "grade": "8.5"}
