{"name": "Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-alert-2-yuris-revenge.html", "text": "Yuri the traitor. The story of Yuri's Revenge starts exactly where that of RA2 ended: after the allied army has managed to defeat the Soviets and conquer Moscow, Yuri (first adviser, and then traitor, of the Russian army) returns to the scene trying to take advantage of the situation. What unites the 7 new allied missions, and the 7 new Soviet ones, is the fact of having to fight against this third new enemy, and no longer against each other: it will be possible to take control of Yuri's faction only in the mode Skirmish. The programmers' choice was to create an army made up of rather powerful units and structures, inspired by Yuri's two main characteristics: mind control and genetic mutation. If we wanted to make a quick list, we could not fail to mention among all these the Brutes, enormous beings endowed with physical strength beyond human limits, capable of destroying any building in just a few blows: it is very fun to use the Genetic Mutator (available once a particular building) against the enemy infantry, transforming it into a small army of Brutes at our orders. Yuri the traitor. Alongside these, the Yuri Prime, able to take mental control of enemy units and buildings: an absolutely devastating weapon, capable of resolving any situation in seconds. It also has a secondary attack, a wave of pure mental energy that instantly kills any nearby infantry unit; fortunately for the opponents, he is however very weak in build, and a few placed shots are enough to take him out of the way. Equally powerful (perhaps too much) are the naval units, the Boomer Submarines, and the air unit, the Floating Discs. The former are invisible to enemy eyes and capable not only of rapidly destroying any naval vessel, but also any land building in a short time: equipped with two ballistic missiles, they are able to hit land targets even very far from the coast, constituting in fact the most powerful naval unit of the game. As for the Floating Discs, these are real extraterrestrial discs subjected to Yuri's mind control, with enormous destructive power and a non-negligible secondary ability: they manage to steal the electricity from enemy bases. From the great destructive potential if accompanied by a fast ground support, they end up being quickly destroyed by the enemy if left in confrontation with the enemy anti-aircraft. Leaving aside the remaining units, which are also original even if less relevant, we also mention the second special ~ability~ of Yuri's army (which joins the Genetic Mutator we have already talked about): the Psychic Mutator. Able to take control of enemy units for a certain period of time, it is in fact the most powerful special weapon among those available, capable of changing the outcome of the battle in a short time. The last mention goes to the most politically incorrect structure of the entire game: the Grinder, inside which the captured units are literally ~recycled~, recovering energy and money. When you see, in one mission of the game, the civilian population go to their deaths and hear their screams, well, then you will understand how badly Yuri was made... Reinforcements. How to think you can face such a powerful army without some new units? Impossible. Among the American ones (four plus a new building), the most important are undoubtedly the Robot Tanks, robots that Yuri is unable to take control of, and the Battle Fortresses, gigantic Tanks in which it is possible to cram the infantry to increase their firepower. As for the former, their tactical importance is fundamental: even if rather frail and not very powerful, they are in fact the only alternative to Yuri's power, as they are able to resist any mental attack. Despite their modest offensive weight, they are the only fast unit (and also capable of traveling on water surfaces) with which to carry out an important land offensive without ending up with an army controlled by the enemy... Le Battle Fortresses, on the other hand, are of even greater importance, as they are capable of literally crushing enemy tanks and the walls built by the adversaries: imagine being able to destroy in a single moment, and with a single passage, all the tanks that the most inexperienced enemy will send to meet, and you will have an idea of their destructive scope. Implacable, once crammed inside them qsome infantry units, even against land units given the enormous range of fire that this combination can produce. Reinforcements. As far as the Soviet army is concerned, the most important novelty is Boris, a special unit equipped with great firepower, capable, among other things, of directing an aerial bombardment on the targets designated by him. The Siege Chopper is also of considerable importance, a successful mix between a land vehicle of considerable offensive range, and a rapid, fast and effective air unit against enemy infantry: on balance, finally, even the Russian army has a vehicle with which carry out an aerial counteroffensive, filling one of the few gaps of the original game. Ultimately, considering the originality and functionality of the new units introduced, we can certainly speak of a perfect result on the part of the programmers: the only doubt remains on the objective difficulty that the allies and the Russians encounter during clashes with the army than Yuri, less gifted in terms of numbers, but considerably more powerful as a whole. Being able to counter Yuri's tactics, made up of small raids and an excellent defense aimed at stalling while waiting to be able to hurl the Genetic Mutator and the Psychic Dominator, is revealed, and not only in the campaign missions, but above all in the Skirmish, really difficult despite the new features introduced. A quick overview, and then... Alongside some rather important innovations, Yuri's Revenge re-proposes the spirit that made the entire Command & Conquer series, of which Red Alert2 is only the latest exponent, one of the most loved and long-lived videogame sagas ever made. The game so furiously fast, capable of being mastered after a few hours (but which gives its best only after numerous game sessions, when one begins to understand the numerous tactical facets) by any strategy enthusiast, finds its yet another apotheosis. A quick overview, and then... To confirm this, to reiterate the concept that only what comes from Westwood is truly ~C&C Inside~, we find in this Add-on some features that make Yuri's Revenge a Must Buy: the movies, lasting more than a now, they pick up the story right where the enthusiast left off late last year; the multiplayer game, a true consecration of the series, has been improved with the introduction of the cooperative game mode and the Team Play mode; the Rush attack (ie the attack that most online players carry out in the first minutes of the game) has been further, and voluntarily, disadvantaged thanks to the introduction of stronger defensive elements; the introduction of more powerful units for the allied army compared to the Russian one finally balances the advantage acquired by the latter in the original title; the difficulty of the game, even the one against the computer in Skirmish matches, has been leveled upwards, offering the player a further level of challenge (as it has always been in the expansions produced by Westwood); last but not least, the missions of the single game represent almost the best of what we have seen lately, surpassing even those of the original game in difficulty, originality and beauty. In a nutshell Yuri's Revenge could be named ~reference expansion~, as it improves the original title so much, making it advisable even for those who had chosen to discard it a priori. Everything fans of a saga can ask for is present in this Add-on: after the half-disappointments of the Elite Force and Rune expansions, we really had to wait for Westwood to savor the pleasure of picking up a title again already finished. 17 ...finally the conclusions I have to say it without shame: after totally ignoring Tiberian Sun, I enthusiastically approached the Westwoodian universe with Red Alert2, partially recovering the feeling with this type of game. Over the years, in fact, I have directed my attention more and more often towards less frenetic titles (even within the same genre: Age of Kings is a striking example) compared to what is proposed by the C&C universe, but the need having to reinstall RA2, and this expansion for its review, has rekindled long-dormant instincts in me. In a short time I found myself reliving the same sensations of a long time ago, when the grainy GDIs of the first Command And Conquer had been able to make me lose more than one night of sleep. The typical setting of the series, frenetic on the surface and tactical in depth, was able to regain my attention in a short time and renew a passion that has never really faded. Merit, it must be said, of this Yuri's Revenge, which corrects, as we have been able to see, the few defects of the original title. If, unlike me, you have never moved away from Command & Conquer, perhaps even passing by the controversial Tiberian Sun, with Yuri's Revenge you will find yourself at home again, wishing to stay there for a long, long time. Once again, Westood has really achieved its goal, and the thousands of enthusiasts around the world can only rejoice: it's really time to get back on the battlefield. Finally, a small tribute to the main characters of the game through some images taken from the movies in the expansion. Command And Conquer. That Westwood knew how to follow and satisfy fans of the C&C saga was well known. Since the days of ~Covert Operations~, the add-on created for the first chapter, the talented American programmers have created an expansion capable of giving fans additional hours of high-level gameplay. Passing from a rather defined common thread (the introduction of unpublished units, the continuation of the story through new films made for the occasion, the raising of the level of difficulty and in general the playability of the title), over the years the players have been able to enjoy some very successful add-ons: The Aftermath (who doesn't remember the battle with the giant ants?) and Counterstrike for Red Alert, and more recently Firestorm for Tiberian Sun. Yuri's Revenge, the expansion of Red Alert 2 which we analyze here, it even manages to exceed expectations, presenting us with a product comparable to what The Conquerors was for Age of Kings: a Must Buy, an indispensable completion for an already almost perfect title. Even the most skeptics, even those who snubbed RA2 considering it a remake of the first title, consider themselves morally obliged to take a step back: let's try together to understand why.", "date": "2001-11-01", "grade": null}
