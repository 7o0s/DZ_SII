{"name": "Powerboat Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/powerboat-challenge.html", "text": "Boat racing has always fascinated video game developers, both for the high speed that can be reached aboard the most powerful motorboats, and for the inertial control that must necessarily be implemented in order to really have the sensation of moving on water. On consoles we have seen numerous titles of the genre, even of excellent quality, which differed in the type of vehicle used but also in the purely course or combat-focused setting. Since mobile phones had already taken a few steps in the direction of polygonal graphics, it was only a matter of time for someone to make an ~aquatic~ racing game in the mobile sector too. In this case, the Fishlabs team has taken care of it, with Powerboat Challenge: it is a ~motorboat racer~ in which we will have to face three opponents in different types of races. The game has only one mode: first we will have to select a character among the four available (each characterized by different values in terms of speed, acceleration, agility and turbo), then we will access the first of four territories dotted with events in which participate. Competitions can be normal, elimination or time attack; we will always start from the last place on the grid and we will have to make up ground against our opponents, paying attention to the position of the buoys. The latter are a very important element in Powerboat Racing: we will have to coast along them in the direction indicated on the screen, or we risk disqualification. On the other hand, exceeding them fills the turbo bar, which rises more if the buoy is close. Once filled, this bar allows us (by pressing the 5 key) to enjoy searing acceleration, which can help us build an advantage over the others or catch up. In the event that you get stuck against a coast or an obstacle, you can press a key to have the boat repositioned in the correct way, with an obvious cost in terms of time. Finally, the game uses a third-person view by default, but you can switch to a second first-person view at any time. Playing this way is a little more immersive, but sadly you can't really see the limits of the channel you're racing in. The developers have opted for a simple and straightforward control system, with automatic acceleration: we'll only have to worry about directing the boat and applying the brake when necessary. Unfortunately, the response to the commands is neither immediate nor accurate, and to this we must add the speed of the action, which is rather low at the beginning. Things improve thanks to the good vehicle upgrade system: by earning money through victories, you can visit shops that sell spare parts capable of significantly modifying the boat's performance. The graphics are completely polygonal, apart from some contour elements, and show off really interesting effects such as reflections, water ripples, etc. It is possible to deactivate them to make the game run faster on less powerful terminals, however. The textures that cover the scenery are very simple, but adequate for the purpose. There is a good use of colors and the fluidity is sufficient, unfortunately the speed is lacking. The sound, for once, is of a good standard, with some catchy music accompanied by some spot-on effects. We have already spoken of the control system: simple and immediate, a pity that the boat does not respond to commands immediately. PRO A large number of different events Technically excellent Well done upgrade system AGAINST Slow action High hardware demands", "date": "2008-04-15", "grade": "S.V."}
