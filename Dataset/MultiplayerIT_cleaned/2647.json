In Lumen's review we are dealing with a game that takes this kind of classic videogame puzzle and transforms it into its main gameplay object, with interesting results also thanks to the particular characterization chosen. From the mysteries of archeology to popular culture, through Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark to Myst, RiME and a wide range of examples in adventure video games including the recent The Last Campfire, the idea that a bundle of light channeled according to a certain path can reveal secrets and open mysterious doors is a bit of a recurring element, deriving from the indisputable fascination of the properties of the sun's rays and the effects of refraction. In the case of Lumen, the concept is placed in a very particular context, between abstruse mechanisms reminiscent of Rube Goldberg's machines and a strange story hidden among the many levels to discover. Although it is essentially a long sequence of puzzles, Lumen also has narrative ambitions and wants to tell the story of Mrs. Olivia McLumen, Scottish inventor of the early 1900s, passionate about science and pioneer of robotics applied to everyday objects. The bizarre and genius of the character in question is reflected in the whole style of the game, which mixes strange ancient mechanisms with aesthetic touches in the Art Deco style, period music and a certain underlying cheerfulness. Miss Lumen's dreams and projects may seem strange and naive, but her personality as a romantic dreamer combined with the passion and acumen that she pours into her constructions make her a truly charismatic character, able to give a strong identity even to a simple puzzle games. In fact, the story sees us committed to rediscovering Olivia's inventions hidden in microfilm inside a strange mechanical box found in an old attic, to be restored by directing beams of light in various ways. In this way, the progression between the puzzles is transformed into a real narrative, accompanied by the voice of the inventor who recalls her exploits and, occasionally, by short films of her life and her discoveries. At first glance, Lumen may recall the excellent The Room series, in terms of setting the puzzles and characterization, but the structure of this game is different, being entirely focused on a more homogeneous and less variable basic concept than the Fireproof Games series. Instead of discovering from time to time the types of interaction and the hidden mechanisms to activate, Lumen immediately makes clear what are the elements at stake and the rules to which they respond, rather asking us to interact with these objects in order to reach the solution of the enigma. It is a deductive rather than inductive reasoning, all based on the behavior of the light that passes through mirrors, filters and various mechanisms whose influences and possible applicable modifications are immediately understood. However, what needs to be done is no less demanding: once the variables in play have been established, it is a question of moving on a narrower path but which can also prove to be very complicated for this reason, which requires a certain application. Each puzzle is played on a sort of chessboard where there are various movable objects such as mirrors, filters, shutters and mechanisms capable of interacting with light, which can be rotated and oriented in different directions. The aim is to direct the light beam until it reaches the frame to be illuminated to compose the film on the history of Lumen, also trying to hit the three stars arranged on the table in the path of the beam, in order to obtain the maximum score. From a certain point of view, Lumen is inevitably more monotonous than The Room, given that it re-proposes this mechanic for all its numerous levels proposing far fewer variables at play, but still manages to stimulate both thanks to a particularly sweet and inviting progression, and thanks to its staging, endowed with a notably refined taste both in terms of graphics and audio accompaniment, all set on a sort of mechanical and Goldberian Art Deco, so to speak.", "date": "2021-02-09", "grade": "7.3"}
