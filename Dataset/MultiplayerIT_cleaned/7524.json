Usually the sagas of video games can be started at will from any point, especially when the individual chapters are sold separately. In the case of Deponia this does not apply. Starting from the end is not recommended because you risk understanding little or nothing, distracted above all by the noisy acrobatics of Rufus on stage. Therefore, it is better to start from the first chapter and follow the rise of this hero who, if from the beginning he seems only a teenager with demented ideas, already in the second episode allows us to glimpse the signs of an evolution that will reach its turning point at the end of Goodbye Deponia . Players who started following Deponia from the first episode therefore have a worthy conclusion to their adventure, but it is more of a season finale, so expect the announcement of a new adventure set in Deponia soon. The idea of returning to the junkyard city should in any case make Rufus fans happy, and we must admit that after this third episode we like it too who have never been seduced by his humor - which is Deponia's humor, since it infects every pixel in the game. The best memory we have of Goodbye Deponia and which gives us hope for a sequel concerns the crowd of secondary characters, all characterized very well in appearance and spirit. Each of them also plays a role, small or large, in Rufus' desperate mission, so no one passes by by chance. We are talking about dozens and dozens of subjects, a real population of an imaginary world, with the return, among many new actors, of old acquaintances from the previous chapters. Therefore, although Rufus is a hero overflowing with words, often spoken nonsense, who tends to want the scene all to himself, Goodbye Deponia remains an ensemble adventure. If the show has succeeded so well it is therefore due to the parade of personalities who alternate on the screen in harmony with each other. Therefore, while we wait for them to come forward holding hands to gather the applause of the audience, let's take the time to talk about the engine of all point and click graphic adventures, the puzzles. Goodbye Deponia is a tough-to-finish adventure that plays on excesses without trying to please everyone There is a baby with a beard in the inventory In the past we have criticized Deponia for the excesses of fantasy needed to solve the puzzles, which bordered on the absurd. From an adventure that makes excess its humorous figure it is clear that we cannot expect sober and plausible puzzles, but we must admit that Goodbye Deponia manages to disseminate the puzzle game in line with its style without exasperating us. After a crackling first part full of animated sequences, where the puzzles are solved almost without pause, the long and complex central section of the story opens. Here Rufus goes in threes. This is the most intriguing moment of the third episode and of the entire series, because it offers a level of depth that the developers have been good at exploiting to concoct fiendish puzzles. It also gives us the impression that the adventure is always moving even though we are actually waiting to find the solution to the next puzzle. However, three active and separate characters involve progress to be earned with the sweat of the mind. After a step forward, another wait immediately awaits us before a new illumination, but the satisfaction of having penetrated the logic of the game is great. Furthermore, it is often enough to read between the lines of dialogue and Rufus' bizarre comments to find a clue that puts us back on the right track. If you pay attention to the details, and don't let go of the adventure for many days in a row, the coherence behind its apparent madness penetrates us and guides us painlessly from one puzzle to the next. As long as you keep in mind that in Deponia a burrito wrapper can become a warm blanket for a child (come on, we revealed this to you). It is also a good idea to immediately press the space bar when entering a new screen to highlight points of interest. Even so, something escapes. In fact, the only time we got stuck wasn't because of the difficulty of a specific puzzle but because with so many screens and sensitive points available it's easy to forget about an object that we've never shown a certain character. From the past of the series, the mini-games also return, which perhaps represent the greatest challenge of the game, but which can be skipped with a simple click if we are not in the mood to puzzle over the classic canons of the genre. Then after so much effort begins the third part of the adventure and the rhythmaccelerate again to the daring conclusion. At that point we are real experts in demented gimmicks and lateral thinking. Nothing stops us anymore, not even a bearded baby in the inventory. And the same goes for Rufus. They're just kidding Deponia has always stood out for an obsessive search for the joke at any cost. In Goodbye Deponia the writers were good at joking about it and making this hunger for laughter the very reason to laugh. Maybe you'll love Deponia's style or maybe not; we, for our part, as we have mentioned, turned up our noses during the previous chapters, but this time we had a few laughs and in any case we enjoyed the journey. There are so many gags and quotes in a single screen that they compete with the tables of Zero Calcare. The developers know that they share a large amount of knowledge with the average player and have exploited this complicity to their advantage, putting it above all at the service of the puzzles, which become an integral part of the narrative, almost mini-stories within the main plot. And perhaps this is the aspect that struck us most about Goodbye Deponia. Everything else is joked about; there is even room for the caricature of a pedophile and racism. Intelligent people will be able to read in the right way even these jabs at exasperated correctness - the one that borders on the ridiculous, so to speak - of which we find continuous examples in the texts that the media churn out in a continuous stream. Despite the efforts made, however, Rufus continues to be often heavy, and the amount of dialogue wins the best intentions, prompting us to press the left mouse button quickly so as not to put up with other chatter concerning anything but what interests us at that moment. Do you think that there are so many dialogues and puzzles in Goodbye Deponia that we forget the classic structure behind it. For once the gears of the game remain hidden under the stage effects, which lose their luster only in the animations. Otherwise Goodbye Deponia is a pleasure to see, as the photos show. The problem of adaptation remains, on which the game also jokes (is there anything it doesn't joke about?). Indeed, Deponia was written in German. So in the transition from German to English part of the original humor has been lost. But maybe that's okay: after ten hours of play we are so stunned by the many events and ramshackle jokes that we do not miss other gags.", "date": "2013-11-01", "grade": "8.2"}
