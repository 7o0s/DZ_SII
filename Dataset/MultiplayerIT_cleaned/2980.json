Cuphead, that's right, Cuphead again. Can't you take it anymore? Don't lie, come on. Chad and Jared Moldenhauer of StudioMDHR probably discovered the goose that lays the golden eggs, when they released their title on PC in the now distant autumn of 2017. A production that immediately showed itself for what it was: delightful to see, hilarious to play, infamous like few other things in life, on the difficult side. Then again Cuphead: it was April 2019, when we offered you the review of Cuphead on Nintendo Switch. But that still wasn't enough, and so Cuphead again for the third time: let's go back to talking about it and proposing a second conversion, which arrived like a bolt from the blue (it's not a way of saying, it was really an unexpected bolt in the clear sky of monotony summer) even on PlayStation 4. This is the fate of numerous exclusives, in the last five years: from console to PC, from PC to console, from console to console. For the benefit of what really matters: gamers. The conversion to PlayStation 4 This paragraph of the review, in which we will deal with the conversion of Cuphead on PlayStation 4, will be extremely short, precise, concise. Indeed, we summarize it with a single sentence, light as a haiku: the port of Cuphead on Sony consoles is excellent, whether it is a PlayStation 4 Standard, Slim or Pro. And this reconfirms for the second time a detail we already knew: the competence of StudioMDHR, that insistent search for quality at all costs, which has ensured that one's videogame does not arrive anywhere else except in practically perfect condition. After all, it took more than a year to see Cuphead on Nintendo Switch: but it ~ran~ in an excellent way. One more year for it to arrive on PlayStation 4: it ~runs excellent~ again. Here too the performances settle on 1080p and 60 fps, while (by choice) the animations of the characters remain at 24fps. Clearly never as in this case such numbers leave the time they find: in fact the only thing that is really necessary for Cuphead is the fact that it proceeds quickly, fluidly and without hesitation. In fact, we have not seen even the shadow of hiccups or interruptions, neither in the spectacular clashes against gigantic bosses nor in the more agitated phases in the run 'n' gun style. Even saves and loads only take an instant. The hatred that remains on you when you are defeated for the fourteenth time by that cursed clown at the Luna Park, on the other hand... that lasts much longer. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course: where did the DLC go? What better occasion than the Cuphead review on PlayStation 4 to go back to questioning ourselves about The Delicious Last Course DLC? Have the various portings taken time away from the actual development of the expansion? Or has the DLC been moved ~forward~ just so that, in the meantime, players have time to recover the basic adventure on any platform in their possession? Assuming that the conversions of the title have extended the development times of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, we should be there by now. The expansion will introduce new levels and bosses, but above all the playable character of Ms. Chalice, with new moves and completely new patterns. Originally expected in 2019, the DLC has been pushed back to 2020; and now it is only expected that it will be further postponed to 2021, in truth. After all, not even a new trailer has been shown so far, nor has information from the developers arrived. But all this also makes sense from a marketing perspective. If Cuphead has landed on PC, then on Nintendo Switch and finally on PlayStation 4, it means that the user base has tripled; therefore potentially there will be triple revenue for the purchase of the DLC. Conversely, if Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course had really been released in 2019, the developers would then have had to include it in the portings for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, thus limiting revenue. Playstation 4 trophies Cuphead comes to PlayStation 4 with quite a few Trophies, including the Platinum Trophy. But if you think that adding them to your collection is easy, you are unwary or simply crazy. Know, for example, that you will have to complete the entire adventure at the maximum game difficulty. And also that you'll need to get an A score against each boss. It will also depend on your skill with the specific genre of reference... and your patience. The gameplay: challenge the devil But let's go back to the real Cuphead, to the main adventure. This review was opened with someconsiderations on the Devil (joking of course, we have not yet become Satanists), and will be concluded with as many. We have already told you that Cuphead on PlayStation 4 is perfect, cared for as much as all the other versions. So let's now underline how another aspect of the production has also remained substantially unchanged: the brutal gameplay. Yes, because if Cuphead is instantly recognizable, it owes it up to a certain point to its artistic direction, its instantly recognizable characters, places and enemies. StudioMDHR's title is difficult, bloody difficult, especially when compared to any other vaguely similar production that has landed on the market in recent years. It is precisely this gameplay that embellishes it, which requires attention, demands efforts from the player, requires memorizing the behavior of the enemies. And then rewards him, of course. Every win in Cuphead is worth ten wins in any other video game. Because they are sweaty, you deserve. And when you get to directly challenge the Devil (if, you get there)... but we won't be the ones to deprive you of the joy of discovery.", "date": "2020-08-02", "grade": "9.2"}
