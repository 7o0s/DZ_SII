All the others will find in ~Grand Prix 4~ a title of the highest quality. Of course, you will still need to be a minimum of driving enthusiasts. Spectacular and fluid graphics even on systems that are no longer of the latest generation, immediate playability from the first game sessions but still profound with a slow and progressive learning curve that promises to keep you busy for several months. Telemetry, multi-faceted set-up of the car, routes reproduced with great care (for example, the use of satellite surveys has been envisaged) with lots of variable atmospheric conditions recreated with a realism that is still unrivaled today: driving in the middle of a storm in the clouds of water raised by the tires of the opposing cars and launching at full speed on an asphalt where the objects on the side of the track are reflected is an experience that is not easily forgotten. In short, many other productions will be superior from a purely simulation point of view, however those who are willing to give up the most absolute realism by virtue of a simpler and more trivial entertainment will certainly not be disappointed. Thanks to the particular help system, both the first-time beginner and the more experienced and experienced player will always and in any case be able to take advantage of the gaming experiences resulting from this game. Even the problem of the official FIA license, which limits the simulation of the 2000/2001 station only, can be easily circumvented thanks to the great expandability of the title and the dozens of OnLine resources thanks to which it will be possible to customize, update and improve almost all the components of this game: drivers and tracks included. In short, the real lack must still be indicated in the absence of Multiplayer via the Internet and via Lan. In fact, the possibility is given to compete only in ~Hot Seat~ mode, i.e. the one in which all the different participants will alternate at the computer while the CPU will drive the cars of the others. No longer the undisputed masterpiece in the genre but still a first-rate title full of satisfaction, especially for all beginners. Sid Meier's Civilization III In 1992, one of the most successful video games in the history of the PC platform was released. Sid Meier, already the author of other masterpieces such as Pirates and ~F15 - Strike Eagle~ gave us what defining a video game is perhaps - even today - an understatement. Civilization was one of those titles that managed to go beyond the simple world of interactive entertainment. Civilization practically created a new genre of video games and represented a real experience. It began with a group of settlers at the dawn of the origins of mankind and, starting from a primitive and small village, a nation had to be created first and a real civilization then to arrive, thousands of years after our first turn of the game , to organize and launch a first expedition in an unknown direction: Alpha Centauri. Thus described in a few lines it might seem too simple and trivial but we assure you that the game variables and the situations introduced by the game mechanics gave life, every time, to a unique and above all unpredictable game. During the leadership of our empire we will in fact be faced with numerous choices: which technology to research, which commercial policy to implement, which . Do you dominate the world with diplomacy or with armies? Conquer world leadership thanks to our economic strength or by virtue of our scientific advances? Civilization 3 arrives after about ten years the appearance of the progenitor and, in the end, does not add anything particularly innovative to the old and indissoluble game concept, after all, why distort something almost perfect? Civ3 therefore represents, after the parenthesis of the second chapter, the return to the reins of a Sid Meier who, also thanks to the Alpha Centauri experience, has decided to direct all efforts towards the purely diplomatic and, more generally, tactical component. Finally, for example, now our empire and those of our adversaries will have well-defined borders, not respecting them or crossing them too lightly could prove lethal to our relations with our ~neighbours~. Sid Meier's Civilization III Sure, the graphics won't make us cry out for a miracle (indeed!) and the sound will end up boring us very soon, however what matters, that is the variety of the game and the artificial intelligence that guides the opposing civilizations, has been even more improvedor ensuring the small hours to all fans of strategy and not. Yes, because you don't necessarily have to be a fan of WarGames and the like to fall in love with this game, with the sense of power (sometimes even omnipotence) that arises from it, from the ever-increasing challenge that is given to us after each new round of the game, from the perverse mechanism ~one more shift and then I go to bed~ which is established from the beginning and will accompany us until the end of each campaign. The rules to know in the end are few and simple, all that is asked of the player is the desire to constantly test their deductive and logical skills. In short, a bit like playing chess. Those who are passionate about strategy titles and have never played any title in the series must absolutely buy it, even sight unseen. Those who have played (and appreciated) any of the previous chapters must absolutely buy it (also by virtue of the more than convenient Collector's Edition that is on the market), those who want to try to enter the fascinating world of strategy games yes, you guessed it: they must buy it. All the others can also save themselves the purchase. Just one note: those who want to get to know Civilization from a new and fascinating point of view will be forced to buy the ~Play The World~ expansion. In fact, with this Expansion Pack it will be possible to play Civ3 no longer against cold artificial intelligences but, finally, also against other human leaders perhaps sitting on an armchair on the other side of the world. Was it so expensive to foresee it already in the basic version? Unreal Tournament 2003 Unreal Tournament 2003 represents, pending the imminent 2004 version, the latest evolution of the First Person Shooter exclusively dedicated to OnLine gaming. In fact, if after ~Quake 3: Arena~ the programmers of the Id seem to have retraced their steps a little, Mark Rein, master father of the Unreal project in all its nuances and incarnations, wanted to press the accelerator umpteenth to place, even more , the accent on that concept of eSport so desired by the Fraggers of half the world. But what does this version of UT offer again compared to the original chapter? Not much to tell the truth, yet the justifications for switching to the ~Model Year 2003~  just to borrow a term so dear to the motorcycling world  seem to be, in the end, quite convincing. Above all also thanks to the release of an official and free Bonus Pack, freely downloadable also starting from this address. In the face of some game modes that have remained almost inexplicably lost along the way and in spite of someone else who has changed their name (and character), the most significant (and expected) innovation is represented by the ~Bombing Run~ in Italian). This mode, clearly inspired by American football, consists of two opposing teams who must carry the ~ball~ into the opposing ~goal~. The players of the two sides will - of course - be able to freely shoot at their opponents, with the only exception of the ball carriers who, in addition to being well highlighted, will not be able to use any weapons. It's really easy to imagine the different game situations and game tactics that can be implemented during the different matches. Seen with distrust by most of the more conservative players, the ~Bombing Run~ turns out to be much more than a simple diversion, becoming, for many, the most used mode among those available in the basic version (we must remind you of the almost endless availability of MODification around the Net?). Unreal Tournament 2003 The famous mutators could not be missing: the famous modifications that make it possible to change some aspects of the game mechanics, such as InstaGib - where a single shot will be enough to kill the opponents - or ~Low Gravity~ - which will modify the movements of the physics. Still on the gameplay front, it is certainly worth mentioning the introduction of adrenaline pills. Collecting a hundred during our raids we will then have to decide how to exploit them. We will be able to decide, among the various possibilities, to increase our speed, to make ourselves practically invisible or to increase our level of vital energy. However, it is from a strictly technical point of view that this UT2003 seems to want to lower all its aces. The graphics engine - also known by many as Unreal Warfare - although characterized by a slightly less advanced state of development than that used for the ancora more ~muscular~ Unreal 2, represents a real revolution compared to the still appreciable first Unreal Tournament. Also of first order is the physics engine implemented by Epic, the famous Karma Engine, which manages to give a real life to the arenas of this Unreal Tournament: seeing the corpse of one of our opponents collapse to the ground, for example, does not will never give the impression  or almost  of watching the same animation. I may seem like details or simple purely accessory changes, but when the basis is that of an appreciated and successful title like Unreal Tournament it is still difficult to blame the designers for not wanting to upset a ~winning team~. In short, if you like multiplayer-oriented FPS, the choice is almost obligatory. If, on the other hand, you don't like online multiplayer, know that UT2003 expects to be able to play all modes even alone on your computer, giving you the opportunity to compare yourself with different bots. But it would be like buying a Ferrari and then using it only to go shopping in the supermarket next door Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 4 The name Geoff Crammond and the name ~Grand Prix~ have marked for at least ten years, in the field of automotive simulations on PC, an indissoluble and nothing short of prestigious combination. If for the first two chapters of the series we can speak of real masterpieces, the third title of the series instead left a bad taste in the mouth of more than one enthusiast. The release of the latest ~Grand Prix 4~, therefore, was expected as the last appeal test for the wizard of English programming towards those who, by now, looked with confidence almost exclusively towards the automotive simulations produced by the giant of EA Sport. The verdict, after about a year, is still not completely clarified. Those who expected a real revolution after the misstep GP3 were somewhat perplexed, above all because of all the different improvements prepared for the game, one aspect in particular unexpectedly remained almost unchanged. On balance, over the years what represents the heart of each simulation, i.e. the driving model, in the Grand Prix series has not been subjected to those improvements and new technological solutions which instead have affected all the other ~surrounding~ elements . What in the mid-90s was considered an accurate and realistic driving model today, on balance, is no longer able to satisfy the most convinced simulomaniacs in search of the most absolute realism, leaving instead a certain bitter aftertaste in the mouth .", "date": "2003-10-08", "grade": null}
