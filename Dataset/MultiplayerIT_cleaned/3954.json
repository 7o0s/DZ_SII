Opening the ranks of the series was Dimmi chi sei!, free for many months on PlayStation Plus among other things, followed by paid productions such as Knowledge is Power, Hidden Agenda and SingStar Celebration. After a year, Sony has decided not only to increase the dose but also to enhance its variety: in these days several new PlayLink-branded games will debut on PlayStation 4, some of which have never been seen before, others ~updated variants~ of those already present. Scimpazziamo is a real novelty, and in our review we want to explain how it could brighten up your family evenings. Let's Chimp: Gameplay and Ideas Chimpazziamo is a real workhorse of the PlayLink line, exclusive to PlayStation 4: buying the game from PlayStation Store is not enough to start playing, but don't worry because you won't have to spend a cent to have additional peripherals. Indeed, if you own only one DualShock 4 you will be happy to know that you can still play up to four people at the same time: it will be enough for everyone present to download the application of the same name from the Google Play Store or the Apple Store. A few megs to download and everything is ready to start playing: smartphones are the controllers to use, but the home TV must always be kept an eye on because it is the reference point for the crazy monkey-based party game. Scimpazziamo is just that: a collection of carefree mini-games, most of the time intuitive and above all very fast, lasting a few minutes each. The undisputed protagonists are a series of funny and colorful crazy monkeys, for up to four players at the same time, only and exclusively locally: a few taps on your smartphone, just enough time to take a selfie to then use as a game avatar, and you are ready to begin. Even the initial menu is extremely intuitive, on balance the proposed game modes are just four and all more or less require you to do the same thing in different ways: participate in many mini-games. There is a single player mode that is a bit sad, because all the atmosphere and the idea behind the title are irretrievably lost; things go much better with the ~game of the goose~ style mode, where those present must face a series of challenges in an attempt to reach the end of the board first, thus winning the golden banana trophy. Each completed mini-game provides a certain number of points with which to advance on the playing field, naturally paying attention to penalties (~go back a certain number of boxes~) and bonuses (~advance a certain number of boxes~). The heart of Scimpazziamo consists of the minigames, everything else is a mere side dish to embellish the package. Every screen, every indication on the screen, even the nice customization of the monkeys takes a back seat: what matters is to enter the game as soon as possible, play and then start over with a different type of challenge. Scimpazziamo wants to make it clear right away, but apart from the initial procedure to configure the smartphone, perhaps it will soon start to run a little too much. The intuitiveness of the gaming experience is functional to the type of offer: everyone can really play at Scimpazziamo, from grandfather to seven-year-old boy, so much so that it is sufficient to press a single button on the smartphone to control the monkeys and thus help them in their bizarre assignments. In the first minutes, laughter is guaranteed, and also fun, but soon many defects begin to catch the eye. Playstation 4 trophies Chimpazziamo also offers players the possibility of unlocking a glittering Platinum Trophy: obtaining it will be particularly simple, especially with the list of all Trophies at hand. Just play, replay and continue having fun with the many mini-games offered, trying to meet some specific conditions (accurately explained by the description of the Trophies, precisely). Lots of content, but also some limits Scimpazziamo has many ideas to propose, and it is good for a title that counts on fierce competition and that wants to be immediately loved by everyone present. The proposed mini-games are 18 and 80 levels, but unfortunately the superficiality is around the corner in a whole series of aspects. We have already mentioned speed: almost always Chimpazziamo runs a little too much in its path, making it difficult for everyone presentfigure out what the heck you need to do to win a certain minigame. All right, just always press the same button, but the gameplay is not as obvious as it might initially seem, and when a party game resolves itself into ~pressing everything to do something~ it's never a good sign. Some levels require you to steal the pineapple from your opponents within a vertical scenario made up of a few platforms: with a tap on your smartphone, the monkey jumps, and you have to make it jump at the right moment to prevent the other participants from stealing your loot. Other challenges are based on basketball: a quick initial press on the phone serves to point the direction of flight, a long press to establish the extent of the jump. Getting to the basket safely without bumping into everyone else present is another matter: a real skill almost never comes into play. Luck, chance, and chaos are the factors you'll need on your side to win in Let's Chimp, and it all works out decently as long as the confusion doesn't get too much. On balance, the variety of mini-games offered also often leaves something to be desired: in a couple of cases the game offered us the exact same challenge twice in a row, just changed in the setting. Furthermore, some mini-games are decidedly more valid than others, such as the one in which you have to color as many surfaces as possible in a given period of time, in full Splatoon 2 style. Even here, however, everything is too random, frenetic and confusing to be truly satisfying , while in other cases the game controls are either incomprehensible, or explained in a superficial way, or simply useless: you press a little at random on your smartphone and it goes as it should. In short, a title like this is good for a couple of evenings with friends.", "date": "2018-11-13", "grade": "6.5"}
