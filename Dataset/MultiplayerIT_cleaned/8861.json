A little over six months ago he proved to everyone that he has the makings of a hero in a platformer that has reinvented him, if only on a visual level, offering one of the most original stylistic cues ever. Only last month, however, he made his last visit to the Nintendo DS toy library bringing with him a small horde of clones, because many puzzles alone he could not have solved. Between threads of wool and puzzles, we may have forgotten the original powers that made Kirby famous many years ago, when he limited himself to inhaling his enemies to absorb their abilities and thwart the plans of King Dedede, his sworn archenemy. So the developer HAL Laboratory thought about it to remind us of Kirby's true nature with a decidedly traditional platformer, inspired in a not too veiled way by the good old Kirby's Fun Pak of 1997 for Super NES: a real journey through time that leaves, however , even a little bitter in the mouth. Inhale, exhale, inhale... A spaceship crashes into the world of Dreamland, breaking into pieces as it shatters the atmosphere right in front of the amazed Kirby, King Dedede, Waddle Dee and Meta Knight. To help Magolor, the ship's pilot, to leave for his world, the improbable quartet begins a journey in search of the missing pieces: everything is told in a short sequence in computer graphics devoid of any dialogue, accompanied only by a nice jingle that almost anticipates the disarming simplicity that characterizes the entire game. As we said, with Kirby's Adventure Wii we return to our origins, to the platform divided into several stages connected by magical doors, full of enemies that Kirby can finally start aspiring again to shoot them as if they were projectiles or swallow them and absorb their peculiar powers, changing shape and gaining special abilities that add to the traditional repertoire of jumping and temporary floating. Those who have played some of Kirby's previous traditional adventures will immediately recognize some transformations such as those that allow him to fire lightning bolts or swing a sword, while others are brand new and in many cases it is important to absorb the right enemies to interact with the environment, breaking down the obstacles that, perhaps, separate us from the destination or even from a secret area. In addition, Kirby can now swallow more powerful enemies that allow him to use super-attacks for a limited period of time: these extremely spectacular special shots are real smart-bombs that knock down everything on the screen, helping to drastically lower the already low difficulty of the game. We'll come back to it in a moment, in the meantime we need to mention Kirby's Fun Pak again because, just like in that cartridge, also in this case a second player can hold another controller and immediately appear next to Kirby, to help him in his endeavor. In reality, up to a maximum of three players can participate in the game, playing the three enemies / friends of Kirby or some colored clones of our protagonist. Dedede, Meta Knight and Waddle Dee all have special abilities that allow you to overcome certain obstacles or interact with the scenario in different ways, allowing access to otherwise unreachable areas and helping to take down enemies and end-of-level bosses even faster. Eyes closed Just when playing in company you come across one of the negative aspects of the new super-attacks, because basically our companions will remain with their hands for the duration of the power-up, while Kirby grinds enemies on each screen: Kirby's Adventure Wii is a very simple game by itself, but many of these inconsistencies unfortunately tend to make the challenge almost non-existent. We can share our vital energy with our companions, for example, and there is no real ~game over~, at most we start a stage over. Many levels can be passed simply by floating from start to finish or easily avoiding enemies in the way, while the obligatory end-stage bosses have predictable attack patterns that can be dodged without much problem for those few seconds it takes to defeat the enemy . The main challenge, at that point, consists in finding all the secret objects scattered throughout the levels and unlocking the various mini-games accessible from Magolor's spaceship, a relatively demanding mission which, if nothing else, requires the player to have the right skills or to really explore each area far and wide: doing so is a piacere, because Dreamland is just as we remembered it, funny and colorful. In reality, Kirby's Adventure Wii is a technically unpretentious game and betrays its origins, a development started on Gamecube which here demonstrates the full weight of its years through an almost essential simplicity of polygonal modeling and textures. The result is practically incomparable to what was seen, for example, in Super Mario Galaxy 2, but it does its job adequately thanks at least to an always inspired artistic direction and to a variety of settings and color choices that make each new stage pleasant and fairytale-like. Probably the little ones won't care about texture or polygon count, but after playing pearls like Kirby and the Hero's Cloth one can only be a little disappointed by this return to such an ordinary Dreamland.", "date": "2011-12-14", "grade": "7.2"}
