{"name": "Potere al popolo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111143-when-vikings-attack-potere-al-popolo.html", "text": "It is quite significant that one of the most interesting games released recently on PlayStation Vita is not to be found in blockbusters such as Assassin's Creed: Liberation or Black Ops: Declassified, but in the studio of a small independent team based in England. Small yes, but not unprepared for this, considering that Martin Turton and Andrew Newton, the two founders of Clever Beans, bring with them years of experience in companies such as Psygnosis and Treyarch. The debut game of their independent label is When Vikings Attack, an intense mix of ideas that makes the multiplayer component its forte. The purpose? Throw objects and make as much mess as possible. Vikings or skittles? Overflowing with that typically British humor that pervades the entire adventure, the initial cinematic introduces the crazy premises of the game: the last of the surviving Viking peoples has decided to invade Britain in the 70s, but unfortunately the citizens of the place they don't seem to have any intention of giving up. Indeed, gathered in huge rioting groups, the civilians decide to defend their homeland by throwing everything at hand against the Viking invader. Literally, everything. Mainly due to cartoony and lively urban settings, a first glance may remind you of The Wonderful 101 that Platinum Games is preparing to launch on Wii U, but the mechanics are fundamentally different. Leading a handful of commoners, the player must make a clean sweep of the enemies by collecting objects in the scenario and throwing them at the opposing groups who, in turn, will be busy doing the same: the result is a mix between Pikmin and Powerstone, in which screen you can see flying crates, cars, cannonballs, penguins and so on and so forth. Through an intelligent mechanism that winks at Katamari, the more numerous your group of characters and the larger the objects that you can collect, so that your attacks are more devastating and can hit multiple opponents simultaneously. This ploy gives When Vikings Attack a strategic thickness that emerges only after a few levels, when you begin to become familiar with the few but fundamental skills at your disposal: by pressing a button you can make a shot useful to avoid incoming objects , to catch them while they are in mid-air or even to blow them from the hands of the enemy. This leads to different approaches, single player as well as online, with a player trying to gain numerical superiority and then throwing objects at the opponent that he is unable to pick up; or maybe we study for a few moments waiting for the other to make the first move, ready to neutralize his attack and send it back to the sender. Since you are defeated when the last character in the group is eliminated, the number of people you carry with you represents in a sense the energy available, although the size of your handpiece also affects the speed of movement. There is no shortage of special characters capable of enhancing the speed and strength of the group but more interesting is the possibility of using the back keys to rotate the collected objects. In this way it is possible, for example, to launch a light pole in a horizontal position, so as to hit a large number of opponents, or, by continuing to rotate insistently, a powerful attack can be launched which cannot be blocked in any way by the enemy group. There's so much to enjoy if you add special items to the mix, such as bouncing missiles or rockets capable of converting opposing units into your allies, but it is clear that the Clever Beans game gives its best in the three multiplayer mode, when you don't have to deal with predictable AI and can challenge each other in some of the best arenas of the main campaign. It should be noted that, while local multiplayer is also supported on PlayStation 3, on Vita the possibility of playing with multiple consoles in the same room should only arrive later, through an update on which the developers seem to be already at work. In fact, very successful scenarios add another challenge and make the experience less repetitive: at a road junction you can activate a traffic light in the hope that enemies will be run over by cars, while a sorting center sees players battle each other trying not to fall off a set of reels. Unfortunately the fact remains that, in the absence of interesting unlockable content or any kind of variation in gameplay, the main campaignrepresents the least successful offering, although the ability to tackle it with a friend adds some spice and lends a huge hand in the more difficult boss battles. The rest is a frantic and goofy action game that oozes humor and English style both in the comical game situations and in the delightful art style that gives a nod to Wallace & Gromit.", "date": "2012-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
