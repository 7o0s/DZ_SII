A sort of revolution in the classic console input method, as well as the focal point of the entire hardware offer of the Kyoto house. In reality, however, it has never managed to fully reveal its potential, squeezed between obvious technical limitations (the absence of multi touch above all) and the scarce support of third parties, certainly not stimulated in this sense by the modest sales of Wii U. But a slice of the ~blame~ must also be given to Nintendo itself, which has rarely indicated in a convinced and convincing way with its first party titles the way forward to fully exploit the potential of the peripheral. It is therefore rather astonishing to note how it is a semi-unknown Danish independent team, Knapnok, in collaboration with Nicklas Nygren (Knytt Underground, Nightsky) who today bring to Wii U one of the games capable of understanding and best conveying the opportunities offered by the GamePad. Affordable Space Adventures is one of the few Wii U games that actually takes advantage of the GamePad From the north with fury Knapnok, based in Copenhagen, is a studio made up of about ten people whose main focus is the development of titles that take advantage of the new interfaces, consequently giving life to games and prototypes for iOS, Kinect and Wii U which aim the search for innovative gameplay ideas. Affordable Space Adventures is, in fact, the second product for the Nintendo console, which comes almost two years after the nice but certainly not unforgettable party game Spin the Bottle. Also in this case, as is now customary and necessary for indie developers, the sales channel adopted is the digital-only one of the eShop, however at a price that is rather out of the standard: 18.99 is in fact an important figure, certainly not favorable to impulse buying, and which therefore requires qualitative contents of a certain level in order to be able to convince users. Fortunately for Knapnok, Affordable Space Adventures is undoubtedly one of the most interesting eShop titles of recent months, and more generally a Wii U exclusive truly built around the hardware features to the point of making a hypothetical version on other platforms, if not the all impossible, at least very complicated and probably less effective. The premise behind the Scandinavian production lies in the hypothesis that, in the near future, space exploration will in fact become a common and economic practice, within everyone's reach. This is thanks to a company, Uexplore, capable of putting on the market a low-cost, safe and perfectly suited spacecraft to satisfy the wishes of the new galactic Christopher Columbus. In reality, not everything is as simple and risk-free as Uexplore's 70s-style advertising would have you believe, and this is immediately clear from the very first moments of the game. First of all because the shuttle undoubtedly appears cheap, but not in the positive key of the term: moved by a crackling and not very fluid diesel engine, initially it only allows you to move with uncertainty in the dark meanders of the inhospitable planet. Secondly because it is not equipped with any type of weapon: a lack destined to be felt soon enough, with the appearance of the first hostile aliens. In most cases, however, more than the enemies themselves, it is the conformation of the settings that brings with it the biggest problems: Affordable Space Adventures is in fact mainly a physics-based environmental puzzle game, in which you have to try to find the correct way to overcome obstacles and puzzles relying only on the systems available to the shuttle. Teleportation, Mr. Scott! Yes, because, like an ugly duckling, your improbable means of transport gains new skills and fundamental tools as you progress through the levels. These are anti-gravity, propulsion, mass modification, heat management, landing, boost systems, as well as an entire electric propulsion alternative to the diesel one. Each of these is managed directly via the GamePad screen, which practically becomes the command console of the shuttle itself. We therefore find ourselves playing the role of a sort of miniature Captain Kirk, precisely managing the capabilities of your means of transport, trying to figure out what the correct combination of them is in order to continue. The puzzles start out simple and require very little effort: gain mass to be able to travel underwater or push motsgold at most to move a heavy block are only the tip of the iceberg, however. The addition of the various systems and the need to manage several of them quickly makes things soon more demanding, although always below the limits of frustration, and in this sense the developers must be credited for having perfectly calibrated the level of difficulty . One of the most often used solutions is then to be found in the need not to be identified by enemies, who evidently do not have eyes but only sound, heat and electricity detection instruments: an analysis of one's own scanner, managed with the right stick, in fact, it allows you to know precisely which limits are not to be exceeded, and consequently calibrating the equipment of your shuttle. If in words this does not seem very exciting, in reality the progression in Affordable Space Adventures is confirmed to be almost always very pleasant, with the constant incentive to continue linked to the gratifications that each obstacle overcome guarantees. Of course it must be admitted that the quality of the level design undergoes some downturn in some cases, and that more generally the spark of genius that is typical of absolute masterpieces is missing. Nevertheless, we can certainly be satisfied, we assure you. Analogous speech for the graphic component, effective and very atmospheric but without a characterization such as to remain impressed in depth. Finally, although the title of Knapnok is an experience that can undoubtedly be faced entirely in single player, the team has included a successful and convincing multiplayer mode in which up to 3 friends can share the management of the ship: one manages the scanner, one the on-board systems, and the third the movements.", "date": "2015-04-15", "grade": "8.5"}
