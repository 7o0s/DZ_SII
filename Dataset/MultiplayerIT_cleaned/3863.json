Given the amount of content offered by the French house in the main title, never before have parts of additional stories really to be considered for use and consumption only by the most ardent supporters of the series, given that we challenge anyone to be dissatisfied with the hours of gameplay put into play from the storyline and side quests. We put our hands forward mainly because we cannot expect a revolution in terms of thematics nor a radical change to the game structure from the Legacy of the First Blade, especially now that we are in the midst of this adventure. We approached the DLC after having spent almost fifty hours on the title and still having a significant amount of time at our disposal before platinum Assassin's Creed, therefore without any claim towards the product, but some interesting ideas to think about embarking on new missions we luckily found it. The story so far In Macedonia, the war between the Spartans and the Athenians favored the arrival of the Persians in the territory and with new enemies, obviously new adventure companions also appeared. Dario and his daughter (or son depending on the protagonist) were the cornerstone of the whole first part and now that things are getting more intense they are being put further under the magnifying glass. This time, however, the question moves to the coasts of Achaia, with the ultimate goal of discovering what was the fate of Nima. The new DLC therefore starts from Patras and will accompany you for the canonical three/five hours of play, depending on your speed in moving and completing the various missions offered. The northern region of the Peloponnese is filled with enemies already seen and fought in the past and only when you enter the heart of the story will you see something new in this sense. The variety of situations does not change enormously therefore, with the classic Spartan and Athenian deployments to be knocked down and the addition of the various Persian spies, perhaps too little overall for a package that requires an outlay of almost thirty euros, if bought outside the Season Pass. And yet, as we said, we liked the plot and the way of telling things in the Legacy of the First Blade much more than in the original game, above all since they tend to depart from the Greek imagination and mythology by returning to tracks more in keeping with the series, where the events were narrated in more serious tones. We also delve into the soul of Alexios/Kassandra and we discover unexpected and interesting implications for the future, with situations capable of closing (almost, because to say definitively we will have to wait for the third part) some of the many question marks left at the end of the campaign principal. However, remaining on the subject of fighting, this second chapter pushes the accelerator on the battles at sea and on the clashes aboard the Adrestia. In fact, the main antagonist will be a fearsome captain with a ship with extremely powerful weapons, which we will have to be able to sabotage in some way and perhaps even then use in our favor. Without going into too much detail to spoil the surprise, just know that navigation will play a central role and the time you will be confined between ports and the open sea will be significantly longer than that spent inland. Unfortunately this second chapter of the Legacy of the First Blade seems to be only an indispensable filler to slowly take us towards the final revelations of the third chapter, an objective achieved only thanks to the last moments of the game. The central part, narratively speaking, is rather weak and the characters involved are nothing but the umpteenth figures devoured by hatred and revenge, already seen dozens of times in the main storyline while we were dealing with exterminating the Sect and which today do not represent anything particularly touching. On the other hand, the entire final part of the story is very interesting, with a single ending unrelated to your choices, although Ubisoft has tried to create the impression of providing narrative crossroads with the dialogues. We would have expected a few more details, or further explanations, on the origin of Dario and his hidden blade (which we remind you to appear with this narrative arc for the first time in Odyssey) but apparently we will have to wait a few more weeks to have the Complete picture. The Legacy of the First Blade is a package that does not give away details nnew emotions to the player but puts the tone of the narrative back on the right track. There are interesting endings, new weapons for the Adrestia and even some twists that will manage to keep the interest high until the next chapter. We recommend its purchase, however, only to those who have really devoured and loved Odyssey to the core and to those who still don't have enough of traveling around Greece as Alexios and Kassandra looking for stimuli to reach level 70.", "date": "2019-01-14", "grade": null}
