The name of Vainglory immediately comes to mind, but as mentioned, the titles belonging to this trend are varied and for a few days there has been one more: Planet of Heroes. Made by Fast Forward Studio and produced by Mycom, the game is already available on the App Store and should arrive shortly on Google Play, in both cases strong on the traditional free-to-play model, with a handful of characters accessible for free and others to be purchased using real money or by scraping together virtual currency with a (lot) of patience. What is surprising is the formula developed by the authors, who wanted to simplify the typical mechanisms of MOBAs a little: instead of having two or three parallel lanes, the three-against-three real-time battles of Planet of Heroes take place in the perspective of a single path, although there is an ~undergrowth~ in the lower part of the map where it is possible to find opponents controlled by artificial intelligence and take useful shortcuts to enemy towers. The latter must be faced in a classic way, thus waiting for the arrival of the minions who can absorb their attacks, with the ultimate aim of reaching the third location and destroying it to obtain victory. The element of the grind has also been eliminated, the growth that each hero performs in view of a single match and which leads to the unlocking of different weapons and objects with which to face the battle. Planet of Heroes offers an instant and accessible take on MOBAs on mobile devices Six heroes united here The currently available Planet of Heroes characters are divided into various categories, although there is not a clear-cut classification as there is in the classic MOBAs. However, it is easy to identify the heroes who behave like tanks, powerful and resistant, ideal for close combat, as well as those who prefer attacks from a distance but are particularly affected by melee combat. More refined specializations would not have made much sense in the context of three-on-three clashes, and in fact during the games you feel quite free to choose the warriors you prefer, or that you want to grow, without worrying too much about the team balance. In fact, light-heartedness is the key element of the game, also thanks to a very quick and effective matchmaking, the presence of few problems related to lag and a good balance between the available moves, with a view to equipment that can still be upgraded using the objects obtained with victories and virtual money, the latter also essential for unlocking runes that activate certain perks. After a few multiplayer games, the Planet of Heroes experience is also enriched with some nice single player missions, which adopt an action RPG approach to make us face a series of enemies, managing a group consisting of three characters alone. An extra of value, which is paired with an excellent technical, fluid and truly valuable realization as regards the design of the heroes.", "date": "2017-03-17", "grade": "8.0"}
