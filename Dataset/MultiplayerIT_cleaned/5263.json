{"name": "Non  pi il 1999", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174625-toxikk-non-e-piu-il-1999.html", "text": "When Epic Games and id Software launched the first two first-person shooters designed only for online, Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena respectively, they founded them on an axiom that few at the time would have disputed: every player had to start with the same means and there were to be no mechanics that benefited them in any way. It was the summary of the experience made with the multiplayer modes of the various DOOM, Quake and Unreal. The flamethrower is difficult to use, but rewarding You can be a sniper, but don't expect to be able to stand still for whole minutes shooting at stationary targets The only discriminating factor in a game had to be the player's ~skill~, which for years was the beacon to which everyone referred. By skill, which we can effectively translate into skill, we meant a mix made up of mastery of the control system, knowledge of maps and weapons and the development of strategies aimed at dominating some key resources (weapons, armor and so on). In short, the games were designed not around the player, but around the search for a balance that brought out skills and experience. Over the years, skill-focused online shooters have gradually died precisely because of their greater virtue. In fact, new players were unable to easily access many games, because they were literally mowed down by those who had more experience than them. It is a natural and inevitable process, which however clashed with the needs of the market, that games must be able to sell them even to the poorest players, without frustrating them too much. So over the years the design of online shooters has been refined, going in the opposite direction to the initial one: the games had to become accessible to all and create skill ~holes~, let's call them that, i.e. moments in which even the player stronger can do nothing to avoid being killed. Not for nothing practices considered incorrect in the first online titles, such as camping, have become central in some modern games, while the speed of movement has been reduced, techniques such as that of double pressing the keys to dodge have been almost completely abolished , considered out of reach for many players, customization systems based on the growth of levels and equipment have been added, with related imbalances, and weapons and techniques have been added that allow everyone to score some points in the game (the notorious iron sight tell you something?). To say, we have arrived at the paradox of an Overwatch that integrates mechanics once considered cheats and in which most of the best actions in a game are linked to the use of super moves. We reviewed Toxikk, a beautiful arena shooter that probably came out of time It's not 1999 anymore Toxikk is the confirmation that the classic arena shooters are dead and buried in the collective imagination, i.e. that they can no longer count on large numbers, but must live marginalized in a market that no longer accepts them. After all, it is a great gift to the industry, which can enhance its undoubted quality, while pointing out its lack of success as an example not to follow if it wants to survive. If you reread the previous paragraph, when we were talking about classic online shooters we were also describing the title of Reakktor Studios, which we can consider a real act of love towards a sadly anachronistic gameplay. It is not for nothing that the game's slogan is ~Frag like it's 1999~, i.e. the release year of the aforementioned Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Arena. There is also a nice map set in Italy The problem with Toxikk is that it really has nothing wrong with it: it's fast, it offers maps with a perfect design and obvious sources of inspiration (like the whole game, after all): The Citadel is clearly modeled on Unreal's Facing World Tournament, despite the larger size, while DEKK is Deck 16; introduces gameplay elements like invisibility and apparent death (actually both already seen), but harmonises them with the rest flawlessly; there are the vehicles, which are clear throwbacks to Unreal Tournament 2004, and so on. Their developers have been flawless in presenting the game for what it wanted to be and what it has become: they launched it in Early Access at a very affordable price and continued to support it despite the crisis of players. At the time of launch, to attract the public and counter the competition from Epic's new Unreal Tournament, they released a free version that offers a lot of content and acts as a bridge to the definitive one, whose price has been lowered.As promised there are no DLCs and no free-to-play mechanics have been introduced. Of course, by accumulating experience you grow in level, but it only serves to prevent too strong players from comparing themselves with newbies. In short: will quality play added to very correct behavior towards the community be paid for stellar sales? Classic gameplay, modern gamers Unfortunately not and, indeed, here comes the only big problem of Toxikk, the one for which there are no patches that can remedy the situation: the lack of players. Some will tell you that the problem with the game is Epic's Unreal Tournament, which is completely free to play, but that's not exactly the case. That is, certainly the Epic title is played more, but even that certainly does not make dizzying numbers when compared with those of other online shooters. Some weapons are more difficult to use, but can be very rewarding There are also vehicles The genre simply doesn't appeal to new players. Toxikk is all about grabbing weapons and resources to start a frag dance with your enemies. It's elaboration of lightning-fast strategies, pursuit of perfection game after game. The weapons are designed with the classic progression in mind: the most used is the rocket launcher, then gradually there are the others, apparently weaker, but only to be known in order to be able to make the best use of them. There's also the sniper rifle, but standing still doesn't win: you still have to move, also because the movement system, which includes double jumps and dodges, doesn't make players helpless targets. Also from a technical point of view Reakktor Studios has done things really well. Toxikk does not reach the title of Epic, but setting the maximum level of detail is still a good thing to see. Some maps, like the one set in Italy, made up of castles and warm landscapes, are very beautiful. Of course, the refined look is that of the classic Epic, therefore made of edgy and somewhat naive science fiction with many fantasy touches, visible in the very varied settings ranging from snow-capped mountains to futuristic cities, passing through mysterious archaeological sites and military bases. There aren't many maps, but they vary according to the mode selected (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Domination of Control Points... nothing new). There are also single player modes, i.e. a training campaign divided into missions and the possibility of setting up matches to practice against bots. They're just fine for practice, but they're obviously not the focus of the game. In short, for the asking price the contents are excellent and the work done is truly excellent. Yet we have to go back to talking about the low number of players on the servers, which hardly exceeds one hundred units at peak daily moments, despite the free version. The question that arises is obvious: what do players actually want? The answer is not clear but certainly, despite the claims, not that classic competitive gameplay that they say from time to time should return to sweep away the new forms of online gaming. Here he is, he's back, but he's just a tear in the rain.", "date": "2016-10-03", "grade": "9.0"}
