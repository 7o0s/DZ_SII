But next to the big names, the million-dollar blockbusters, there are less ~mass~ brands ~ but equally - if not more - loved and appreciated by the long-time fans of the Kyoto house. And so while we are anxiously awaiting that by now infamous Pikmin 3, on 3DS in the absence of a Nintendo product belonging to the great series mentioned above, on the other hand there is a coincidence of releases of precisely those ~younger brothers~ who for a long time have been been snubbed, not to say forgotten. Waiting for the imminent return of Kid Icarus, therefore, this Pilotwings Resort also appeared among the launch titles, the third episode after the debut on Super Nintendo in 1990 and the sequel on Nintendo 64 in 1996. Get off the ground Another amusing point of contact between the two revived series just mentioned lies in the underlying theme, or that human desire to fly that finds its most famous representation in the myth of Icarus. But if Kid Icarus on 3DS will be a kind of shooter completely dedicated to action, Pilotwings Resort is something completely different; in this case the flight is not a simple tool through which to convey a canonical gameplay applicable to other contexts, but on the contrary it is the only and fundamental focal point on which the entire experience develops. Pilotwings is a simulation, although obviously sweetened (there is no deadlock, just to name one) as well as perfectly calibrated on those boundaries of accessibility and fun that are typical of Nintendo games. There are no enemies or adversaries to take out; at most a few targets or balloons, just to please. The basic structure offers three different means of traveling through the clouds, deeply distinguished by characteristics and method of control; it's a plane, a jetpack and a hang glider, with ~improved~ versions of them to unlock. The setting is uniquely that of WuHu Island, not unknown to those who have had the opportunity to play Wii Fit and Wii Sports Resort; on the other hand, given Miyamoto's statements regarding the desire to make the island a sort of character in its own right, it is not unreasonable to believe that this will not be the last time we will be able to visit this location. The overall dimensions are discrete, but it doesn't actually take much to discover every nook and cranny, even more so if you have had experience with the aforementioned titles; at that point the desire for ~something more~ will inevitably begin to make itself felt, a sensation that is actually destined to involve other aspects of the product as well. The missions for example, which in fact represent the main and most robust component of the game; about forty in all, divided into classes ranging from ~practical~ to ~platinum~ obviously in relation to the increasing difficulty. These are ~sewn~ around the qualities of the different aircraft, thus requiring specifically designed objectives for each of them; often, for example, with the plane it will happen that you have to hit fixed or mobile targets, while with the jetpack in most cases you will have to cross rings and perform precise landings by carefully dosing the available fuel, while with the hang glider you will perhaps be able to take pictures of certain elements present on the island trying to obtain optimal shots, exploiting the warm updrafts to gain altitude. Although there are variations to the examples just reported, it is undeniable to notice a sort of static and recycling effect in the objectives offered by the Pilotwings Resort missions, an element that begins to manifest itself in a short time, reducing the brilliance of the progression. The 3D effect Pilotwings Resort is among the best titles in the 3DS line-up in terms of 3D effect representation; never excessive or annoying, it is enhanced by the depth of the visual horizon and the amount of elements on the screen. Although not graphically surprising, the final result is therefore absolutely valid and capable of representing the distinctive feature of the Nintendo portable well. Flying Challenges With a ~layered~ structure that often characterizes Nintendo productions, even the Pilotwings Resort missions can be tackled with a commitment and attention that varies according to one's will; the performances in each of them are in fact evaluated with a score - divided by a series of items - which, once added together, determines the number of stars earned, from zero to three with the further addition of the perfect (plus a ~second level~ of perfection for the best). Although it takes a certain amount of stars earned to reach the next class, the achievementminimum is not particularly difficult to achieve, indeed. Where you can find a bit of a challenge is precisely in the search for the best score, an objective that can be achieved by repeating the same mission several times. But if perfection is not part of your aspirations, it is not excessive to say that Pilotwings Resort can be completed in a couple of play sessions; a little bit, considering the general lack of variety that the product shows. One might have expected at least some additional means, but in reality continuing in the main mode all that is encountered are small variations that add very little to the original versions. Even very pleasant exceptions, such as the squirrel suit, are so rare and occasional that they leave more bitterness in the mouth than anything else. To the mission mode described so far is added a further free flight mode, structured in such a way as to allow you to freely explore the island; by collecting certain hidden objects on the island it is possible to extend the duration of the time available, or block phases of the day in which to go out to fly (day, evening, night) and models to collect. An addition destined to increase the life of Pilotwings Resort by only a few tens of minutes. What annoys Nintendo's production is therefore precisely the poverty of content, so marked as to be unjustifiable even considering all the extenuating circumstances of the case of a launch title. There is also no system for sharing scores, locally or online, just as the StreetPass function so dear to Nintendo is not supported either. Although hardly imaginable as a driving product of the new laptop, Pilotwings Resort could have been a highly advisable purchase because the basic substance is all there; the control system for example, simple but not simplistic, capable of rendering well the differences between the means and the pleasure of flying. Or the graphic component, extremely pleasant and full of details despite the minimal and stylized style that has often been exploited by the Kyoto house since Wii Sports. But with so little iron on the fire, the feeling is that of having a demo or so in your hands.", "date": "2011-04-12", "grade": "7.2"}
