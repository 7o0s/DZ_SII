Ah, no, it was down... too late. I settled into the armchair in the living room at home, the DVG is in the player and the remote control in my hand curiously wondering what happened to the usual pad. The screen, after an initial presentation film, takes us to the game menu which includes the possibility of starting a new adventure, continuing one that has already started, choosing the mode of use, the difficulty or viewing the credits. Scrolling with the four directional arrows on the player's remote control, which together with the central ~ok/enter~ key will then be all that we will need to move within the game, we discover that in the menu relating to the methods of use it is actually present a mini-tutorial that will allow us to familiarize ourselves with the game interface. Thus we will learn to interact with the environment and with the characters, using the traditional lens to observe, speech bubble to speak and hand to pick up/use objects. We also get to know Tristan and find out how the action sequences work. First perplexity. The actions of combat, parries and evasion of blows are indicated to us by yellow flashes that appear on the screen, to give us an indication of the relative key to press on the directional to perform the correct action. To dodge to the right, for example, we will have to press the right arrow. If we want to make a shot, we will press enter / ok when the yellow flash will illuminate our character. But however simple, conceptually, this dynamic and being accustomed to all sorts of keys, combos, pads, keyboards and interfaces ... I find myself puzzled by not being able to react in time to visual cues on the screen. Is it possible that I only have a nanosecond to see the flash flash, register the direction it is pointing to me, press the consequent directional key on the remote control and hope that the signal is faster than me to be processed by the reader? Well, it will be just the unfamiliarity with the remote control, I tell myself, let's see what happens by playing. A new Adam rises from the remains of the Ark We start a new adventure and we find ourselves immersed in a suggestive introductory movie that leads us to know the first details of the plot. The graphic impact is really beautiful and the snows of Mount Ararat envelop us with promises of ancient secrets, which will apparently cost Prof. Badgers, an archaeologist in search of the legendary Noah's Ark, his life under a landslide that will plunge him into the abyss together to the remains of the relic he had just discovered. But after these excited sequences we find no peace. In fact, from past events and the swirling snow we are suddenly thrown into the town ~Papoc~, inspired by our Parma, where we meet again Tristan, a jaunty-looking and a little impertinent teenager, as well as naive as only a young hero can be. We are in 2011, Tristan is sitting quietly in his gym when a tornado suddenly hits the city, throwing all sorts of objects at us and making us frantically reach for the remote control that we forgot we had for a moment, trying to react within the very short time that we are granted visual flashes that tell us what to do. A bike ride, battling wind and debris, we end straight through a window, meeting the very archaeologist we left behind on Mount Ararat so many years ago. And not to lose the habit, life threatening, under the threat of a strange being who points a gun to his head. In a way as casual as daring we will save him, thus ending up caught up in an adventure with a truly fascinating plot, which will lead us to have to save the world from the Nephilim sect, an organization within which man has been recreated perfect: the first Adam, so perfect as to be more powerful than God, who, realizing his mistake, closed him in a sarcophagus which, guess what, will jump out of Noah's Ark. This, in a nutshell, is the plot of the game that will take place between religious and legendary elements, in a rather smooth and engaging way. A game for all or for none? The only flaw, the poor characterization of the characters. We would have liked to know more, delve further into the elements of the plot, which in my opinion really had excellent potential for development and have been neglected in favor of a more hurried user, perhaps. But let's go back to the game dynamics for a moment. One of the problems that immediately catches the eye of this new format is related to the saves. It seems evident that it is not possible to take advantage of the usual installations or memory cards that allowed us to storesave data for ~traditional~ titles. So here is that the chosen solution takes us back for a moment in the past, when we passed a certain game scheme we were given a save code which, once entered, would take us back to where we were. The thing in itself would not be a nuisance, were it not for the problem relating to the limited number of attempts (three) available to the player in case he fails to pass an action sequence and thus access the next save code. And precisely this raises the greatest perplexity about the balance of the game, which in my opinion has not been achieved. In fact, if we wanted to aim at an extremely large catchment area, making the title usable even by those who cannot be considered an expert player, in my opinion we made the mistake of making the margin of time that is granted too narrow for react to visual impulses. The flashes that appear on the screen are really too ephemeral and in more than one case they don't clearly indicate the direction corresponding to the arrow that we have to press on the remote control. Too many times I have had to repeat an action sequence which, although truly excellent in terms of visual and emotional impact, has proved frustrating by the need to repeat it several times, until learning in a mechanical way the right sequence of movements and the right times required for their execution. managing to overcome them with a snort a little too exasperated. But how... already finished? Of course, a little effort is needed, even for a casual gamer, otherwise the game would have risked becoming flat and monotonous, nothing more than a real interactive movie. True, but we would have liked to see the sector relating to exploration and interaction with environments and characters less sacrificed, the dialogues more developed, rather than lengthening the game times ~thanks~ to an excessive request for quick reflexes. In the exploratory parts there are very few ~hot spots~ which, through a selection window, will allow us to interact with objects to take, levers to activate and actions to take to solve the puzzles that we will find along the way. There is no inventory, we will simply collect, use, act, in linear sequences that require almost no effort of reasoning. Too little for any graphic adventure enthusiast, too little even for an occasional gamer. If we then consider the fact that the game's instruction booklet, in addition to containing brief hints of the plot, including some pages drawn in comic strips that will reveal the background of the events that saw Prof. Badgers as protagonist on Mount Ararat, also brings us back the complete solution of the game and the puzzles... we wonder if it wasn't worth giving savvy players a little more trouble by lengthening the longevity of a title that didn't commit me, in total, more than four hours to finish. Choices that, perhaps, were not particularly lucky. As for the technical sector, however, nothing to complain. The graphics are truly spectacular and extremely accurate and know how to involve giving a truly beautiful experience. The soundtrack, for its part, is equally spot on and engaging, as are the environmental and sound effects that accompany the flow of the game. Final comment Dangerous Heaven is certainly an experimental title, thanks to the new DVG format that makes it readable by any DVD player, whether it's the player in the living room or the more traditional gaming platforms. A hand extended towards a global catchment area, thanks to the possibility of playing it comfortably seated on the armchair in the living room, managing it with five buttons on a remote control. The excellent graphics and the beautiful settings are capable of great impact on the player, even if the lack of depth of the plot and the characters and some problems with the control mechanics prevent this adventure from being the video game gem it would have had the potential to become. Pros A format compatible with any DVD player Graphically spectacular Compelling and interesting storyline Cons The control system requires too quick reflexes Puzzles and interactions with the environment too meager Very short-lived Strange sensations for a 'living room' support As an ~old~ gamer I had by now forgotten what it means to insert a game support and wonder uncertainly and with a strange sense of unease and expectation what will be offered to us in a title with an ~experimental~ flavor. The discomfort arises from the non-habitual game management dynamics, starting from the performance of gestures that we are used to performing in the roubefore watching a movie inserted in the DVD player at home rather than in the rituals we usually perform when we feel like playing. In fact, this title falls into the new category of Digital Video Games, which are presented to us on a support suitable for being read by any type of platform, including PCs and consoles that are equipped with a DVD player. Extremely versatile solution, as it is logical to think, which inserts Dangerous Heaven in a strategy that wants to reach an extremely wide range of users, breaking down the limitations that prevented a less expert or technological user from approaching the world of video games and offering the possibility children, housewives, older users to sit comfortably in the living room and enjoy the experience of what seems easier to define an interactive film, mastering it with the remote control tool, certainly familiar to the hands of each of us. But let's go step by step, take me by the hand and accompany me on this adventure.", "date": "2006-04-28", "grade": null}
