At the end of last week, in record time, the third and final DLC of Immortals Fenyx Rising also appeared on PC and console, trying to do what the others hadn't entirely succeeded: vary. Let's find out how it is in our review of Immortals Fenyx Rising: The Lost Gods. A new champion Fenyx is now a Goddess in all respects and this brings with it burdens and honors. Sitting at the table of Zeus and his companions is certainly an extraordinary privilege, even more so after having earned this place with one's abilities. Despite the efforts to preserve cohesion, several other deities have decided to abandon the king of Olympus and take refuge far away, on the islands forged by Daedalus himself. This action has brought the world to the brink, with natural disasters and situations under control that are decimating human beings and upsetting the balance of things. Fenyx would like to intervene, but her new position prevents her from doing so, forced as she is not to attack other deities. So he decides to choose a human champion, someone still faithful, making the choice fall on poor Ash. A change of perspective that puts us back in the position experienced by Fenyx herself at the beginning of this long wandering. Even the tones remain the same: we return to the light-hearted look of the original and the serious hues of the oriental-themed DLC are abandoned a little. Unfortunately the narration never takes off and it is precisely the few scenes of ~Pantheon life~ that give all the smiles and funny moments of the five or six hours necessary to complete the campaign. Overall, however, we are satisfied, especially in the light of a content that focuses all its power on the gameplay, transforming what we already knew, but keeping some principles firm. Diablo - Immortals Raise your hand if you haven't smiled at the title of the paragraph. Leaving aside our strong irony, it's really funny to think that Ubisoft Qubec has been so brave in experimenting that it has distorted its own creature. Over the (few) months since the arrival on the market of Ubisoft's biggest surprise in recent years, Immortals Fenyx Rising has attempted to encompass many different changes of direction within it. It is probably the very nature of an experimental project that has allowed it, but it is this very nature that makes it so interesting to our eyes. Where the first DLC set aside the narration and combat and pushed everything on puzzles, the second has instead attempted to replicate the original formula by translating the experience into Chinese mythology. For this third iteration we return to Greece and to the already known faces, but putting on the plate a totally new experience from a gameplay point of view. The classic third-person shot leaves room for that of top down titles, loudly recalling games like Diablo and Path of Exile. Also from the point of view of progression and mechanics, the changes do not struggle to get noticed. The cornerstones of controls and the basis of combat remain, divided as it is between light and heavy attacks. However, the enemy stamina disappears and also some of the advantages in exploration that strongly recalled Zelda: Breath of the Wild. No more potions for the recovery of life and stamina, but only spheres of relative color and which are released by defeated enemies. The puzzles are always there, even in a much smaller number for a DLC that blatantly points the finger towards the open-air clash. It is no coincidence that a large part of the adventure is characterized by waves of enemies, to be beaten and defeated to make their way through the missions and maps of the islands. Just in the course of exploration, space is also left for many adjustments in the progression. The resources that can be collected substantially increase and, among these, there is also the one dedicated to saving progress. Once defeated, in fact, you go back to the last save made, a not indifferent detail that we don't hide being one of the things that made us turn up our noses the most. The map is in fact scattered with a series of altars which, once activated, allow you to make offers to the gods, so as to receive in exchange new powers, upgrades and the very possibility of saving progress. In practice this turns into a totally different degree of customization, which is amplified even more by the presence of essences: real modification mods and buffs for the equipped skills. The latter range from increase dthe values up to the addition of specific perks that modify the use and functionality of the skills themselves. This is where all the great inspiration of Ubisoft Quebc and of this additional content comes out. The creation of your own build and the application of essences can be carried out on different skills, generating equally detailed effects. What we think does not work within the formula is an ever-present lack of depth, which gradually pushes situations to repetitiveness and that did not help to avoid the most classic of horde modes, a structure adopted to give duration and degree of challenge to the adventure. Gli Dei Perduti therefore has this dual nature: on the one hand, the awareness of being a fun and successful experiment, almost a prelude to a possible dedicated spin-off episode. On the other hand, however, it also suffers from the difficulty of putting together an all-encompassing experience, deep to the right point not only in the application of some RPG variants, but also in its play structure.", "date": "2021-04-28", "grade": "7.5"}
