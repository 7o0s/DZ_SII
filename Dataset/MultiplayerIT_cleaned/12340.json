{"name": "Final Fight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fight.html", "text": "One of the most monumental milestones of the now almost extinct genre of scrolling fighting games, Final Fight sees three characters fight along the most infamous streets of a city in search of a kidnapped girl: it is the mayor-wrestler Haggar (the father of her), of the blond Cody (her boyfriend) and of the lethal Guy (who apparently has nothing to do with her). As everyone knows, the game is resolved in the crossing of different two-dimensional scenarios, previously peppered with a plethora of opponents to punch. In this mobile version, Final Fight uses a fairly simple control system: four keys dedicated to movement, one to the basic attack, one to the special strike and two reserved for flying kicks. In an all in all decent general picture, only this last aspect appears to have been made with great superficiality, given that despite the two buttons it is still necessary to combine a direction to hit from one side or the other. Even the excessive softening of the difficulty level makes one turn up a bit, probably implemented to meet the heterogeneous mobile audience: also thanks to the continuous infinities, going on in Final Fight is all too simple, to the point of making the playful action boring at times. Fortunately, all the characteristic elements of the classic Capcom intervene to give relief to the user in this sense: the stages are therefore well recognizable, as well as the various types of enemies and their different attacks; again, the picturesque weapons make their appearance (iron pipes, knives, swords, Molotov cocktails and so on) that it is possible to find inside the barrels or collect from fallen opponents. Even if a little easy, Final Fight is still always enjoyable, and moreover rather ~big~ by the standards of mobile gaming: between the three selectable characters and the numerous game levels, the Capcom title guarantees considerable longevity. If on the gameplay front - as we have seen - Final Fight alternates ups and downs, the same can be said regarding the technical realization, on the one hand quite faithful to the original but on the other a little dated compared to other video games for mobile phone. In the face of sufficiently varied and well-kept backgrounds and well-defined characters, it is painful to note the paucity of the animations, as well as the dubious aesthetic taste of the huge energy bars on a black background placed at the top of the screen. Finally, the sound is also reduced, reduced to a polyphonic musical accompaniment that objectively gets boring within a few minutes. Pros: It's always Final Fight Faithful to the original Against: So-so control system Low difficulty level Graphically not impressive", "date": "2007-04-21", "grade": "S.V."}
