{"name": "Turbo Pizza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/turbo-pizza_a.html", "text": "Yet your goal, in Turbo Pizza, will be to manage a successful pizzeria by yourself! In the role of Rebecca, a skilled handyman saleswoman, you will find yourself facing customers one at a time or all together, with the imperative of being able to manage their orders quickly and, possibly, to serve them as a group. It is an atypical video game genre, which probably has its roots in the old Tapper, a 1983 coin-op (converted for all gaming systems of the time) in which you controlled the manager of a brewery, who had to quench his thirst its customers with mugs of beer, juggling between various counters. The dynamics of the new I-play product are very similar, in fact one of the key elements of Turbo Pizza is time. The first thing to do is face a short tutorial, in which we will be explained how things work in the place we will manage: what is the coffee machine, what is the soft drink dispenser, how to prepare pizzas and ice creams, and so on. The control system is based on the universe of party games, as we will not control Rebecca directly, with the joystick, but we will move an indicator on the screen passing from one area to another, using the 5 key to indicate where we want her saleswoman head. To prepare an ice cream cone, for example, we must first ~click~ on the cone area, then on the ice cream area; finally, we will have to ~click~ on the part of the counter occupied by the customer who placed the order to deliver it and receive the money in return. The fundamental concept is not so much the creation of a certain number of dishes, as the ability to manage a large number of customers at the same time, dividing between things that need to be cooked and those that are already ready, with an eye to the ~patience~ indicators of who stands in front of the counter and another to the amount of money earned. The latter actually sets the goal to be overcome in order to complete the internship, and to make more money it is advisable to carry out the collection and deliveries in ~combo~, i.e. in rapid succession with two or more customers. Between one level and another we will be able to use the amount earned to invest it in training courses (to make Rebecca faster and/or better), accessories for the venue (new table, new flooring, new counter, etc.) or equipment new generation, which allows us to prepare dishes more quickly. The game's graphics feature a series of well-drawn sprites, with discreet animation, which alternate at the counter while the protagonist divides herself between the various equipment. The excellent use of colors and the possibility of changing the place add variety to the aesthetic component of Turbo Pizza, which inevitably cannot be presented as a spectacular title but which carries out its job in a more than decent way. Don't expect much from the sound, however: as often happens, the only accompanying MIDI music can be largely deactivated. The control system turns out to be surprisingly precise and simple, after all it's just a matter of selecting an area and pressing key 5 for our order to reach it, doing the rest automatically. Certainly such a setting would have worked better on a device with a touch screen or using a mouse, but we can't complain too much. PRO Original and fun Well done graphics Immediate control system... AGAINST ...but a little disorienting at first Mediocre sound Only one game mode", "date": "2008-08-19", "grade": "S.V."}
