{"name": "Far Cry: Instincts Predator  - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-instincts-predator-recensione.html", "text": "Beastly gameplay After the first fully guided mission, in which the basic commands and actions that can be carried out directly in combat are illustrated, the game begins to get going with consequent evolutions in the plot, and in the skills of our character who have guaranteed an excellent, well-deserved , public success in previous versions of the title. The action within the jungle and vast environments of Far Cry is always very appreciated, while there is not a high degree of interaction with the vegetation, the resulting atmosphere also affects some aspects of the game mechanics. The approaches to combat can differ greatly from player to player, one of the most successful features in FC is precisely the ability to manage exploration and the various clashes by choosing the most direct way possible, like a real frenetic Fps in the most classic of solutions , between reinforcements that arrive, medkits that are used in industrial quantities, usable double weapon and so on. real frenetic Fps in the most classic of solutions, between reinforcements arriving, medikits that are used in industrial quantities, usable double weapon Beastly gameplay The other possible game method, on the other hand, allows you to place traps in the trees, take enemies by surprise, aim to attract their attention away from the radios, hit them from behind like the best Sam Fisher or look for effective head shots using the zoom of certain weapons by exposing yourself as little as possible. In aid of Jack during the course of the adventure there will be the possibility of using some particular skills, which will modify the parameters of our alter-ego such as running, strength, sight, attacks, climbing and others. Using these abilities is a strong point in the console version of Far Cry, which was also built for certain types of objectives and missions, around the evolution of Jack's abilities with these super powers. evolution Speaking of the new campaign, i.e. Evolution, technical improvements should be noted, thanks to areas designed from scratch and therefore with the experience on the part of the programmers of what was already produced for the first FC on Xbox, while from the point of view of playability everything remains unchanged compared to the first part of the game, perhaps too much given the extremely linear progress of the level design and related objectives to be achieved. The control system is practically the standard one for all titles in the genre, so nothing new. Unfortunately, an atypical problem for a first person shooter played on the Xbox 360 pad is precisely the rendering of precision, which in Far Cry Predator was not properly implemented. Players who use a high sensitivity in the analog sticks, especially the right one, may experience some sort of minimal delay in response, and find themselves in difficulty at first impact in the game. After a few tries with different values in the sensitivity of the sticks or perhaps disabling the automatic aim, which is not exactly perfect, the hindrances vanish and the game takes off. As far as the purely technical aspects of Far Cry are concerned, one can only be partially satisfied. The frame rate has been improved with the relative active antialiasing filters, some graphic effects such as the rendering of water are equally well done, which can be admired on several occasions. Unfortunately, the technical improvements are not sufficient to optimally exploit the potential of Xbox 360, so much so that Far Cry Instincts Predator is far from the graphic rendering of GRAW (to stay at Ubisoft) due to a graphics engine developed on the basis of that already seen in the Xbox version. The same situation for the routines dedicated to physics which have remained practically identical in the transition between Xbox and Xbox360, without taking advantage of the potential of Microsoft's next gen console. Even the sound department has not received major updates compared to the version released on Xbox, apart from the use of customized soundtracks, but the rendering of the environmental effects on a dolby digital 5.1 system is still more than valid. Furthermore, the title is completely localized in Italian, including the dialogues. The artificial intelligence in Far Cry fluctuates, in some cases the reactions are good, for example the enemies try to move to avoid our attacks, in other situations the result is certainly not worthy of note, with defects in the very limited visual range , poor adaptability to the environment that leads our opponents to fall off cliffs, or to move according to somewhat dated behavioral sets. Multiplayer The game supports a variety of multiplayer modes, including split screen action for up to 4 players on the same gamescreen, while by connecting to Xbox Live the number rises up to 16 players per match. Also in these modes there are additions of various kinds, starting from a greater number of maps available, now more than 20, up to the introduction of new usable vehicles. The various types of game resume those already seen in the Xbox version with the introduction of a search mode created from scratch. Obviously, the editor for creating and saving your own multiplayer maps and sharing them online is also present on Xbox 360. Unfortunately it won't be possible to reuse the previously created maps developed on FC: Instincts for Xbox, for this purpose without losing the news of the evolution section but by renouncing the high definition of the Xbox360 version you can proceed with the purchase of Far Cry: Evolution for the previous Microsoft console. Overall, between the two single player campaigns, the hours of play are over 15, even without considering the possible offline replayability using different combat methods, the multiplayer modes, the splitscreen and the very valid map editor, the longevity certainly represents one of the strengths in Far Cry. Comment Far Cry Instincts Predator is certainly promoted from the point of view of playability, especially for those who have not been able to appreciate the PC or Xbox versions, but, unlike other Ubisoft productions, the technical performance is one of the aspects that most penalizes the title on a consoles like Xbox 360. Ultimately one of the best fps on Xbox of 2005 arrives on Xbox360 with a good job behind it, new maps and various additions, unfortunately not such as to make it truly suitable for the concept of Next Gen, which titles like Ghost Recon they helped to appreciate. Far Cry, however, is a title to consider for all those who have not had the opportunity to play it previously, or for those who have been satisfied with it, and here the list gets considerably longer, and want to continue Jack's adventures both offline, as well as in multiplayer via Xbox Live. Pros Far Cry at its best Additional maps and modes Improved longevity and multiplayer Cons: Graphically not like a true Next Gen A.I. not at the highest level Possible control problems Ubisoft proves to be one of the most active third parties on Microsoft home consoles and, after the excellent Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter returns to Xbox 360 with the conversion of Far Cry Instincts, released on Xbox last fall. The Predator suffix, in addition to the various technical changes to make the title suitable for the Xbox 360 hardware, also derives from the presence of a new single player campaign, which is unlocked after finishing the first part of the game. Also on Xbox 360 we find our dear and not too old Jack Carter, an ex soldier looking for a job without too many headaches as captain of a boat that plows the seas of the Pacific. Due to the latest contract stipulated with an affable journalist, Jack must regain confidence with weapons and related fighting techniques due to the classic illegal genetic experiments carried out by a mad scientist and his battalion of mercenaries in tow, who did not appreciate the visit of Jack on the shores of their island hideout.", "date": "2006-04-10", "grade": null}
