In the mobile sphere, in fact, we have already been able to appreciate a large number of titles that share the war setting and perhaps even the game structure, with the use of the top view as a solution for a whole series of limitations (the joystick on all). Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is about to enrich the ranks of these productions, bringing a fairly well-known name among fans as well as a good technical realization. From the start screen you can try your hand at a quick game, with random settings, or start the campaign by tackling one stage at a time. The developers have given great importance to the story, with our character being hired to free a Latin American country from the tyranny of its governor. We will therefore have to complete a series of different missions, in which a constant is represented by the obligation to eliminate all the enemies that we will face. We will be able to move using the joystick to go in the four main directions, while the combat system implies a completely automatic approach to the clashes: in the presence of opponents within range of the equipped weapon, the character will fire without having to press any button, until the fight doesn't end (one way or another, that's clear). The situation regarding the secondary weapon, often a grenade, is different: to use it we will have to press the 5 key to activate a crosshair, move it around the screen until it is positioned on a target and then press 5 again to launch. The interface shows us at all times the ammunition level of the equipped weapon (which seems to never run out) and of the secondary weapon (which does run down, and how), as well as our state of health. In a firefight, we will see our vital energy drop even quickly, depending on the number of opponents we will be dealing with: in such situations we will only be able to retreat and then return to the attack, given that the energy bar it gradually fills up when we are not hit. Within the stages there are often interactable elements, both in the form of sensitive objectives (to be blown up with a grenade, for example) and as structures to take shelter behind in order to attack at intervals. The eliminated enemies leave their weapons on the street, weapons that we can pick up by pressing the usual 5 key once above them, and which boast very different behaviors: on the one hand there are the machine guns, effective from any distance but not very powerful; on the other there are shotguns, lethal up close but unable to hit from a distance. The graphics of the game are very well done, beyond a series of shortcomings that do not detract from the real experience. The characters boast a discreet design and decent animation, but the strong point certainly lies in the scenarios, which are very differentiated and full of details. Let's say that one never gets the impression that the backgrounds have been filled randomly, as unfortunately happens in various mobile video games, and in general the graphics give a good feeling of ~agility~, with a fast scrolling which unfortunately often allows uncertainties. The sound consists solely of MIDI music, with a non-adjustable volume, which however has the advantage of accompanying the action effectively, making it even more engaging than normal.
