{"name": "Need for Speed Underground", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-underground-2.html", "text": "Spoiler, what a passion Need for Speed Underground, this is the name of the production in question, undoubtedly represents an interesting point of view towards an inflated genre such as that of automotive titles: as already mentioned, the effort of the Black Box team is entirely set at night in the interior of a US metropolis, scene of illegal races in the full spirit of ~The Fast and the Furious~, just to give an idea. And just like in the film just mentioned, an enormous weight is represented by the modifications, aesthetic and performance, of one's car. In fact, the Electronic Arts title can realistically be defined as divided into two parts, of equal importance and dignity within the gameplay economy: running and processing. As regards the first aspect, Need for Speed Underground does not betray its roots, proposing an extremely arcade and immediate game mechanic; full-throttle skids, straight stretches at 200 km/h and counters with opponents are the daily bread, all with the foot strictly pressed hard on the accelerator. The main mode, called Underground, puts the player in front of 111 competitions to be faced in sequence; in order to diversify the playful offer of their title, the programmers have decided to introduce 3 different specialties called respectively Race, Drift and Drag. The first is the classic race against other cars, also divided into point-to-point (a long route that crosses the city), circuit (several laps within a closed circuit) and knockout (similar to circuit but with the difference that the last one of each round is eliminated). Drift, on the other hand, is a race of skids and skids on a short and tortuous circuit, where each performance is evaluated on the basis of speed, duration and corner entry angle. Lastly, Drag is a head-to-head challenge on a more or less short straight, during which it is essential to shift gears optimally and avoid the traffic ahead. It is therefore undoubtedly a commendable effort, capable of guaranteeing benefits in terms of variety and freshness of the gameplay; tackling the challenges of Need for Speed Underground is extremely fun and, especially in Race mode, it's not uncommon to finish a race with a genuine sense of elation. All this thanks to the excellent dynamism and frenzy that the EA production is capable of transmitting, accentuated by the good amount of shortcuts present - now a hallmark of the series - and the spectacular nature of some passages, enhanced by short extremely cinematic external shots. In detail, on the occasion of accidents or ~jumps~ of one's car, the camera leaves the in-game view (first person or from behind the car) to position itself in front and better frame the action. Beyond these aesthetic quirks, however, Need for Speed Underground proves to be a good automotive arcade, satisfying to play and extremely fast. Nonetheless, the flaws are not lacking: among these, the most obvious is undoubtedly the far from perfect collision detection system. In fact, if the collision with another car causes a credible reaction from one's own car, with results similar to what was seen in Burnout (albeit without damage to the bodywork), on the contrary, the collisions with the setting are resolved in the vast majority of cases with the simple and cloying arrest of one's fireball. This can be the cause, on some occasions, of excessive and unjustifiable penalties for the player; widening a curve too much and touching a lamppost with the bumper can in fact result in an irritating stop, capable of compromising an entire race conducted perhaps perfectly up to that moment. Equally serious is the questionable artificial intelligence of one's opponents, often too aggressive and impetuous in the conduct of the race; to this must be added their possibility of ~cheating~ during the competitions, a factor that allows them to recover otherwise unbridgeable disadvantages. Online Enabled Continuing its policy of stonewalling Xbox Live, Electronic Arts has made online play possible only on PS2; which is a real shame, since the US house has successfully managed to ensure that owners of the Ps2 and Pc versions can meet and challenge the network. The foundations for a huge struggle without borders, therefore, were all there. As for the mode itself, it is undoubtedly a particularly well-finished aspect that will make broadband adapter owners happy; it is in fact possible alreadygo online to one of the competitions present for up to 4 participants. There is obviously the option to use your own modified car, and even compare it with those of your opponents before starting the challenge to evaluate any performance gaps. Mister Taroc with the accent on the q But undoubtedly the element that helps Need for Speed Underground to stand out from the crowd and earn a respectable evaluation is the phase of modifying your car. The complete fleet is around 20 units, starting from a modest selection of ~common~ cars such as the 206 and Golf up to monsters such as the Nissan Skyline. The interesting thing is that you can change everything about your car. That's right: everything, very simply. Starting from bonnets, side skirts, spoilers, air intakes, brakes, exhausts, up to enhancing the engine, improving the set-up, reducing weight, applying airbrushing and stickers, changing the body colour, the brake calipers and even everything what's under the hood. Unless you viscerally hate any form of video game based on 4 wheels, Need for Speed Underground is a title capable of bringing out the truzzo alter ego (or ganassa, tamarro, maranza, boar, etc.) of anyone who decides to dedicate a some time. What is surprising is precisely the enormous stimulus that the car tuning mode manages to provide for the entire game: you find yourself passing races and tournaments only with the desire to try the latest unlocked modification and fake this or that appearance of your bludger. It is precisely through victories that new car tarot options are unlocked: some of these are linked to individual competitions, while others become accessible once a certain number of points have been reached. The latter, to be obtained on the track through overtaking, skidding, jumps and so on, are directly linked to the aesthetic aspect of your car. Yes, because the amount of cosmetic changes increases the ~Respect~ indicator, which is nothing but a multiplier of the aforementioned points. The circle thus closes, becoming a real vicious circle: I want to score points to unlock new parts to modify my car to get more points to unlock new parts and so on. The strength of EA production lies precisely in this: in the ability of the programmers to have studied one of the most stimulating structures ever to appear in a car title, so well done as to be able to overshadow the defects of a certainly valid main mode , but certainly far from the great masterpieces of the genre. As far as the purely technical discourse is concerned, Need for Speed Underground undoubtedly represents a product of good overall value; the settings are rich in detail, large, free of pop-ups and absolutely brimming with light sources and special effects. The modeling of the cars is also extremely convincing, rather faithful reproductions of the real and surprising counterparts in the transformation process, which sees them go from production cars to monsters that are only very distantly related to them. The use of textures designed in a particular way and the inclusion of a marked motion blur for the light sources also manages to increase the sensation of speed, already in itself more than well returned by the proximity to the ground of the first person view. The latter is certainly preferable to the one behind the car, which on the contrary takes away from the action and slightly weighs down the occasional but evident drops in frame rate, even more marked in the face of the fact that the graphics engine never manages to exceed 30 fps . But beyond the technical merits or defects, it is impossible not to denote a lack of variety in the only setting present: while offering different glimpses, from the sewers to the centre, it is in fact a question of running always and only at night within a single and only city, mostly on a discreet but certainly not sensational number of tracks. From this point of view, it would have benefited not so much the ability to face daytime competitions, which in our opinion would have proved to be an inconsistent decision with the context of EA's production, but rather the inclusion of other cities markedly different from the present one. Replay is also absent, a decision that is really difficult to accept for a title released in 2003. The sound, on the other hand, is good, with a more than satisfactory selection of songs and spot-on effects. COMMENT Need for Speed Underground is not a masterpiece: the competitions present, albeit extremely enjoyable and equipped with an appreciable onevariety, are based on a mechanics devoid of treble and penalized by a couple of too many defects that would have been appropriate to remove. Furthermore, the only setting present, although certainly well done and, as far as possible, although diversified between one track and another, proves to be limiting and repetitive already around mid-game. Nonetheless, the game structure is undoubtedly among the best ever adopted in an automotive title, so much so that it proves to be the real driving force capable of stimulating the user to continue from race to race; the possibility of modifying one's car in every aspect possible and imaginable represents the holy grail of every four-wheel enthusiast, able to awaken the tamarra soul of even the most calm gamer. A big surprise then, as well as an excellent basis for a sequel that could have what it takes to really leave a mark. Pros: Exceptional game structure Good graphics Immediate and satisfying gameplay Cons: Limited variety of the only setting Questionable shock management Drops in frame rate Need for Speed, or the need for speed. Behind this apt title there is nothing more than one of the countless series produced by the prolific Electronic Arts, a real multinational of video entertainment. As easily understood even by those unfamiliar with the brand in question, Need for Speed is a title that has always represented crazy car racing with dream cars characterized by a purely arcade mold and without particular simulation ambitions. However, unlike most video game series, not only those published by EA, the numerous productions united by the name ~Need for Speed~ have not limited themselves to proposing graphic updates and new tracks, but have often followed different paths always maintaining a common thread to unite them. As evidence of this ~development policy~ just described, the last episode of the series has decided to shift its gaze to the world of clandestine night-time competitions, in a rather similar way to what Genki proposed with Tokyo Extreme Racer and its discreet sequels.", "date": "2003-12-12", "grade": null}
