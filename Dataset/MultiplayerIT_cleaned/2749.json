Strengthened by that success, Sonic Team and SEGA return to the fray with a strongly derivative sequel, enriched however by the introduction of some simple but welcome RPG element, by the addition of the new Technical Battle mode and by the presence of many more characters. Let's break it down in the Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 review. New Technical Battle mode Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 is a colorful, fun mashup with an even more challenging level than the first one. The title offers various contents for single player and multiplayer: from this point of view we are faced with more or less the same ones present in the first Puyo Puyo Tetris, therefore with the various Lessons, the local Multiplayer, the quick challenges in Puyo Puyo , Tetris or a combination of both. To find something new you must therefore ~enter~ Single, where there is the Technical Battle mode, which is added to the six main ones that already exist, namely Versus, Exchange, Party, Fusion, Big Bang and Challenge. The mechanics that govern matches in this mode provide for the creation of teams made up of three characters, ready to challenge each other to the latest technique until the opponent's Life Points, indicated by an orange bar at the top of the team window, reach zero. A peculiarity of this session is in fact that the game can continue even if the piles of puyos or tetrominoes reach the top of the board (in this case the team will lose ~only~  of the VPs). It is therefore essential to know how to create a heterogeneous team to adequately exploit the skills of each character, so that the characteristics of each component are complementary to those of the companions. Each element of the group, in fact, has its own HP and MP bars at its disposal, plus a personal set of special techniques that are activated by spending MP: one is started automatically at the start of the game while the second, Special, is commanded by the player via Square, Triangle and R2 buttons. Then there are the Item Cards that improve the general statistics of the various avatars: however, only four can be equipped at a time, so you need to use a bit of strategy to exploit them at the right time. The combination of all these elements gives rise to challenges that are always exciting and quite varied in strategic terms: for example, Ringo has the ~Change Everything~ skill, which allows him to change the color of the Puyos and thus facilitate the elimination of a large block, but with the help of a card at the right time, he can also send discarded blocks to the opponent's table, significantly lowering their ~vital~ energy. The Overworld The ~technical battles~ can also be ~fought~ within the Adventure mode, so as to unlock cards that give special skills and options, and level up the characters' stats. Within the mode is Overworld, which resembles a sort of streamlined tabletop RPG, complete with a story. The worlds of Puyo Puyo and Tetris have merged thanks to a mysteriously powerful being known as the Dimensional Parasite. With this threat looming, Ringo, Tee and friends must traverse the world to pop the Puyos and free the Tetriminos to save everyone from a dark conspiracy. The adventure therefore takes place on a map with an isometric-like view, on which the character can be moved one square at a time, overcoming the various obstacles made up of opponents to beat and challenges to overcome. There are branching paths, optional levels, and side stories told through scripted dialogue screens where you can cross paths with other heroes to recruit to your party, and you can freely replay some points as you pass them for higher scores and rewards. best. In short, nothing particularly original, but the same fun enough to keep players busy for a few hours. As for the ~old~ modes, however, there is nothing new, since they have remained substantially the same, with Fusion, for example, which blends the classic mechanics of Puyo Puyo and Tetris and combines them with some new situations . In fact, the overall goal is always to blow up even more puyos and clear out more and more tetriminos. The situation is different for the online multiplayer mode, playable from 1 to 4 players, where the various competitive options already available in the previous title of the Puzzle League comeThree new leagues have been added, complete with leaderboards, namely Tetris League, Puyo Puyo League, and Technical Battle League. In short, a competitive space in which to compete with other enthusiasts and try to become one of the best players in the world.", "date": "2020-12-07", "grade": "8.3"}
