{"name": "Gun Valkyrie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gun-valkyrie_a.html", "text": "A fast impact game! Sure, Gun Valkyrie isn't exactly an old-fashioned shooter, as the 3D graphics imply the use of the third dimension. Let's put it this way, a sort of 3D Turrican! While the images might mislead you, Gun Valkirie is not a 3rd person adventure or Halo-like game. It's a shooter, full stop. There is little to think and much to act. You don't have to hide, you don't have to solve puzzles, you don't have to reload weapons or look for ammunition or medical kits. There are no friends who will come to our rescue. We will be alone, in the role of our alter ego, to vanquish hordes of enemies, with cannons with infinite projectiles, machine guns, and other devices of mass destruction. To make the action a little more varied, the programmers have provided the protagonists with a kind of jet pack that also serves as a protective armor for their bodies. Through this we will be equipped with powerful boosts that will allow us to fly for short distances, move quickly forward and backward, perform very rapid evolutions and dodges. Obviously the time will be limited to a few seconds but for example, once you get to the top it will be possible to launch yourself into the void and glide slowly with the engines idling, bombarding the entire area below. A somewhat ~arquato~ control! The control system is very complex. Not uncomfortable, but complicated. One trigger fires the jetpack, the other fires. The left analog stick is used to move while the right one to direct the gaze and therefore our shots. However, the combined use of the two levers allows us, for example, to move and shoot in a different direction than the one in which we are moving. Furthermore, always through the simultaneous use of the two analog levers, it is possible to use a smart bomb that will destroy all enemies in the vicinity, but will consume one of the two energy bars available to us. Arm yourself and not only with wisdom! The environments in which we will find ourselves operating will be the most diverse. We will go from external rocky stages to alien bases, with a frequent alternation of closed and open spaces.. precisely the cumbersomeness of the control system at the beginning may discourage the most impatient, because if in the first mission everything seems to go smoothly, already in the second between caves and narrow environments you often find yourself back against the wall without being able to free yourself. All it takes is a little training, but also calculating the level of difficulty which is not exactly low, someone could get bored or give up prematurely. And that would be a grave mistake because this game deserves to be played to its fullest. The technical realization is really excellent. Forget the silly comments about the fact that the frame rate drops from time to time (try to look at what happens and then you'll be able to tell me!!!) and that basically it looks like a port improved by dreamcast the graphics are heart attack. Textures, effects, fluidity. Everything is at Xbox level, with excellent definition and no sign of jaggedness. The 3d models of our heroes (a woman and a kind of samurai) are perfect and animated very well, as are the shocking guardians at the end of the level: huge and highly detailed. The surfaces of the rooms are never bare but rather always defined and retouched with bump mapping. In short, the feast for the eyes is guaranteed. Perhaps only the color palette is a bit monotonous, but it is more a personal consideration than a defect. The weapons are all devastating even if some are really too slow to use. The machine gun with which you can make real hecatombs is very funny. A few tricks! The sound settles on discrete levels, but sometimes tends to become boring, especially the music during periods of prolonged permanence in a level whose end you cannot see. Well, this is one of the biggest flaws of the game. In 99% of cases you will get stuck in a level until all enemies are eliminated. This means that if even one, miserable insect remains hidden in a corner of a level or behind a rock, you will have to find it by scouring the whole area meter by meter. A radar would have been useful in this sense, because the alarm beep provided by the game is not of much use, considering that sometimes it also reacts to invisible dangers (perhaps it signals enemies behind a wall in the adjacent room). Furthermore, the action is sometimes broken up unnecessarily, depriving the game of that frenetic pace that is only sometimes glimpsed. Often you will find yourself wriggling between dozens of enemies at the same time with the adrenaline skyrocketing between dodging and attacks, while sometimes there will be long sections with sporadic, somewhat monotonous attacks. It would be niceI help a little more balance in general. At the end of each mission it will be possible to save and based on the score and the demonstrated skill we will get points with which we can improve our equipment (hooks, boosts, shields). Everyone ready to play with the Valkyrie's gun? In short, if technically we are in full swing, in terms of gameplay a little something would need to be reviewed. Yet even so the title Smilebit, while not being able to boast the name of masterpiece, is confirmed as a top-level title, not free from defects but which will make the happiness of all those who, like myself, were waiting for nothing but to beat a little ' of laser cannon fire without thinking too much about anything else. A beautiful game, at times wonderful but definitely not suitable for everyone. But don't make the mistake of comparing it to Halo, a game with which it really has nothing in common. PROS: superlative graphics lots of action quite challenging CONS action not always constant sometimes frustrating cameras not perfect complex control system Exclusive Video 1 Exclusive Video 2 Exclusive Video 3 Exclusive Video 4 Exclusive Video 5 Exclusive Video 6 Exclusive Video 7 A shooter? After shocking us with Jet Set Radio Future, rightly one of the best games ever in recent years, Smilebit is back to producing something more classic albeit with its good dose of innovation: a shooter. With the advent of 32-bit machines, a genre of games, that of shooters was almost completely lost. Hyper-frantic games like the old horizontal or vertical scrolling shooters now seemed like prehistoric stuff. Luckily Smilebit, aware of the power of the black box, has decided to give new vigor to a genre that is now in disuse.", "date": "2002-05-27", "grade": null}
