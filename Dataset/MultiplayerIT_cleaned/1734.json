{"name": "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance-6.html", "text": "The technical realization The technical realization of Mortal Kombat is at a good level, with Midway developers who have been able to create a respectable graphics engine. With the transition from 2D to 3D, the graphics of the game have improved significantly: the polygonal models of the wrestlers are very well made, detailed and defined in every aspect, and even if not yet at the levels of Virtua Fighter 4, still able to pleasantly impress. A point clearly in favor of Mortal Kombat is the possibility of injuring one's opponent, with consequent contusion on the body and face. Also noteworthy is one of the most characteristic aspects of the series, the massive presence of blood on the screen, which will flow in rivers with each successful hit. The arenas and backdrops, on the other hand, are not particularly striking, however they are made with sufficient care and, all in all, they do their duty. Negative note for the animations: the movements of the fighters appear poorly coordinated and composed, an aspect that should instead have catalyzed the attention of the developers more. When compared to other games of its genre, Mortal Kombat, however, fails to live up to its competitors both in terms of characters and in terms of game environments. On balance, the graphics engine does not prove capable of fully exploiting the potential of Sony hardware, and the results are before our eyes. The technical realization If the graphics didn't completely impress, it is the playability that improves the fate of the Midway title: playing Deadly Alliance is really fun and rewarding, thanks to an immediate and direct combat system, where even the novice player will be able to feel at at ease. The Dual Shock 2 has fortunately been exploited properly: both the front and rear buttons are used during fights. With the front buttons you will perform the standard attacks, i.e. punches and kicks, which in turn can be differentiated into ups and downs; with the rear ones you will have the possibility to carry out a special attack that varies according to the character you use. Each wrestler is able to manage three different fighting styles, and you, by pressing the L1 key, can change it at any time. Of these three styles, one is accompanied by a weapon, which even if at first glance it might seem like an excellent incentive to gameplay, in the end it turns out to be decidedly penalizing. Sub Zero, for example, is able to stick an ice sword inside the opponent's body, thus causing a constant flow of blood, with a consequent decrease in the energy bar. An element that has always been characteristic of the series (and therefore inevitable in this chapter) is the possibility of performing fatalities at the end of the fight. Thanks to a precise combination of keys, our character will carry out a deadly move against the opponent, really violent and bloody. A striking example is Jonny Cage, who after throwing a punch in the stomach, smashes the opponent's head by grabbing his brain. The most sensitive people could be impressed by these scenes, which is why the title is not exactly recommended for the faint of heart. Overall, the Midway title is a mixture of technicality and immediacy, a compromise that will certainly entertain both fans of the genre and newbies. Even with regard to longevity, this title defends itself quite well: in fact, thanks to the Kripta and Konquista modes, the player will have many extras to unlock, with guaranteed fun for a long time. It must also be said that thanks to the Multiplayer mode, the longevity factor becomes almost unlimited: the challenges with your friends are always exciting, and the Midway title offers plenty of fun from this point of view. The sound effects that will accompany us during the game do not shine particularly, the music instead is normal, except for the soundtrack that accompanies the introduction, whose melody is extremely atmospheric. Comment One of the most famous fighting game sagas of all time is finally back, with a completely renewed graphic design and with a gameplay capable of entertaining any type of player. Overall an excellent fighting game, unfortunately penalized by a not excellent graphic design, but which we can only recommend without reservations, unless of course you are particularly impressionable subjects from massive doses of virtual blood. Pros: Fun and passionateionante Lots of extras to unlock Cons: Character animations Sound effects can be improved Let the fight begin As soon as the DVD is inserted into the console tray, the introduction movie to the game appears, in which we see Liu Kang intent on training after winning the last Mortal Kombat. A normal introduction, you might think, which instead reserves some surprises, given that the evil ShangTsung allied himself with the perfidious Quan Chi and, once they arrive on earth, they reach our favorite and eliminate him miserably. However, he is not the only victim of excellence of the two sorcerers, since Shao Kan, Emperor of the Outside World, to whom ShangTsung and Quan Chi swore loyalty, however lying. Thanks to the soul of Liu Kang, the two evil allies managed to awaken a large part of the Ancient Imperial Army, with the obvious intention of conquering the world. The legendary Rayden therefore decides to gather around him the best fighters in the world, in a desperate attempt to counter a situation that seems really critical. The Grand Master explains the situation to his students, concluding his speech with the sentence: ~We must stop this Deadly Alliance~. This is what frames the new Mortal Kombat, the umpteenth episode of mother Midway's fighting saga, which however promises to bring the series back to its former glory by presenting a completely renewed game structure, passing from 2D to the more modern and effective 3D. The main screen of Deadly Alliance offers a wide range of options: Arcade, Kripta and Konquista make their beautiful presence on the screen. In Arcade you will be grappling with the usual ~1 against 1~ battles, in which you will face different stages where you will fight against your enemy; in Conquista you will instead embark on a small adventure together with your character: a short introductory tutorial is the premise for the real adventure, in which you will have to achieve very specific objectives. The last of the main modes of Deadly Alliance is the Krypt, in which you will find 700 coffins full of interesting secrets and extras to discover. Each extra has its price to pay, which varies according to the coins. You are surely wondering where these coins can be won, right? It is fair to point out that once the game profile has been loaded and a mode between Arcade and Konquista has been undertaken, based on your results, you will earn coins of different colors, which will be useful for acquiring new and juicy bonuses regarding Mortal Kombat, such as extra characters, hilarious cutscenes and tips about the game.", "date": "2003-03-03", "grade": null}
