Well, the concept behind Unstoppable Fist is similar, although obviously you don't have to punch the touch screen of your iPhone, but simply touch the six portions of the screen for the character we control to hit the corresponding area. The narrative implications of the thing are explained in the animated introduction of the game, indeed in a humorous and bizarre way: our alter ego is a kind of blond super hero, extremely cool, who literally falls from the sky into three different locations, from gradually unlock, and there he has to face a decidedly inhospitable fauna. The first available scenario is a sort of junkyard, the second puts us in the middle of some Aztec ruins and the third on the bottom of the sea, in front of the remains of a ship. Each of them contains different enemies, but we soon realize that the variation is purely aesthetic and does not substantially affect the gameplay, which remains devoted to the more traditional ~button mashing~. Hits here, hits there How does Unstoppable Fist gameplay work? It's very simple: our character is stationary in the center of the screen while hostile creatures arrive from the sides, along three ~lanes~, and want to harm him. Depending on the enemy, the speed and resistance may be different, but the way to get rid of them is the same: touch the corresponding area of the touch screen to perform low kicks, punches and high kicks. Sometimes opponents approach from left and right at the same time, and in this occasion it is possible to tap both sides of the display to perform a ~double~ attack, while finally ~slides~ from bottom to top and from top to bottom they translate into as many special moves. The energy bar at the top shows us how much health we have left, health that we can restore by collecting certain objects. When the bar empties it's game over, and the survival-style approach means that you just stand there, hitting anything that comes your way, with a level of difficulty that gradually increases, trying to hold on for as long as possible. Already this type of structure, you know, does not excite us, but the problems of Unstoppable Fist are quite different. The first, more serious, is the almost total lack of impact, a fundamental element in a game based on punches and kicks: our character throws blows left and right, but you don't perceive a different sensation when he misses the target or when it hits it. The second problem, which is also quite serious, lies in the poor responsiveness of the controls: very often you touch a part of the screen but the character doesn't deliver the blow you expect, and so you suffer damage unfairly. The third problem concerns the repetitiveness of the action, intrinsic to the survival structure but particularly felt here. It's a shame, because from a graphic and sound point of view, the developers have done a good job, giving us a product that exudes pixel art and 90s atmospheres.", "date": "2012-08-03", "grade": "5.5"}
