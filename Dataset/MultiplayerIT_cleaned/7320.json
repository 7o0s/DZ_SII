Today, with Inazuma Eleven 3: Attacking Ogres!, we can only reiterate our perplexities in the face of the absurd policy with which the three versions of Inazuma Eleven 3 (precisely Lightning Bolt, Exploding Fire and Attacking Ogres !) have been proposed in Europe. The three titles are relatively mirror versions of each other that were released in Japan within a few months on the Nintendo DS. In Europe, the three games have been transplanted directly to Nintendo 3DS - with the only addition of a disappointing stereoscopic effect - three years after the original release and at a time when the success of the cartoon has run out. If we consider, then, that Ogre attack! is inspired by a feature film we have not yet released, you will understand that we are dealing with one of the worst omelettes in the long and sad history of the worst omelettes. Ogres Attack! is the victim of the absurd distribution of the three versions of Inazuma Eleven 3 The future is here Despite the football theme, Inazuma Eleven 3 is always a Japanese RPG that follows a tradition of exploration, long narrative sequences and random fights in its own way. The story is essentially the one already narrated in Lightning Bolt and Explosive Fire, with some changes especially in the initial and final stages of the adventure. In fact, the game begins by showing us a distant future in which Canon Evans, great-grandson of the historical protagonist Mark Evans, discovers the plans of the Ogre team intending to return to the past to prevent Mark and Inazuma Japan from winning the very difficult international soccer tournament called Football Frontier . While Lightning Bolt and Blast Fire respectively focused on the characters of Paolo Bianchi and Hector Helio, Ogre Attack! devotes numerous story sequences to defining Canon's character and enemies from the future. There is no more space for the ~supernatural~ teams of the other two versions (recruitable anyway) and also the introduction sung in Italian and some other fully voiced cartoonish cinematics have also been changed in accordance with the new story. Apart from that, the development is practically identical, despite some discrepancies in relation to the animated version of the franchise: Ogre Attack! in fact, it is inspired by the film Saiky gundan Ogre shrai still unreleased in Italy, which however is set during the first narrative arc of the anime. In short, for fans of the series, it is an excellent opportunity to get to know the characters and events that they may never see on television screens in our language. We must always bear in mind that Inazuma Eleven is a rather bizarre series, in which football is considered almost a religion rather than a sport: the impression, at certain moments, is that the series takes itself a little too seriously and that Level-5 fails to sustain the narrative without falling too childish. A very positive note, however, deserve the texts and the dubbing in excellent Italian. The 3D effect As with Lightning Bolt and Blast Fire, Ogres are on the attack too! offers a very light stereoscopic effect which benefits the general visual rendering in a very limited way and which can be easily deactivated without losing anything. The past as well Already on the occasion of the review of Lightning Bolt and Blast Fire we denoted a certain tiredness in terms of gameplay: Inazuma Eleven is a series which, unfortunately, from episode to episode, has proposed very few changes and novelties, ending up curling up in a compendium of mechanics always appreciable but now hardly surprising. This third episode, for example, gives players only a very few new mechanics that allow you to combine the efforts of the players on the pitch to break through the opposing defense and control the game more. For those who don't know how Inazuma Eleven works, it is easy to say: it is a jRPG that projects the mechanics of Japanese role-playing games into an urban and everyday context, and therefore the exploration of more or less vast environments in which it is possible to interact with NPCs, make purchases, open ~chests~ and so on. There's no shortage of random combat, but battles in Inazuma Eleven are soccer matches where the player's ~party~ goes head-to-head with an opposing team. Our players control themselves with the stylus on the lower screen, tracing their movements and tapping on othersplay on the pitch to pass the ball or ~engage~ in a match in which the best of the players involved will prevail. For this reason, it is necessary to manage the team strategically, selecting its members based on their unique skills and managing the equipment to upgrade them when necessary. There is also no shortage of special techniques that the characters show off in short and spectacular non-interactive sequences with an all-Japanese flavor. It's a pity that, at this point, the showmanship is no longer having the effect it once did, especially considering that this Ogre is also on the attack! is nothing more than a three-year-old title for the Nintendo DS released, in Europe, only for the Nintendo 3DS. Technically it is therefore a fairly antiquated product, decidedly out of place in the library of the new Nintendo portable. Fans of the franchise will also fly over its visual paucity, but how many of them who have already purchased at least one of the two previous versions will want to return to the field this time too?", "date": "2014-02-13", "grade": "7.0"}
