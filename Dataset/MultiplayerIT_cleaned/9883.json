{"name": "A caccia di rottami spaziali", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79042-trinity-universe-a-caccia-di-rottami-spaziali.html", "text": "Nippon Ichi, Idea Factory and Gust, three of the teams behind the fun Cross Edge (the others were Namco Bandai and Capcom) and several other excellent RPGs including Disgaea (PS2/PSP), Generation of Chaos (PSP) and Ar tonelico ( PS2), the latter made individually by each developer, return with a new common project, a typically Japanese role-playing game exclusively for PlayStation 3. Just with the aforementioned Cross Edge, Trinity Universe shares a certain indirect appeal both for the absolutely out of concept head than for the presence of characters taken from other famous video game series. In our case they come from the sagas of Atelier Iris and Disgaea (Violet, Etna, Flonne, etc). In a galaxy called the Netheruniverse where a large amount of objects of various kinds end up, from harmless ones such as chocolate donuts or portions of sushi, to larger and more dangerous ones such as buildings or wandering atolls, a central asteroid rises on which placed the city of Empyria. It is constantly threatened precisely by the elements mentioned above which risk colliding with it. Here also live the protagonists of the story, namely Kanata, descendant of a prestigious lineage whose task is to sacrifice themselves to maintain the balance of the Netheruniverse by protecting it from the pitfalls coming from other systems, and the Valkyrie warrior Rizelea who has sworn to defend her world and is therefore on the trail of Kanata, who just doesn't want to dedicate his life to the role that fate (and family) have assigned him instead. Precisely in the role of one of the two unlikely heroes, gamers can experience the adventure from two different points of view, given that Nippon Ichi, Idea Factory and Gust offer them the opportunity to interpret them both (one at a time and in different games) and have among other things two stories distinct from each other. Explore the Universe Trinity Universe as mentioned in the introduction is a traditional turn-based JRPG structured according to the classic canons of the genre, albeit with some slight modifications. Starting from the evolution of facts and situations which is different from other products of the genre: the adventure can be tackled in a more or less free way, i.e. without the constraints of Final Fantasy XIII, deciding for oneself which dungeons to explore and in which sequence. At least for the normal ones. In fact, some of them must be completed in order to advance the story but only in order not to lose the leitmotif of the narrative, characterized by an interaction with the other characters through dialogues that take place via texts and semi-animated manga-style drawings. For someone, these phases could represent a real trauma, perhaps given the excessive length and frequency. But on balance they can vice versa be appreciated by those who want to enjoy all the skits that the various characters will bring to life. But let's now see how it all works: from a main screen that represents the small universe of the game, you can choose which location to reach, whether the classic shops where you can stock up or the taverns or one of the many objects in orbit around the city, at least the largest , with related dungeon. Having made his choice, the user leads his party of four characters to explore the desired area in search of hidden objects and treasures, using when needed the appropriate search function and the related energy that produces a colored guideline up to the point where particular enemies or special artifacts are hidden. The color of the generated line changes according to the object found, for example in the case of a treasure it will be yellow while it will be white if the elements called Gravity Cores are found. Among other things, the latter must be destroyed to remove the object and its dungeon from Empyria. It should be noted that it is always possible to leave a place that is being explored simply by heading to the front door, even if sometimes you have to hurry as an orbital detachment from Empyria of the host structure can happen, with the risk of getting stuck there. To remedy the problem, however, there are particular elements used to anchor the dungeon to the city. The battles During the exploration phases there will logically be battles against very nice but fierce enemies. The combat system of Trinity Universe is based on random clashes and uses, as we mentioned at the beginning, a turn-based structure where, however, the action is regulated and speeded up by the possibility of directly managing attack or defense moves by quickly pressing the pad buttons instead of the canonical menus. From the combinationand some of them can then be developed a series of fighting game-style attacks including terrible group combos. This interesting novelty (for the style of the software houses involved in the project - Ed) introduced by the developers to revive the gameplay during the battles is in our opinion a point in favor of this production because it adds an element to the typical solidity and static nature of the turn-based system dynamic that embellishes and revives the clash phase. As does the other key element that regulates battles, i.e. the so-called Action Points (AP). These, represented with a number inside a circular indicator usually placed on the right of the screen, determine the type of action that a character can perform and are consumed precisely in relation to what is performed (a normal spell will consume a certain number, a combo many more, etc.). In some ways it is somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy's Active Time Battle. AP can also be accumulated by simply skipping one's turn, so that the next time it will be possible to have more and therefore perform even more powerful and longer moves, as well as special ones linked to specific weapon or character skills. Thanks to the system called Fury Chain by the developers, by pressing R1, the attack can be passed from one character to the next, so that they can exploit everything to perform a much more powerful move than normal. Furthermore, under certain conditions, it is possible to give rise to couple or team attacks. Everything else is unchanged: single physical attacks, spells and blows are performed during battle. At the end of the fight you are rewarded with items and bonus AP or HP points. Playstation 3 trophies The Trophies available in Trinity Universe are 37 in total divided as follows: 22 Bronze, 9 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum. To get them you have to meet the specific requests of the game such as for example creating at least 100 monsters or spending 100000G in shops to collect the simplest prizes, until you get the true ending or leveling all the characters over 100 and taking all the Trophies for the most valuable ones respectively in gold and platinum. A colorful world From a graphic point of view, Trinity Universe is certainly not to be considered a masterpiece. And perhaps we could not have expected otherwise given that the software houses behind this project have always favored gameplay and history rather than the aesthetic tinsel in their products. Focusing decisively on the proven design style that has characterized their works since the dawn of time. However, despite the general poverty of the scenarios in which the presence of angular and squared shapes prevails, and of the textures that certainly do not seem suitable for a production for PlayStation 3, the overall vision seems to work thanks to the choice by the graphics of a palette of very lively colors, to the variety of environments proposed and to the manga-anime style inherent in the various polygonal models, including the characters. The latter then boast discreet animations and splendid high-definition avatars that serve to represent them during the many dialogues of the game. As far as the audio sector is concerned, the title has excellent dubbing available in both English and Japanese versions, with the latter standing out over the other for quality, brilliance and effectiveness especially during the more comic skits, while the on-screen texts are available only in the language of Albion. The in-game effects are also good, while the soundtrack is, as almost always in these products, catchy and pleasant, with music that characterizes every type of environment (city, castle, spaceship, etc.) and that in the long run enters the minds and hearts of the players .", "date": "2010-07-26", "grade": "6.8"}
