So let's see how the fourth and most recent chapter of the series (already released on Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii) makes use of the new technology of the Nintendo hardware. Master of Puppets To find out everything about Just Dance 4, we refer you to our review of the cross-platform version, which also lists in detail the over 40 songs that make up the Ubisoft product tracklist. To celebrate its debut on Wii U, the title has been enriched with three additional tracks, namely Domino by Jessie J, Want U Back by Cher Lloyd ft. Astro and a cover of Ain't No Other Man. Let's immediately remove any doubts about the gameplay, which has not undergone any changes compared to the version on the old Wii: therefore you always dance holding the Remote in your right hand and imitating the movements of the silhouette on the TV screen, with the software giving a real-time assessment of each user's dance step. However, those who expected an improvement in sensor accuracy in this new guise of Just Dance 4 on Wii U are destined to be disappointed: the system continues to prove to be very approximate, a feature which, on the one hand, penalizes those who would really like to know if they danced well, on the other hand it constitutes a great push towards immediacy, which has always been the real queen of any self-respecting party game. Precisely the fact that it is a social game in all respects has prompted the Ubisoft developers to act in this direction also as regards the exploitation of the GamePad, which in fact transforms itself into an entertainment factor for non-users. directly involved in the dance. In fact, while a maximum of four players - obviously equipped with as many Remotes - can battle each other simultaneously with dance steps, any observers can use the controller for three distinct functions. The most banal, but not negligible, is the Karaoke mode, which causes the lyrics of the song currently being played to appear on the GamePad screen to allow those waiting their turn to accompany others with their singing skills. Maybe it's not the proverbial egg of Columbus, but it's still a nice element that fits perfectly into the carefree context of Ubisoft production. An assessment that can easily be extended to the second exclusive content of Just Dance 4 for Wii U, or rather the possibility of tracing writing or drawings on the touchscreen that will be shown in real time superimposed on the TV screen: this too is an assist aimed at lightheartedness, capable of making the act of meeting with some friends in front of the game more fun. The third and final feature is the one most linked to the playful sphere, and is the so-called Puppeteer mode: by making this selection from the list of songs, the user in possession of the GamePad has the option to choose the moves to be performed by the dancers, the all in an extremely easy and intuitive way. In fact, four silhouettes depicting as many dance steps appear on the controller screen at regular intervals, and you just need to tap on the desired one to see it transferred to the TV, ready to be repeated by the players. The icing on the cake is the ability to order other users to stop in a specific pose (also in this case chosen from four available) and then reward the person who is believed to have reproduced it better with a score bonus. In short, Just Dance 4 on Wii U certainly does not represent a product revolution that we all know by now, but the innovations introduced by Ubisoft to take advantage of the GamePad undoubtedly contribute to making this version even more devoted to party use than the others, although with a sop even for those who want to dance alone: it is possible to view the game in standalone mode on the controller screen and try your steps in another room, provided that it is close enough to the position of the console to guarantee signal stability.", "date": "2012-12-12", "grade": null}
