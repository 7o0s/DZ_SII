For this reason, the announcement of the arrival of XCOM: Enemy Unknown on iOS platforms left a little perplexed, despite the nature of turn-based strategy being rather inclined to the capabilities of the systems in question. If we then consider a sales price of  17.99, totally out of the standards we are used to on the App Store, it is clear that the 2K Games product must necessarily possess great qualities to be able to convince. Home phone XCOM: Enemy Unknown, for the uninitiated, is a turn-based strategy created by Firaxis and released last year on the market for PC, Xbox 360 and PS3; a product that had the great advantage not only of standing out for its quality, but also of being able to recover and do justice to UFO: Enemy Unknown, an extraordinary 1994 title by Microprose rightly considered a milestone of the genre and still remembered today as a kind of fetish from the fans. Since the conversion has returned the contents of the original almost intact on Apple platforms, we refer you to the relative review for all the relative details, leaving the analysis of the most important differences at this location. First of all, let's start immediately by indicating what has been sacrificed, with a list that is essentially limited only to the contents of the DLC and the multiplayer mode; among other things, as stated by the responsible team, for the latter it is a temporary absence that will be filled with a future update. Giving this promise for good, it can therefore be said that the contents of XCOM: Enemy Unknown are substantially identical also in this version. A remarkable result, which however translates into very substantial dimensions of the app: in fact, the download from the Store is about 2 GB, which becomes 3.23 once installed. It is therefore inevitable that the owners of 16GB devices are probably destined to find themselves in difficulty to make way for this battle between humans and aliens. However, once you have overcome the space problems and started playing, you immediately realize that the conversion work was not done lazily at all; on the contrary, the interface of each section has been revised in such a way as to adapt convincingly to the touch screen, consequently making the experience always rather fluid and pleasant. The writer has played and completed the title on Xbox 360, finding the control via pad slightly more precise and responsive, but in any case a little practice is enough to be perfectly at ease even in this version. The availability of executing various commands both through taps and swipes and with virtual buttons also allows you to freely choose the preferred solution for each user. Also in this edition therefore, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a playable, deep, balanced, long-lived and engaging title, one of the best turn-based strategies of recent times. That said, the adaptation cannot be said to be without flaws. First of all, there has been a notable and marked reduction in the graphic quality, immediately evident even to the inattentive eye; the biggest cuts concern textures and effects, but also the visual depth and the frame rate have undergone a scaling. It must be said that 2K Games clearly indicates that it is preferable to use ~at least~ an iPad 4, and in fact with older terminals the results can be problematic. The same iPad Mini object of our test, which as is well known shares a good part of the technology with iPad 2, has trudged a lot, inevitably reducing the quality of the gameplay. Much better on the iPhone 5 instead, which suffers (but not too much) from the small size of the screen; in this case, however, it must be considered that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a real leech for the battery, as well as not exactly the most suitable game to fill the 5 minutes in the mail queue. Finally, the instability of the app should be noted, destined to crash especially on less performing devices (read iPad Mini); a frustrating situation to say the least if it occurs in the middle of a mission. And some optimization and filing with the next versions will be necessary, because having to watch the introductory movie at every start is quite boring. The qualities of XCOM: Enemy Unknown have remained almost unchanged even on iOS platforms", "date": "2013-07-02", "grade": "8.2"}
