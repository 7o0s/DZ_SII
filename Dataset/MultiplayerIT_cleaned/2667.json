{"name": "Tekken Tag Tournament", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tekken-tag-tournament.html", "text": "A simple fighting game? As you will have understood from the introduction, this game has something special, either for the legacy it carries with it, or because it is the first episode of the series produced for PS2. And that it was developed for the latest Sony console can be seen right from the spectacular initial FMV movie (for which, according to the Namco programmers, it took 8 months of work ...): all the characters you will have at available from the outset they will be presented to you here in a very cinematic manner and it is no wonder that someone passing by your television screen mistakes that footage for a cinematic trailer. Nothing is given to chance and everything is perfectly realistic. After this pearl of programming we are at the main menu. The modes present are: Arcade, Vs Battle, Time Attack, Survival, Team Battle, Practice, 1 on 1, 1 on 1 vs, and, as usual, Option .. Those who have already played any fighting game will know that in the mode Arcade you have to go through a certain number of encounters to finish the game and watch the final movie. The same goes for TTT but the novelty it brings is having to choose two characters (the famous tag mode). You will therefore fight in each match (for a total of 8) against another pair of opponents and the defeat of one of the two will ensure victory. After the last match (where you will face the new character Unknown, who fights alone), you will watch the short final video of the first character you initially chose (very nice to see, in fact it uses the graphics of the game, but unfortunately sometimes stupid and nonsense). In Vs Battle mode you will choose two characters to use to face a human opponent. In Time Attack you will have to complete the game in the shortest possible time, always using two fighters. In Survival your goal will be to survive as many encounters as possible without having the opportunity to regenerate your energy each round (again you will fight with two characters). Practice will allow you to train using two fighters of your choice. Slightly different modes are ~1 on 1~, ~1 on 1 vs~ and ~Team Battle~: in the first two you will choose only one wrestler to fight respectively against the computer and against a human opponent. In Team Battle you can instead fight with a maximum of eight characters and a minimum of one. To all these modes will be added (thanks to victories in Arcade) also Theater, Gallery and Tekken Bowl. In the first you will have the opportunity to review all the movies of the game. In the second you can look at the images you have saved during the game. In the third you will have to choose two characters with whom you will play an improbable but very fun bowling simulator. The fights. As I have already told you, in TTT you will have all the characters that have appeared in the various episodes of the series at your disposal. But to get them all you will have to sweat a lot and the only way to get them in your character selection screen will be to complete the game countless times. In total there are fourteen secret characters which, added to the initial twenty, make a total of thirty-four. The twenty wrestlers you will have at the start are: Jin, Paul, Law, Lei, King, Nina, Yoshimitsu, Xiaoyu, Hwoarang, Eddy, Julia, Gun Jack, Jun, Baek, Michelle, Anna, Armor King, Ganryu, Bryan and Heiachi. Good connoisseurs of the saga will know that Tekken is, from a certain point of view, a soap opera: in fact, there are numerous kinship ties between the characters (for example Jin is Jun's brother, Kazuya's son and Heiachi's nephew) and others are instead linked by a strong friendship (Law and Paul). As the wrestlers increase, the simple initial plot will thicken and you will discover new background on the history and the bonds of the various characters. The new entry of this episode is Unknown, a strange woman always followed by the ghost of a wolf. This strange character will be able to use the moves of all the characters and will change the set of shots at each tag (that is, every time you make her enter the ring again). But what game is this? Here is the question that you will ask yourself more than once when viewing TTT. The graphic aspect of this title is something absolutely shocking. It's practically a movie. The characters are sublimely detailed and are all made up of thousands and thousands of polygons. Every muscle is perfectly real, indeed, just perfect. The faces are so detailed that they remain open-mouthed for a week. Facial expressions reflector reality so faithfully that all other games have to go into hiding by comparison. Every little aspect has been taken care of, from the shadows to the movement of the hair, from the clothes (also amazing) to the incredible light effects caused by the shots. And the backdropsprobably comparable only to those of a photograph. If for a moment you should stop playing, I strongly suggest you observe all the characters that are part of the backgrounds and how they seem to enjoy a life of their own. You will see helicopters taking off, beautiful waterfalls on the hills, boats, dozens of martial arts students training incessantly. Magnificent. The only comment that can be made concerns the non-perfect synchrony between the movement of the ring and the backdrops; but this is perfectly understandable, given that otherwise the arenas would have been too small to guarantee ample freedom of movement. It must also be said that TTT is the first game to use Anti-Alaising (which allows you to make the contours homogeneous without the annoying jaggedness), a function never used in a PS2 game (in fact this operation takes place via software, and not via hardware, which makes it a bit more complicated to program, but certainly not impossible). Finally, it is necessary to praise the excellent animations that embellish the whole. The Namco programmers have in fact used the Motion-Capture to be able to make every move of each character absolutely believable. The animations are those of Tekken 3 but I can assure you that on PS2 they have a different effect (everything, even the fingers and the hair, moves independently from the rest of the body). As far as sound is concerned, the effects of the blows are very exciting, even if they do not exactly reflect the real noises. The voices are excellent and spot on for each character (although it must be said that they are generally limited to simple verses). The music is not that of the previous Tekken but fits in well with the general atmosphere of the game (techno always has an effect in a fighting game). In conclusion.... Tekken is Tekken. You can finish it millions of times and maybe you will eventually get bored. But when a friend picks up the other Joypad, I can assure you that you will continue to play with it for a long time to come. In addition, the implementation of the Tag mode and a whole series of secrets (which you will discover by playing) will make the game almost eternal. I say almost because eventually someone will take you off the PS2 by force. So what to say in conclusion? Do you have a PS2? Buy Tekken Tag Tournament at all costs. Don't you have a PS2? Buy one and buy what I am not afraid to consider the best fighting game of all time. In conclusion.... Pros -Everything at the highest level Cons -Not recommended for those who have a very intense social life -Sometimes the endings are a bit disappointing The Iron Fist Tournament In the year of grace 1995 it made its first appearance, first in arcades, then on the first Playstation, a game destined to change the world of fighting games forever. The first of its kind to be three-dimensional and not based on ranged attacks as the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat sagas had done for years. A game that in a short time defeated the competition thanks also to characters with a strong charisma and a technical realization that was impeccable at the time. This masterpiece had a name: Tekken. The story behind Namco's most ambitious product was simple and obvious, as it is easy to expect from a fighting game: people of all ethnic groups and social status participated, for personal reasons, in the Iron Fist Tournament (the Iron Fist Tournament) , hoping to be able to avenge someone or simply become the champion of the tournament. The other two chapters of the saga were also based on the same story, but they took place later in time from each other. Thus the competitors aged and new ones entered the largest martial arts tournament in the world. And in this latest episode, we finally get a chance to see them all reunited.", "date": "2000-12-05", "grade": null}
