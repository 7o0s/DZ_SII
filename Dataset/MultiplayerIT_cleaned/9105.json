There is no software house that can resist you, and with good reason. It is after all one of the smartest and most proven ways to make money in the video game industry. Focusing on freeware has made some semi-unknown companies real powerhouses, and saved companies from the brink of bankruptcy. The system works so well that it has attracted the attention of some big fish. Very big... huge fish named Microsoft. As is well known, the American giant does not take it easy, and immediately decided to enter the arena with guns blazing by using a brand of considerable impact for its ~free~ project: Age of Empires. Considering that the series is one of the mainstays of computer strategy and still boasts legions of fans, there could not have been a better choice to churn out a hit. Expectations then grew further when development moved from Robot Entertainment to Gas Powered Games. The software house led by Chris Taylor has a respectable pedigree, and fans of the genre were thrilled to see what would emerge from their union with the legendary Microsoft saga. With such a deployment of forces in the field it was really difficult for something to go wrong, however Murphy's law teaches that one must never be too optimistic, and it is good never to forget it. In this specific case, Microsoft made the mistake of not fully embracing the free to play model, creating a freemium. If you frown when you read ~freemium~ it means that you know what we're talking about: they are titles in which the store does not offer side items or simple experience boosts, but real content packages, often significant. Free games more in name than in fact. Rarely have we seen masterpieces go this route. Will Age of Empires Online have made it the exception that proves the rule? Panta Rei If you have played the third Age of Empires game in the past, you will immediately feel at home in this online version of the game. Power taken from the latest titles in the series, in fact, the capitals are back: cities that develop outside the missions, grow with you and are to all intents and purposes a visual representation of your development in the game. In your capital you can build buildings with various functions, upgrade your troops, accept quests, and unlock branches in your technology tree. The resulting gradual growth of the empire controlled by you slightly diversifies the gameplay from previous chapters and adds a pinch of novelty to the formula. However, the wind of change brought about by this system disappears completely when you decide to start a mission. Once a task has been undertaken, gameplay immediately returns to the classic one of the saga. The economy is based on four different resources, food, wood, gold and stone, collected by the inhabitants of your village. During a game it is possible to move to a later era in order to make new units and structures available. Finally, as in any self-respecting strategy, the troops are divided up like a ~rock-paper-scissors~, with very marked strengths and weaknesses. Of course, they can also be grouped into numbered groups with the help of the inevitable ~ctrl + random number~ command. The tasks available are quite varied, but much shorter and easier than those proposed by the predecessors. You will find yourself facing missions whose objective is the total elimination of enemies, timed defenses of certain structures, rapid construction challenges, and the horde mode (which is nothing but a defense quest in which opponents attack in waves of increasing difficulty). However, the latter method is paid, and the need to shell out money is also closely linked to the basic tasks. Let's see why. We have your elite Mangudai. If you want to see them again, pay In the previous paragraph we talked broadly about the gradual growth system. This innovation brings the development of one's civilization to be similar to that of a RPG. With each completed quest you will earn experience which will allow you to level up, and money with which to buy new structures. Many of these buildings allow you to obtain raw resources that can only be used in the capital, and useful for creating equipment to deliver to your troops. Tools, resources and structure blueprints can alternatively be obtained by eliminating bandits guarding chests hidden in the various maps. The idea is good, and it gives players a reason to stick to the screen. There's just one tiny problem: you want to get themore rare and powerful weapons? Use special elite units? Own an army capable of making Alexander the Great's armies look like a softball team? You'll have to get the dough out. Unfortunately, the limitations imposed by the developers on playing for free are enormous, and Age of Empires Online just puts them in front of your eyes. For example, ranked PvP can only be used by premium users (a practically obligatory move, given the imbalances in strength due to the equipment), ditto the aforementioned horde mode, available in the form of a demo to be unlocked with money. Many blueprints obtainable during the campaign will not be able to be developed, and in some quests you will be allowed to use some ~super units~ only to then be informed that to reuse them you will have to pay for them. The problem wouldn't arise if costs were limited, but some of the available packs and timed season passes cost more than a full-price retail game! Honestly, a commercial model of this type doesn't seem smart at all. The project had the potential to stand on its own feet even with lower prices and less prohibitive limitations. The fact that of the four planned civilizations only two are currently available, Egyptians and Greeks, does not help. Low polygons, lots of charisma? Graphically Age of Empires Online isn't anything stunning, but it's still a pleasure to watch. Focusing on the cartoon style of units and structures has long been one of the best choices to lower the polygon count and maintain a commendable appearance. The assessment of the developers is understandable: by using a lighter graphics engine, the chances of spreading the game in homes are maximized. The sound is also good, with catchy music and units with unique phrases. Let's move on to the game servers which, although they have remained fairly stable during our experience, have shown some weaknesses from time to time. It takes some time to find matches in PvP and, in case you decide to tackle some missions in co-op with a friend, expect some slowdown too much. However, the longevity is remarkable. It will take you a very long time to reach the peak of your civilization, but be warned that it could be quite boring and repetitive for those not willing to spend. This is also due to the presence of elite variants of the quests (a monstrously more difficult version of the same, with huge and very resistant enemies), which add spice to the main campaign, but are almost impossible to complete without extremely rare power-ups and special units. Another point against the freemium system of the game.", "date": "2011-09-07", "grade": "7.0"}
