{"name": "Super Mario 3D All-Stars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-3d-all-stars-recensione.html", "text": "Our review of Super Mario 3D All-Stars must necessarily start by explaining the criteria we have followed to evaluate an operation like this, which are not at all obvious. The project was probably developed by NERD (Nintendo European Research & Development, based in Paris) and collects Super Mario 64 (1996/7), Super Mario Sunshine (2002) and Super Mario Galaxy (2007). It is a celebratory collection, so much so that it will only be available - even digitally - until March 31, 2021. Although it is legitimate not to agree, we have chosen to give priority (in evaluation) to the quality of individual games, rather than the value of their update. Unlike other sagas, Super Mario doesn't need to be relaunched: collections like this please Nintendo's pockets and the palate of fans, but the brand has no need to reach new generations through remakes. Having clarified this, it must be said that the quantity of modernizations is rather scarce. Even if we don't compare this operation to some recently seen remakes (such as Spyro: Reignited Trilogy), it was obvious that more could be dared. Updates of the controls aside, which we will discuss in detail shortly, on a visual level Nintendo has limited itself to raising the original resolution of the proposed titles. Super Mario 64 is playable at 960x720, whether docked or not, at a stable 30fps. Super Mario Sunshine runs at 1920x1080 on the TV, at 1280x1720 in portable mode, with the - very welcome - addition of 16:9 (absent in the original, of course). The exact same numbers for Super Mario Galaxy, which however - unlike Super Mario Sunshine - also goes to 60fps. In addition to these three titles, Super Mario 3D All-Stars offers the soundtrack of each one, which can be listened to in full even with the screen off (exactly as happens in Super Mario Bros. Ultimate). The quality of the tracks is identical to the original one, so the only ones orchestrated are those present in the Super Mario Galaxy OST. Which, by the way, was also the first Nintendo soundtrack recorded with an orchestra. Before starting the actual review of these three classics, a note on the absence of Super Mario Galaxy 2. It's a heavy absence, which Nintendo ignored during the presentation of the game. In our opinion, the choice was made because there were too many difficulties in adapting the control system. That title, in the numerous phases with Yoshi, took full advantage of the Nintendo Wii pointer: a system that, on Switch, only works well with unattached Joy-Con. In short, Super Mario Galaxy 2 could not have been played decently in portable mode, let alone with the Pro Controller. Nintendo would have had to make structural changes to the work, which would therefore have required a very different approach from the one taken during the development of Super Mario 3D All-Stars. super mario 64 GRAPHICS AND CAMERA Obviously, Super Mario 64 is the game that has aged the worst visually. Made all the more angular - inevitably - by the heightened resolution, he is part - indeed, he is the captain - of the generation which, more than any other, has become unpleasant in a few years. It has a certain vintage charm, but more (in 2020) cannot be granted. There are two other shortcomings that need to be mentioned. The first concerns the management of the shot: commanded by Lakitu - which remains, to this day, a beautiful narrative device - the camera is now inadequate. Not so much for the ~digital~ rotation, now managed through the right control stick (but identical to the original in terms of functionality), but for the very slowness of the movements, as well as for their imprecision. It was avant-garde at the time, now an antique. Conversely, we can't imagine a valid reason why Nintendo didn't port the game to 16:9; we have some suspicions, which we do not share due to lack of evidence. In any case, this was a feature that we would have expected, and that clearly separates Super Mario 64 from the other two titles. VIBRATION Still speaking of this particular edition, although translated into the languages in which the title was originally published (no Italian, therefore), it is based on a 1997 Japanese version of Super Mario 64, very little widespread, which already at the time included the use of the Rumble Pak. In short, the vibration you will feel was not created specifically to take advantage of the Joy-Con HD Rumble, but it too was imported from the last century. Better than nothing, anyway. THE GAME With these pain points made clear, we can't help but bow to Super Mario 64. It's miraculous how good it is twenty-four years later: moving around is still an extreme pleasure, and its controlsthey are deeper, more precise and more responsive than most contemporary works. Super Mario Odyssey itself, while faster and ~softer~, doesn't have as many nuances, from this point of view, as Super Mario 64. The level design is adamantine, practically perfect. It continually introduces new concepts and, in full Nintendo style, complicates and intersects them as time goes by. It is a pure and refined design, without unnecessary or unexploited content. There is not a single move or ability that is used only once, or in only one way, an extremely rare virtue, unknown even to some more recent Super Marios (again we mention Super Mario Odyssey or, to make a direct comparison, Super Mario 64x4). The fact that this game was designed and implemented without any model to inspire makes it all the more incredible. The last game officially directed by Miyamoto, and it shows: in every corner, in every trampoline, in every illuminated detail. Super Mario Sunshine GRAPHICS AND 16:9 We bet that Super Mario Sunshine, at least among fans, will initially be the most played one. It's the first time it's released in high resolution and at 16:9, but above all it's the first time we can play it without a GameCube. Graphically it surprised us positively: some things are now antiquated (we are still talking about a 2002 title), such as the lighting system, which would really flourish only in the next generation. But, in general, it is certainly not unpleasant to see. Which is surprising, given how much it was criticized - at the time - from this point of view. CONTROL SYSTEM AND CAMERA We immediately get to the focal point, the one about which everyone had their doubts: the adaptation of the functionality of the SPLAC 3000, which from here on we will define ~spray~. The GameCube controller had two analog triggers as backbones, L and R, with a very long stroke and with an additional final button, to signal the achievement of full power. The more R was pressed, the farther the sprayer, in its main function - that of throwing water like a pistol - reached; when they reached the end of the stroke, at the maximum range, Mario stopped, making it possible to direct the water at will. An inelegant but functional solution has been adopted on Nintendo Switch: by pressing ZR Mario sprays the water in front of him (running), while with R he stops and reaches the maximum range. A less fluid system than the original, but which, except for rare stars, allows you to fully enjoy the experience. It would have been better if there had been support for the gyroscope, which we are now used to for aiming. The control system, the one relating to the main movements of Super Mario, is perhaps the best of the entire series. Fast, soft, extremely malleable. This despite having fewer jumps than its predecessor and successors: the use of the spray bottle is essential to move, especially in the ~jet pack~ function, but in the beautiful sections without it - detached from the game world - the absence of jumps is noticeable typical of the series, such as the long jump. The camera was criticized at the time, and actually still has many flaws today: however, one cannot see how modern it is, and how much it has marked the subsequent evolution of this technology. Not by chance at the time it was presented as a ~free cam~. BETWEEN EXPLORATION AND LINEARITY Super Mario Sunshine is an exploratory 3D platformer, like Super Mario 64. It has fewer stages, and more stars (Sun Keepers, to be precise) in each stage. However, it marks a first return to linearity: each ~story~ makes the goal visually clear, and applies small or large changes to the morphology or contents of the level. This choice, together with that of Koizumi as director and the introduction to self-contained (and very, very platform) stages without a sprinkler, would have been fundamental for the birth of Super Mario Galaxy. The funny thing, in retrospect, is that Super Mario Sunshine had also postulated a totally different evolution for the series, more tending towards the open world: the adventure is set entirely on the Delfinia island, which has a precise spatial definition, so that from each stage it is possible to see, in the distance, at least one other. In short, if instead of Super Mario Galaxy (more linear), the saga had veered the other way, Super Mario Sunshine would still have acted as a forerunner. A LITTLE LONGER Not only does Super Mario Sunshine have an atypical seaside/tropical setting that pervades the whole adventure, but it also has a queer atmosphere that, honestly, we didn't remember. Koizumi likes to narrate, and here he does it a lot, much more than in other Super Marios (after all, he is the first one he directed): the incipit is long and with various cutscenes, with scit really does not adhere to the canonical spirit of the saga, which among other things cannot be avoided, including a sad monologue by SPLAC 3000 while, on Mario's shoulders, he is in prison. It's not necessarily a negative factor, but Super Mario must also protect those who just want to play, and here (from this point of view) the incipit is really too long. QUALITY In general, and here we close the Super Mario Sunshine topic, it's an atypical game, which doesn't have the charm of the collection companions. It wouldn't have been easy for anyone, after all, to find themselves between those two. However, Super Mario Sunshine could have been a beautiful game: the reason why it failed, unfortunately, lies in the haste with which it was concluded, to be launched as soon as possible. A development opposite to Miyamot's philosophy, which in fact has never been repeated. Up until the fourth stage and the boss it presents, following the flow of the story without looking for every item, it's a great game. Then it drops, quite evidently, to the point of proposing one last stage (and one last boss...) that is really careless. At the same time, trying to complete everything, many stories are not up to par, and the game reveals more and more how much it has been stuffed with fillers (of blue coins, in particular). It's still enjoyable to play, and essential for any fan of the saga, because it's a clear bridge between Super Mario 64 and the game we'll tell you about in the next paragraph. Super Mario Galaxy Super Mario Galaxy is the masterpiece of Yoshiaki Koizumi, perhaps the most important creative figure of current Nintendo; before making a career and taking on (also) managerial roles, he directed this last game. Which turns out to be extraordinary, in 2020, as much as it was in 2007: perhaps because few have followed its journey (probably few would be able to), but its interaction between platforms ~isolated~ in space, with fascinating gravitational alterations, it still remains astonishing. GRAPHICS Finally brought to high resolution, even in terms of graphics Super Mario Galaxy remains beautiful. Technically you can feel the gap with Super Mario Odyssey, but incredibly, in many respects (including Mario's animations), it's more enjoyable than Super Mario 3D World for Wii U. It helps a lot that it's the most ambitious episode of the saga, and at the same time more centred, on a stylistic level: having extremely heterogeneous settings, sometimes even within the same level, the visual glue of the work is given by the similar degree of deformation of the objects. In summary, from the stylistic code: the stones, the grass, the water and the hills evidently belong to the same world (Odyssey goes in the opposite direction, deliberately presenting ~annoying~ opposites, such as Pisces Smack swimming together with some.. . well, carp). CONTROL SYSTEM Super Mario Galaxy can be played in three ways. The best one, and with a large detachment, is to use the Joy-Con untied: in doing so, the right pad takes the place of the Wiimote, and allows you to point (albeit based on the motion sensors) towards the screen. The second way (in portability) uses the touch screen to emulate what was once done with the Wiimote: an uncomfortable setting, functional during calm selections, inappropriate for more dynamic ones (and they are quite numerous). The third relies on the Pro Controller, which simulates the pointer through the motion sensor, and is practically unusable. In summary: to be fully enjoyed, Super Mario Galaxy must be played with Joy-Con unattached. HISTORY The register of Super Mario Galaxy is joyful and, at the same time, melancholy. With this work Koizumi not only perfects his approach to the game design of the series, but also to the narrative component: the character of Rosalind, her relationship with the Lumas and the fairy tale (optional, this time!) that she tells are delicate and evocative . We will never know, but it is possible that Koizumi, who wrote the entire script of the opera in a single night, inserted something personal into it: whether or not this biographical connection exists, the research and affectivity of Rosalind has something touching. LEVEL DESIGN Super Mario Galaxy is a unique, wonderful, delicate game. Probably the high point of the whole series. In terms of level design, amazing things happen all the time: we are using very flattering terms, but we are not choosing them lightly. This game, born in 2007, deserves them all. It proposes something still astounding, a joyful oneiric dream due to the strangeness with which the platforms of the paths connect, naturally and fluidly.
