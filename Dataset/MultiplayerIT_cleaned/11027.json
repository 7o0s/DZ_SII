{"name": "Wii Music - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wii-music-recensione.html", "text": "Shoot for the moon, even if you fail you'll land among the stars Naturally the same concept of ~non-video game~ would require a much more in-depth treatment than that allowed by a review: to simplify the matter and extrapolate from the concept what is important to talk about Wii Music, we accept the common belief that this term indicates those titles which, by choice, do not propose a precise end and, consequently, a challenge to overcome. This is undoubtedly the most representative factor of Wii Music, namely the alienation from (almost) all the music games released so far, rejecting the concept of score, of the right or wrong version of a song, and placing the experience at the center precisely that note which, in the canonical version of a piece, should not have been there: interpretation, not execution. Naturally, when you start playing one of the fifty songs in Wii Music, you can activate a window that indicates the normal rhythmic and melodic path of a song: in this way you can easily play and record a version identical to the original one, without however remain minimally satisfied or amused. Repeating a song as it is in its initial form is a misunderstanding of the spirit of Wii Music, which encourages the player to take a tune, use it as a starting point, and deconstruct it at will. You can alter a composition more or less ferociously according to your wishes, but the prerogative to enjoy the game is precisely this, that is to put your ideas before the execution of the song itself: the objectives are not absent, they are almost infinite. The spectrum of variables that Wii Music offers can leave you helpless: you can play a song with instruments other than those originally planned, you can speed it up or slow it down, you can completely overturn it or even make it unrecognizable. For each composition there are six tracks, which can be recorded separately, activated and deactivated: two are used for melodic lines (main and secondary), two for percussion, one for bass and one for chords. Each of the six can be created using one of the sixty instruments included in the game, all of which can be classified into four types (guitars, percussion, winds and strings) and as many control systems: the synthesis works very well in most cases, and the emulation through wiimote and nunchuk of the real movements is not only immediate and engaging, but also very precise, perhaps too much. In Wii Music you don't create music from scratch, you ~just~ interpret it of the pieces in a free way, a structure is altered which, however distorted, is still present: therefore it is not possible to choose the notes to play, which however can be stretched, supported, tied, played more or less frequently or intensely. Although it differs from what we traditionally label as a video game, Wii Music does not completely deny its roots, placing itself in an equally distant position compared to music software: in fact, you cannot modify only a part of your performance if you are not satisfied he repeats everything from the beginning, thus risking ruining the good work produced up to that moment, in the name of the challenge and to the detriment of the quality of the piece. Once you're satisfied with your composition, you save it (in the form of an MTV-style video) and move on to the next one. Battery Through the Balance Board, used together with the usual wiimote-nunchuk coupling, you can play the drums in a very thorough way. Although it offers various satisfactions, this mode requires many sacrifices, as it is not easy to master, also due to precise but not very intuitive controls. For those who really want to create compositions from scratch (or almost) it is however an option to be seriously considered. Johann Sebastian Domisol Given the complexity of Wii Music, there is a tutorial that accompanies the user during the first hours of the game, providing him with lessons, initially mandatory, which range from the basic notions on the use of the instruments to the more advanced ones concerning rhythm, musical genres and song arrangement: in fifteen hours you will know how to elaborate a version of Beethoven's Ode to Joy with a typically Japanese stylistic code. Although deepening the title is extremely satisfying and fun, perhaps it is even more so to play in multiplayer, and record the various tracks that make up a song with a friend. For a neophyte, the learning curve is directly linked to the quality of one's ear: those who know how to play drums will know how to give rhythm to the song in a few minutes, on the contrary those with less experienceience or talent will require more time and greater dedication. The very nature of Wii Music precludes the experience for many possible buyers: it is suitable for children who use it as a toy and for those who want to experiment through the songs, cutting the category cleanly between the two, i.e. people who want to have fun or rest ~performing~ the classic version of a song without much mental effort. For all these people there are some well-crafted secondary modes (ironically inserted under the wording ~games~) which however by themselves do not in the least justify the purchase of Wii Music. Among these, the most original is certainly the one that puts the player in the role of an orchestra conductor, in which you have to move the remote control up and down, more or less intensely according to the situation. Another mode uses the structure made famous by Guitar Hero, only rather than playing a guitar, you have to shake bells in time; the last one, more akin to the Wii Music concept, is represented by a sort of musical quiz that tests the player's ear. Miyamoto's role We often tend to attribute the paternity of any Nintendo production to Miyamoto, whether it be Zelda, Mario, Wii Sports or Fit; although it may seem surprising, the famous game designer has been more involved in Wii Music, both in the design and implementation phases, than in more traditional projects such as Mario Galaxy or Twilight Princess. Not only is he of the ~old guard~ Nintendo fully committed to Wii Music, as the entire project has been produced and closely followed by the phenomenal Takashi Tezuka (author of Super Mario World and Yoshi's Island, to name two), and by Katsuya Eguchi, father of Animal Crossing; in short, tradition in the name of innovation. Splints Wii Music isn't perfect, indeed, it has several flaws. The soundtrack is too focused on uninspiring popular songs, which could have made room for more pieces borrowed from classical music or jazz; given the essence of the game, however, this aspect does not affect the quality of the work too much, given that you can take a piece, even the most banal, and blend it at will. The same thing cannot be said for the quality of the sound samples: forced to use midi to guarantee a high degree of musical malleability, Nintendo could and should have chosen less primitive samples anyway. Some instruments suffer little, others, like the saxophone, lose much of their beauty, and it's a real shame. The graphics themselves are rather poor, like almost all the works that focus on the enhancement of the Miis: some stylistic choices are valuable, such as the characters of the Domisol band or the direction of the videos, but every now and then cloying and not very smooth details appear , which undermine the aesthetic cohesion of the game. The only, huge, unforgivable flaw, however, lies in the unstructured online: you can exchange (and edit) videos with users on your friends list, but you feel the lack of a common server, where you can observe the compositions of talented strangers and enter your own creations, especially in an era now dominated by the personalization and sharing of content.", "date": "2008-11-24", "grade": "8.5"}
