{"name": "Rescue Party: Live!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rescue-party-live-recensione.html", "text": "Rescue Party: Live!, the first game by Tag Studio, published by the Italian publisher 505 Games, is available on Steam from 13 January 2022. In the role of a firefighter, we'll have to fight against natural disasters and accidents of various kinds to save as many lives as possible, both alone and in cooperation. Here is our review of Rescue Party: Live! Gameplay One of the first levels of Rescue Party: Live! Let's get straight to the point. Rescue Party: Live! is sort of an alternate version of Overcooked!. Simplifications are never the best thing, we know, but if you want to quickly understand the type of product you'll find yourself in front of, thinking about the Ghost Town Games game is the quickest way. In each level it will see us struggling with the rescue of injured people, following an accident. Most of the areas will be of the type ~Save as many people as possible in the time available~, with the aim of getting enough points and reaching the three Stars. The mechanics are similar to the source of inspiration: there will be some raw materials (our ~ingredients~) and we will have to use them to create (at workbenches) the tools needed to heal the wounded (the ~dishes~, continuing with the metaphor ). Each wounded requires various items and, in the end, must be transported to the ambulance, which will be more or less far from where the character is. The whole adventure is made up of about thirty levels, divided into 6 thematic areas, within which we can play starting with a minimum of two characters. ~Characters~, not ~players~, as Rescue Party: Live! - like its source of inspiration - allows you to play the entire campaign in single player. Given its setting, however, it is essential to always have two characters on the screen, to be controlled intermittently to carry out all the tasks in the best way. The solo experience is obviously very different from the multiplayer one and is included so as not to deny anyone playing access to the game, but of course Rescue Party: Live! must be considered as a cooperative game. However, the single player was created with a minimum of knowledge of the facts, given that the number of points necessary to obtain the Stars decreases. At the same time, however, there are levels in which coordination between players is fundamental to say the least and there is the risk that alone it will be very difficult to obtain even just one Star. Basically, if you don't have friends available, we can already tell you that this is not a recommended purchase. Variety and originality A level with a pipe system for moving objects Rescue Party: Live!, as you may have already understood, is not particularly original. Comparison with Overcooked! it is impossible to avoid and the game does not come out on top. First off, at Rescue Party: Live! it lacks that slight madness of the culinary game and that stylistic variety that makes the direct competitor always fresh and pleasant. The limit is also determined by the theme of the game, which ~forces~ the developers to propose environments that are visually of little impact and all too similar to each other. The variety arrives, at least, at a playful level, thanks to some interesting finds. Each level, especially after the first area, always offers some kind of unexpected event that changes the cards on the table. Sometimes the water level rises and changes the shape of the land, other times waves of water arrive and wipe out all the available resources, or the resources to treat patients are parachuted into the middle of a wolf-beaten area, that need to be scared off with a lighting system that needs to be replenished with petrol on a regular basis. There are various unforeseen events, although unfortunately sometimes a little frustrating, given that they risk blocking the gameplay, waiting for the level to become accessible again. Even if it is rare, there are situations in which we can do nothing but wait a few additional seconds and, faced with a fairly pressing countdown, the impression is that it is an unfair punishment, which will prevent us from obtaining that third coveted star. A crumbling structure from Rescue Party: Live! We also add the fact that sometimes the controls are not comfortable and we find ourselves wasting a few seconds to be able to interact with an object that is in front of us and should be easy to grab. Finally, compared to Overcooked!, there is a greater focus on survival. Unforeseen events can make us ~die~ (respawning is quick, but each death causes us to lose points) and, if two characters use dash (that is, the fastest way to move), while they are close together, they risk being stunned and losing precious few seconds.Rescue Party: Live! ~punishes~ those who play very carelessly. The relevance of these problems is linked to the type of approach. If you play to be competitive then you might be annoyed by some edginess in Rescue Party: Live!, but if you want to play co-op with a group of friends without worrying too much about the score then it might be interesting. In any case, our advice remains to take a look at Overcooked first! 2 in case you haven't played it. A swamp in Rescue Party: Live! We also point out that a cooperative tournament mode is available, which unfortunately we have not been able to try due to the lack of online players in the pre-launch days. This mode allows you to unlock new cosmetic items for your character. Some cosmetic items, such as new characters, are also purchasable with in-game currency, which is earned by completing levels in the main campaign. Finally, on a musical level the game is somewhat annoying. Level jingle is extremely repetitive and pressing - we found ourselves setting it to minimum very early on. At least, playing in co-op, what matters most is hearing your friends through headphones. We also point out a graphic detail: the game is basically set up to show writings on the screen, some themed news ~flash news~ with the saving in progress. However, these appear everywhere on the screen, invading it. They're one of the worst ideas in the game (in fact none of the promotional images include them) and, fortunately, they can be deactivated in the options menu: we advise you to do it immediately upon launch.", "date": "2022-01-14", "grade": "7.5"}
