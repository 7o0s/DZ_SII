Signed by Digital Tales, the reduction for iOS of the simulator developed by the Italian team Kunos Simulazioni immediately makes some concepts clear and it is therefore difficult to formulate incorrect interpretations. Firstly, we are talking about a premium production, on sale on the App Store at the price of only 4.99 and for this reason devoid of any mechanism comparable to the much widespread and opposed freemium model: there are no microtransactions, and so the progression that characterizes the long career mode is devoid of problems relating to balancing nor does it present sudden paywalls. Second, the move to mobile has led developers to make the experience substantially more permissive. It's easy to realize this: just try to take a curve without significantly reducing speed and without using the ideal trajectory, which in the standard edition of Assetto Corsa translates into a practically certain spin. Finally, and here we enter the field of this reduction, the numerous layouts available for the touch controls do not in any way include the possibility of using the manual gearbox, the support for the Bluetooth controllers is lacking and even disadvantageous, while the aforementioned career is not accompanied by a possible mode multiplayer. Structure Assetto Corsa Mobile, an attempt to overtake when cornering Let's start with the numbers, because for a price of only 4.99 euros, as mentioned, Assetto Corsa Mobile definitely offers a lot of substance. The core of the experience, i.e. the career mode, will in fact see us compete in nine real circuits (Imola, Brands Hatch, Barcelona, Mugello, Vallelunga, Red Bull Ring, Silverstone, Laguna Seca and Zandvoort) and in the context of five different stipulations, six also considering normal practice on the track. The stipulations in question range from the traditional race to the time attack, from the checkpoint-based endurance race to the way in which overtaking gives extra time, to finally arrive at the test in which speed cameras are used to calculate the maximum speed reached inside of the track and decree the winner. The progression is traditional and is based on the conquest of a certain amount of trophies in order to unlock the next tournament: there are sixty-three in all. Gameplay Assetto Corsa Mobile, cutting the track involves a short penalty Then, obviously, there is the fleet: Assetto Corsa Mobile includes fifty-nine official cars, belonging to brands such as Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Ferrari, BMW, Lamborghini, Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes, McLaren, Lotus, Audi, Mazda, Maserati, Pagani, Porsche and Praga, reproduced with care and customizable in terms of livery (there are over five hundred available, also unlockable), all characterized by a different behavior on the road. The growth of experience, understood as the test of increasingly powerful and therefore nervous cars, it seemed to us to have been done very well, hand in hand with a set of electronic aids that can actually simplify driving to the point of making it even banal: from the brakes to the assisted steering wheel, passing for the ideal trajectory and electronic aids, there really is everything you need to nanny during the first few hours of the game. Assetto Corsa Mobile, the cockpit view is one of six available However, it is inexplicable how support for Bluetooth controllers is only partial, with the ability to use the analog stick and triggers, but not to control the rest of the interface during the race. Furthermore, dead zones and ~tapping~ prove to be the archenemies of performance: driving with touch controls and the accelerometer for steering will have you crossing the finish line with several seconds of advantage. The artificial intelligence of the adversaries, then, often produces results that are to say the least unexpected. Furthermore, there is the question of the manual gearbox which is completely absent as an option: an inexplicable choice, given that the automatic tends to fall asleep (especially with cars less performing) and the alternative would have made it possible to get more inspiration when restarting, engaging the right gear and keeping the revs up instead of relying on a mix of electronics and visual indications (those for braking, in this case) which often turn out to be imprecise . Technical realization Assetto Corsa Mobile does not boast particularly sophisticated graphics If it is true that Assetto Corsa has proved to be of great depth in terms of technical realization, in particular on PC, the reductionand mobile unfortunately compromises from this point of view as well. The developers set themselves the goal of a frame rate that almost never drops below 60 fps, but to achieve it they cut a lot of things and the results show. We therefore have some excellent cars which, however, do not boast convincing, well-represented circuits but with desolate scenographic contours to say the least. A decent rendering of the weather, but the rest is little stuff, especially when compared with the most spectacular racers currently available on iOS, which also have adjustments capable of increasing the visual quality that are completely missing here. Lastly, the music seemed a little anonymous to us.", "date": "2021-09-06", "grade": "7.4"}
