Given the ~touch~ nature of the minigames, the DS conversion must have seemed natural, and was rewarded with two sequels and over a million cartridges sold. Is all this enough to justify a fourth episode? Let's see it together. No news, good news? From the point of view of content, the title does not differ from its predecessors; 20 mini-games, just like the last two episodes, divided into 4 categories: Strategy, Action, Puzzle and Cards. The games are minimally retrieved from past iterations, while as regards the novelties we are still faced with reworkings, not to mention real clones, great classics or concepts that appeared in competing productions. Examining everything a little more in detail, in the Strategy section we have Boxdrop in which we have to stack crates on 4 columns, each one bearing a number so that the sum is equal to 32, Pharaoh's 9 which is none other than the classic Tris typically found at the bottom of a chessboard, and Super Boxxi, Coco Loco, Draggle Drop and Monster Madness which are all variations on the theme of associating three or more of the same shapes/colors to clear them from the screen. Among Action games, Vinci-Ball stands out for being a clone of the classic Breakout, Dodge Bull and Feeding Frosty will see us grappling respectively with a bullfighter and a snowman to control to avoid obstacles on the screen, and Tricky Fish takes up an unforgettable minigame from the DS version of Super Mario 64, in which, by touching it, you had to make the dear plumber bounce so as to always keep him in the play area. In the Puzzle category we find Super Cell Chaos, which requires us with a single touch to unleash a chain reaction such as to eliminate a certain number of elements, Tic Tac Trivia, the childhood thread of all of us associated however with questions on various topics ( localized for the Italian culture), Sudoku6 which needs no explanation, Quik Match which is a revision of Shanghai, Ink Rally which takes up the main theme of Kirby and the Dark Design, and 11 Ball which foresees the association of those billiards whose sum is 11. Finally, for the Card games category, as well as three reworkings (two solitaires and a game for two) of the theme of discarding the card of a higher or lower unit than the one ~on the ground ~, there is Cattle Drive which requires a minimum of knowledge of poker and its winning combinations. Mini-game or mini-game? The quality of the minigames present, understood as a realization, is rather constant, all the concepts are made discreetly and with sufficiently reactive controls; personal tastes are therefore decisive in establishing which are the best games for each user, and out of 20 different activities present, although some are very similar to each other, it will not be difficult to find a good number of them on which to apply with real pleasure . Unfortunately, however, practically all mini-games have a time limit which does not allow you to go very far even reaching high levels of skill; although this makes sense from the point of view of online rankings (already present in past editions and therefore, although certainly a positive element, by no means definable as new), it is still a pity that the programmers have not thought of adding a mode ~ free~ at least for some games, which would have greatly helped the longevity. Furthermore, we have noticed a certain tendency to take on extremely succinct and cryptic tones in the in-game explanations of the various games, which are instead detailed in the manual, which contrasts a bit with the immediate nature of the title. Absolutely unforgivable, then, the very little weight given to the multiplayer component: the DS Exchange mode indeed allows you to alternate the commands, but if you want to play each with your own console (and contemporaneity makes much more sense in this kind of game), only three minigames - Quik Match, Spider Kings and 11 Ball - are available. The ~Connect~ suffix of the title actually comes not from the multiplayer, but from the possibility of connecting your Facebook and Twitter profile to the official site of the game, in order to publish the results obtained in real time; an option that is certainly nice but which does not affect more thanmuch on the appeal of the cartridge, while the Trophies to be unlocked by achieving certain results in each game are worthy of more note. Finally, DSi owners will be able to take a photo to personalize their profile even more. Last very fast note for the technical department, which reveals itself without infamy and without praise in the interface and in the sound in general, to reach even good level peaks in some mini-games characterized by the presence of many elements and a large number of colors, even if the graphic style used could be indigestible to some players.", "date": "2011-02-09", "grade": "6.4"}
