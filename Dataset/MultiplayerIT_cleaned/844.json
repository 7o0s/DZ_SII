{"name": "The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-incredible-hulk-ultimate-destruction.html", "text": "Peaceful Encounters These are the premises of the convincing - albeit not very developed - plot of The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, which this time is fortunately not as invasive as in the previous tie-in. In fact, if in that case the player was forced to face boring and approximate stealth sections in the role of Bruce Banner, in this new title all the attention is focused on the green beast and his ability to destroy everything that comes his way. The vast majority of the playful emphasis in the Radical creation is in fact placed on combat and on the obliteration of elements of the scenario, which are different and whose role within the game economy is more important than one would think. But let's go in order: The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction could be described as a modern three-dimensional scrolling beat'em up, set in two large free roaming areas (the city and the badlands) within which our green beast is called to carry out about thirty missions with objectives that are actually somewhat limited: for the avoidance of some exceptions, the game almost always asks the user to go from point A to point B and there destroy a particular thing, be it an enemy, a building or other. However, it is the way in which such feats are performed that makes the objective modesty of the play structure of the product more tolerable (at least initially). Hulk is in fact equipped with a vast series of offensive moves, divided between simple but spectacular physical combos and between various interactions with the numerous elements of the scenario. In addition to being able to pick up and throw substantially every object that comes in his hands (trees, cars, rocks, etc.), the Hulk is also capable of exploiting some of them to ~create~ real weapons: therefore, by splitting a truck in two, they will obtain picturesque metal gloves, while from batteries of missiles and from spherical signs of petrol pumps it will be possible to obtain respectively a rocket launcher and a deadly bowling ball. And these are just a few examples of the abilities that can be unlocked by spending the points earned by the amount of destruction caused. When you say incitement to crime, in short. Green is beautiful As mentioned before, however, the amount of moves and the possibility of interacting with the scenario are not entirely sufficient to keep the level of fun high throughout the course of the game, which is rather short (less than ten hours). A relief in this sense is represented by the numerous Challenge secondary missions scattered within the two large levels: these are sub-quests that reward the player with considerable amounts of points after passing certain tests, such as launching the pickup truck, bowling with cars instead of pins, golf with a crane as a club, and so on. All very nice, of course, but the substance remains of an actually somewhat limited product, which seems to live on its spectacular and noisy look. Furthermore, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction does not exactly prove to be the best in terms of attention to detail, with a control system and cameras that make your nose turn up a bit and with very little menu and loading tricks orthodox. All in all, venal sins, which however combined with the limits described above considerably slow down the rise of the Radical stock towards higher valuations. From a purely technical point of view, however, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction does a more than fair job, succeeding above all in the creation of vast scenarios full of enemies to face and objects to collect and/or destroy, all sacrificing little or no nothing on the framerate altar and offering a clean and pleasant cosmetic to the eye. Particularly convincing are the modeling of the green protagonist - also equipped with really well done animations - and the effects of the blows of the same on the scenario, with holes, explosions and anything else to mark the passage of the beast. The in-game sound is also good, as are the music that accompanies the action, while the Italian dubbing of the cutscenes is certainly not among the best ever heard. Comment The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction is a pleasant and fun title, spectacular for how well it manages to bring the destructive fury of the green beast to the screen and certainly commendable for the amount of moves and Challenge missions made available to the user. Technically valid, however, the Vivendi Universal product definitely shows the side in some aspects, stopping at an overall assessment that is only discreet. Alongside some uncertainties in terms of canvas managementcamera and control system and absolutely questionable solutions regarding menu screens and loading, the biggest limitation of The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction is certainly represented by its intrinsic repetitiveness, moreover accompanied by a rather reduced longevity. Pros: Technically sound Very fun in the first period Large amount of moves and special abilities Cons: Objectively limited game plan Short longevity In the long run repetitive After the non-exciting tie-in of Ang Lee's film on the green giant, Radical Entertainment returns to deal with Bruce Banner's alter-ego with this The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. Unrelated to obligations of loyalty to the aforementioned film, the new born in the Vivendi Universal house draws from the fertile ground of comics production in terms of storyline, with characters certainly known by fans such as Dr. Samson - faithful friend of Bruce - and the evil spy Emil Blonsky. And it is precisely the latter who kicks off the plot of Ultimate Destruction, setting fire to Banner's refuge and himself coming into contact with the deadly gamma rays...", "date": "2005-09-12", "grade": null}
