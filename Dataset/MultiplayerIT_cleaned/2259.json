CrossCode: A New Home is the team's definitive declaration of love for the world that they themselves have created and also for everything concerning the idea of community and sharing an online title. The original CrossCode has become a cult over time, thanks to word of mouth and the awareness of an extraordinary project created with almost maniacal care. After spending several hours with this additional content it is therefore time for the review of CrossCode: A New Home. We are pleased to tell you that we not only recommend it, but candidly admit that we were also excited. The history of CrossWorlds CrossCode: A New Home: an exploration phase As we have already mentioned and as you can explore in our review of the base game, CrossCode is set in an alternative future during which a company has managed to create a real virtual world, using a small moon purchased by the company itself as a ~field game~. In a sort of hybrid between Ready Player One and Sword Art Online, game participants use a particular and very expensive hardware to transport their psyche inside an avatar, which will act as a character in the world of CrossCode. As always happens in these cases, all that glitters is not gold and the plot is divided between intrigues of power, characters addicted to the game itself and a series of questions that remained unresolved for two and a half years for the protagonist herself, Lea. After finding herself in the game afflicted by amnesia and also thanks to the problems of the module dedicated to communication, the forty hours necessary to close the main campaign have been one of the biggest surprises on the independent scene of the last five years. CrossCode: breathtaking views To start A New Home, this is the title of the DLC just released, it is necessary to have completed the campaign, precisely because chronologically the new events represent a real sequel, bringing Lea back into the game after the forced disconnection. Far from the truth that she has been looking for for so long, she finally has a new opportunity to close the accounts, but ends up leaving some subplots a little too far which, despite the important amount of hours of the DLC, are not closed entirely on duty. A trifle, especially when compared to the usual sociological and damned current issues that make CrossCode an important project both on a playful and narrative level. It always has a certain effect to see how artists of this caliber are able to bring out emotions and feelings , as well as reflections and positions also using only a medium such as pixel art, without even recorded voices. Adventures like To The Moon or, albeit in a different way, all-encompassing experiments like an Undertale come to mind. From this point of view, A New Hope, as well as the basic adventure, also hits hard and makes you think, giving even more value to those players aware of the meaning of sharing. We are facing the end of a splendid journey that we will always carry with us and that we recommend everyone to experience. A DLC full of content CrossCode: A New Home: There will be a mix of old and new glimpses in the game For those who haven't experienced CrossCode at the time, we'll try to summarize the experience. It is an action rpg that bases all its gameplay on frenetic and deep fights, made up of attacks and dodges, as well as different fighting styles, all interspersed with important and articulated puzzle phases. These two elements, so different and so difficult to amalgamate, on the contrary represent an almost perfect union, even where the latter tend to discourage however long-winded and intricate. The guys from Radical Fish Games, a very small German team that is dedicating body and soul to this project since its foundation almost ten years ago, they have always spoken of themselves as maniacs of detail and this element perfectly explains what CrossCode is. Any element involved, even the less articulated and interesting ones, brings with it a level of attention that is almost obsessive. The animations, the menus, the research into aesthetics and the attention given to the bosses are just some of the little things that have made CrossCode great in these two and a half years. In this A New Home really represents a new home, which does not improve what it already good was present in the original and which even exaggerates in some elements, creating some small smudges due precisely to the exaltation and ambition. This however notit invalidates the final result of a DLC that has an incredible amount of content, especially in relation to a price that dwarfs its competitors on the market. CrossCode: the shot will be your best friend Over the course of the ten or fifteen hours that you will need to complete it (all based on your familiarity with puzzles) you will be able to visit new areas and a gigantic new dungeon, which alone represents a good half of the experience and which it collects all the aspects that have made the CrossCode gameplay great. It is no coincidence that the developers themselves speak of it as the greatest dungeon created for their work. On closer inspection, the structure is closer to a series of challenges in a long sequence, with the sensation in some moments of being faced with a content that is slightly disconnected in its entirety, but which in any case will require the maximum of your experience and will allow you to enjoy really full of everything you have gained in the previous hours. The assist mode comes to the aid of less savvy players, added shortly after the launch of the game, it allows you to lengthen the time available to complete the puzzles and to facilitate general experience, which in some moments could really jeopardize your patience. Speaking of content, you can easily add to the general calculation a series of new secondary missions, some new NPCs, a completely new ~social~ area in which there are also some vendors and a handful of extra musical pieces, less inspired than the originals but still catchy.", "date": "2021-03-08", "grade": "8.5"}
