{"name": "Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter-recensione_a.html", "text": "Heavy Fortunately Ubisoft has taken a few steps back from the second chapter (a few lines ago I wrote that it's bad, but why not repeat it in this parenthesis too?) and finally we are back to breathing some of the magnificent atmosphere of the first episode. But I'm running too fast, as QuakeMan said before he fell off his bike. In the meantime, it must be said that the PC version is graphically and conceptually closer to that for Xbox 360 than to that for the other consoles (ugly, indeed). This means that the visual aspect is well-kept and that the graphics engine is able to show many next-gen effects (which in a few months will no longer be so much next). We are not here to list them all for decency but we can say that the result is truly remarkable, especially if you have a card with 512 MB of memory, since in this way you can activate the higher resolution textures, which greatly improve the appearance visual. However don't worry, GRAW is splendid on a graphic level even with medium resolution textures that allow you to enjoy all its realism without making the absence of the extra feature feel too much. Of course, all of this Manit's assets are paid for in terms of performance: the graphics engine is very heavy and, even on highly pumped computers, it is never 100% fluid, often lavishing annoying slowdowns that are difficult to explain. It is impossible not to notice how much more could have been done in terms of optimization given that if you don't have a super computer, you risk having to cut most of the details to get decent fluidity. The structure of the control system is similar to that of a normal FPS, with the addition of some commands to manage your colleagues. As in the first episode, we will have a tactical map available to give orders and view the mission area from above. Team management is simple and effective even if, it is fair to say, most of the time you will have to rely on the AI, given that the orders that can be given are vague and are often disregarded by personal initiatives (which perhaps aren't such... but I cannot consider differently the cases in which a ~ghost~ has decided to go around a corner on his own business, being riddled with bullets by a passing rebel). However, by installing the patch promptly released by Ubisoft, in the days immediately following the release of the game, some AI problems are resolved and it is possible to keep the exuberance of our men at bay by limiting their suicidal strategies. Finally the action The action is the classic one of the genre: slow, meditated and made up of cadenced movements aimed at discovering the areas where the enemies are supposed to be. Anyone who enjoys running among millions of monsters screaming ~it's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all out of gum~ shooting like hell can change the article and wait for the review of Duke Nukem Forever (and in the meantime he can start a family and mature his pension) since here, more than anything else, people crawl. It's when you find yourself engaged in firefights against AI-led opponents that you realize GRAW's biggest flaw: it's not just our men who are as intelligent as the competitors in the Big Brother house; even the CPU-driven ones think decidedly out of context. Let me explain right away: are you shooting at them and are they behind cover? Well, they won't stay there for long since, in a completely irrational way, they will often tend to discover themselves by getting caught in the open field (obviously a bullet in the forehead is what it takes to celebrate such stupidity). It's fine to try to make the game more accessible, but in this way many of the applicable tactics by exploiting our teammates are nullified: does it make sense, for example, to give orders trying to flush out the enemy when the enemy is perfectly flushed by himself? That something extra That said, there is no doubt that GRAW is a high-level title, with dozens of goodies (such as the numerous weapons that can be selected during the briefing phase) and a truly excellent mission structure. Most of the objectives are achieved in a linear way, but, in some cases, a greater freedom of approach is left. The urban setting is accurate and turns out to be the best ever seen in a video game, surpassing the competition by several hands in terms of number of details and scenic splendor. The difficulty is medium / high level; despite the flaws of the AI, overcoming the various skirmishes is not easy at all, especially due to the lack of quick saves. We proceed in this way paying attention to the slightest movement and moving slowly from one corner of the building to the next. The single player campaign lasts a total of 12 hours net of the times that you are forced to reload due to death. The multiplayer sector takes care of adding longevity, with two very interesting modes, unfortunately affected by a few too many bugs. Hardware boxes To run Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter properly you need a really well equipped computer. The minimum requirements marked on the box (a 2 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalent, 1 GB of Ram and a 128 MB of RAM video card compatible with DirectX 9.0c) certainly allow you to play decently, provided you reduce most of the effects. For best results, bring the processor to 3 GHz, the ram to 2 GB and equip yourself with a video card with 256 MB of ram (preferably of the latest generation). To get the most out of it, as already indicated in the article, you will need a video card with 512 MB of ram which is definitely not a little. Tested on a P4 with 3.4 GHz, 2 GB of ram and a GeForce 7800 GT video card, GRAW presented no particular problems, except for some annoying slowdowns. There are no reported stability issues. Final comment Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a title with very marked lights and shadows that determine a good but not exceptional judgment. Visually excellent, it pays for a non-optimized graphics engine that makes it difficult to run well on many computers. Another defect, already underlined in the article, is the artificial intelligence that is not always up to par and dampens many situations by trivializing the development of the action. Fortunately, compared to the console versions, it is possible to exploit your teammates in action, without having to consider them mere dead weights. In short, a very good title that could have been exceptional with a few more precautions. Pros Beautiful from a visual point of view Finally a hardcore tactical shooter after years in which the genre seemed insipid Perfectly designed campaign Cons Very heavy graphics engine Artificial intelligence with more than a few naiveties A few too many bugs in the multiplayer mode Never trust... When Rubbini told me: ~I've found a secure job with great career potential~ I was already dubious. When he added: ~we will travel the world, we will be in contact with very advanced technologies and we will visit a lot of famous cities~ the doubts grew. But what to do? The jobs are all precarious (the only ones who have a permanent job are those who go on television to say that precariousness is beautiful and good), wages are low and my cat cans are increasingly expensive. So I followed him without batting an eye. When they put a strange uniform on us and gave us strange glasses with built-in monitors, the suspicion that the ~sun~ was imminent became almost a certainty. Receiving a sniper scoped assault rifle dispelled any doubts. At the first outing on the field (for a practically deserted city) the first encounter with other human beings was not the most friendly. Rubbini, they're shooting at us So it seems, but still better than in Harlem. Anyway, pretend to be on a peace mission, you'll see that they calm down.~ Obviously we are not here to discuss the temporary agencies used by Rubbini (of course when he read the name, ~GEA~, he could get the suspicion that there was something strange), but to talk about Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter , third title in the Ghost Recon series (I immediately anticipate the question of the uninformed: no, the second episode was never released for PC fortunately, given how bad it was), signed by the ubiquitous (in the Ubisoft catalog) Tom Clancy (in my opinion old Tom with the PC only plays Prato Fiorito now I've said it). The story behind the game is a typical plot of rebels, insurrections and terrorists; just an excuse for some healthy tactical shooting, really.", "date": "2006-05-23", "grade": null}
