So let's see in detail what this operation consists of and, above all, if it is a successful experiment. Go round Set in the colorful scenery of a Caribbean island, Beach Buggy Blitz proves from the outset to be a no-frills title, saving the user from having to view special introductions and menus and allowing him to immediately start the race by pressing the large Play button located at the bottom of the screen. Thus begins the only game mode offered by the product, which sets the goal of driving your car as far as possible before time runs out, with the countdown that can be delayed by a few seconds at each pass of checkpoints. Due to a precise design choice, initially you have only one buggy with rather modest performance and no power-ups, and you are not even allowed to customize the vehicle with new colors and decals or change the driver's appearance. This is because in Beach Buggy Blitz everything must be paid for with the coins that are collected during one's rides, a routine that in fact becomes the fundamental pillar of the playful experience. In fact, the Vector Unit product develops in a circular way: you collect enough tokens to buy an upgrade or a new car, you take advantage of the upgrades to go further and get more rewards, you invest the money accumulated in new improvements and start again. On paper, the repetitive effect is around the corner, and knowing the risk, the developers thought well of making the generation of the path random for each game: the effect is quite successful, and even if the setting always remains the same, not finding yourself always having to take the same road helps to remove the specter of recurrence, at least for a while. Being a free to play, in fact, Beach Buggy Blitz does its best to invite the user to open the wallet and buy one of the various packages that make their fine presence in the dedicated store: this is because accumulating enough coins to access any upgrade immediately proves to be a long process that requires many games, and without spending real money, the repetitiveness in the long run still makes itself felt and there are no random paths that hold. The alternative is to deal with the product as a simple pastime to which to devote a handful of minutes from time to time, without frantically chasing the final goal: taken this way, Beach Buggy Blitz can be undoubtedly pleasant, and from time to time discover some new glimpse of the island is also quite rewarding. From a technical point of view, then, Vector Unit has really done things right, first of all by equipping its product with a variety of control systems capable of satisfying all needs, from gyroscope purists to those who prefer on-screen keys. Graphically we find ourselves on medium-high quality levels, with cartoonish-looking vehicles that whiz over extensive and luxuriant scenarios at a solid frame rate, all without disdaining a good variety of light effects and destructible contour elements.", "date": "2012-10-26", "grade": "7.5"}
