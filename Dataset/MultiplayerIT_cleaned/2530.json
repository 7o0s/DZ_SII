{"name": "Serious Sam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/serious-sam_a.html", "text": "The game As already mentioned in the preview phase, the game has an exceptional graphics engine that allows you to view both open scenarios and the more classic closed environments with extreme ease, allowing excellent scalability of detail in order to have good performance even on less powerful and always spectacular effects to see. Our Sam finds himself catapulted back in time, alone and with few weapons available: in fact, we will leave with a simple knife and a gun that has been magically treated (!) in order to have infinite ammunition! Therefore, as in the most classic of Doom clones, we will have to explore our map in search of the exit and, in the meantime, make our way through hundreds of enemies, without forgetting to collect the weapons and power ups scattered around. The fights are faster, compared to other fps in circulation, because our enemies will go down more easily, but also because the player will be forced to move much more and much more quickly since, in most cases, he will have to juggle in the midst of many enemies all present on the screen at the same time. Furthermore, the amount of information available to the player during the games has been increased, given that there is a handy screen that summarizes all the news on the current level, on the weapons found, on the defeated enemies and also a complete game statistic and it can be recalled at any time, even during the most agitated phases of the fights (sorry, hideous-monster, stop sticking me with its electro-stings because I have to consult the manual of the young marmots). This system takes the name of NETRICSA (NEuroTRonically Implanted Combat Situation Analyzer) and is nothing more than a small computer inserted into our poor Sam's skull and which provides him with all the information necessary to avoid being transformed into a homogenized for small werebulls of the lower Egypt. The weapons The weapons available to our truzzissimo hero are several and are even well made, so as to have a truly captivating feeling. Ammunition is generally found in abundance, although it is easy to consume almost all of it from the first waves of attack, and is well distributed among the various levels. Let's see better what weapons have been made available to save the world: 1 knife 2 colt/two colt 3 shotgun/sawed-off shotgun 4 tommygun/minigun 5 rocket launcher/granade launcher 6 lasergun 7 BFC. As we have seen, we start with a measly knife, which however is not so meager, since a huge evil and it's a really bad weapon, just a pity that it forces close combat and very often it is not recommended at all. The other weapon supplied is the colt, a normal six-shot officially faked for the occasion, given that it has an infinite number of ammunition. Both weapons are very useful in the early levels of the game, especially when there are no monsters around! :) It is possible to pick up another gun in the field and use two at the same time, in fact a weapon exchange system has been implemented which becomes a valid and interesting alternative to the more classic 'double shot', typical of games such as, for example, UT. It is about dividing the weapons into groups of two and with a key you can switch from one weapon to another, within each group. As for Sam's arsenal, after the double colt we can finally get hold of an almost cult object among gamers: the shotgun! This new weapon will soon prove to be very effective during the fights we will have to face and will soon be joined by its older brother: the sawn-off shotgun! But if the reload times of the rifles are too long and you prefer a weapon that requires more aim but which shoots with greater speed, then the Tommy Gun is the right one for you, that is the classic 30s-style machine gun, fast, clean and elegant. Also in this case we will have a bigger and meaner version available: the minigun. It is a cross between the legendary 'big wheel' of Quake2 and the long-barreled machine gun of the AvP marine. It is a weapon that needs a short time for the barrels to reach full speed, but then manages to shell lead at an incredible speed, literally devouring the ammunition available! It is, perhaps, the most beautiful weapon to look at in the whole arsenal. But Serious Sam wouldn't have been a serious shooter (ahem) if he didn't have the inevitable rocket launcher! And here, to the delight of adults and children, Croteam has decided to give us one of the most beautiful andlethal rocket launchers I have ever seen in a fps. Unfortunately, it was joined by one of the worst grenade launchers ever made. Awkward, slow, and doesn't feel like a devastating weapon, looking like anything but a grenade launcher. Luckily, to raise the quality of the available paraphernalia, we find a respectable laser cannon that seems taken verbatim from the Millennium Falcon...! One word: GAJIARDO!! Finally, Sam will be able to benefit from a curious weapon to say the least: the BFC. Leaving aside the meaning of this acronym, given that it could be anything that ends with Cannon (therefore also Big F? Cannon), it is - precisely - a cannon. A cannon, you might say, but what kind of cannon? Laser cannon? Plasma Cannon? Gauss cannon? Erm... do you smoke? None of this. It is, however, the classic canon that was mounted on the ancient galleons, a very retro and a little piratical stuff, in short. But how does it work? How does the BFC manage to scatter the monstrous limbs of the world's hideous enemies? How does this mysterious weapon bring about mass destruction and ultimate annihilation within the ranks of the enemy? With an energy wave? With a nuclear explosion? With a multipike fan launch of tricks, wall barrels, nails, pulleys, empty bottles and diapers against bad monsters? How the hell does this damn cannon work??? Simple, throw a metal ball that bounces and hits some of the enemies on the screen (not all) and then explodes a little (but only a little). In short, a bastard! Of course, to be the last weapon, the definitive one, it's a bit scarce. What a disappointment! However, in essence, Serious Sam's arsenal is not bad at all, indeed if on the one hand we find a couple of decidedly mediocre weapons, on the other there are some nice surprises, very well made and which give an excellent impression of power and a believable feeling of 'physical pain' to our enemies. The monsters We have seen with which tools our Sam sows destruction among the monsters that crowd the streets of this strange and alternative ancient Egypt. Now let's see in more detail some of these incredible creatures that we will face. The first enemies we will have to face are unlucky headless hominids ('headless', in fact) who will launch energy projectiles at us in the hope of making us die from tickling. Later in the game, we will meet some interesting variants: there will be those who will throw grenades at us and who will explode after being killed and the kamikazes who will run towards us screaming, armed with bombs, to blow up once they reach us. The models are made quite well, it's just a pity that the skins are rather showy by presenting too strong and not at all evocative colors. In short, they are not scary nor are they able to disturb the player who is facing them. Of a completely different kind are the Keel Skeleton, i.e. horned skeletons which, armed with steel bolas to strike from a distance, become lethal in hand-to-hand combat, a bit like the legendary Quake Fiends. Without a doubt among the baddest enemies in the whole game! We will then find, in no particular order, scorpion-men armed with machine guns, bullfighting bulls, harpies, so strange with an eye and a mouth in the middle of their chests and other bizarre rather than disturbing creatures. From this point of view, the Croteam designers have unfortunately created models with little appeal, without character and not at all capable of sending a shiver of terror down your spine during a normal game. This, however, does not mean that the monsters present are unoriginal or not very fun to meet, but simply that they do not contribute to creating an atmosphere of tension and involvement as it should happen for a game that makes single player its primary feature . As for the variety, in Serious Sam's bestiary, it must be said that we will be faced with different types of enemies, each with very specific characteristics. We will fight against bulls who will throw us into the air with horns and which we will be able to dodge just like in a bullfight, there will be harpies who will fight both from above and from the ground, we will have to deal with beasts who will throw meteors at us in search and we will see before our eyes huge lava elementals that will split into a greater number of smaller creatures once hit. In short, at Croteam they undoubtedly have a great imagination and have exploited it well to characterize their creatures, which are very convincing also by virtue of their limited intelligeartificial nza. Yes, that's right, the AI routines are very simple and limited to basic behaviors, so the monsters will be able to chase us, without getting wrapped up in walls or columns, they will be able to hunt us down and attack us at the right moment and in a surgical way lethal, but they will not be able to make more complex decisions. So, let's forget guerrilla techniques and combat tactics, there are no UT bots here but just a herd of stupid and hungry monsters. And this is precisely the distinctive feature of the game: many enemies to slaughter but also many claws to escape from! The maps As we have already said several times, Serious Sam is set in a fantasy Egypt and therefore the underlying theme of the various levels is more or less the same. Those who wanted to make the comparison with Doom will be disappointed by the lack of demonic symbols, bloody altars and ancient and mysterious architectures: here we will not find the blasphemous cathedrals of pain invented by Carmack and Romero, but only sand, hieroglyphics and pyramids. In fact, especially from a certain level onwards, the setting is a bit monotonous as well as repetitive and in some cases we are faced with maps created in a rather superficial way. What immediately catches the eye is that very often the maps have a flat development, as if they were in two dimensions, just like the Doom maps (wanting to continue the comparison), and therefore few crossed passages, few overlapping planes and many areas open and desolate. To this we also add that, in some cases, the shapes are meaningless and certain buildings seem to have been created at random, without a precise objective in mind, limiting oneself to alternating the areas between them: the squares with the courtyards and the halls with corridors. Certainly not all levels of the game suffer from these shortcomings, fortunately we also find small level design jewels, such as the sand canyon at the exit of the temple and the valley of the kings. In these cases, the graphics engine allows us to enjoy some really valuable aesthetic feats, giving the game a higher value. Multiplayer Serious Sam's multiplayer, as already mentioned at the beginning of the article, also takes into account the possibility of having up to four players play simultaneously on the same PC, via a split screen option. This, of course, is a very remote possibility, as performance would drop even on a powerful machine and it would also be very difficult to play on a quarter-sized screen. The real multiplayer mode is the one on LAN or on the Internet and contemplates the possibility of playing the usual DeathMatch and Team DM, but also of creating a game in Cooperative, as hasn't been seen for a long time now! Basically, for those unfamiliar with this type of game, it's about going through the singleplayer maps but with a team of players, all on the same side and against computer-controlled monsters. It is possible to create a dedicated server and set so many game parameters, even how much stronger the monsters must be, for each player added to the game. The DM is in turn divided into two distinct modes, the FragMatch and the ScoreMatch. In the first case, the ranking is calculated in the usual way, based on the number of enemies killed, in the second case, however, the points accumulated will decide the winner. Conclusions We have reached the end, therefore, and it is time to draw conclusions. Is this game worth buying? Who is the purchase recommended for? Well, it depends on a few factors. First of all, ask yourself if you like pinball machines, because Serious Sam is nothing more than a big and colorful pinball machine in first person view. Second, ask yourself if you're willing to play a game with a bare-bones (but really bare-bones) storyline and repetitive gameplay, where in addition to shooting, running, and jumping, you also have to shoot, run, and jump. Unfortunately, SS has some defects which, although not serious, undermine its absolute playability. If you are among those who expect from a game, in addition to action, a dose of atmosphere, involvement and thrill, look for - even!! - interaction with the surrounding world and if you pretend even - exaggerated!!! - to be able to really squeeze your brains, then SS is absolutely not the game for you. If you are satisfied with leading your hands, if visual satisfaction is enough for you (but mind you, not in all levels!), if you don't mind being faced with monsters created without an underlying theme, as pr", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
