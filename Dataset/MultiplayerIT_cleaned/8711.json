{"name": "Martha is Dead", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/martha-is-dead-recensione.html", "text": "We are in Tuscany, in 1944. Martha and Giulia, daughters of a German graduate, are spending the last year of the war in a rural farmhouse located a few kilometers from a typical Italian village. The echoes of the ongoing war reach them from the regime press, from the radio, which they always leave on to get news in real time, and from the rumors that circulate among the population. Despite the conflict becoming more and more dramatic, the place where the two girls live remains of a dazzling beauty, almost untouched, straight out of a poem by Carducci. However, one day, Giulia sees Martha's body emerge from the lake in front of their house. Who was it that killed her? The partisans as the Germans claim? Some wanderer passing by? Or the white lady, a figure of popular folklore that has always fascinated Giulia? To find out why it is really worth shedding light on this mystery, you just need to read the review of Martha is Dead, in which we tried to explain what she appeared to be the real beauty of the LKA title. Photography The house where Giulia, the protagonist of the game, lives Martha is Dead is a first-person psychological thriller, as the authors themselves define it, to which we already owed the excellent The Town of Light. The player plays Giulia and must try to shed light on what happened to her sister, exploring the surroundings of the house and the house itself in search of clues and traces that lead to the resolution of the case. What apparently seems like a sort of whodunit, at least in the early stages, however, is completely transformed after a few hours of play, revealing its deepest nature and weaving together themes and problems that are apparently very distant from each other, between inner research and historical events, which they form an unprecedented unicum for the world of video games. In terms of interactions, Giulia can examine many objects of the furniture, from which the player draws information about her past, she can collect some of them, to use them as needed, and she can take photographs with a Rolleicord, a twin-lens camera with a waist level viewfinder . The latter will be one of the cornerstones of the game right away. Giulia is, in fact, a great lover of photography, a passion she inherited from her father, and at the time Martha was killed she was taking pictures on the edge of the lake. So one of his first goals will be to recover the cameras and develop the rolls of film in the dark room, built in the cellar of the house. It should be emphasized that the entire photographic process has been simulated with great skill, net of some obvious simplifications (however described in the tutorial). When taking photos you have to frame the subject well, focus, expose correctly by adjusting the shutter speed and aperture, use the right filters according to the light conditions, then take the rolls of film to the darkroom and use the enlarger to impress the negative on the paper, to then wash the image obtained. Who killed Martha? A secondary objective is also linked to photography, which is not very clear while playing, so you have to go in search of hidden details in the map using a specific photographic filter. In any case, the whole system is very used, with the darkroom becoming a kind of place of Giulia's conscience, where the images taken can be revelations or deceptions depending on the moment in which they are developed. Or, simply, moments to remember (in some situations the player is left free to photograph what he wants, even without caring about the plot). A note on the censorship of the PS4 and PS5 versions Attention, because this box will openly talk about three moments of the story of Martha is Dead, telling them in detail. If you don't want advances, don't read it. Or come back and read it after finishing the game. Let's spend a few words on the censorships of the PS4 and PS5 versions of Martha is Dead, which are not limited to just the sequence that emerged in recent days. Meanwhile let's see what they are: In a dream sequence Giulia rips the face off Martha's corpse using a tag to perform the surgery, and puts it on her face. The censored version is a non-interactive movie, where on PC and Xbox the player does the whole process. In an advanced sequence of the game, Giulia goes to the cemetery where Martha's body is exposed and, to check if her sister was pregnant before she died, she disembowels her with tailor's scissors, taking out the fetus and placing it on her chest. This sequence has also been made non-interactive, like the previous one. In the final sequence, Giulia briefly recounts her experience in a mental hospital, talking about how it ismasturbated all day in the throes of very strong impulses. All references to masturbation have been removed from the PlayStation version. Now, apparently, except in the ending sequence, there was no actual content removal in the PlayStation versions. In reality, we are very keen to contest this position, because much worse has been done: the video game has been denied its nature as an interactive medium, transforming the player from an active agent to a passive user of the content in two key moments, which serve to better understand the existential tragedy experienced by Giulia, the protagonist. It must be said that whoever managed the publication of Martha is Dead on the PlayStation side understood the expressive power of the videogame medium much more than those who minimize its censorships, because acting directly in those sequences creates a sense of repulsion and disquiet that with passive vision is partially lost. Deconstruction of a life Martha is Dead works perfectly on a metaphorical level Martha is Dead amazes with its narrative virtues and how it uses its setting to tell the mind of the protagonist. Those expecting pure horror will probably be disappointed. Sure, some sequences are strong, even disturbing, but don't expect to crouch around to avoid some monsters moving in the dark. The authors' goal is not to make you jump off your seat, but to make you experience a tragic story, capable of conveying a strong sense of unease throughout its duration, in a piece of Tuscany almost eighty years ago, reconstructed with great attention to detail. Giulia's house is full of period objects and is furnished in a plausible manner, starting with the room shared by the two sisters, another of the symbolic fulcrum of the work. The game map is not very large and includes the house, the lake, a small church and a cemetery built in the typical Italian style. The rooms are easily reached by running, but Giulia can use a bicycle for longer journeys if she wishes. Naturally there are also external environments, linked for example to dream sequences, but in general the adventure takes place completely in and around the house, which makes it even more disturbing in its being enclosed in an essentially familiar environment for the protagonist. The characters you interact with are few. Giulia's father and mother live in the house, but we never speak directly to each other, with interactions limited to a few key moments (it is difficult to tell a game like this without mentioning the story). You can make phone calls, but they too are only needed to get other information, apart from those required by the plot. If desired, one can also interact with a group of partisans via telegraph, but without ever coming into direct contact. The dream sequences are done really well In terms of the actual narrative, Martha is Dead never resolves its underlying ambiguities and has no interest in doing so either. It doesn't ask the player to follow a story, but to deconstruct it. The authorial imprint is evident and strong, but it is not satisfied with giving an unequivocal interpretation of what is happening. Instead, he asks the player to understand that Giulia's story cannot be reduced to a single one, because we are experiencing it from her point of view, which is the fragmented one of those who cannot distinguish reality from fantasy, of those who have fought suffering creating his own world with undefined borders, which constantly intertwines and confuses with the truths he tries to hide, in which the only truly clear aspect is the suffering that generated it. Paradoxically, this delusional staging of the unconscious takes on an ever more immanent dimension, as new details are discovered and one digs deeper into Giulia's past, until one looks into the abyss that supports her. Indicative in this sense is the fact that, in order to remember her past, Giulia has to literally represent it in a puppet theatre, while entrusting the player with the reconstruction of her memories, which are vague and nuanced. What is hiding at the bottom of the lake? We are faced with a narrative process similar to that of The Town of Light, in which the documents that it was possible to find in the game deliberately created contradictions in the life of the protagonist, precisely to affirm the unknowability of the same in its historical integrity. Something similar happens in Martha is Dead, with Giulia becoming aware of herself and her inner fragmentation by trying to remember what happened to her, what she caused and of which she was at the same time a victim. It's a processdelicate and masterfully written narrative, which finds its deepest meaning precisely in its not wanting to give a binding one. A final mention deserves the soundtrack, made up of period songs reinterpreted in a modern key, which is successful not only in qualitative key, but also in that accompanying the narrative flow, of which it soon becomes an inseparable part, capable in its own way of describing Giulia's mental state better than many images.", "date": "2022-02-24", "grade": "9.0"}
