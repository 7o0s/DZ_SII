Director's Cut", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/153808-qube-directors-cut-ti-faccio-un-cubo-cosi.html", "text": "There are so many ways to get around budget constraints when it comes to developing an indie game. In the case of Q.U.B.E., the guys at Toxic Games have seen fit to take advantage of the first person view and play with colors (or, better, with the absence of them) and a mix of simple shaders to obtain a visual result that only he rarely shows his weaknesses. In fact, the protagonist of the game wakes up in a mysterious and aseptic place, characterized by long corridors completely white, equipped with mechanisms that continuously shape their shape, as well as rooms in which there are elements of interaction, puzzles to be solved using the terminals present on the gloves of the special suit. In our review of the original edition, we openly appreciated the ideas behind the gameplay and the solidity of the puzzles, however we lamented the lack of any plot to accompany an adventure that undoubtedly has its moments of tension, its essential sharp. Well, we have been listened to: in the Director's Cut, which also marks the debut of the game on consoles, the developers have added a narration in two voices (in English, unfortunately without subtitles) which paints an intriguing and non-trivial story, which revolves around the illusions and deception, with a view to a search for the truth that will find its fulfillment with the conclusion of the campaign. Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut is a high quality first person puzzle game that is short but intense In white painted white Since there are no real tutorials, the first levels of Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut act as an introduction to the mechanics that regulate the gameplay, which are indeed very immediate: you move using the analog sticks, with a strictly first-person view, you jump with the X button and you interact with the environment by activating the sensors on gloves using the controller's back buttons. The puzzles almost always involve the activation of switches that allow us, through simple platform sections, to reach the door that leads to the corridor or the next room, for a total of seven increasingly complex areas. Everything is based on cubic shapes (precisely) of five different shades, each with specific properties: the red blocks can appear or retract for a maximum of three levels, the yellow ones form an ascending or descending figure composed of three columns, the blue ones work like a real trampoline for projecting the character (or objects) towards a certain area of the scenario, the purple ones allow you to rotate entire portions of the stage and, finally, the green ones cause a cube of the same color to appear, to be used as a ~step ~ to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms. The variations on the theme are extremely numerous, one might say ~by the book~, as during the course of the campaign all the possibilities of this system are explored to then mix the cards and add new elements again, with a view to a formula that always remains fresh, varied and genuinely challenging, alternating static puzzles with much more dynamic ones, in which timing plays a fundamental role. In the more advanced phases, for example, it will be necessary to accompany the path of a sphere and adjust the position of the blocks along the way so that it passes within certain areas, coloring themselves in a certain way and ending up in a ~hole~ of the same shade to compete when opening a door. Or, again, the ability to freely assign colors to the blocks will be obtained, thus obtaining a completely free interpretation of the puzzles, which can be solved in different ways depending on the approach and intuitions of the moment. Playstation 4 trophies There are nineteen Trophies present in Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut. Most of them can be unlocked by simply progressing through the campaign and completing the seven sectors that make it up, but there are also Trophies related to specific puzzles and other more complicated ones to obtain, which revolve around exploring the scenarios or performing particular maneuvers. Speed runs Have already completed Q.U.B.E. in its original edition it obviously helped us to proceed very quickly in this Director's Cut, we suppose more than normal, so as to reach the final stages of the adventure without a fight in the course of a single game. Even approaching the experience for the first time, however, it is not appropriate to expect a duration of more than three and a half hours, although the authors have also included the DLC Against the Clock in this version, which adds a series of timed challenges which, if desired, can keep you busy for quite a while.It is a light and fun diversion, but which in our opinion somewhat distorts the philosophy behind the product and does not lend itself well to use with the controller and analog sticks, which are notoriously less reactive and quick than the mouse when you have to adjust your view very quickly to get the required time on a given course. Beyond the challenge package, however, the originality, atmosphere and quality of the Toxic Games title are undoubtedly enough to justify the price on the Xbox Store and PlayStation Store (in this case, moreover, 20% discount for Plus users), offering console owners a fascinating journey towards freedom, artistically inspired (albeit with all the limits of an indie-friendly technical sector), capable of communicating one's messages even visually and accompanied by essential musical pieces, but who manage to effectively underline the various situations and even the twists and turns.", "date": "2015-07-28", "grade": "7.5"}
