{"name": "King Arthur", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/king-arthur.html", "text": "Between myth and reality The narrated story draws directly from the film: the Roman Empire is constantly expanding and is subjecting more and more populations to its mercy. Among the many defeated opponents, the Romans are however impressed by a people, the Sarmatians, who despite the defeat have shown that they possess an ability and tenacity out of the ordinary. So the Roman army has decided to spare these skilled warriors and grant them their freedom, provided however that they and their offspring serve Rome for at least 15 years. And so Arthur makes his appearance with his knights, who after having obeyed the Roman Empire for a long time find themselves facing the last mission before conquering the coveted freedom: to save Alexius, destined to become the new pope, before his settlement was joined by the Saxons, the bitter enemies of Rome. The game not only retraces the events of the film version, but also shows some clips taken directly from the film, represented by about 20 minutes of the film. On many occasions, however, the videos will suddenly change into three-dimensional graphics, representing a pleasant effect never seen until now. Long live King Arthur! What exactly is it about? King Arthur is a purely action game, where we will have to achieve the objectives set with blows and blows. During the adventure we will be allowed to maneuver various characters, such as Arthur, Lancelot, Geneva, Galvano and others; each of them will have different weapons with relative attacks, and in addition everyone will be able to use the bow with arrows. In some sections we will use the horse, thanks to which we will be able to overwhelm enemies and break down doors. However, the differences between the heroes will really be minimized due to an all too elementary control system: we will have a quick attack, a medium one and another powerful one, plus the one to parry. Unfortunately, the most powerful move will prove to be rather slow, and before the sword can reach the enemy, the latter will have already beaten us! Not even the combos that we will learn during the course of the adventure will be of much use, given their irritating slowness! For this reason, therefore, the player will almost always resort to the quick and medium attack, which in any case will be enough to continue without too many problems. All this also happens because the opponents' AI is at very low levels, and their monotonous and strategy-free offensives make them easy prey...at least as far as fights with few opponents are concerned: in some points, in fact, the hordes of enemies will be numerous, and their blind and stubborn attack makes them a rather difficult obstacle to overcome (not surprisingly, unity is strength!). Then add the fact that if we die we will have to redo the level from the beginning, and frustration is guaranteed. Alongside us in our businesses there will always be another companion, who will be driven by the CPU (and will not prove to be very efficient), or by another user if we decide to play in cooperative mode. Another aid will come from the sporadic appearances of potions capable of restoring health. Regarding the levels, they will be extremely linear, without the possibility of exploration, and the only thing to do is to beat up all those who stand in front of you until you reach the end. For this reason, the gaming experience will be boring and unattractive in the long run, and the use of numerous characters is not enough to break the intrusive monotony, also due to an overly simplified control system which makes the fights decidedly dull. Technically speaking.... Even from a graphic point of view, the Konami-branded product does not make a miracle cry: poor and flat textures are not exactly a pretty sight, and the distance from today's standards is quite large. Quite commendable however is the faithful reproduction of the film of the settings, even if the low number of polygons makes their view unattractive. However, to counterbalance the lack of complexity of the graphics engine there is the fluidity of the frames, absolutely free of slowdowns. The sound sector, on the other hand, is convincing, characterized by songs that are pleasant to listen to and suitable for the atmosphere of the game, and by discreet sound effects. We add acceptable dubbing in English, accompanied by subtitles localized in our language Comment If Bruckheimer's film has not enjoyed exceptional fame, the same can be said of the videogame counterpart, which indeed has a worse fate. Konami's product unfortunately does not take off in any aspect: the exhausting repetitiveness of the levels, an inadequate control system and aThe technical ion that is just sufficient certainly does not make it the main attraction of the year, and given the numerous titles of the homonymous genre on the market, I believe that King Arthtur finds a very small space. However, if you liked the film and have always been a fanatic of the legendary King Arthur, you might as well give it a look. For the rest, I strongly advise you to focus on products of a much different thickness! PROS Lots of controllable characters Faithful to the movie Good soundtracks CONS Below average graphics Basic control system, inadequate moves Extremely linear In October 2004, King Arthur, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (author of ~The Curse of the Black Pearl~), landed in cinemas. The film told the real story of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, who have been the subject of countless legends and heroic deeds for a very long time. Unfortunately, the film in question did not achieve the desired success: the box office receipts were low, and the critics did not spare themselves negative judgments, especially the English one. Despite this, Konami has decided to publish the video game version, following the lines of Lord of the Rings.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
