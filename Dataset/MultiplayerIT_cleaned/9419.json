After an almost megalomaniac drift that saw the Total War series tackle the ambitious project of almost global domination in Empire, Creative Assebly had already taken half a step back by bringing things back to Europe alone with the excellent Napoleon, but it is with Shogun II which really goes back to the origins of the series and with it to a traditional but at the same time very fresh vision of strategy, both turn-based and real-time. Let's face it: a bit of everyone, especially in Italy, turned up our noses when the hopes of a Rome II were canceled by the announcement of the Shogun sequel, regardless of whether it was caused by marketing reasons or simply by a desire to start from scratch with an almost complete restyling of the game. Yet this new release could do for the Total War series what Rome did almost ten years ago when compared to its predecessors: rebuild the series from the ground up and redesign it in many of its aspects, while keeping it faithful to its original scheme. We are talking about a complex work, which has seen the management part improve and expand, heavily rewrite the war phase and propose a brand new multiplayer guise, in a series of improvements that go far beyond the mere aesthetic aspect (albeit exasperated) and which nevertheless continues to drag along some historical defects of the series. Let's see below which ones and why. Heaven and earth are my parents Although also appreciated in the online game, the soul of Total War has always been the single player strategic map: this time the campaign will take us to Japan in the mid-16th century and will allow us to control its evolution for about fifty years , for a total of over 200 game rounds, each representing a season. The first choice obviously goes to the clan: there are several of them and each is distinguished by an unpronounceable name and a war or commercial particularity: powerful in combat, the clans of the hinterland play assault infantry units but suffer greatly from the wear and tear of the shooters and they literally don't know which way to turn if they embark. Similarly, a coastal clan will be able to train fast cavalry in the plains and build excellent ships, even if its inhabitants will not have the physical prowess of the inhabitants of the hinterlands. Considering that the choice will hardly be dictated by reasons of the heart - unless there are some Japanese culture experts among the readers - as could happen in a Medieval setting himself at the helm of his own city or in Rome treading the deeds of our ancestors in lorica and tunic, it will obviously be the style of play that will make the player decide which clan to command, since the differences and tactical/managerial evolutions between one faction and another have never been underlined as in this case, although they are obviously less evident, at least for us Europeans, than those between the Republic of Venice and the Holy Roman Empire may seem. Once the clan has been chosen, the strategic map looks quite familiar to fans of the saga: Japan has in fact been divided into various provinces, each of which has a capital and several smaller cities in which to develop resources, on the Empire model, and through various menus it is possible to access the control of finances, diplomacy, one's own characters and agents and public order, up to the study of oriental philosophies, which take the place of Empire's technical-social research and recycle the system. Changed anything? At all. First of all, from the very first hours of the game it can be seen how the province is no longer, so to speak, self-sufficient: since the time of Medieval we have become accustomed that, with the growth of cities, it is also necessary to strengthen the agricultural systems, otherwise the impoverishment of the lands, but it always remained a marginal and almost secondary aspect of development. This time, however, the supply of resources is essential, just as the accumulation of food supplies for possible sieges is no longer automatic but subject to the productivity of the countryside and ports, while the mood of the citizens is also affected by the absence of recreational facilities if you have mistakenly given yourself a total industrial increase, essentially forcing the player to pay much more attention to the economy and management of the individual provinces. The real highlight of Shogun II, however, is the administration of the characters, be they generals or agents, and this is paradoxical considering that doubts were expressed in this regard in the preview phase: inspired by the strong culture of honor that characterizes Japan, in fact, the svThe developers have made the relationships between the characters more complex and well researched. Each man or woman in the family has its own life, and will grow on it: a defeat in battle will drastically drop the soldiers' confidence, lowering their discipline, while a victory will increase the skills and retinues of the commanders, an important assignment it will increase their loyalty, lowering the risk of betrayal and consequent civil wars, while a demotion or even removal from a command could even lead to ritual suicide. But the big news is in the features. Always present in Total War but made much less important by the disappointing Empire, not only are they back in Shogun but they even constitute a game within a game: gradually a character acquires life experiences (victories, defeats or successful assignments in the case of agents) these will translate into points that can be spent on various improvements for its characteristics, divided by thematic areas ranging from military to diplomatic or legislative capacity, passing through upgrades dedicated to certain troops rather than certain others and so on, in an almost role-playing development not only of the person, but also of everything that revolves around them. All these factors to be multiplied for each of your vassals, to which are added how many and which battles have been won, how many and how the subjected provinces have been treated, how many and what type of philosophies that have been studied all add up to a single indicator : that of the honor of one's clan which, if filled through correct politics and conduct worthy of a samurai, could lead to having the utmost respect from the other clans, facilitating relations and accelerating the race for domination of Japan. Other improvements? In spite of what was feared, there are really many trainable units, so many that it will be difficult to try them all, also because some are special for certain clans (here, perhaps more could have been done in terms of customization) or certain religions: a example are firearms, available only to those who will convert to Christianity. Diplomacy has once again been enriched with options, including for example the exchange of hostages, even if the greatest attempt has been to equip the computer with an AI worthy of the name and to develop coherent political and diplomatic strategies, which again this time was not completely successful: it is true, the enemy armies now move with a little more logic, perhaps avoiding direct confrontation and preferring to attack objectives or unguarded provinces, but there remain strange suicidal tendencies of small groups or even solitary characters and a propensity to rather dubious diplomatic choices and betrayals as well as inexplicable even tending to self-destruction - typical the minor clan from a province that declares war on you having your army along all borders; it was already a craze of Empire's non-playable nations. I have no Katana: the sleep of the spirit is my Katana We all know that, after a few rounds of planning, after the first training sessions, after the first diplomatic disputes, sooner or later the battlefield will decide who will dominate the four major islands, with a very welcome return of the general's speeches, back to the glories of the times of Rome (~The roosters believe they are equal to or superior to us!~, what memories!). We are all used to the magnificence of Total War strategic maps, but this time the show is truly phenomenal: between light effects, refractions, even leaves and flowers blown by the wind, rust on armor, the difference between warrior and warrior, the work done by the developers is truly commendable, and no words can testify to it like the related pictures and videos. Of course, the price to pay is a certain heaviness of the engine, which advises PC owners who are not exactly cutting-edge to make various compromises for the video options, in order not to have to endure a horrid show of battles in slow motion: in this regard , however, a fair scalability of the game engine should be noted. Since thank goodness you don't live on graphics alone, the developers have well thought of giving new life and new depth to tactical battles: we already know that the unit classes are quite small, mainly dealing with artillery, infantry and cavalry, both in the variants light/heavy or with a spear rather than a sword or a musket to replace the bow, to which are added the special units of the various factions and other minor units - serfs, women, warrior monks and others - which however remain inside of these three categories. However, this is only an apparent simplification:in reality what has been created is a perfect system of Chinese paper between the units, based not so much on an excessive number of possibilities (as in Medieval) as on a careful micromanagement of the skills that each of them possesses, some of which are unique or require the study of certain philosophies or the development of a character in a certain direction. In fact, each unit has different capabilities, from incendiary attacks, finally no longer merely aesthetic, to particular formations, the possibility of fighting on foot rather than on horseback, up to real skills such as instilling fear in enemies or courage in one's companions, creating different tactical variants unpublished for the series and for the first time focusing attention on the management of units as well as the army, trying to create a synergy between the various components of one's army. Tactical depth increased by a battlefield that finally, in Shogun 2: Total War, does not serve as a mere contour to the clash: garrisoning a building gives decisive bonuses to the occupants, both in terms of resisting blows and repelling a frontal assault ( then a cannon shot solves the problem), woods and hills are finally able to cover the line of sight and for this reason the much hated orderly is particularly useful for once, who will take care to inform us if a hidden unit should be discovered; but forgetting to specify which one. As far as naval battles are concerned, they are obviously still present and to balance the scarcity of vessels present, because it is not that great battles were made at sea in the Japanese Middle Ages, the same positive aspects that make the land experience enjoyable: the micromanagement of the various abilities of the ships, the perfect harmony between the classes (boarding, attrition, merchant) and the influence of the game environment, such as shoals or contrary currents, on the field performance of the units, as well as obviously an already mentioned visual marvel which gives its best in the representation of coastal settings and the games of refraction on the surface of marine waters. But how does the enemy interact with the new tactical variants? The computer tends, once again, to demonstrate a simplistic AI, which unfortunately does not seem to be able to exploit the new possibilities and remains glued to the old tactics, placing the shooters in front and the infantry behind, without keeping units in reserve (and the malus deriving from tiredness have been accentuated, as the number of shells has been decreased) and falling into any trap of the player, almost immediately stripping the shooters and launching the massacre of the cavalry, or sending the ships straight aground or against the wind. Unfortunately, raising the difficulty will not increase the enemy general's tactical acumen, but, if anything, it will not strengthen the troops, who will suffer less damage from shooting attacks and will prove to be less prone to breaking the front and subsequently fleeing. Let's be clear, we are not at the levels of linearity of Empire, the pre patch and pre mod one, and the same units have much more fluid and rapid movements than the infantry organized in ranks of the European eighteenth century - and God forbid - however the feeling that something more could have been done remains present. I have no friends: my friends are my spirit We can begin the analysis of the multiplayer component of Shogun 2: Total War by connecting directly to the game campaign and even to the aforementioned AI flaw: the first possibility is given in fact when deciding whether to face a battle automatically, in the tactical map against the computer or...against a player, instantly searching for an opponent whose army matches the standard of yours. What do we mean by army standard? You should know that the entire online experience has been expanded and redesigned, almost re-presenting an online version of the strategy map! While obviously not being able to expect a real turn-based experience, the developers have created the possibility of having your own virtual avatar, completely similar to any of the characters in the campaign: this means that your alter ego in multiplayer games will have a clan to choose from and, based on the results you get in battles via the internet, he will be able to acquire skills for himself or his troops, he will be able to upgrade and access increasingly specialized units, up to enlisting new officers and creating more armies, forming alliances with other players and moving on a simplified version of the strategic map (basically the only movement of the pawns on the map, as happened at the beginning of the series) in order to vary the setting and the type of clash, which can", "date": "2011-03-14", "grade": "9.2"}
