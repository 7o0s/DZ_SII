{"name": "SongPop Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/songpop-party-recensione.html", "text": "Trying your hand at the SongPop Party review is a bit like coming home, considering how popular and known all over the world this franchise is now. The funny thing is that the formula has remained intact: a Sarabanda-style musical quiz where the winner is whoever guesses the song faster than the others. In the meantime, however, everything else has evolved. In fact, we are talking about the first episode of the series available on Apple Arcade, with a premium setting that completely eliminates any mention of microtransactions and which simply bases the progression on our performance, on the keys we manage to obtain and therefore on the categories and aesthetic objects that we will be able to unlock to enrich the experience. Structure: a sea of songs SongPop Party, the simple game interface. SongPop Party has no problems betting on numbers: if it is true that from the start screen of the game it is possible to access only three modes (single player, online multiplayer arena and party for local challenges), it is in the music categories that rediscover the great substance of the game. There are many of them, with even a subdivision by decades that covers virtually any need. The songs that are heard during the matches are previews of the real songs in streaming, and it is obviously no coincidence that at the end of the match it is possible not only check the list of songs we've just listened to, but also access them quickly if we have an Apple Music subscription. Gameplay: Moss! SongPop Party considers not only the correct answer but also the time taken to provide it. Then there is the actual gameplay, which is enhanced by the aforementioned progression system, including new unlocked categories and new characters, but which in its essence confirms a well-tested approach to say the least. Whether you play alone or in multiplayer, the substance does not change: there are ten songs, each one is hinted at and you have a few seconds to respond. Points are awarded to participants not only on the basis of the correctness of the indication, but also on the speed. This type of solution creates fairly exciting sequences, in which everything can change within two or three questions, completely overturning a ranking that seemed well established up to that moment. Technical realization SongPop Party, some of the first characters available. As per tradition, the graphics of SongPop Party are quite essential, with stylized characters, quite nice, which liven up the interface while the backgrounds are declined in various shades. There are few buttons, but navigation among the options is not always immediate as one would expect from such a product. As regards the central aspect of the experience, i.e. the rendering of the music, the streaming appears to be of fair quality and it listens well both with the smartphone speakers and by wearing a pair of earphones. Too bad only for some glitches that sometimes cause multiplayer matches to end prematurely or ~forget~ to start a song.", "date": "2021-05-07", "grade": "7.5"}
