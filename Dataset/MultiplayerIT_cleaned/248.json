The all-Italian King of Seas, developed by 3DClouds, is a game that enters the restricted circle of experiences dedicated to pirates that stand out for their originality and ideas. In fact, it is difficult to be able to pair up with timeless giants such as Monkey Island, or with recent publications such as Sea of Thieves. Just think of Skull & Bones, and how complex it is to be able to innovate a title about pirates in this precise historical moment of the market. That said, how does this pirate title fare in portability? Let's find out in our review of the Switch version of King of Seas. Narrative and gameplay King of Seas: fire to dust Whether you decide to be the daughter or son of the pirate king, it doesn't matter, the narrative incipit will catapult you into a harsh and difficult world where freedom and loot are at the center of the carefree life of pirates. However, like everything beautiful, the possibility that the idyll will be interrupted is around the corner, especially if there is a hand of magic to put a spanner in the works. Without going into the merits, the King of Seas narrative is nonetheless fundamental, an ecosystem support that allows the 3DClouds title to manage some playful contents. The single player mechanics, favored by the fact that you will not have other crews controlled by players lurking behind a rugged coastline, they are there in full view, to be unlocked through the progression of the story and exploration of the world at the pace you decide to take. A choice that is certainly divisive, but at the same time useful for the solutions envisaged by the development team at the level of the playful ecosystem. King of Seas: Exploration is key But what are the key points of this ecosystem? Well, King of Seas rests its beating heart on three elements: maritime exploration, layered combat and procedural unpredictability. Let's start from this last point: the King of Seas map is procedural and will guarantee you games from different geography, to offer you variety but above all unpredictability. This aspect should not be underestimated and indeed the idea of exploring a different world also allows you to replay the title with greater peace of mind. Maritime exploration, the second fulcrum of entertainment, benefits from this choice. Going in search of loot, discovering outposts and boarding ships that await you in the inlets of the archipelagos is something very satisfying also thanks to the four-speed navigation system of sails, with the speed adjustment positioned on the upper right dorsal of Switch. Therefore comfortable to play and fun to perform, the movement of the ship is fluid and rewarding and the training guarantees the player the possibility of effectively maneuvering the ship over time. In addition to these points, however, there is also the combat factor, based on cannons but also on special skills. Four equipment slots and four skill slots, with basic Switch key mapping that we find comfortable and manageable. Speed of the cannons, health of the ship, crew and sails, all managed through loot and all supported by the player's ability to steer the ship to dodge enemy blows and position himself in advantageous situations. As we said, however, the loot (or loot if you prefer) is essential for managing the parameters and effectiveness of the fights. It starts from the rarity of the loot (from common to legendary) and ends with the magic of special abilities that will allow you to escape, set fire to ships or perform otherwise impossible actions. The experience on Switch King of Seas: sunset on the rocks Another speech to be made concerns the overall gaming experience that starts from the graphic and technical level and continues passing, both for the level of challenge and for the convenience of playing on Switch. On a technical level, the game does not shine for cleaning the textures and indeed the graphic quality stands at a generally average level. Switch clearly benefits from the graphic style of the game but certainly does not favor the reproduction of the best version of King of Seas. The reuse of assets is evident, but despite this, what makes King of Seas attractive is the world design, with a clever use of buildings that returns a pleasant world to explore and observe. To support all this there is an excellent use of music and ambient sounds that cradle the journey and support the action of the fights. Not very original music, but still pressing and respectable accompanying sounds. Unfortunately, the speech is not so positive for the proposed level of challenge. The game also at pi levelsThe high levels of difficulty don't have much bite and the surprises become less incisive as time progresses, relegating the joy of the new which is only a few moments away. There is, in fact, a basic repetitiveness that doesn't fill you up, but that certainly doesn't guarantee peaks of emotion. To reinforce the feeling of a monotonous challenge is a somewhat approximate management of skills that yes offers interesting variables, but never gives the idea of having a card capable of upsetting a clash. The player's ability to maneuver the ship will be the only point capable of shifting the balance, and this as far as it can be defined in line with the historical context, in a single player game it is perhaps not the most apt choice. Last point, but not least: the experience on Switch. The real strength of Nintendo Switch is portability and for this it must be said that King of Seas benefits from this feature to the full. The game can be played easily in all situations, from the moment of pause on the chair to the moment of relaxation on the sofa. King of Seas does not suffer from the small size of the screen and indeed precisely because of its placid nature in moments of exploration it is also a game that adapts very well to some main situations of using the Switch.", "date": "2021-06-27", "grade": "7.2"}
