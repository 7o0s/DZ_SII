Given therefore that, despite the name, Pro Zombie Soccer is by no means a football game based on the performance of the Italian national team at the South African World Cup, we can safely say that the developers of the pseudo-football title made this suggestion to them, trying to give originality and a pinch of madness to a more than exhausted genre, especially on the iPhone, like that of the classic tower defense, enriching it with various goodies and a really well implemented action component. The ball is my best friend Jax, protagonist of Pro Zombie Soccer, was a promising young footballer: enticed by his friends, he decides to audition for an important team, with unfortunately very negative results. In fact, the coach not only rejects him but even, with a sort of fatwa, forbids his engagement in all the other teams in the world. The apparent unjustified excess of malice of the coach will have a precise motivation in the continuation of the story, the fact is that this anathema will cause Jax a series of chain misfortunes such as to reduce him to rummaging through garbage cans to live. Just during one of these unhygienic searches, a zombie suddenly appeared and attacked him by biting his arm; that creature was, however, coincidentally a great football champion, idol of Jax who, given the situation and taken by anger for what happened, throws his ball at him, killing him instantly. From this moment on the boy, convinced that he had absorbed the powers of the famous zombie footballer through his bite but also aware that within a short time he would have transformed himself, decides to discover the origin of these monsters. This is how the journey in search of the many answers to Jax's questions will begin, obviously surrounded by thousands of balls in the face of the various zombies he will meet along the way. Flying over the artistic value of the narrative plot, Pro Zombie Soccer succeeds where it really counts, that is, in giving fun and action that is always varied, immediate and engaging. With the typical isometric side view, common to many productions of the same type, the player's only goal will be to direct Jax's shots at the various monsters that will come towards him, swiping his left thumb up or down and releasing his finger to perform the conclusion. The list of commands actually stops here: the elements of interaction, if we add the enhanced shot that can be carried out by releasing the finger after a few more seconds of pressure, are therefore minimal, but absolutely sufficient for the purpose. Assuming therefore that killing zombies with balloons is bloody fun, it remains to solve the node of the diversification of the action: a brilliantly found solution thanks to the great variety of monsters that can be faced, many of which must be hit several times or in well-placed points to be defeated. precise. We will start from simple and slow zombie-fans to faster cheerleaders, passing through excited warehousemen, monsters with armor and shields (to be hit with bank shots) and even some flying ships, which can only be shot down by destroying their glass dome. In two very specific points, which will act as a link in the story, Jax's kicks will be carried out in motion, a purely aesthetic effect that will not change the heart of the gameplay. As can be easily understood, the score will be increased depending on the number of enemies eliminated, with additional bonuses in the case of single and series Headshots. Upon reaching a certain number of successful balls, an energy bar will then be filled, necessary to activate the ball's three momentary power ups: super speed, which will increase the speed of rebound on enemies, penetrability, which will make the balloon an unstoppable projectile capable of crossing all the monsters along the trajectory and finally the curious friendly satellite. The use of the satellite is in fact quite particular: upon activation of the enhancement, Jax throws a colossal kick at the sphere, such as to make it come out of the atmosphere and precisely hit this satellite which, once stimulated, will set off very powerful rays in able to incinerate all enemies; the targets affected by the rays will have to be signaled through a viewfinder moved by the accelerometer of the iPhone. In the final phase of the story the satellite will be replaced by an equally devastating enhancement that will makethe explosive balloon for a few seconds. From what has been said so far, therefore, it is easy to understand how you find them original and at times ingenious they are certainly not lacking in Pro Zombie Soccer, a pity however that all this collides with a very poor longevity, much less than 2 hours: really too little even for an iPhone game. However, a minimum of replayability is guaranteed by the survival mode and the extreme difficulty level that will be unlocked once the story is over, without forgetting the Crystal Achievements that can be synchronized with Facebook. Technically speaking, the game is really well done, with a fairly inspired level design, very beautiful comic-style cut-scenes, excellent command response, granite framerate and a discreet characterization of the different types of zombies; the effects of the power ups are also good, while some inevitable notes go instead to the only 3 animations that characterize Jax's movements. Finally, the sound is perfectly blended with the semi-serious context, with the possibility of hearing the 16 tracks of which it is formed directly from the Extras menu.
