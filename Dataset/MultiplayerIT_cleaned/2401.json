{"name": "Commandos 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/commandos-6.html", "text": "Finally easier? During the programming of Commandos 2, trying to create a title within everyone's reach, the programmers of Pyro must have found themselves faced with a Hamletic doubt: distorting the game concept to make the title more accessible, creating different levels of difficulty while maintaining unchanged the structure of the game or make everything less tied to the resolution of ~puzzle-time~? If they had opted for the first hypothesis or the third, it is likely that fans of the first game would have felt betrayed by such an attitude, as the sequel would no longer have been as they wanted it. After long decisions, the Pyros instead implemented three different levels of difficulty, achieved not through a differentiation of the puzzles or objectives, but thanks to the programming of a different A.I. enemy. I try to explain myself better. Normal, difficult and very difficult: here is the choice of the difficulty level that we will find ourselves doing once the game has started. If the difficult mode corresponds to the standard mode of the first episode (practically the enemy troops will have identical behavior to that of the predecessor - and this is the news that the loyalists of the first Commandos were waiting for -), in the easy one the response time to our solicitations visual and sound is a little longer and the damage that the Germans inflict is decidedly less important. As for the very difficult mode, the situation is exactly the opposite, leaving the player with no possibility of mistake or uncertainty. Finally easier? My advice is that, for those who have not tried the first game and for those who have discarded it due to being too difficult, to set the normal mode (however, one must not believe that the challenge is less, it's just a matter of greater chance of action). On the contrary, for players who have finished the first one, it is advisable to use the difficult mode, as you could be disappointed by the Nazi attitude, which is less reactive than what Commandos has accustomed us to. To make the missions more accessible, a rather detailed description of the objectives has been implemented this time, which illustrates with just a few clicks what actions must be taken to continue in the game. To tell the truth, the description is sometimes too eloquent, even if in various moments without that help you will feel really lost: fortunately a good balance has been found between the proposed aids and their real need, especially in advanced missions. Initial learning problems Although equipped with one of the best manuals that we have seen in recent years (as mentioned in Day Five of our coverage), Commandos 2 lacks where its predecessor shone: the game tutorial, in fact, instead of teaching us step by step the different actions the commandos can carry out, it simply offers us the execution of two training missions in which we will be able to control a few characters. Oddly enough, this choice almost seems designed more for those who already know Commados than for those who have never approached it. Among other things, the game interface is simple and well done in some parts, but less immediate in others. Specified that any interaction with the environment or with people in general is achieved by pressing shift+left mouse button (disable mines, set objects in motion, open doors, enter vehicles, tie up unconscious enemies...) , unfortunately the lack of a summary table where the different keyboard shortcuts are explained (perhaps recallable with a simple click of the mouse) is felt above all during the first hours of the game. However, a splendid online help comes to the aid of the player which explains ~almost~ all the objects and abilities of the game, their function and the key assigned by it: I did not say ~almost~ by chance, as for some things it will be necessary try and find out what their action is. A rather important lack of the manual is instead that of having omitted the explanation of saving and fast loading: it is carried out by pressing ctrl+s and ctrl+l. Initial learning problems Having become familiar with the entire interface, you can even right-click to open the part relating to the various inventory objects and assign them to one of the four slots available for each character. The advice is not to give up in the face of these initial difficulties that you will almost certainly encounter, but to invest a little more time in the first three missions, trying to discover all the different possibilities (at least forthe characters that you will have the possibility to control) available: surely your investment will be repaid by a much deeper gaming experience. Finally, we have to record several reports from several readers of some problems during installation (I myself have had experience as reported during the coverage), either for the non-recognition of the second or third cd, or for the inevitable blue screen after installing and after starting the game. We don't know if all systems will suffer from these problems, but it must be said that most of these, as reported by many, can be solved by defrag before the whole process: perhaps the time has come to do it, because it's worth Really... Lodi (former province of Milan) without borders. After seeing some of the few negatives of the game, if I had to start talking about the positives of Commandos 2, it would probably take at least five or six paragraphs... Still, some of them are worth seeing together. First of all, a clarification regarding the game engine: on day two of the coverage I stated that it is not polygonal, but in reality at Pyro they have created a totally three-dimensional skeleton and blocked the view at the four corners, in such a way as to maintain the 2D view. However, structurally, the maps are polygonal, and this allows the guards' cone of vision to be calculated much more correctly than in the first episode. As for the graphic aspect, it can be said without fear of excessive contradiction that the textures used are unrivaled in any other game: Age of Kings itself, splendid from every point of view, has been outclassed. The animations of the characters have also improved a lot: when running, the characters even move the center of gravity of their body; the effect of when they get up from the ground, when they move on the stairs, on the light poles, on the electricity wires, is beautifully realized; when the spy poisons a guard, he staggers a bit before falling to the ground. Even the game map this time seems much more ~alive~, as each character is doing something: patrolling, perhaps gymnastics, smoking, falling asleep, looking at documents and talking on the phone... all these actions, among the other not repeated but alternating, help to increase the realism of the game, almost as if you were taking part in an interactive film with which you can interact. Lodi (former province of Milan) without borders. Unlike what happened in the first episode, this time the missions are dynamic, with the objectives changing as the action progresses: there are also many cutscenes, created with the same game engine, which introduce new elements of the mission or changes in history. As if the main objectives proposed to the player were not enough, there are also a series of secondary objectives which for the most part must still be achieved to continue the mission: however, this time the player is left with total freedom of planning as regards the map exploration. Not only that, it could be said that this time the player is encouraged to search the various chests and wardrobes, as they contain not only objects useful to the characters, but also particular bonus ~books~ which, once collected, unlock some bonus missions. Finally, to confirm the greater freedom granted to the player, the possibility of concluding some missions without killing any enemies (even if this is less noticeable in the second part of the game). However, the heart of the game is, and remains despite some freedoms offered to the player, still of the stealth type, and it is necessary to attract the enemy's attention as little as possible, both from a sound point of view: in fact the characters will produce a certain noise for each action (running, shooting) and the guards are also alarmed by this aspect which must be kept in mind. Conclusions part one: what kind of gamer are you? Commandos 2 is a great game. Despite some initial learning difficulties, no gamer passionate about strategy should give up playing this title. But, beware. Reflect, plan, try, reload, reflect, plan, try an alternative - this is the essence of the game. If you don't consider yourself a calm and patient player, turn your attention elsewhere, this is certainly not the game that, due to its complexity and difficulty, will make you change your mind. On the contrary it will probably hate the intero kind. However, if you feel ready to enter the next step of your gaming maturity (the status for which you appreciate not one, but a thousand aspects of such a particular hobby), go out and buy the game without thinking too much. Compared to the first, which you will have discarded for the same reasons mentioned above, the title has been significantly improved and made more realistic, more complex but at the same time more flexible: yes, it was designed for you, to attract you too. So why resist? Conclusions part two: dedicated to Commandos fans While writing the article I looked at the sheet of notes that I had taken while playing, and the positive points of the title seemed to never end: graphics, animations, complex missions and at the same time more ~customizable~ by the many choices of the user, objectives complex (the mission set in Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the background is one of the most beautiful ever) and dynamic, cinematic cutscenes capable of immersing you in the story in a much deeper way than what happened with the first episode (where the missions seem be detached and without particular connections - excluding that of the bridge, first to de-mine and then to blow up -), tying each mission to the next, an unprecedented attention to detail in a title of its kind (you even have to be careful not to tire too much the characters while they are hanging on to the strings of light or while they are underwater... All this, and much, much more. I know that however, as I have done during these days spent in the company of the game, most of you he mainly wonders two things: has the challenge offered by Commandos been maintained, and above all, is the game actually less ~puzzle-oriented~ than the first? Fortunately, the first question must be answered yes: despite the presence of a few missions (once you finish them you certainly won't want to play them again... believe me), the challenge within each of them can be quantified in about ten hours of average (even more, on certain occasions) intense gameplay (unlike the first episode, here it is unimaginable trying to kill most of the enemies, which are much more effectively covered with each other). Each action, due to the wide range of possibilities left to the player, will have to be planned and tested several times before being able to access the solution of the passage. Conclusions part two: dedicated to Commandos fans 13 To the second question, however, I have to answer with a... no. I thought a lot, having had the opportunity to try the game rather in advance, if the ~puzzle~ setting had been kept, and there can only be one solution: yes, even if it doesn't seem like it. In fact, in most moments the player finds himself rather lost in managing the many possibilities of the characters, but until he identifies which command to use for which action... he gets stuck in the continuation of the action. Yes, it is true, in some missions (particularly in the one set in Kwai, above the famous bridge...), there are two or three roads that can be tackled, and this also happens in other points of the game: however in most occasions there will be one solution and only one. One moment, though. This is not a defect of the game, but in my opinion a great value. If the programmers hadn't decided this way, the concept of the game would have been profoundly distorted in favor of the search for greater public consensus (perhaps attracted by a more action or even more arcade setting), and disappointed fans. So rejoice: Commandos 2 is just Commandos the way you want it to be. As for the minor defects I told you about during the game, they are annoying (but they are because it would have taken very little to correct them) but with a little more patience, acceptable. One step away from heaven, here is the exact place for Commandos 2: finally, after three years of waiting, we can breathe a sigh of relief. Question, answer. Is Commandos 2 the game everyone expected? Were the Pyro programmers able to improve the Commandos concept (the first one), and to perfect the few defects that afflicted it? Has this second chapter become more tactical to the detriment of the puzzle-game component that had been criticized so much in the original title? And above all, this time gamers will be able to really have fun without having to bang their heads against the wall for the", "date": "2001-09-24", "grade": null}
