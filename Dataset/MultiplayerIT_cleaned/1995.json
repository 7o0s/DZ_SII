It is therefore logical to expect to find in the game a massive dose of realism and all the features that make tennis a spectacular and exciting sport. To begin with, the Tennis Master Series 2003 brings together the 9 most important tournaments in the world (which form the ~Master Series~) which make up a mini-circuit that we will have to face in an attempt to qualify for the final round in Shanghai. Passing through the scorching courts hard courts of North America (Indian Wells, Miami, Toronto and Cincinnati), the clay courts of Southern Europe (Rome and Montecarlo) and the indoor courts of Madrid and Paris, the road to the ATP Finals and the top of the rankings will be long and very The game modes available are the classic ~tournament~, ~career~ and ~exhibition~, to be tackled in 3 difficulty levels that will allow both beginners to obtain great satisfaction and more expert players to express themselves against difficult opponents. Our character is chosen from a list of 67 players who, despite the ATP license, are pure fantasy even if well matched.It is in fact possible to find clay specialists, fast courts or multipurpose tennis players and therefore able to get by on all surfaces. At the time of selection, however, two defects in particular are noted. First of all, it is not possible to create a player out of nothing, which takes away the satisfaction of creating a tennis player in our image and likeness. Second, small, flaw is represented not only by the absence of Italian tennis players but even by the appearance of a mysterious ~Panatta~, but a standard bearer from Argentina. Nothing so disrespectful anyway :) A well-placed serve is worth half a point After the presentation of the game, it must be said that the ATP license seems to have been exploited properly. The first, pleasant surprise comes from the playability that manages to simulate the sport of racket very well while remaining accessible to everyone. The strokes available are really many (the game manual has 60) and can be performed using 4 keys. By default, with the A button you execute the flat shot, with the B in topsin, with the X in backspin and with the Y the lobs. Both the baseline shots and the volleys and smashes were made with good care, thanks also to the animations ~captured~ with the inevitable motion capture. Actually I noticed that the physics of the ball during some rallies is quite unrealistic, as if the ball is moving in slow motion. This occurs mostly during net exchanges and translates into a series of volleys that seem to reflect Max Payne's ~bullet time~ but unfortunately I think the effect obtained is different from the desired one. Nonetheless, Tennis Master Series 2003 proves anything but disappointing even if the impression obtained in the early stages of the game was not the best. With practice, and only with this, it is in fact possible to reach a very satisfying level of play and perform all those shots that were previously only possible on paper. A long list of shots will thus be available such as tight crosses, drop shots, stop-volleys and extraordinarily powerful baseline shots. To carry out the latter, however, it is necessary to position yourself correctly in relation to the ball and load the shot by holding down the shot button for a few moments. Even the service has its importance and in fact, even in the game it will be important to direct it with sufficient precision and power over the net, being able to choose to hit the ball without any effect or cutting it to the extreme, obtaining portentous effects in ~slices~ to come out. Live from the Foro Italico Technically speaking, Tennis Master Series is arguably one of the best representations of tennis on console. If Sega's Virtua Tennis still constitutes the state of the art in terms of animations, Tennis Master Series comes very close thanks to the inevitable motion caputre which, although it has not drawn ~inspiration~ from the movements of famous tennis players, is of excellent workmanship . The tennis players' models are made up of 5500 polygons (many more than the 3000 of the previous PC version) and moved on the screen by the beauty of 500 animations which make the players' behavior extremely realistic in every situation. The textures are well defined and, even if they don't represent anything shocking, they are undoubtedly the bestor whether he saw himself in a tennis game. The reconstruction of the stadiums is also very convincing, inspired by the real counterparts and often identical to them. The only sore point comes from the audience which, as often happens in this kind of production, damn clashes with the rest of the objects. The sound performs its task without particular problems, after all there are not many noises that occur during a tennis match. Last quote for the initial presentation, really impressive! Game, Set, Match! On balance, Tennis Master Series 2003 turns out to be a good title. The level of entertainment offered by titles on other consoles is probably higher but, at least on XBox, we are faced with the best tennis simulation. The bow arrows of the Microids game are not secondary, good simulation depth, variety of shots and impact technical realization. All these elements, together with numerous others mentioned above, will probably make all XBox owners happy who, not being able to rejoice in the Italian successes in the ATP circuit, will thus be able to try to climb the world rankings, even if only virtually. In the future we can certainly expect even more complete and exciting titles but, at least for the moment, Tennis Master Series should not be missing from the collection of sports fans. Game, Set, Match! Pros: 4 shots and 60 shots available Good simulation depth Convincing animations Top-of-the-gen graphics Cons: Invented names of tennis players Ball physics not always realistic Virtua Tennis is still king Materials Video clips Let's dust off the rackets This Fall I will remember as tennis season. Not happy with having dusted off my rackets after a couple of years of inactivity, I nourished my reborn passion for tennis by watching some matches on TV and playing almost all the simulations dedicated to the sport in question. Between a set at Sega's Virtua Tennis and another with Namco's Smash Court, I found myself, surprisingly, in my hands a new title that seems to have all the credentials to ~break through~ on XBox. To challenge the excessive power of the unforgettable masterpiece of Sega Sports is this time Tennis Master Series 2003, new edition of the game appeared in the past on PC. Strengthened by the ATP license and consolidated experience in the sector, could this be the right occasion for Microids to unseat the Sega Sports masterpiece from the throne of sports simulations dedicated to the beautiful sport of racket?
