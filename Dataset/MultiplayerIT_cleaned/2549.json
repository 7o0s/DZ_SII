{"name": "Metal Gear Solid PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-solid-pc.html", "text": "What is it about? Metal Gear Solid bases much of its gameplay on invisibility; in fact you will enter the atomic complex unarmed and with a large number of genetically modified soldiers guarding the building. If you want to face all the enemies directly as in the most classic of shooters you will have to prepare yourself to use the keys a lot to save and load games since you will almost certainly be killed many times. I therefore advise against using this tactic even if the game allows it. The best way to approach the action is to remain invisible as much as possible trying to avoid direct confrontation. In the upper right part of the screen you will have a small radar available in which you will be able to see all the enemy soldiers present in the area, for each of which a cone of vision is represented which represents the soldier's field of vision: if you enter that area, the soldier will start chasing you and shooting while also calling for reinforcements. As soon as you are spotted by an enemy your radar will stop working for a few seconds and a kind of countdown will start displayed instead of the radar. If you manage to stay hidden from the enemy until the counter reaches zero, the pursuit will stop, the soldiers will return to their original path and the radar will start working again. Believe me, it's more complicated to explain than to do, but it all makes for a really addictive game. Let's now move on to examining the game from a technical point of view, inevitably also comparing it with its PSX counterpart. The best you can get from a console Graphically MGS is one of the best conversions I've ever seen. Although it does not reach the levels of the latest PC productions, the graphics are quite well done even if the number of polygons present is not very high and many textures are in low resolution, an evident legacy of the PlayStation. On the other hand, many light effects have been added and full support for 3D acceleration, which allows you to reach a resolution of 1024x768, light years away from that of the PlayStation. From the point of view of character control, the game is at its best if you use a good gamepad. In this case you will have the same feeling of the PlayStation; using the keyboard instead, the control method becomes a little more complicated and requires considerable practice before being able to master all the movements in the best possible way; however the game allows a total configuration of the controls allowing everyone to choose the configuration that best suits them. The best you can get from a console The audio part of MGS is the one that impressed me the most: using a Live! or another card that allows the management of the 4 channels, there is a sensation of complete immersion, something difficult to achieve with a PlayStaion which is normally forced to use the TV speakers. The dubbing of the characters is excellent with clean and well-characterized voices, one of the best acting I've ever heard in a game even if unfortunately there is no Italian version so the speech is only in English, as well as the subtitles that can be activated at your choice. This makes it particularly difficult for those who are not very familiar with the Albion language to understand the plot of the game and can discourage many people from buying, given that much of the story unfolds in conversations between the various protagonists. The background music is excellent especially the final sung piece; during the game these vary according to the situation and are never annoying, on the contrary they help to create the right atmosphere. Of course they are able to overshadow many recent productions, both for PlayStation and for PC, from this point of view. I repeat again: an excellent job has been done and to confirm this there is also the fact that while I'm writing this review I'm listening to The Best is Yet to Come, the final theme of MGS. The excellent work done by Microsoft in this conversion is also confirmed in the various improvements that have been made to the original version of the game. It is now possible to save at any point, a first person view has been implemented, which is not available in the European version of MGS and, last but not least, all the missions of the VR Missions version have been included, which is sold separately for PSX. The VR missions are set in a kind of Tron-like world where you have to perform specific tasks. In all there are about 300 missions that will keep you busy for a long time even after completing MGS, perhaps in some cases they turn out to be a bit boring but they are an extrawhich is appreciated. Of all the modes, the Mystery and Puzzle modes stand out, which will ask you to solve logical problems; finally, a small gem of the PC version are the Ninja missions, in which you will play a robotic ninja capable of extremely fast movements. In conclusion I can say that MGS is a game that will keep you glued to the screen from the start and you will hardly be able to tear yourself away. You will be captivated by the cinematic style transitions, the excellent cut scenes, and the intense gameplay. Even once you finish it you'll be tempted to start it over again to see what would have happened if you approached an objective differently and to see the different endings that vary based on the choices you make throughout the game. In short, it is an excellent product, a highly recommended purchase, especially if you have never tried the original version for PlayStation. A great conversion.. Metal Gear Solid was one of the biggest killer applications for the PlayStation, and surely even those who don't hang around the world of consoles will almost certainly have at least heard of it. It can be safely said that it belongs to that small circle of games that, upon release, revolutionize the genre to which they belong or even create a new one. It's the game that, since its release for PlayStation (it's now about 2 years) until today, comes closest to the mirage of the interactive film that has been so much pursued in recent years by graphic adventures (and which in part has caused the decline). The question that most of you will be asking, especially after seeing the quality level of the latest conversions from PlayStation to PC, such as the last two episodes of the Final Fantasy saga or Resident Evil, will surely be whether at least this conversion is up to it of the game or if this time too we find ourselves with a great game but with a mediocre technical realization. I will try to answer this question in the course of the review. First we try to provide a little background to all those who are not familiar with the Metal Gear saga. Metal Gear Solid is the third installment in the series. The first, dating back to the now distant 1987, is titled Metal Gear and sees a novice agent member of FOXHOUND named Solid Snake engaged in preventing a small country in southern Africa (called Outer Heaven) from completing its evil purpose: the creation of a tank similar to a mech (the Metal Gear of the title), equipped with nuclear warheads. Ours was also in charge of freeing his companion Gray Fox, hostage of the villains, to arrive at the final confrontation with Big Boss, the leader of the FOXHOUND, as well as one of the greatest soldiers of the century. In the second episode, entitled Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, we find ourselves instead in Zanzibar, in Central Asia, with Solid Snake recalled from leave and committed to freeing Dr. Kio Marv, held hostage, and to face his former friend Gray Fox and destroy Metal Gear again. Thus we arrive at the third episode, the subject of this review, in which a nuclear weapons production plant located on Shadow Moses Island in Alaska is attacked and captured by the Next Generation Special Force. The criminals thus manage to get their hands on thousands of nuclear warheads; the request made by the group of terrorists is to have the remains of Big Boss within 24 hours otherwise they will launch a nuclear weapon. Of course, this time too Solid Snake will be called back to service with the task of infiltrating the nuclear site and freeing two hostages, the head of DARPA, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech Kenneth Baker, and trying to prevent the nuclear launch. I won't reveal more since a great strength of the game is the plot, full of betrayals, twists and much more.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
