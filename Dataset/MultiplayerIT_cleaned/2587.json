{"name": "Formula 1 Racing Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/formula-1-racing-championship.html", "text": "Let's start from the end I say right away that F1RC is a great game but not a masterpiece and by reading this review you will find out why, but it is right that you know from the start what we are dealing with. Let's start by placing the Ubisoft title exactly, which I like to define as a ~light simulator~, and therefore finds itself dueling with the various EA GP3 or F1 2000 CS in the (successful) attempt to win the first class title . What do I mean by Lightweight Simulator? Well a game that has good physics, a decent damage model, that gives us valid driving sensations and that makes us believe we are driving a real F1, but which does not require the expertise and immense learning curve of a simulator ~true~ as are the Papyrus titles and therefore are not comparable to the Ubi Soft title. Having said this, I can safely tell you that F1 RC wins hands down in all fields and rightfully places itself at the top of the category and this even if the game reproduces the unfortunate 1999 season, that of the famous accident at Silverstone by Schumy and the famous wheel of Irvine and won in the last race by Mikka Hakkinen. But as many of you know this is not a problem given the ease with which it is possible to create splendid carsets updated to the current world championship. The advertised features are fabulous, with everything that other simulators offer and something more. Furthermore, the graphics, thanks to the demo and the myriad of screenshots published, made fans dream. The new limit I was talking about the graphics which are absolutely one of the best creations ever seen, with the circuits taking the lion's share. It must be said that these were created by acquiring data with surveys made on the spot with GPS and therefore are very precise and reproduce all the depressions and bumps of the real track in an extraordinary way. As also mentioned in the preview phase, the track has the notable characteristic of rubber, and therefore, after a few laps, we will notice the classic black streaks on the asphalt near the bends. But that's not all... the track, in addition to being very detailed on a planimetric level, also reveals remarkable precision in the objects that surround it with a simply superlative pit area. The cars are also state of the art, certainly the cockpit has remained a bit poor, but it is a lack that goes almost unnoticed. Also all the ~special~ effects are beautiful, such as going out on the sand, accidents or the beautiful environmental effect that deserves a separate mention. You should know, since I haven't told you yet, that besides being visually beautiful the graphics engine is also efficient in terms of performance and on my machine (the usual Celly2 566@850 and GeForce Mx) runs very well 1024 x768, at agreement to disable a graphic option known as an environmental effect, which in practice does nothing but reflect the surrounding world. Beautiful, is not it? If you really can't do without it, it must be said that the performance decay is not too traumatic, but in this type of game the precision given by a high framerate is fundamental. Also noteworthy is the rain effect, which proves to be beautiful and believable, even if it doesn't reach the levels of GP3, which proves to be unsurpassed in this. Another small mention deserves the front wing, which if damaged vibrates differently depending on the speed we keep. Unfortunately the damage model isn't the best we've had the opportunity to see. Only the wheels and the spoilers can be lost, while the rest of the car remains intact, furthermore we are prevented from driving the car with a damaged wheel or suspension, given that in this case the game intervenes and takes the full tank. vehicle control. This lack of freedom is also felt in other circumstances, such as in the circumstance in which we reverse the direction of travel. Another drawback is represented by the parts of the car, which unfortunately remain on the track and which can be hit by the cars. I say unfortunately, because there is no red flag, nor is anyone involved in removing these dangerous debris, which in this way remain on the track until an unfortunate car hits it. Everyone on track! Well now let's analyze what are the cream for a Racing game: the driving model and the controls. Obviously I'm referring to the expert mode, i.e. the one without the aids, given that it is the one that interests enthusiasts the most and which represents the real test of 9 for a simulator (after all, aids can always be inserted, right? Dunno, it seems too much obvious!and let's move on! ). Remember my initial talk about ~real~ simulations? Well if you have that in mind then the F1RC driving model is really great. The car behaves very realistically and responds to our commands just like we expect an F1 car to do. It's easy to see the inside front wheel smoking due to loss of grip, or having big problems metering the accelerator when exiting slow corners. The behavior of the suspension is also remarkable, and I must say that compared to the Beta version, the car warns of the grip limit reached in good time. The engine is no different, proving to be low in torque at low revs, only to explode above 10,000 rpm! So the physics engine, compared to that of GP3, is decidedly better, while it stands at levels similar to that of F1 2000 CS (remember that the driving model of the EA game is perhaps the only real reason to praise this title). The controls are no different, as well as being widely customizable they prove to be magnificently functional. A praise goes to the Force Feedback which stands at decidedly high levels, certainly not perfect (for example the steering does not harden with the increase in speed), but it proves to be a good tradesman. Furthermore, it should be noted the presence of the clutch, even if the F1 cars use this device in a very limited way, and finally the presence of a special key that allows spinning. The whole part concerning the car settings was also well done with a myriad of values from which to choose the most suitable ones for our needs, moreover the cars have different performances and the right number of gears are also correctly reported. It must also be said that excessive technicality is not in the spirit of the game, but in this way the enthusiast is given the opportunity to modify even the smallest details. On the other hand, what hasn't convinced me are the sounds, even if I bet that new ones will soon be found on the net. Furthermore, with great pleasure, I note that telemetry has reappeared and proves to be a very useful tool for fine-tuning the car in the hands of the more expert, well for the others all that remains is to download the setups that can be easily found on the sites that deal with simulators. Multiplayer? Multiplayer! Multiplayer!? One of the most talked about aspects of the Ubi Soft title is multiplayer, especially the one oriented to games via the Internet, given that the split-screen mode is of interest to few. So this blessed multiplayer is there or isn't there? The answer is: boh! I understand that it is the answer that no one expects to hear from a reviewer, but believe me it is not possible at the moment to give a clear and definitive answer. Let me explain. Originally F1RC does not support a suitable protocol for Internet play, as it has the TCP/IP and IPX protocols but oriented to local network play, however it is also possible to compete with suitable clients (downloadable on the net almost everywhere) style Kali, which allow you to use the IPX protocol for Internet connections as well. Now why Ubi Soft has opted for such a solution is not clear (it has even come to hypothesize a direct inference from the FIA who does not want an F1 game to be made via the Internet) but nothing is known exactly about it . In any case, the mystery remains dense, and in any case the scenario that emerges from it is, at least, singular, given that it will be left to the initiative of the usual Internet players to find a valid solution to make the game usable even on the large net. We are careful and therefore as soon as we know something we will inform you immediately. The other aspect of the multiplayer game, which boasts an enormous diffusion and which has given rise to countless rankings, consists in the Hot-Lap competitions and which in fact represent an alternative to the On-Line race. In this F1RC is very advanced and allows you to save replays that contain a lot of information on the characteristics of the lap, even the type of controller used is even highlighted. But that's not all, for the first time in an F1 game of this type it is possible to use the famous Ghost Cars, i.e. the replay of a performance that appears in the form of a ~ghost~ car that serves us as a direct reference on the track . What if Multiplayer doesn't interest me? Well on this it is not that we can expect big news, and the game modes in Single Player are the usual. What needs to be highlighted is the behavior of the cars driven by theCPUs that lend themselves to numerous criticisms. First of all they do everything to avoid accidents! Indeed, they look like Kamikazes eager to sink their opponents at the cost of their own lives. In addition, one can witness absolutely unrealistic overtaking and a race conduct that is not exactly beyond reproach. Conversely, the starts are beautiful, with the cars opening out convincingly like a fan, unfortunately everything is partly ruined by the aforementioned homicidal tendency of the AI, which very often causes an accident. In any case, Ubi Soft has already announced the release of a patch (even before the game is distributed!) which should partly correct these unpleasant drawbacks. I also take this opportunity to highlight the excellent game interface, which provides us, in real time, with a whole series of useful information on our performance, with gaps from our opponents, lap times and anything else that can be useful. Checkered Flag! F1RC is one of those titles that must be bought by F1 lovers, simply because it is absolutely the best game of modern F1 and I think that's enough. The problems that afflict it do not greatly affect the value which remains at decidedly high levels. On the other hand, there is already news that a patch which, among other things, should improve the A.I. is almost being published, and this demonstrates a considerable attention from Ubi Soft towards this product. Well, we said what there was to say, now it's your turn! Red, Red, Red, Red, Red... go!!! We finally got our hands on the definitive version of F1RC by Ubisoft that the transalpine giant kindly sent us and that we immediately proceeded to install on our cars ehmm, sorry on our PCs. As you may have noticed, we have always followed this title with great interest and have dedicated numerous articles to it, however I want to anticipate that for once a software house has kept its promises, tangibly fixing the problems that had arisen with the beta version. But let's go in order, on the other hand, there's not really a lot of meat to put on the fire.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
