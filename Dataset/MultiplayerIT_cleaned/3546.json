{"name": "Tomb Raider Reloaded", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-reloaded-recensione.html", "text": "The value of a brand like Tomb Raider does not need to be explained: regardless of the fate of the latest productions starring Lara Croft, the character created in 1996 by Core Design has largely transcended the boundaries of the gaming market to become part of the imaginary pop, and the 600 million dollars paid by Amazon to acquire the rights demonstrate it. The story of Tomb Raider on mobile was probably less traumatic than other equally popular characters and series, see for example the re-editions of the classic chapters and the solid strategic interpretation of Lara Croft GO. But now it's the turn of something different, specifically the adventure of a cartoony and practically ~chibi~ Lara, the protagonist of a free-to-play single stick shooter. A failed experiment or a pleasant surprise? We tell you everything in the Tomb Raider Reloaded review. Gameplay: Shoot me, Lara Tomb Raider Reloaded, Lara dodges bullets and attacks back What the heck is a single stick shooter? It is an entirely mobile simplification of the twin stick shooter, those shooters that use both sticks of a controller to move the character on one side, direct the shot on the other. In this case there is only one (virtual) stick and it is used to pilot the movement, but as soon as you stop, an automatic attack starts towards the closest target. The most famous representative of the category is probably Survivor!.io (here the review ), who took that kind of approach to extremes in a survival structure that quickly becomes frenetic and complex. Tomb Raider Reloaded does not choose to travel that same route and instead prefers a more reasoned action, with individual rooms that need to be cleaned up within increasingly longer and more complex sequences. It is therefore played with a single finger, moving Lara within a scenario that develops vertically (as well as the device, which must be kept in portrait mode) and which is filled from time to time with more or less plausible wild animals: a reference, this, to the classic episodes of Tomb Raider, where the shrewd explorer often found herself facing even huge dinosaurs. There is no shortage of particularly difficult sections and boss fights, but a twin stick solution would certainly have been more pleasant. By overcoming the stages and collecting enough points, we are allowed to choose an upgrade from a list of three options, which makes our character more and more powerful and effective on the single progression. However, there are a whole series of permanent improvements that can be unlocked between one expedition and another, by changing the equipped weapon and improving it or making the equipment more robust and richer. Structure: lots of irons in the fire and lots of microtransactions Tomb Raider Reloaded, the upgrades obtainable along the way Tomb Raider Reloaded is available in two versions on the App Store and Google Play, both free but with some differences: the first adopts the classic freemium format, with the entire set of microtransactions; the second is reserved for Netflix subscribers and sets the only limit on the traditional system of tickets that are used up with each attempt, requiring you to wait for them to be recharged if they run out. From this point of view, the structure of the game offers a large number of contents and a campaign that appears very full-bodied, supported by special events that try to add a pinch of variety to the formula, but at the same time there is a lot of space dedicated to unlockables and the specter of microtransactions hovers over the experience, although in the early hours this combination does not it seemed limiting to us. Technical realization: the little Lara Tomb Raider Reloaded, a fight sequence As mentioned at the beginning, Tomb Raider Reloaded uses a cartoonish graphic style, very cute and colorful, with a Lara Croft in a ~chibi~ version, i.e. with the proportions of a little girl. Although it may seem a bit blasphemous, the final result appears surprisingly nice and pays homage to the origins of the series by making the protagonist perform in climbing and acrobatic jumps at the end of each level. As regards the design of the scenarios and enemies the situation is less brilliant and is somewhat lacking in terms of visual variety, while remaining on a more than discrete level, while the music that accompanies the action is a real revelation, ~adventurous~ and engaging as one would perhaps expect from a more serious experience.", "date": "2023-02-19", "grade": "7.5"}
