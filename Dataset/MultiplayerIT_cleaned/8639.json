In this case, 49Games and Deep Silver try with Summer Stars 2012, a title with a clear ~Olympic~ inspiration that allows us to try our hand at eighteen classic sports disciplines, divided into various categories. Specifically: running (100m dash, 200m dash, 400m dash, 110m hurdles), throw (javelin and hammer), jump (high, pole, long, triple), sports aquatics (10m platform diving, 100m freestyle swimming, 100m butterfly swimming), archery (70m compound or 50m recurve), trampoline, mountain biking (on three courses) and foil. Each type of sport has different controls, but always based on motion detection and therefore on the Wii-mote / Nunchuk combination. Let's take running for example: when our athlete positions himself on the starting ramp, we have to press down on the analog stick on the Nunchuk to ~load~ an indicator, trying however not to let it go beyond the threshold before the start. Once the judge has sanctioned the start of the race, we will have to alternately shake the two controllers as if they were our legs, producing more speed depending on the pace, until we cross the finish line. Olympic discipline par excellence, running is tackled in Summer Stars 2012 in a very physical and engaging way, it can be really demanding over long distances but produce a great sense of satisfaction if we manage to set a new record. The career of the athlete The fulcrum of the 49Games product lies in the career mode, which sees us control a pair of athletes (male and female) engaged in a substantial sequence of tests of various kinds. The amount of disciplines that you have to grapple with to complete this mode is truly enormous, in short, it requires quite a few hours and allows us to unlock achievements (here called ~challenges~), as well as certain events within the mode ~ free game~. The latter represents the ~party~ soul of the game, since it allows us to challenge relatives and friends in a competitive multiplayer for up to four players via split-screen, an element that certainly represents the most interesting part in the casual offer of Summer Stars 2012. Unfortunately, however, the value of the challenge can decrease depending on the sport we are dealing with. Archery, for example, is translated on the screen in a very limited way: once again the pressure of the analog stick downwards, which triggers the starting maneuver of the character and therefore the tension of the bow, with the pointer infrared of the Wii-mote who simply has to frame the target for a few seconds, or the time needed to shoot the arrow. The difficulty is the vibration, which simulates the trembling of tense muscles and makes it more difficult to place a shot in the center of the target; but the whole operation, we repeat, appears a little too limited and lacking depth. From this point of view, the high jump appears more convincing: the controllers must be shaken at the right moment to give the greatest possible thrust to the athlete's run, who then jumps when we shake the Wii-mote and Nunchuk upwards, looking for to pass the bar without touching it. Ups and downs As it was reasonable to expect, the sports featured in Summer Stars 2012 alternate more or less engaging and more or less excited phases: some disciplines leave something to be desired in terms of how they were represented, while others definitely have their own why and also indulge in quick time event style. As in the case of the trampoline, where our character, once he has achieved sufficient momentum, must produce a series of movements while he is in mid-air: this happens only if we carry out the maneuvers shown on the screen in the right sequence, without committing errors. Too bad that the sensitivity of the controller does not always prove to be up to the task, with a directional shake that may not be detected correctly. The same type of solution turns out to be bad for foil, probably the least successful discipline of the package, while for mountain biking the developers have resorted to fairly trivial ideas. The final picture is therefore that of a discreet title, with ups and downs, which on the one hand allows us to ~let off steam~, alone or above all with friends, in the typical manner of old-fashioned sports games, on the other hand it must accounts with a part of the ind experiencedumbly subdued and, ultimately, very little fun. Furthermore, from the point of view of the target user, the absence of an Italian translation of the dialogues is surprising, while the technical sector, in its entirety, proves to be decent without overdoing it. In conclusion, Summer Stars 2012 is a recommended product if the genre attracts you a lot and you want to try your hand at a bit of ~racing~ at breakneck speed in multiplayer, but if you expect a minimum of thickness and uniformity, better look for something of different.
