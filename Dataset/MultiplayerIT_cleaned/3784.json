{"name": "The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-lego-movie-2-videogame-recensione.html", "text": "The LEGO Movie was a revelation, one of those films that no one believed could work and instead, in the end, was not only so much fun, but also managed to convey an important and ageless message about the value of imagination. The LEGO Movie 2 has lost some of that magic, but still managed to be a satisfying sequel for all fans of Emmet, Lucy and company: considering the success of the two films, it was obvious that TT Games would develop a tie- in video game again this time. If the first The LEGO Movie Videogame had managed to carve out a small but interesting space in the British developer's curriculum, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame unfortunately fails in the same intent. Let's see why. The game is not wonderful It must be admitted that TT Games - indeed, TT Fusion - has tried at least to revolutionize a little the tested formula that has accompanied us for more than ten years through countless franchises: despite all the good will, and the concrete need to innovate now trite mechanics and hackneyed, what was introduced in The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame convinced us little, so much so that we even consider it a step backwards compared to the latest LEGO games such as LEGO DC Super-villains. The setting has remained more or less very similar: the game is divided into a series of worlds inspired by the film and what we will have to do, in the role of Emmet, Lucy and the other characters that will gradually unlock like the legendary Batman, it will essentially solve the problems of the various inhabitants. In an old school LEGO game we would probably have to switch characters as needed, using their unique abilities to solve a puzzle and unlock new areas and rewards. Part of the appeal of those games was this ~loop~ that led us to find new characters to explore already completed levels in search of hidden collectibles. In The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame there is almost no difference between the various characters, because most of the puzzles are solved using the gadgets and blueprints used to build gadgets or other structures with LEGO bricks. To put out a fire we won't have to impersonate a particular hero or heroine, but only build the necessary hydrant. This type of solution opens the door to a more open world structure that TT Games has already experimented with in its latest titles, for example LEGO The Incredibles. And in fact The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is much more reminiscent of the ~toys-to-life~ LEGO Worlds of some time ago and also uses the same engine. Respecting the film that inspired it, the new title from the British developer takes place in worlds made entirely of bricks where almost everything can be destroyed. On the one hand, this sacrosanct choice guarantees much greater involvement and freedom of movement; on the other hand, however, the various worlds appeared dull and poor in detail, as if they had been designed and built in an amateur way. The level design is confusing and immature in general, especially as regards the division into main and side missions, even if we liked the bosses a lot, even if they are very few. In fact, the most important missions reward you with the main collectible pieces which, collected in a certain amount, unlock the next world and allow you to continue with the story. Lootboxes and lootbugs You soon realize that there isn't even a real storyline to follow. The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame tends to retrace the script of the film of the same name, but it does so in a detached and incompetent way, using some kinematics and above all delegating most of the narration to abstract and off-screen dialogues that describe what happened in the film without showing it to us. In short, anyone who hasn't gone to the cinema could feel quite confused, and this inexplicable choice ruins the light-hearted atmosphere of the title, transforming it into a kind of cross between a sandbox and a treasure hunt simulator for its own sake. By completing some tasks or simply sifting through every corner of the various worlds, you come across special chests that contain collectibles in quantities and memorabilia, special bricks that can be exchanged at the appropriate shops for new gadgets, characters to control or vehicles to use. There is a system - not particularly elaborate, actually - that allows you to find the memorabilia without breaking a sweat, making us buy them in exchange for bricks or recycling the duplicates into components that form further memorabilia, but however long-lived this aspect of the game - there are so many characters, vehicles and objects to find -in the end it becomes redundant and irrelevant, especially since many of these collectibles are completely anonymous. In this sense, it almost seems that a large part of the game exists as a function of some customizable worlds where the player is free to build whatever he wants using previously unlocked bricks and blueprints, almost like Minecraft, but this is an uninteresting feature - considering that creations cannot be shared online, then - which is based on a structure that does not particularly encourage you to discover new collectibles, especially when it often happens to come across software crashes, bugs that lock the character into the environment and force us on restarting the game, glitches that corrupt saves and so on. LEGO games have often lent their side to below average quality control, but in this sense The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is one of the grossest.", "date": "2019-03-03", "grade": "5.0"}
