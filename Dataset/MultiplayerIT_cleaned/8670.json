So let's see if the title has the characteristics to stand out in the crowd or if it will simply remain one of many. Chip and Dale to whom? The first approach with Little Acorns is not the best, and not because the title presents itself with an unsatisfactory technical realization, far from it: we are faced with a game that is aesthetically even too colorful, lively and light-hearted to be able to think that it can offer offer genuine entertainment to anyone past childhood. Mr. Nibbles seems to have come straight out of a Cartoon Network series, and moves with deliberately minimalist animations within scenarios with a basic architecture which, however, do not spare themselves in the use of the brightest shades of the palette. All accompanied by a sound sector that stands out above all for a pleasant funky-style musical carpet, which it is no coincidence that the initial screen strongly recommends listening using earphones. However, appearances are often deceiving, and this is the case with Little Acorns, which behind a childish appearance hides an absolutely enjoyable gameplay and a design that many other colleagues dream of. The game is a very old-fashioned platform, which in some ways could recall the antediluvian Mario Bros, with levels that develop in height decorated almost exclusively by simple horizontal platforms. The purpose of each stage is to collect all the acorns present before the countdown expires, in order to unlock the door that leads to the exit, paying close attention to the obstacles and enemies scattered here and there. This main objective is accompanied by some secondary ones dedicated to users more accustomed to challenges: it is a question of completing the levels by beating the time set by the developers, or gather all the little ones of Mr. Nibbles or even collect the five fruits that appear after having recovered the acorns, essential for unlocking costumes and gadgets with which to embellish the protagonist squirrel. Considering how the game offers the beauty of 60 stages (which will surely see an increase with future updates), it is evident how Little Acorns can offer a more than satisfactory amount of content for anyone who is passionate about its gameplay. And it is objectively easy to be captured by the Chillingo production, mainly thanks to a successful level design and a simple and very reliable control system. It is sufficient to act on only the three virtual keys on the screen to run in both directions and jump, fulfilling all the main needs of the gameplay. The levels do their duty admirably, often offering situations of symmetry that force the user to go up on one side and down on the other to collect all the acorns: all enlivened by some pleasant races against end-of-level bosses and a series of power-ups useful to temporarily emphasize some skills of Mr. Nibbles.", "date": "2012-03-16", "grade": "8.4"}
