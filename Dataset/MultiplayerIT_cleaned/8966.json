{"name": "TMNT: Splintered Fate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tmnt-splintered-fate-recensione.html", "text": "The roguelike-style action RPG has become a kind of new standard on which developers, especially in the indie arena, make variations, improvisations and virtuosities to taste. Mobile productions are also grafted into this sort of videogame jazz, which often arrive late or bring with them particular specific needs to be adapted, but can still result in interesting solutions, if only for the type of use which is unique and can provide a extra gear. The review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate must take place in this perspective, because there is no doubt that Super Evil Megacorp's game is heavily indebted to Hades, but this does not mean that it should be demoted to a mere negligible clone. we are talking about the Ninja Turtles: the reference world and its characters have an undeniable charisma, which manages to emerge convincingly in the constant narration that accompanies the game action. The story is based on a hackneyed canvas: Master Splinter has disappeared and it seems that Shredder and the Foot Clan are behind the crime, for a change. In short, the premises do not really represent the avant-garde videogame narrative, but it is the dialogues that hold everything together in a convincing way, the typical banter (that is, the chatter between the characters) able to accurately capture the different characterizations of the four fighters. We have to choose one of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo and set out in search of the lost mentor, facing levels, enemies and bosses in succession according to the typical rogue-lite scheme but with a certain reference to the scrolling fighting game which is the element typical for the series. An idea that could certainly lead to greater originality than a slavish repetition of certain elements already seen, but which still represents a very interesting proposal in the Apple Arcade catalog. Gameplay already seen, but still valid TMNT: Splintered Fate, a fight scene On the gameplay front, the reference to Hades is clear, but the reference is in general to the whole rogue-lite sub-genre in its new meaning which provides for a basic progression in the face of the constant threat of ~semi-permanent death~, for so to speak. Once the character has been selected, we find ourselves facing levels in sequence within the typical settings of the series, going from the sewers to the roofs of New York, with mini-bosses and major bosses arranged at regular intervals so as to mark the progression and provide fundamental nodes of passage in history. Every time a section ends, just like in the Supergiant game, we can choose a bonus to apply from the options proposed, boosting some statistics or expanding the possibilities of attack and defense. The progress thus obtained is lost when game over arrives, which inexorably sends us back to the hideout of the Ninja Turtles forcing us to start again, but by investing special coins that are earned in combat it is possible to unlock some permanent upgrades. The action takes place along the lines of the hack and slash action RPG, even if we are quite close to the scrolling fighting game in terms of rhythm and tactics: it is a question of alternating the basic attack - linked to the specific weapons of each of the four main characters - with additional and support skills, which can be activated by respecting the recharge at the simple push of a button. Great tactics are not required in dealing with enemies and bosses, but a certain skill in timing and above all in the use of dodging becomes indispensable in order to survive in the more advanced levels. TMNT Splintered Fate features various enemies and bosses Given the fast pace and the need to act quickly and precisely, the controller remains the recommended choice for tackling TMNT: Splintered Fate, but to tell the truth, the developers have also done a great job with the touch screen controls, making them responsive and rather conveniently placed, even if they become more and more complex as the screen size decreases. The presence of cooperative multiplayer is noteworthy, which in a game of this kind can make a big difference in terms of involvement. The display itself becomes a discriminating element in order to play at its best: the graphic style adopted is simple and clean, with good characterization which refers to the colors and atmospheres typical of the Ninja Turtles but the small size of the characters and some elements on the screen can make it difficult to discern the action best on smartphones. For the rest, on the aesthetic front, the 2D elements that recall thehe classic tradition of comics, as well as excellent English dubbing for the protagonists.", "date": "2023-05-18", "grade": "7.5"}
