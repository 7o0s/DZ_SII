They are all games that for some reason make us visit a rather unusual place: Burma or rather, Myanmar. A Southeast Asian state ruled by a military junta that has only recently timidly discovered the joys of free thought. Burma isn't just a place to shoot at anything that moves or sneak in silently, with its jungles filled with, we assume, mystery cults it's the perfect setting for a game that's all about fear. This is precisely the goal of The Falling Sun, an indie title available on Steam Greenlight which tells the unfortunate story of an English officer during the Second World War, whose mission is to unravel the mystery of a missing battalion. The Falling Sun takes us to a jungle full of zombies and mysteries You jump on the chair The title is still in the early access phase, indeed, judging by the current state, quite early, given that the audio and video rendering of the game is decidedly crude. So rough that from the first minutes of the game you have the feeling of playing a title from many years ago, which has come down to us thanks to a mysterious magical portal. An experience between amarcord and ~did I go back in time?~ which could confuse less experienced players. Paradoxically, the greatest fear that The Falling Sun manages to instill in the heart of a thirty year old is that the last 15 years have not passed, he returned in 2000 and still has to take his final exams. Seriously, despite a ~simple~ graphic design that risks making you feel little part of the setting, The Falling Sun still manages to scare, but usually it does it in the most banal way possible: with screams and sudden appearances of monsters lurking behind the corner. Great merit of the atmosphere goes to the sound sector, the quality of which however fluctuates. On the one hand the ambient noises, the sudden screams and grunts of the creatures really manage to make the blood freeze in the veins, on the other hand the amateur acting of the protagonist (he even blows into the microphone, come on!) and an average audio quality decidedly low, both in terms of sound and programming, they remind us that we are dealing with a decidedly modest video game. The Falling Sun is broken up into small, very narrow sections, made up of corridors, dungeons and some outdoor sessions (i.e. corridors masked by vegetation) in which you have to go from point A to point B without being touched by what is hidden in the shadow, or half-fleshed zombies who run very badly, on pain of instant death. Well yes, once again the Nazis tried to win the war by mixing esotericism and corpses, cursed! After the first levels, in which the threats almost always arrive head-on and being widely announced by a scream, it will happen more and more often to find monsters hidden around the corner, ready to jump on us at the slightest distraction. Unfortunately the fact that these are always in the same position makes the game very ~trial & error~. Once you understand the position of the beast on duty, it takes a moment to eliminate it and move on to the next one. Fortunately, there will be a gun to help us with which to make the undead understand that perhaps there is no need to disturb an English officer in the performance of his duties. It's a pity that the minimalist interface doesn't present any type of indication on ammunition, targets or any other type of useful information. Maybe it's a way to make the game more realistic and difficult, too bad it gives the whole thing a further feeling of incompleteness. For the moment The Falling Sun is a graphically poor title that can be captivating for lovers of easy thrills. During the two sections available, some jumping on the chair is undoubtedly guaranteed, provided you overlook the dated graphics and a very simple structure of the levels and missions. Perhaps his greatest flaw, however, is that he immediately reveals his only card: monsters. Once you understand how they are made, where they are and how they move, the game quickly loses interest and becomes a simple move through very bare environments to the next checkpoint. To get a real survival horror there is still a lot of work to do.", "date": "2015-04-17", "grade": null}
