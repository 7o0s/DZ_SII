Having said that, the charm of ~ultra arcade~ seems to regardless of how many buttons you have to press to play, and in this specific case RedLynx (formerly responsible for the spectacular Trials HD for Xbox Live Arcade) shows us how to make a product with thickness, fun and immersive by basing the controls on the tilt of the Apple device alone. To be honest, in Monster Trucks Nitro 2 there is also the possibility of adjusting the speed of the vehicle by acting on a bar located at the bottom of the screen, but in practice we had no problems adjusting it to the maximum and leaving it like this for all the stages. A useless feature? Size matters The twenty challenges found within the only game mode available are each made up of three different stages: you have to pass them three times and always cross the finish line first to unlock the highest possible award. It is clear that each stage corresponds to a level of difficulty, which takes the form of the presence of a ~ghost~ that we must try to anticipate and beat before the race ends. The first four events are free to enter, while the following ones require a sum of money to enter. Not bad, however: just win a few races to raise the necessary money, and in the worst case scenario you can always stick to the same level until our finances won't allow us to move on. Each challenge corresponds to a different monster truck, but generally we will have to deal with three categories: medium-sized and fast vehicles, lighter and more agile ones and bigger, slower and heavier ones. You race using a fixed side view, trying to collect all the boosts on the track to be ready when a jump occurs. At this juncture, we can produce aerial rotations which, if well executed, automatically translate into an additional boost once we land. Attempting a stunt with the heaviest monster trucks isn't the best of ideas, however, and in fact the challenges featuring slow vehicles are based mostly on memorizing the scenario and its obstacles, which we will have to try to overcome as quickly as possible possible, without wasting precious seconds. The situation is different for the lighter and faster monster trucks, which by dint of collecting boosts turn into real rockets, difficult to keep glued to the ground. Power is nothing without control As mentioned at the beginning, Monster Trucks Nitro 2 uses almost exclusively the accelerometer for controls: once the speed has been adjusted on the touch screen by acting on the relative bar, in fact, we have to worry exclusively about tilting the iPhone to the right or left to load the weight of the vehicle on the front and rear respectively. During normal running these operations do not produce extraordinary results, but as soon as you collect a boost or make a jump, things change substantially, and the degree of inclination of the device dictates the direction and speed of rotation, as well as the wheel alignment before returning to the ground. Furthermore, in the presence of obstacles to overcome, the way in which we manage the position of the monster truck proves to be of fundamental importance: knocking down a wall after having ~wheelie~ is one thing, doing it with the bonnet on the ground proves to be counterproductive. The gameplay reveals numerous similarities with the aforementioned Trials HD, even if the protagonist vehicles are very different: in that case they were motocross bikes, much more agile and devoted to aerial maneuvers. Despite the precision required, moreover, the not very steep learning curve is surprising: to pass even the advanced stages without problems, just do a few minutes of practice, even if it must be said that the experience can be anything but relaxing . Technically a good job has been done: the narrative voice in English explains how to play and underlines the goodness of our performances, while the rest of the sound acts as a side dish. The graphics are of good quality, with the vehicles appearing convincing and quite detailed, while the scenery moves up and down.
