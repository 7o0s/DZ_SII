{"name": "Steel Battalion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/steel-battalion.html", "text": "Steel Battalion I especially want to underline that the view is always good, to the detriment of many criticisms made by some reviewers; therefore, even if you don't have a television of, I quote the words: at least 32 inches !, I can assure you that viewing is always optimal (obviously, excluding the 15 inch in the kitchen, don't exaggerate!). The combat system is one of the most realistic and simulative (as far as they can be) ever seen in a similar video game. Being bipedal mechs, if you find yourself hitting a lower wall with a ~paw~, you can even trip over it and fall! You will always move at a not too high speed, considering the size and weight of this war machine, and each movement will always be moderate, giving the real sensation of moving a steel arm or leg weighing several tons. However, I'm sorry to contradict again those who say that Tekki's controller is difficult to use and difficult to control: I can give two different testimonies to the contrary, one purely technical and one trivial. For that technique, it is easy to say: since the controller is very bulky, you necessarily have to get comfortable as if you were driving a car. Steel Battalion The Super Controller The controller is also composed of a pedal, complete with accelerator and brake. Just take a position similar to the one you have in the car, and that's it! As for remembering the 40 buttons that the controller is equipped with, just think that on the left knob there is only the analog lever to look around, and on the right a button and a trigger, one to fire the missiles and the other for the machine gun. The rest of the keys will light up when they need to be used handy, right? The trivial testimony instead concerns a sample of friends who came to my house to try the aforementioned game: out of five people, only one took half an hour to figure out what he was playing, he lost the first ten minutes to figure out what the accelerator was used to make the robot walk; all the others were extremely satisfied with the precision, solidity and sense of mastery of the vehicle that is acquired by playing, almost like actually driving it! Furthermore, the forty keys and the two knobs are equipped with an automatic gearbox which is used to make your giant advance more or less quickly.at least, they spared us the clutch! Steel Battalion Bag and baggage.. It is one of the flaws, so to speak, from which the game suffers. There aren't many weapons, and as you progress through the missions you won't acquire many. They will boil down to different types of machine guns, rocket launchers, missile launchers, and the ever-present lightsaber to hit enemy mechs up close. On the other hand, the ones they offer us are devastating, including the basic machine gun on the right arm of the mech. The gameplay is not affected, everything takes place in a frenetic and fully satisfying way both for lovers of pure action and for those who like to do targeted actions. You will not enjoy a moment's break; although you will find yourself in each mission alongside a team, they will go to fight from a completely different part of the game map, leaving you with an area with hordes of enemies to take down; you will go from destroying a fortress, to shooting down aerial bombers, up to measuring yourself against other robots similar to yours. Real-time graphics ? Noooo, Full Motion Video!!!! Definitely, one of the biggest strengths of the game. Despite the color palette limited to grayish tones, Tekki displays a level of detail of real-time 3D graphics never seen before. And I'm not just talking about the light and explosion effects (never seen such realistic special effects in a videogame), but also about the geo-mod this title enjoys (the geo-mod is a programming technique that involves structural modification of the scenario or of the objects that make up the game). Yes because, every architecture that is destroyed, be it a control tower, be it a building, be it a tank, be it a wall, changes and is destroyed as in reality. Let me give the example of the airport control tower: it will not just collapse and explode, but will gradually detach at all its joints, until it bends, collapses and then explodes. However, the level of detail is so high that you will never know when an FMV starts or ends, so little is the difference! Everything remains at a constant frame rate without any slowdown. Steel Battalion Final comment. We are facing a true masterpiece of the genre, and it will certainly be difficult to imitate this product by other h softwareouse. It is no coincidence that the Capcom team chose Xbox for this project, even though they are aware of the distrust that Japanese gamers have for this console. A title with attention to the smallest details, practically almost free from defects, one of a kind. The too high cost will make many turn up their noses, but I recommend sacrificing a few more purchases to have this title, because there will hardly be many other high quality products like this in the future, or at least, they will be rare. Also recommended for non-fans of the genre, who will be troubled by the fact that a game they would never have played will have the power to keep them glued to the screen. The most original and controversial Capcom title of all time is here, finally in our hands. After the award for best innovative technology for videogames, the pros and cons criticisms, the truth about this title from Xboxitalia just for you! War yes, but with style! To say that Tekki has its own style, and is one of a kind, is an understatement. A game with a simple plot, but with non-violent content (although it is a war game, the clashes will only take place against tanks, planes, mechs, etc.) which manages to make the player identify with it like no other video game created so far. Set in an unspecified place and time, you will find yourself driving a mighty 5 meter high mech in a continuous struggle for survival. The game will start with a mini training session, through which you will be allowed to learn the control system to tackle the real missions. The view is always from the cockpit (from the inside), and everything is taken care of down to the smallest detail: ammunition menu, weapons, fire extinguisher, radar: one gets the impression of actually driving the mech, even if there isn't even one specimen that can be touched by hand (unfortunately!). Although the view cannot be changed from first to third person, you will still have control of the situation around you thanks to a masterful use of an analog stick located on the left knob; control that you can refine by also following the information that the radar passes you and the team of robots that will accompany you during the missions.", "date": "2002-12-06", "grade": null}
