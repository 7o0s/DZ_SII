{"name": "Apex Legends per PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/apex-legends-pc-recensione.html", "text": "Apex Legends is crunching numbers at a frightening speed, the result of a very well planned strategy by Electronic Arts: the surprise launch that defused weeks of toxic discussions on microtransactions and prize boxes, the quality of gameplay strongly linked to the system used for the excellent Titanfall, a mix of elements that draw on the best competitive shooters and a clear talent, that of the guys from Respawn Entertainment, in crafting an experience capable of combining immediacy and depth, accessible to all but far from trivial to be mastered in its many dynamics. Less than three weeks have passed since the milestone of 50 million players and the many rumors about the debut of Season 1, the Battle Pass and the new character, Octane: now that finally all the pieces of the puzzle fit together, it seemed right to analyze them in the scope of a new review of Apex Legends, focused this time on the PC version of the game. Get your mouse and keyboard ready or grab the controller if you're really daring, then: it's time to launch once again into the Canyon of the Kings. What's new in Apex Legends Let's start immediately with the updates of the last few hours, represented as mentioned by the debut of Octane, the start of Season 1 and the release of the Battle Pass. All these elements have been the subject of various rumors and leaks in recent weeks that have anticipated their characteristics, but clearly touching them was different. The new character, purchasable with 950 Apex Coins or 12,000 Legend Tokens just like Caustic and Mirage, is a former amateur stuntman, the bored son of a pharmaceutical company tycoon, who one day takes one too many risks and ends up losing his legs. Thanks to Lifeline's intervention, the boy gets a pair of high-tech bionic prosthetics that make him faster than he's ever been. At that point, posting stunts on social networks was no longer enough for him, and so he decided to try his luck in the Apex Games under the name of Octane, equipped with a passive ability that allows him to heal faster, an active ability that amplifies his rapidity of movement thanks to a shot of adrenaline and an Ultimate which consists in the creation of a trampoline capable of projecting him to great heights. These are features with a consistent specific weight in the context of a strategy devoted to touch and run with a tendency towards stalking: thanks to the launchpad, the character can quickly reach the roofs of the tallest buildings and wait for other players to pass by to target them from the distance, perhaps with precision equipment, and at the same time escape very quickly from complicated situations with a jump or fleeing like hell using the Stim ability. Titled Wild Frontier, Season 1 of Apex Legends works like other competitive multiplayer games and is therefore based on the release of unique items, specifically a Wild Frontier legend skin, five Apex Packs and eighteen counters. Combined with the Battle Pass, which can be purchased as Octane at the price of 950 Apex coins but not with the Legend Tokens, therefore only using the hard currency, it allows you to take advantage of two parallel progression systems, one general and one linked precisely to the pass, for obtaining of over one hundred objects including skins, banners, intros, finishers and more. As you already know, the purchase of 1000 Apex Coins costs 9.99 euros and it is not necessary to buy the Battle Pass to participate in Season 1, although the rewards in this case are limited to the initial set only. Gameplay and structure Compared to the times of the Apex Legends console version review, Respawn Entertainment's battle royale has been the protagonist of an evolution that falls within the normal administration for this type of product: the developers have balanced some aspects and some weapons, Fixed some glitches and introduced new gear. The biggest difference compared to the beginning, however, lies in the average skill of the players, which has grown exponentially: if in the beginning it was difficult to find monsters capable of killing you with a simple glare, today the level has risen considerably and is therefore it has become much more complicated to get to the final stages of the match, even and above all without a team that supports you in a decent way. Playing alone because perhaps your companions go away on their own is equivalent to a very probable game over, given that finding yourself in front of a group of enemies can hardly have any other outcome than knocking down and elimination. It is therefore of vital importance to build dealliances, get organized with friends and prepare expeditions with a minimum of strategy and attention to the selection of characters, playing wait-and-see where possible so that the total number of participants is naturally skimmed off and taking advantage of any numerical superiority to get the better of even the stronger users. Beyond this, the dynamics have not changed but there is certainly a greater awareness of the map and its peculiarities. Specifically, we know better the areas where it is better not to be caught off guard (basically the open areas, without shelter behind which to hide in case of firefights) and the many facets that embellish the scenario, such as for example the zip lines and the transport ships stationed above the setting. The gunplay is confirmed to be solid, with a good balance in terms of precision and power of the weapons, as well as a time-to-kill that increases with the growth of the character, by obtaining higher level armor. It goes without saying that on a PC the use of the mouse and keyboard is a fundamental requirement in order to be competitive, especially in distance trading, where the speed and precision of the pointer are the masters. However, falling back on the controller in the case of a living room setup, with the computer connected to the console-style TV, does not automatically preclude victory in individual duels, especially those played in confined spaces with a shotgun. The PC version Being closely related to Titanfall 2's engine and assets, it is clear that Apex Legends is a very different battle royale from Fortnite, more complex and visually demanding. That said, as expected, the PC version is by far the best on a purely technical front and allows you to push resolution and effects to unprecedented levels compared to what is available on PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X. The enhanced models of the Sony and Microsoft consoles offer in fact very solid performance, with 60 frames per second rocky and unshakeable, but to achieve this result they have to compromise on definition. In this case, both platforms use the expedient of dynamic resolution to travel on maximum values of 1440p but often going down to lower numbers, generally 1080p or even 900p as established by the Digital Foundry analysis. On PC, with adequate hardware, the situation is clearly different: on the test configuration it was possible to opt for the fixed 1440p at 60 frames per second with all effects at maximum or select the 2160p output by activating the dynamic resolution with the same frame target. This specific option seemed to us to work much better than the launch and produces respectable results, often going to work in a range probably halfway between the two resolutions and thus returning unprecedented sharpness and impeccable fluidity, without however sacrificing quality of the image. Wanting to fine-tune the various aspects to scale the experience in the presence of less performing components, the game offers various possibilities including vertical synchrony, adaptive supersampling, amount of memory to be assigned to texture streaming, texture filtering, ambient occlusion quality and anti-aliasing, various shadow quality, volumetric lighting, polygonal model details, impact marks, and ragdolls. In short, there is really a lot of irons in the fire but don't expect to run Apex Legends on a notebook designed for other purposes: we tried using the game on a Matebook X but even at minimum values it was too jerky to be enjoyed with dignity. Little to say about the sound sector, valid but essential and therefore completely functional to the action: the music has personality to spare, the effects are full-bodied at the right point and the voices of the characters appear guessed and easily recognizable.", "date": "2019-03-23", "grade": "8.5"}
