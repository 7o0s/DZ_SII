{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2001_a.html", "text": "It's like a story you've heard before! Thanks to the rich budgets of the gaming giant, the programmers have managed to obtain the exploitation of the image of Tiger Woods, the black god of world golf, the one who has managed to break down any type of pre-existing record, not satisfied with this acquisition we find a roster including all current stars of golf, including Justin Leonard, Brad Faxon, Robert Damron, Stewart Cink, Mark Calcavecchia, just to name a few. Many modes few innovations! The modes available are those already present in the PSX version: play stroke, match, skins, tournament games and an original ~play now~ mode that will allow you to compete on different scenarios from time to time. Unfortunately, as has already occurred in other transpositions from PSX to PS2, beyond a graphic restyling, the game has remained substantially the same, and surely the programmers could have implemented new modes and modified the shot loading system, which despite the evolution of the platforms, remains almost stationary at the three touches of the joypad. The graphics are at excellent levels, players rendered completely in 3D using the Motion Capture technique, so dear to mother E.A. A remarkable attention to detail can be found by seeing the backdrops of the three available circuits (Spyglass Hill, Poppy Hills, and Pebble Beach), you can notice the variable weather conditions, the wind that moves the leaves and other such goodies. The gameplay offers several uninnovative modes already found in previous series! The analog controller is used to make shots whose strength will be dosed according to the filling of the bar displayed on the game screen! Moving the analog stick right or left if pushed too hard will drastically change the direction of the ball. This apparent difficulty actually made PGA Tour more playable and accessible to various age groups. Also included is swing control known as Tiger Control in the PSOne version which will allow you to shift the direction of the ball while it is in flight after a shot. In conclusion! We are dealing with a title that brings nothing new to the series: you will always have the sensation of ~already seen~ and certainly with this assumption, spending your savings on this title will certainly not be easy, since in the months to come many money to grab the numerous Killer Applications that will invade your trusted shopkeeper. If you are an avid fan of the black god of golf give us a little thought, otherwise keep your hard-earned savings in the piggy bank waiting for something better! In conclusion! Pros: Well-crafted environments that will convey the peace and tranquility of this sport Cons: No major innovations that distinguish it from the other titles in the series It's like a story you've heard before! When a new golf game comes out on the market, we can always trace it back to one of the two philosophies that permeate sports games: we can find ourselves faced with a purely arcade title, such as Everybody Golf, or we can deal with a simulation game, in which you will have to rack your brains before you can make each shot. The latest effort by the Canadian team of E.A. Sports is linked to the second philosophy, it is no coincidence that their intent is to exploit the potential offered by the PS2 in order to create the definitive golf simulation.", "date": "2001-06-12", "grade": null}
