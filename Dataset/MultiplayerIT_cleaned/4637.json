It is not even a new name for Nintendo users in an absolute sense, because one of the conversions also involved the unfortunate Wii U. But in an ever-expanding catalog of indie titles like that of the Kyoto hybrid console, which is giving great satisfaction to its users, a game like Axiom Verge fits not only well , but fine. Brief summary: we are talking about a real declaration of love for the so-called metroidvania genre, an incredibly passionate and painstaking work carried out by a single person, such as Thomas Happ, during his spare time over the course of 5 years. Let me be clear, Happ is certainly not a fool, given that his curriculum has much more mainstream works such as Tiger Woods and NFL Street produced by Electronic Arts; but playing Axiom Verge and thinking that every area, sprites, music track and menu has been created by a single author is something amazing. Trace Aran More than a declaration of love for the Metroidvania genre, Axiom Verge is a declaration of love for Metroid. The quotes are so many that imagining Samus in the place of the protagonist, Dr. Trace catapulted into an alien world following an experiment that ended badly, is almost automatic for anyone who has lived through the 8/16-bit era. The references are above all linked to Super Metroid, even if Happ's effort does not lack a careful and personal characterization: the sense of disheartening disorientation of the first moments of the game recalls the one experienced in Another World, although one's alter ego in this case is much better equipped. In fact, from the beginning you have an arm cannon available that you can upgrade, just as you can gain new skills through which to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. In short, everything as per the regulation. However, the learning curve is quite steep, because Axiom Verge is a title expressly dedicated to expert players, the hardcore who grew up on bread and frustration with the much more probable difficulty of video games of the past than now. In this case we are not at such levels as to throw the console out the window, but still it takes a certain effort to be able to continue. Compared to the Nintendo title that it pays homage to, Axiom Verge offers a welcome addition in the combat system, or the possibility of shooting from a standstill by holding down a key, as happened in Contra. Among the most interesting moments of the gaming experience, the boss fights must undoubtedly be included, which demonstrate Happ's skills in a crystalline way as regards the element of game design: challenging, varied, fun and capable of returning a concrete sensation of contentment once the final blow has been struck. But more generally in Axiom Verge the value and importance of level design is perceived, and how much this is absolutely decisive for decreeing the fate of a product, even more so if it belongs to this genre. Switched All the quality in terms of gameplay is accompanied by an extraordinarily characterized graphic component despite the limits imposed by the style adopted, which is ideally placed halfway between the capabilities of the 8-bit and 16-bit consoles: a 12-bit we would say, with sprites and environments with limited details but often generous dimensions, accompanied by effects and parallax levels typical of the Super Nintendo. The acid colors with the dominant color palette on purple and black then outline a living, pulsating, disturbing and hostile organic world, which gets under the player's skin involving him in a total way. Bugs and glitches are used as graphic elements to better outline the cyberpunk aspect, and the result can be said to be successful. Eventually a criticism can be made to the artistic direction, which presents characters and enemies far from the iconic value of those of Metroid. The retro-themed soundtrack is also excellent. As for this conversion on Switch, obviously there are no particular technical problems: the Nintendo console therefore handles everything with ease, and the contents are practically the same as in the previous editions. Axiom Verge then goes perfectly with the use of the Kyoto hardware as a laptop, guaranteeing uncompromised enjoyment even on the move. However, the absence of new content makes the purchase advisable only for those who have not yet had the opportunity to play the title previously.", "date": "2017-10-05", "grade": "9.0"}
