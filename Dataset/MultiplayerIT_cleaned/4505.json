The Japanese publisher has in fact set up a real universe, populated by works ranging from classic additional content to encroaching on other media, as in the case of the animated feature film Kingslaive: Final Fantasy XV. The videogame field is obviously the master, even with the newly arrived Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV, a title that has caused fans to discuss since the presentation that took place during the last E3. Firstly because it is a game dedicated to virtual reality, specifically as an exclusive PlayStation 4 with PlayStation VR, secondly because it puts the fishing minigame seen in Final Fantasy XV at the center of its existence. Having put on the visor, we therefore went to find out what the waters of Eos have in store for us. Underwater demons The narrative aspect of Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV is obviously just a pretext to place this title on the world in which the main game is set, very similar to our Earth. In addition to normal fish, however, there are also demonic creatures in the waters of Eos, which the protagonist is called upon to defeat thanks to his hunting skills. The character we find ourselves controlling In Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV is none of the faces we already know, which obviously don't leave us alone between one demon hunt and another: it couldn't have been otherwise, for a operation that relies on its own fanservice to capture all those who have been fascinated by Final Fantasy XV. The first to show up is Cindy, providential at the beginning of the story in saving our protagonist's life, followed shortly after by the inevitable Noctis, ready to tell us about his passion for fishing and to relive the hunting day with us in front of the fire. Anyone who has played Final Fantasy XV will undoubtedly be pleased to be able to spend some additional time in the company of the protagonists of the main adventure, however confined to a few jokes that do not deviate Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV from its main dynamics related to fishing. From the home base that serves as the starting point for the various options and modes, the player can set off to hunt down the demons that have invaded Eos, but also choose to go fishing in complete tranquility through the free game. There are also tournaments and other types of modes, through which you can get items to customize your equipment. In general, there is little else to say about Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV: we just have to go and see how the game behaves once you put the helmet on your head. Playstation 4 trophies Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV has a total of thirty-six Trophies, including one Platinum, four Gold, ten Silver and twenty-one Bronze. A large part of them can be obtained by hunting for the various creatures present in the game, but those who want to obtain all of the objectives must be willing to recover the various collectible elements introduced by Square Enix. After all, it's a fishing game and patience is a must! Pisces come to me As imaginable, Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV provides the player with two different control alternatives for virtual fishing. In fact, it is possible to use the pair of PlayStation Move or the DualShock 4, finding ourselves in both cases mimicking the gestures we would go to make with a real fishing rod in our hands. Using the two ~ice creams~ undoubtedly becomes possible to count on a higher level of involvement, but the DualShock 4 also performs well thanks to the analog levers, as for example in the case in which we have to rewind the fishing line using the reel to bring towards of us the prey that has taken the bite. Instead, the launch takes place by mimicking the movement with the hands, determining with the latter the distance at which the bait ends up falling. It must be said in this regard that the game can't always be precise in the same way, sometimes presenting mileage launches that go well beyond our goal, while other times the bait ends up falling a few steps away from us. This also happens with a little practice behind it, a sign that the cause is probably to be found in the precision with which the controls are managed. Being able to hit the desired water area can therefore mean trying several times, repeating the same dynamics until the demon-fish we went to hunt arrives. In the latter case thefishing rod gives way to a real weapon, turning the game into a rudimentary shooter where you have to weaken the creature before pulling it out of the water. Nothing complicated to tell the truth, nor particularly striking in the way it is carried out: we would undoubtedly have appreciated the possibility of seeing a bit more diversification between the various phases of the game. From a graphic point of view, Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV presents lights and shadows: from a general glance, the settings and bodies of water resist very well the degradation imposed by PlayStation VR compared to the normal monitor, as well as the character models are represented quite well in virtual reality. The problems begin when these elements have to do with game dynamics: the most recurring defect affects the synchrony between the character model and the user's movements, which somehow end up interfering with what we see in the helmet. On more than one occasion we have seen the view ~detach~ from the body of the protagonist, seeing his disturbing headless model in front of us.", "date": "2017-12-08", "grade": "6.8"}
