{"name": "LVF 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lvf-2005.html", "text": "It doesn't often happen that you can try a title entirely developed in our country, especially when the game in question immediately demonstrates a level of quality at least comparable to that of any other world production. LVF 2004 is one of these few games. Idoru, a young software house born in 2001 based in Padua, has worked in the past on the football simulation ~Zidane Footbal Generation~, a project by the French publisher Cryo. Today Idoru returns to competitions, but this time in practically unexplored territory, offering us a complete simulation of what is the second most popular sport in the world: Volleyball. First Impact Once the game has started, the impression of being faced with a sort of yet another sports title from EA Sports becomes strong, but this is not necessarily a defect, on the contrary. The options are all at the right point and, in some sections, there is even something more than what one might expect, starting from the setting of the game difficulty which, a little like in F1 simulations, instead of the usual levels of difficulty (easy, medium and difficult), it allows us to progressively activate/deactivate a series of facilities by the computer such as automatic reception or assisted block defense. Where the title still shows a long way to go, at least in comparison to the aforementioned Electronic Arts titles, lies in the small variety of the proposed events and in the few game modes available. You don't go beyond the usual exhibition match (read friendly), the holding of an entire championship, a free tournament or a stage of the Play-Offs. There is therefore still no hint of international competitions, training section (which would be really useful, especially considering the elaborate game mechanics) or any team or player editor. First Impact Like at the sports hall LVF 2004, makes use of the official licenses of the Italian Women's Volleyball championship for the 2003/2004 season and can thus include all 12 teams of the League, together with the reproduction of 8 different sports halls. The players themselves appear to be a perfect counterpart of the real counterparts, both from the point of view of the technical characteristics and the more purely physiognomic ones. In the field Once on the field our approval does not decrease, even in this area we can see an extreme attention to detail. The teams on the field perform the ritual pre-warm-up exercises before the match, while we can immediately see the excellent work done in the reproduction of the three-dimensional models and their animations, created using the well-tested Motion Capture technique. The graphics engine appears solid and able to recreate an excellent visual feeling, complete with reflections and light effects of a certain caliber. The game views are multiple and during every moment it will be possible to access an excellent replay section. The only negative note was the audience at the end of the field, reproduced with the usual two-dimensional effect. The bounce of the ball and the dynamics of the animations, including shots on the net or spectacular dives, are always plausible and perfectly integrated with the rest of the context. If we want to be picky and want to make somewhat forced comparisons, it must be said that the harmony of the animations presented by other sports titles - such as the never too acclaimed ~Pro Evolution Soccer 3~ - still remains unmatched, but we assure you that you will pay very little attention, this is because the game actions are always so extremely fast and lively that your attention will mostly be directed to controlling the movements of the ball. In conclusion, the general impact cannot be defined as spectacular in an absolute sense, however LVF2004 is appreciated for the effectiveness of the graphics engine capable of running smoothly even on low-end hardware, almost archaic we would say. In the field Tie-break Before the match, it will be possible to set up the initial line-up and the arrangement of the six players on the field: volleyball enthusiasts will have something for their teeth. Far beyond a simple game vaguely inspired by volleyball, the Idoru programmers have set themselves the goal of offering us a real simulation. For this purpose, they can therefore boast the introduction into a wide range of available tactics and the reproduction of the technical skills of the players on a field calculated on the basis of the performances of the respective real volleyball players. During the evolution of the meeting these same characteristics may vary according to different parameters, such as fatigue orchange in morale, and will significantly affect the efficiency of our team on the pitch. , based on the attack or defense phases, the choral control of the entire team to that of the single player, after a minimum of practice everything resolves into a profound and satisfying experience. The keys to be used are quite numerous (a gamepad is seriously recommended in this regard) and a little running-in time is inevitable. Implementing one's game tactics or deciding the type of dunk, defense, pass or block against the opponents will always require extreme reflexes, pace of play and a broad vision of the game; just like in the Volleyball we see on television. Tie-break Comment I can't fail to congratulate Idoru for the work done with this LVF 2004. With a certain modesty and a lot of rigour, the developers from Veneto have ventured into the development of an honest and effective volleyball simulation. If from certain points of view the title still appears sparse and, perhaps, even a little ~artisanal~ on the other, one cannot help but notice how the heart of the game, that of the simulation, is complete, profound and even fun . Especially if you are passionate about volleyball, LVF 2004 is undoubtedly a title to be taken into serious consideration, all the others should give it at least a look, at least to try something new, even in the sports arena. Pros: Transposes the spirit of volleyball in full Deep and plausible game mechanics An Italian title! (allow us some healthy parochialism, Ed)Cons:Little choice in the competitions and teams availableIf you don't like volleyball... you will hardly change your mindNot too intuitive, it requires a lot of practice 1,2,3.. Play! (aka download and go) LVF 2004 is the first title which, in addition to the normal distribution channels, will also be sold through our Digital Delivery platform ~1.2.3... e Gioca~. An address from where to download the full version of the game will soon be made available. game (1), during installation you will be asked for an authorization code to unlock (2) by credit card for 12.50 (decidedly lower than the 19.99 of the boxed version) after which it will be possible to start immediately to play (3). Simple, fast and cheap. The only limitation for now is the means of payment. If you don't have a card, there is no other solution than to buy the package.", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
