Already starting from this premise, Pearl Harbor Trilogy: 1941 - Red Sun Rising has a point in its favor, proposing to fill a space left practically empty, if we also consider the particular hybrid meaning of shooter / simulator that characterizes the structure of this product legend. Then let's face it, the charm of the Second World War aces is a sort of evergreen in the videogame field, therefore it is with a certain curiosity that one approaches the game for the first time, recently released on WiiWare and with a low cost, equal to 700 Nintendo points. Let's also add the slackness of the first summer period, almost always (as in this case) rather sparing of interesting outings and the road seems well paved for the arrival of this light and well-packaged aerial shooter, which promises to sling us in the middle of the action of war between Americans and Japanese in what Vonnegut liked to call ~the second unsuccessful attempt at collective suicide of civilization~, but which transposed into a video game always makes a good impression, due to the strange mechanisms of the human psyche. It should also be noted that, despite the fact that the subject dealt with was easily subject to rhetorical and even nationalistic interpretations from the American side, the story is treated with a certain philological detachment, with the possibility of dealing with events both from the point of view of the USA and from that of the Japan, sharing the same scenarios but perpetrating different objectives. In short, in the face of all these excellent premises, why is the game not fully convincing? The problem lies right in the heart of the game action, where the excellent packaging is not enough to complete the mission in the best way. Glowing skies It was close to achieving a much higher result, it must be said. Always bearing in mind that we are talking about a 700 Wii Points WiiWare game, at first glance the impact is truly remarkable. Pearl Harbor Trilogy: 1941 - Red Sun Rising derives from a split into three episodes of a game released three years ago on PC and the adaptation (also by virtue of a certain obsolescence of the graphics sector, at this point) is quite satisfactory, both in terms of graphics and in terms of adapting the controls to the Wii interface. This last element is one of the most convincing within the framework, with the possibility of using three different configurations: Remote Control only, Classic Controller or Remote Control with Nunchuck. The most convincing solution is undoubtedly the first, with the Wiimote held horizontally the aircraft responds quickly and fluidly to the commands given by tilting it according to the two main axes and using the keys for the primary (machine gun) and secondary (missiles, bombs etc.) or to change the motor speed and framing. It's really a pleasure to move the aircraft with light movements of the remote control in this configuration, although the limitation of the movement possibilities is quite felt, preventing (partially in a logical way, considering the characteristics of the aircraft of the time) daring maneuvers . The weak point, as regards the gameplay, is the somewhat monotonous level design and the almost zero balance of the difficulty level. In fact, despite the amount of objectives to be completed, we almost always find ourselves engaging in furious dogfights trying to get the enemies out of the queue, while we are mercilessly riddled with shots from different directions. This may not seem like a bad thing at first, but the constant need to go around in circles shrugging opponents off their shoulders in a desperate search for alignment between sights and enemy aircraft becomes frustrating and very little fun in the long run. The missions would also be many and the possibility of tackling the game on both the American and Japanese sides significantly increases its longevity, although this is only the first chapter of the trilogy, but this flattening of the whole game structure on the desperate need to escape from the enemy in the queue, although realistic, significantly undermines the fun that a more refined and more balanced level design would have enjoyed. A cartoon The aesthetics of Pearl Harbor Trilogy: 1941 - Red Sun Rising is fully satisfying. Both as regards the in-game graphics and all the surrounding elements, the game proves to be an excellently packaged product and characterized by a non-trivial and decidedly well-set artistic direction. This appartand clear from the first introductory screens, which illustrate the story (not too deep, but in line with the genre) through a sort of 50s-style comic with a fitting style. In the heart of the game, the representation of the battle with a shot from behind the plane is in line with the now well-coded canon of the genre, but if you think that we are dealing with a budget title for digital delivery, the quality of the graphics is impressive , which is on a par with other similar products sold at full price, or nearly so. There are, to tell the truth, no particular negative elements to report with regard to the aesthetic sector, which if on the one hand does not shine particularly for originality, in the three-dimensional component typical of the ~game~, on the other hand compensates for this lack of identity with a comic representation and detail of all the extra-playful surrounding elements. The audio accompaniment is limited to rather standard effects and music, with pseudo-samples for radio transmissions which are a bit annoying, but create a coherent whole with the representation of World War II battles. Legendo has also included additional game modes, in addition to the main campaign that can be selected by the Americans or the Japanese: to vary the game action we also find the ~Dogfight~, in which we essentially find ourselves shooting down the largest number of enemy planes in a given time interval, and a sort of ~survival~ mode in which we must instead try to stay airborne for as long as possible, but these are two variants that add very little to the basic structure of the game, considering the almost obsessive dogfight even during campaign missions. Furthermore, the total lack of any reference to multiplayer is felt, which would certainly have added a more substantial game variant.", "date": "2010-07-28", "grade": "7.0"}
