{"name": "Human Resource Machine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/157825-human-resource-machine-risorse-umane.html", "text": "After the excellent World of Goo, published under the name of 2D Boy, rightly considered one of the titles from which the modern mainstream indie scene was born at the end of the last decade, and after the original Little Inferno, released three years ago now, which demonstrated to possess unsuspected narrative virtues behind an only apparently mechanistic vision of videogames, today Tomorrow Corporation tries again with Human Resource Machine, a puzzle game that is channeled into the vein of the various Jahooma's LogicBox, TIS-100 or the better known SpaceChem, to mention some recent exponents of logic-based video games. Some solutions are quite complex True success is achieved only by optimizing all processes The gameplay is very simple to explain because, basically, it is a reduction of some essential programming concepts into a video game. The protagonist is an employee of a large company, the Tomorrow Corporation, and year after year he has to do increasingly difficult jobs to make a career. These works are presented in the form of problems, which must be solved by applying some instructions that are provided to us. The starting point is always a conveyor belt on the left (inbox) from which to take the values that must be brought to the conveyor belt on the right (outbox). The complicated part comes when our boss starts asking that particular values taken from the starting ones be placed on the outbox. For example, given two pairs of numeric values, how do you get only the higher one out in the outbox? The solution is less obvious than it seems, because if the result is intuitively obvious and anyone can get there, translate everything into a machine-understandable language, i.e. use the instructions that are supplied to us to build a system that leads us to the result, he can turn out to be a very complex task. For example, in one of the intermediate levels we had to codify a real countdown, while in another we learned to use the labeler, ie a machine creates variables. Each level admits multiple solutions, but after completing it, our code is judged on brevity and cleanliness; that is, to obtain acknowledgments, we must be able to keep it within a certain number of overall instructions and we must optimize the steps by eliminating the useless ones (for example, why place a value when the next operation can be performed by holding it in hand?) . Basic programming If you have some programming experience, it is likely that you have easily identified the references of most of the elements described in the previous paragraph and that, therefore, Human Resource Machine could be a piece of cake for you. In fact, the whole game is a kind of introduction to programming, with the solutions of the various puzzles very similar to lists of instructions. The narrative side manifests itself during coffee breaks To give an extra impetus to the Tomorrow Corporation title, the story takes care of it, understood in this case as the ability to channel a series of game mechanics based on mathematics in a context of a broader sense, which makes the title interesting also from the point of view from a symbolic point of view. This is more or less what happened in Little Inferno, where, however, the puzzles were much less complex and the only difficulty was being able to decipher the secret code that allowed you to reach the true ending. Human Resource Machine instead offers an effective challenge, more or less demanding depending on the familiarity one has with logical problems, but the game still does not give up being an allegory, through a small story narrated in the coffee breaks of the workplace and in the relationship which develops with the boss, mediator between the employee and the company, who is only interested in making sure that the code works. The question that underlies everything Human Resource Machine concerns a certain way of conceiving reality and the risk that society is transforming us into machines capable only of solving problems, year after year, room after room, gratified by nothing and replaced as soon as they are presents the opportunity to be more efficient workers. Will Human Resource Machine be able to transform us into perfect office machines? The machine man From a purely technical point of view, Human Resource Machine has very pleasant 2D graphics, despite the underlying simplicity that characterizes it. Each room a year old The visual style is the one already seen in Little Inferno, with rounded and naive characters, but with a strongly melancholy and dark side. Even the soundtrack reflects this ambiguity, with a good amount of rhythmic and cheerful accompanying songs, which in the most reflexicons leave room for slower and less cumbersome music. Generally speaking, it is childish to say that we are certainly not dealing with a technical miracle, but it is easy to assume that Human Resource Machine has never claimed to be one, preferring to focus on substance rather than frills. Know that the time needed to complete it can vary greatly depending on your familiarity with puzzles of this type. Let's say that to complete all the rooms, including the additional ones, unlocking all the awards, it will take several hours.", "date": "2015-10-20", "grade": "8.3"}
