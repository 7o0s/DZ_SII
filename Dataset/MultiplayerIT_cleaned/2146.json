{"name": "A scuola di paura. Monsters & Co.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-scuola-di-paura-monsters-co.html", "text": "Monster & Co. Profession scare The opportunity is given to us by this Platform which is intimately linked to the film of the same name which is having so much success in cinemas and which features two nice monsters as protagonists who respond to the name of Mike and Sulley. The film tells of a parallel dimension in which there is a company whose goal is to scare children and consequently our two heroes carry out this particular activity by teleporting to the rooms of their ~preys~ and storing the energy caused by the fright ( unfortunately we know how real monsters actually belong to our dimension). The game is a classic platform with a progressive trend, where the game areas become usable only after completing the previous levels and to complete an area, which is made up of 4 levels, you must earn a certain number of bronze medals, which as you may have already understood, they are obtained by scaring children. The two protagonists have different characteristics, Sulley (who looks like a big Yeti) is slower and less agile than Sulley, but has considerable brute strength, it's up to you to choose which of the two you like best. From a technical point of view, the game does not stand out, and indeed seems to belong to a generation of previous titles, the polygonal models are poor, just like the textures are not appreciated for their quality, vice versa the sound is exceptional, especially the localization has been dealt with commendably. However, the title does not lend itself to an ordinary review and therefore at this point I rely on real experts. Expert opinion An important thing in reviewing a game is to consider it from the correct perspective and consequently find the right place for it, on the other hand it is clear that I cannot compare Monsters & Co to technical achievements such as those of Max Payne or MOHAA, because the title he'd come out with all his bones broken, so I don't. Someone could object that regardless of the target, the technical realization must always be at the highest levels; I personally don't think this is 100% true and therefore applicable to all titles, simply because children (which I repeat are the main target for which the game is intended) don't look at the textures or the play of light, but rather at the characterization of the characters. So to continue this article, I have to request the precious external advice (and you don't know how much it cost me in sweets) from two experts: Mattia and Alessia, two of my 7 and 9 year old cousins to whom I gladly leave the Joypad for a full-bodied game session ... ummm work. Fun as a watchword As it was easy to predict, our two experts were pleasantly surprised by the sympathy of the two characters, who they had already appreciated in the cinema, moreover they found the game simple and immediate and their only concern was to have fun. They particularly appreciated the system to scare the nerves (which are automatons that simulate real children), the collection of primordial slime and the beautiful and hilarious animations that refer to the film and which are usable when you complete a level. Preferences towards Sulley and Mike were equally divided, but for both the goal of sympathy was largely achieved, in this Monster & Co absolutely hits the mark. This demonstrates, if there were any need, that to make a game fun and enjoyable to play, especially for a particular audience such as children, light effects, polygons and textures are of little use. And then the theme of fear and fright is treated in such a pleasant and exoricizing way that one cannot fail to be pleasantly enraptured by this narrative style, as was last year's Shrek phenomenon, the monster as a good and likeable character who contrasts with years of ~beautiful is good and ugly is bad~ literature. One thing that my little helpers couldn't see (I quickly ran out of sweets and snacks) and that the game is also very long-lived, not only due to the different settings, but also due to the progressive access system to the play areas. which were previously closed. Scary conclusions Before reaching the canonical conclusion, I remind you that the game is also available for consoles and I think this version is preferable, regardless of the model owned, for the simple reason that since the game is intended for children, it would be correct to let them play on a comfortable sofa in front to a beautiful television than in front of a monitor. During the article I have always referred to a ~young~ target, but this does not preclude anyone from playing, the ssimplicity of the controls and the good variety of levels can find many admirers even to those who are over those ages and want to have a good laugh. So what is this frightening conclusion? That if we could be a little more children inside, we would realize that a simple and healthy game would be enough to have fun. Meditate adults... meditate. Video games for kids? If we take a careful look at the titles that occupy these pages, we realize how the video game has become a product intended for a predominantly adult and mature audience, as demonstrated by the stickers on the packaging, which increasingly rarely prove to be suitable for an audience of tender age. This situation is also a consequence of the differentiation that the market has imposed, for which videogame titles suitable for children are a very specific sector and which normally does not find space in our pages, it must also be added that there are ~magic~ games suitable for all ages and tastes, like the legendary Mario Bros, but this is such a rare event (and not only in the videogames sector) that we consider it out of category. However today we feel like going against this trend and we want to talk to you about a game intended for the youngest audience (Disney itself recommends the game for children aged 6 to 10) and so let's put down our weapons for a moment, let's set aside our magical arts, let's get out of our cars and dedicate ourselves to a game suitable for our children or our little brothers.", "date": "2002-04-27", "grade": null}
