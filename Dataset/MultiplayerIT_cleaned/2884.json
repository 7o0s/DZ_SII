WayForward is a very trust inspiring team, so if they come up with the idea of combining marbles with fantasy hack and slash we might raise an eyebrow, but we'd do well to pursue it with interest and an open mind. And indeed the strange mix works in this game, even if it never seems to be able to fully delve into either one or the other soul of the bizarre union, remaining a bit on the surface but managing, in any case, to interest first and then practically entertain already after a few minutes of playing. How is it possible to combine a hack and slash action on knights and dragons and a marbles race, then? Simple: staging the adventures of fantasy fighters who have the upper half of the body in human form (therefore able to wield a sword and shield) and the lower half represented by a rolling sphere. Although put like this it might seem like a rather creepy idea, in typical WayForward style it's a very comic and cheerful characterization, which simply combines the normal situations of a fantasy action RPG type game with the physics simulation of a Marble Madness and manages to with a disarming simplicity, despite the union being decidedly crazy. The story tells of the land of Roundingham threatened by the fearsome Lord Terroball, and of a series of fighters (appropriately named Knights of the Round, matching their form perfectly) who are called upon to defeat the dark lord and his many henchmen. The premise would be typical of any action hack and slash or adventure like Zelda, were it not for the fact that the means of locomotion of the characters, or the sphere they have instead of legs, introduces rather particular game dynamics, consequently transforming the system of control and the same level design to agree with the fact that the protagonists are practically anthropomorphic marbles. Between swords, spells and rolls At first glance, even looking at the images, Marble Knights looks like a simple hack and slash-style action, with a top view and somewhat stylized graphics that recall the atmosphere of Zelda. However, just move the character to understand what is strange about this game: having a sphere instead of legs, the protagonist rolls rather than walks, which introduces a whole peculiar system of pushes, centrifugal force and inertia capable of modifying substantially the control system and the entire level design, all built on this peculiarity of the characters. That of Marble Knights is in fact a world fit for ~marbles~, so to speak: the whole strange kingdom of Roundingham is populated by rolling individuals, which is why the levels are built almost like tracks to make the spheres run. To tell the truth, this is an aspect that could perhaps have been more in-depth in the game and which is instead only partially exploited. The levels favor the movement of the spheres a little by also introducing elements of challenge connected to this aspect: cliffs to avoid with quick control maneuvers, sudden descents to accumulate speed and sudden jumps to switch from one platform to another and even real labyrinths with holes to dodge by precisely dosing the thrusts, but these hardly represent real elements of challenge, remaining only colorful additions and able to characterize the gameplay a little without being too decisive. To add further doubts about how the game could have made better use of this particular feature is also the control system: the use of the ~tilt~, or the inclination of the screen to move the character accordingly, is somewhat limited by a sensitivity rather low and strangely non-adjustable, which somewhat mortifies the possibilities that the idea of the rolling sphere could open up. For the rest, the game is set according to the typical dynamics of the hack and slash type action adventure, with continuous combats at sword, shield or other ranged weapon strikes and some variation on the theme that takes the form of reading sub-quests. In this regard, there are also almost adventure elements that can also be connected to the use of spheres of various types: the marbles on which the characters are located can in fact be changed with others characterized by peculiar abilities, allowing you to open new paths and solve simple puzzles . For example, the fireball spreads flames wherever it passes, allowing you to burn brambles and shrubs for fellingtere some obstacles, or the ice one can create bridges and passages by solidifying the water, all elements that enrich the gameplay with some almost puzzle game characteristics. Finally, a special mention must be made for the multiplayer: Marble Knights is designed to be played by up to four players at the same time and probably in this situation it is able to offer the best of itself. The fights, the labyrinthine or platform phases and the boss fights are more fun with the sharing of the game, even if this can involve a workload that is perhaps too heavy on some less performing devices.", "date": "2020-09-23", "grade": "7.0"}
