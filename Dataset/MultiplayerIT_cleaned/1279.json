{"name": ".hack//MUTATION", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hackmutation.html", "text": "Where were we? In the cataclysmic finale of the previous volume, Kite had come across a monstrous creature generated by the anomaly that is upsetting The World and reality. Rescued in extremis by the mysterious hacker Helba, Kite finds himself catapulted out of the game, now certain that something horrible lurks in the most played video game in the world. The only way, at this point, is to proceed in search of Aura, the disturbing ghost-girl who continues to contact Kite through increasingly cryptic emails and who seems to wander aimlessly around The World. In the company of the frivolous Blackrose (whose real motivations we will discover that led her to connect to the game), the eccentric Mistral, the bizarre Elk and Mia and an ever-growing cast, Kite will have to face the MUTATION of The World and to discover new truths about a game that, perhaps, is not a game at all. Mutation? Well, not really. MUTATION actually does not present many changes compared to INFECTION: the play structure has remained almost the same and the variations concern in particular the fields of objects, magical techniques, equipment, to which many brand new items have been added, to be exchanged with the other players who populate the cities/servers of The World. The presence of new characters, playable and not, is inevitable, such as Wiseman (a new Wavemaster who will very well compensate for the absences of Elk and Mistral) or Lios (the Administrator of Altimit who will give a hard time to Kite and company, gradually becoming more important in the economy of the plot). Again, the field of additions, which as you may have guessed is quite remarkable at least in quantity, concerns the new monsters that will be faced in the dungeons and the bonuses that can be unlocked with the usual Ryu Books. The Grunty are back, once again breedable in Carmina Gadelica with the objects found in the various dungeons, and the challenges against the Goblins are also back, ever faster and more difficult to defeat. Unfortunately, Gate Hacking is also back: we say ~unfortunately~ because already in this second volume the need to track down the Virus Cores useful for opening new areas is becoming more and more frequent and urgent; if on the one hand this process guarantees greater difficulty and a less linear progression, on the other it proves to be frustrating and repetitive at times. Fortunately, the power of Kite's Dusk Bracelet now makes use of an enhanced version of the Data Drain, the Data Arc, which allows you to act on multiple enemies simultaneously at the time of the Protect Break. Nothing new under the sun? Even the technical aspect of MUTATION has remained the same as INFECTION. There is only a very slight increase in detail in the texturing of new environments and weapons, but nothing more; the graphic realization of this episode of .hack// remains substantially sufficient: it does its duty, with very few drops in the frame rate even in the most chaotic situations in the presence of huge monsters, but it does not reach the peaks of excellence admired in titles such as Suikoden III (where the poor care of the polygonal models was compensated by the amazing realization of the environments). The character design still remains that of a Yoshiyuki Sadamoto in excellent shape, which gives us a Wiseman who impressively recalls the Gendo Hikari of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Even the soundtrack does not have new prominent tracks and continues to settle on more than good levels. Comment The title of this .hack// Vol.2 is misleading: there is very little MUTATION. Sure, there are new monsters to face, new spells to master, new weapons to wield, but from a strictly practical point of view the game is the same. Even the plot is initially perplexing: for about half of the twenty hours needed to complete this sequel it seems to sway from one event to another without a precise purpose, but it is true that the accounts add up only at the end, involving the player in a real and its own barrage of twists and disconcerting revelations. MUTATION is, in short, an episode of transition: we are exactly halfway through the series and the plot is only now beginning to thicken and truly reveal itself; the same thing goes for the OAV: the episode contained in this package adds an apparently superfluous piece to the mosaic of investigations that the protagonists are carrying out in the direction of Altimit and the creators of The World. In short, at this point all that remains is to wait for OUTBREAK, the next episode of the saga, which will present many improvements both from a narrative and a playful point of view. Two months have passed since the release of the first volume of .hack// (INFECTION) in the European version, and here we arepunctual to talk about this second part of the tetralogy made in Bandai that is making so much talk in America and Europe. For those who don't know what we're talking about, suffice it to say that .hack// is probably one of the most original Japanese JRPGs ever produced: divided into four consecutive chapters, .hack// is a real meta-video game, as the protagonist of the saga is just... a video game, an MMORPG played via the internet by millions of people entitled The World. In the last two years, the saga has turned into a multimedia phenomenon that has led to the creation of two animated series, various manga and a series of four OAVs (Original Animation Video), the latter distributed from time to time with the volumes of the video game . That said, it's time to talk about MUTATION.", "date": "2004-06-17", "grade": null}
