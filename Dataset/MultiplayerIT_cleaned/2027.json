Unfortunately Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is anything but an interesting game. It's a pity because the premises seemed to be all there, a highly appealing license, a valid developer (best known for driving simulations) and numerous game modes. To penalize the final result, not one but several defects intervene that denote a lack of care in the realization of the game. First of all, what immediately catches the eye is the poor quality of the graphics which not only do not take full advantage of the XBox hardware but which find it difficult to compare due to the poor realization of the boxer models and the settings in general . The visual spectacle is made even more bleak by animations that have very little animation, being composed of a handful of frames. The result is a whirlwind of punches thrown at a speed that almost does not allow to distinguish the single blow. Things are no better on consoles... There are four game modes: Friendly Mode, Speed Boxing, Belt Mode and Two Player. In the first you will have to play for the bag by fighting against a boxer controlled by the CPU; in the second you will instead find yourself entering the ring in a real fight against time, trying every time to beat your own record by knocking your opponent down in the shortest possible time. The belt mode is instead the classic ~career~ that will allow you to get on the most prestigious rings on the planet (Carnival City, Caesars Palace, Wembley Arena, Rome) to chase the conquest of the gold belt, passing before this for the belts of bronze and silver. Finally, we find the classic challenge against a human player that will allow you to choose between predefined and customized boxers during the single game. Technical knockout As I have already had the opportunity to point out, the fights take place in the name of confusion. it is very difficult to understand the progress of a match and very often the outcome is determined by the speed of pressing the keys, which brings the tactical component to zero. If Codemasters' intention was to bring a simple, immediate and damned arcade game to XBox, then I really think they have succeeded. The trouble is, however, that the resulting gaming experience is also rather repetitive and devoid of any substance. I therefore advise all owners of the Microsoft console, boxing enthusiasts and not, to look elsewhere or perhaps wait for the release of more interesting titles. Pros: There's ~Iron~ Mike Tyson! Good number of modes Repetitive Rough graphics Almost non-existent animations Tyson now in decline... Image gallery preview The end of the Tyson myth? Just as Mike Tyson's star seems to have definitively set at the foot of an insurmountable mountain called Lennox Lewis, a new boxing title dedicated to the former heavyweight champion arrives on our green console. The timing of the marketing of Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is therefore not the best, however this should not affect the validity of a title that could prove to be interesting.", "date": "2002-08-26", "grade": null}
