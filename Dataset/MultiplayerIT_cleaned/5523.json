{"name": "NERF: Superblast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nerf-superblast-recensione.html", "text": "Among the most famous toy weapons of all time, NERFs have the unique ability to exert a certain fascination even among adults. Undoubtedly thanks to the design of these colorful pistols, which through more or less elaborate mechanisms are distinguished in very well-characterized models, just like real weapons but... in a more lively way. The brand's success could only be translated into a series of videogame reductions with mixed fortunes, with an interesting project for PC and consoles launched at the end of last year, NERF Legends. But now it's up to Nitro Games and its new competitive shooter for iOS and Android: we tell you how it went in the review of NERF: Superblast. Structure - four modes for every taste NERF: Superblast, a long-range fight NERF: Superblast finds itself competing in the mobile sector with decidedly more famous productions, and this is why the game immediately makes available a fairly rich structure, with four different modes that allow you to try your hand at competitive games open to the participation of two , six or ten players. NERF Battle stands as the most traditional stipulation, a team deathmatch in which two teams of three users face off within a map with the aim of totaling a number of eliminations higher than that of the opponents. Solitary is instead an all-against-all deathmatch for ten players, with the final ranking determining the results. Flipper is the first of the variations on the theme, it takes place inside a huge pinball machine, in fact, and sees two teams of three participants try to be the first to reach the hundred points needed to close the challenge. Finally, siege is a one-on-one duel (albeit with the support of two bots on each side) in which whoever scores the most hits on the target located inside the enemy base wins. The focus of the progression is therefore not on the unlocking of modes and scenarios, but solely on the growth of the character and his equipment, represented by increasingly powerful and iconic NERF guns, which we will be able to enhance by spending the tokens earned with each match: an aspect of the game which unfortunately inevitably winks at pay-to-win dynamics to be verified in the long term. Gameplay: Shoot the plastic bullet NERF: Superblast, the giant pinball machine If you have ever used a NERF gun you will know that these are limited range weapons, and this peculiar aspect has been faithfully transposed into the gameplay of NERF: Superblast, making sure that you have to take measurements with each shot and calculate both the descending trajectory as above all the speed of the bullet in order to actually hit an opponent. It is a mechanic that can undoubtedly distinguish the experience packaged by Nitro Games compared to the many other competitive shooters available on the App Store and Google Play, but not therefore necessarily satisfactory. Let's say that the enjoyment of gunplay is very subjective: if you are looking for a different shooter than usual, you might like it, otherwise it is unlikely. NERF: Superblast, a western map Fortunately, the system is supported by a touch control system decidedly up to the situation, which uses automatic fire when an opponent is in the viewfinder (as it is sacrosanct, we have been repeating it for years) but also allows you to shoot manually by making a quick double tap on the screen, activate the recharge before the small magazine at our disposal is empty and resort to the special ability of the turn to get an extra cue. As a side dish we find a free-to-play structure that during the first hours proves to be particularly generous in giving out coins and objects, allowing us to upgrade the weapons in our possession and to unlock new ones, as well as accessing the many aesthetic elements with which to change the appearance of the character we control. Sure, then things change but at least the beginning is downhill. Technical realization: color cartoons NERF: Superblast, a firefight A shooter inspired by a toy line could only be toy-like in appearance, and in fact the graphics of NERF: Superblast are very colorful, lively and fluid right from the start, guaranteeing a fairly solid 60 fps on high-end terminals (in this case an iPhone 14 Pro) and a fair variety of settings, although some scenarios tend hopelessly to resemble each other. On the sound side, there isn't much to say: the atmosphere is a bit that of an amusement park, supported by online sounds and music with this philosophy, which accompany us in the action in a functional way but without overdoing it or staying somewherehe way imprinted.", "date": "2022-10-15", "grade": "7.2"}
