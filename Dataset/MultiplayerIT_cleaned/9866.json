{"name": "Orsi e pinguini", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79255-beargo-orsi-e-pinguini.html", "text": "The unforgettable Pengo jingle, recently taken up in a remix for the advertisement of a well-known brand of local chocolate, ideally accompanies the release on the App Store of Beargo, an arcade game developed by an Italian team that bluntly clones the classic SAW. With a substantial difference, however: if in Pengo we found ourselves controlling a penguin capable of moving and destroying heavy blocks of ice to escape the onslaught of some strange creatures, in Beargo the protagonist is instead a polar bear, who inside of something like two hundred stages must face four different types of animals ... starting right from the penguins. The hunter par excellence becomes prey, therefore; but otherwise little changes: you turn each time in a different labyrinth delimited by blocks of ice, you try to escape the enemies and at the same time crush them with a well-calibrated throw. Each elimination, especially the multiple ones, leaves fruit or huge fish on the stage that our bear can collect to multiply the score. In short, is everything really the same? Challenge in the ice If you belong to the so-called ~old guard~ of gamers, you will certainly have played a few games with Pengo. Well, we reiterate, the gameplay of the Imagimotion title refers precisely to that of the SEGA coin-op. Within each stage we have a certain number of enemies trying to grab us and we must try at all costs to keep them at a distance, because their touch results in the loss of a life. To constrain our movements (which are limited to the four main directions) we take care of the blocks of ice arranged randomly, which form thick walls and constitute our only defense weapon: using the only button on the touch screen, we can push them against our opponents to crush them, or crumble them if they are in a ~blind~ position and cannot be moved. In the levels we also find three huge diamonds, which if put together allow us to move on to the next stage, a result that otherwise is obtained only after eliminating all enemies. As mentioned above, our character can move blocks, throwing them at high speed at opponents to crush them, and in the absence of space, he can simply crumble them. Let's therefore say that all attack strategies require a certain distance from our target, while evasive maneuvers always end up being carried out in confined spaces, at the limit; situations in which any hesitation can be fatal, and which unfortunately are made more complicated by a control system that is not always up to the task. Compared to the rigid geometries of Pengo, Beargo offers us an interesting alternative to the standard movements, namely the possibility of moving to the ~edge~ of the scenario. The other differences lie mostly in the technical realization and graphic style, with the game moving between four variants of the background and offering us as many types of animals as antagonists. The characters are in pre-rendered 3D and have decent quality animations, as is the design of the stages. The extremely simple control system works via touch screen and uses the classic virtual d-pad, which however sometimes tends to ~enchant~ itself and can get us into big trouble. The tested version is 1.1. Price: 1.59 App Store links", "date": "2010-08-04", "grade": "7.2"}
