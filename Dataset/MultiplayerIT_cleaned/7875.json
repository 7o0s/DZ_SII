The Digital Extremes title is in fact now available both from the official website and via Steam to be downloaded for free by those wishing to experience this interesting cooperative third-person action. A Free-To-Play product that stands out from the crowd that has been clogging the market for some time now, thanks to a somewhat original gameplay and a captivating aesthetic appearance. Space Ninja Cooperation! Similar in some ways to the multiplayer experience seen in Mass Effect 3, Warframe wastes no time in telling particularly elaborate stories. The narrative background, in fact, will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of futuristic ninja called to fight an alien faction. From the initial menu we will be able to choose between different worlds to visit where missions will await us to be completed possibly in the company of three other players. The objectives vary quite a bit, but the main flaw of the Digital Extremes title soon emerges given the lack of variety in the levels. You will be asked to rescue hostages, locate a reactor to destroy or find an object, but whatever the delivery, in Warframe you will almost always find yourself eliminating waves of enemies, chasing the various waypoints marked on the map. The playability, fortunately, quite obviates the problems of repetitiveness of the title. With the view placed behind our Tenno (this is the name of the metal ninjas we will impersonate), we will have firearms and the trusty katana at our disposal. The Warframes of the title then come into play, representing the different possible configurations of the armor. These identify the different classes of ninjas, with unique characteristics useful for customizing the gaming experience. Initially there are three available, while the others can be purchased with real money or obtained through the crafting system included in the title. Warframes not only modify the aesthetic aspect of your character, but activate peculiar skills, for example allowing stealth attacks, rather than guaranteeing thicker armor than usual and so on. The user will then access further customizations to be purchased with the credits earned for each successfully completed mission. These allow you to improve the efficiency of your Warframe but not only. In fact, there are multiple consumable items to carry with you for subsequent missions, useful for remedying the weaknesses of your configuration and style of play. Untapped potential Warframe's gameplay involves fairly canonical firefights, but thanks to the presence of RPG-style skills it manages to offer an experience with a certain personality. The movements of the Tenno are fluid and allow you to switch from firefights to white weapons quickly. The moment you choose to use the sword, Warframe takes on the appearance of a rough action, thus introducing a further variant to the gaming experience. Ultimately, the sensations returned by the title by holding the mouse and keyboard are positive, guaranteeing a certain depth and flexibility of the control system. At the moment there are no other game modes, but only the possibility of facing the missions alone or accompanied by three other users chosen by the matchmaking system. Being the title focused on the cooperative, we would have expected some tricks such as an in-game chat, while no communication system is provided. This and other shortcomings make the games rather chaotic, without real incentives for teamwork. The differentiation of the classes does not help much in this sense given the limited artificial intelligence and variety of enemies, which can be eliminated essentially by firing on them as quickly and abundantly as possible. Although Warframe is open to all and judged by the developers to be reviewable, it is still officially still in the beta phase, with updates yet to be revealed arriving in the coming months. If these brought variety to the levels and missions, the Digital Extremes product could finally expand what is currently mostly untapped potential. Paid content, in this sense, does not help particularly by characterizing itself more as useful elements to speed up the acquisition of new materials and additional Warframes. These can still be created through an elementary crafting system, but the time required to put the elements together and get to the finished product can also be a couple of real days. Fortunately, however, at the moment the danger of a so-called pay to win title is far awayyear, so that even those who don't want to spend money will be able to enjoy all the contents and have fun without suffering unbalanced gameplay. An advanced engine Although it is a free product, the technical sector manages to get noticed thanks to the proprietary graphics engine of Digital Extremes, the Evolution Engine. This offers detailed and well-animated models on the screen that move in environments with good textures and spot-on effects. In particular we liked the lighting system, nice and personal. The artistic direction in turn stands out, especially in the trait that distinguishes the ninja protagonists. Too bad that so much good work is flattened by bad level design, not so much in the conformation of the maps, but in their aesthetic rendering, flat like few others. The missions, in fact, take place in corridors and rooms that are really too similar to each other, a factor that fuels the boredom effect. Some technical shortcomings, partially justified by the Free-to-Play nature, sometimes affect the experience, such as the lack of menus and settings related to the games. For example, it is not possible to view the latency of other users connected to our game. Considering the lag of some matches, this function could have greatly benefited the enjoyment of the title. There are some sporadic bugs, but in general the experience is always fluid and starting a game is the consequence of a few clicks. Once again the hope is that Digital Extremes has put on the market a product that basically represents the basis for something that will evolve over time, working on the most interesting ideas and smoothing out the sharpest edges.", "date": "2013-04-25", "grade": "7.0"}
