Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. In a post-apocalyptic scenario, however told with a lot of irony, Battle Nations calls us to manage the positions of a military group according to the typical routine of Farmville titles. On the left side of the screen, therefore, characters follow one another who set us objectives to be completed as they become more complex, not in terms of execution but in terms of the necessary time, going to immediately recall the possibility of making in-app purchases to speed up certain operations and add a little sparkle to an experience that would otherwise have to be enjoyed in an extemporaneous and ~segmented~ way. No problem in this sense, however: like most of the management software available on the App Store in the freemium format, the game developed by Z2 Live allows us to pleasantly spend even a few minutes every day, in the pursuit of constant growth for our base and the troops occupying it. From this point of view, the offer is of a traditional nature: new buildings and new units are built, a particular fruit is planted in the garden, an operation is started and then, little by little, the results are collected. actions, results expressed most often in virtual currency and therefore in turn useful for continuing the adventure, increasingly strengthening our army in view of the onerous battles that await it. Not just casual It is precisely on the war front that Battle Nations distinguishes itself from productions that we have dealt with in the recent past, such as Ice Age: The Village or The Oregon Trail: Pioneers of America. In fact, having given up the role of the administrator, we will find ourselves wearing those of the soldier in battles that take place according to the more classic turn-based approach. It will happen that enemy jackal troops or regular forces come into contact with our borders, and then we will have to react strongly and defend the ambush using the available combat units. In a space delimited by square boxes, with a three-quarter view from above, we will therefore have to place soldiers and/or vehicles and exploit their peculiar abilities to eliminate the opponents on duty (literally...), by carrying out targeted or territorial attacks and trying to end the fight successfully and without any losses. The inclusion of these mechanics actually makes Battle Nations a hybrid product and for this reason very interesting, given that the typical monotony of casual management ends up being diluted thanks to the action, which moreover can be confronted more and more often as we level up. The multiplayer possibilities are also interesting, with a specific option that we can activate or not and that looks for other players around the world to challenge. The evident strength of numbers, expressed through dozens of buildings, war units, positions, turrets and so on, is assisted by an excellent technical sector, characterized by cartoony and captivating graphics, as well as by a good detection of objects as regards touch controls, an element that often does not represent the flagship for this type of game.", "date": "2012-05-26", "grade": "8.0"}
