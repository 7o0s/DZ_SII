Over the years, the game has evolved, opening up more and more to technicalities, inserting variations and new balances designed above all for the audience of enthusiasts and experts, the only ones able to appreciate some introductions in the mechanics of the clashes that are difficult to understand by the players more ~superficial~. They are therefore the ~pros~, the players who chew on Plinking, Focus, FADC, who count the animation frames and think by hitbox, the main recipients of these updates that Yoshinori Ono and his companions release at a very slow cadence for the Capcom fighting game most loved among those currently on the market. Therefore, one cannot ignore the clear stratification that characterizes the gameplay and consequently also the Street Fighter audience in the evaluation of Ultra Street Fighter IV, which at first glance may appear to be only a re-edition with 5 new characters from the previous Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, in turn a re-edition of Super Street Fighter IV with a few more characters, and so on up to the original Street Fighter IV of 2009, in an evolution which, however, for those who are able to understand the profound dynamics of game, is based on a large number of variations and additional factors. We all agree with considering the Street Fighter IV genre as one of the best fighting games currently in circulation, moreover a rare example of excellent application of 3D graphics on a structure firmly anchored to the two-dimensional roots that characterize the genre itself, but more as the years go on, the more the expectations of seeing something really new on the horizon increase, and this Ultra doesn't exactly prove to be a revolution in the Street Fighter series, ~limiting itself~ to confirming the hegemony of the title in the fighting genre with a series of improvements to the chisel that will be appreciated above all (if not almost only) by the super experts. Winning team expands: Ultra Street Fighter IV renews the formula with compelling additions Five characters in search of honor The most evident novelty brought about by the Ultra version are the five new characters included in the roster, an expansion higher than that previously seen with the Arcade Edition, even if rather distant from the qualitative leap made with the Super. The new group of characters perhaps does not exude the charisma of other fighters belonging to the historical roster of the series, but it is well-assorted as a characterization, presenting different specializations and fighting styles varied at the right point. We described Decapre, Rolento, Poison, Hugo and Elena in more detail in the Tried published a few weeks ago, to which we refer for more information, while here we can basically confirm the first impressions in terms of balance between these, after a longer trial period , although still necessarily incomplete. All the fighters fit well into the complex mosaic built by Capcom for the Street Fighter IV roster, making this Ultra truly impressive in terms of the amount of characters and fighting styles simultaneously present within it. There really are solutions for all tastes, from the most classic shoto to the most particular approaches, and it must be said that the 5 new wrestlers do their best to propose something new, although none of them start completely from scratch, having all appeared in chapters previous ones (or derived from other characters, like Decapre) but the elaborate moveset is still almost completely new and that's what counts. Hugo is a gigantic fighter of unusual size, unstoppable in close combat, who compensates for his consequent slowness with enormous power. Born within Final Fight, it became playable in Street Fighter III and aesthetically perfected in Street Fighter X Tekken, from which the characterization used here largely derives. Rolento is a well-balanced character capable of fighting at medium and short ranges, equipped with a stick that allows interesting variations of style and chaining moves and combos in a rather unexpected way, also using it as an additional foothold. Born in Final Fight, it became particularly playable in Street Fighter Alpha and reached its current appearance in Street Fighter X Tekken. Poison is the famous street fighter from Final Fight, passed through Street Fighter X Tekken pbefore landing on Ultra Street Fighter IV. Characterized by a somewhat flashy appearance, it is rather moved to the long and medium range thanks to fireball-style ranged attacks and the use of long legs and the whip. Elena comes from Street Fighter III and carries with her particular fighting style reminiscent of capoeira but with a greater rate of unpredictability, also given by the exclusive use of her legs, as well as devastating combos and a particular Ultra capable of regenerating the energy. Finally, Decapre is the only character making his debut for the first time in this game, even if he looks like a sort of clone of Cammy. However, the similarities are above all aesthetic, given that the fighting style distances itself somewhat from that of the British soldier, presenting itself as a ~charge character~ who focuses above all on speed, the use of blades and the ability to teleport. The strength of the group The five new characters are therefore well matched, and despite the inevitable partial recycling of graphic and gameplay elements, they represent a remarkable introduction to the characteristics of the game, bringing different styles and interesting and non-trivial game solutions, also distancing themselves from the classic canons of shoto and other classic types of fighters. Of course, starting from a base of 39 fighters already present in the Arcade Edition, perhaps the transition to 44 fighters can represent a not exactly huge step forward, in particular for those who are not yet familiar with the already vast roster of the previous version, therefore also for this element is worth the idea that Ultra Street Fighter IV is an update more dedicated to big fans, as on the other hand the Arcade Edition was before this latest version. However, the excellent work carried out by Capcom in the selection of 5 fighters as varied as possible and above all, at least as far as tested, well balanced and inserted into the game's mechanics should be recorded, even if the difference between top tier and less efficient fighters it can only emerge in the long run. In any case, one would think that at least Rolento and Poison could distinguish themselves as versatile and potentially appreciable fighters from all, while Hugo, Decapre and Elena represent slightly more particular choices, for which a little ~specialization~ is probably necessary. additional. However, the usual argument that occurs with regard to the entire Street Fighter IV complex is valid, namely that the approach to the game is deeply stratified, and allows you to attract both newbies or even ~casual~ and specialists of the genre. It is a delicate formula that is difficult to implement, which Capcom has managed to put together thanks to the excellent response to the commands, the fast but never confusing rhythm, the charisma of the characters and the complex elaborate system of moves that is easy to start learning but it requires continuous and progressive study to master. In short, the perfect ~easy to learn, hard to master~ by Capcom, able to miraculously involve a heterogeneous audience ranging from the occasional player to the EVO champion. Xbox 360 goals Ultra Street Fighter IV hooks up to the previous chapters and contains the beauty of 67 objectives for a total of 1360 unlockable points. Given the type of game, the achievements are located above all over the long distance and require the achievement of particular ~cumulative~ performances, such as the number of special moves performed, victories won, points collected and much more. It goes without saying that to reach the full loot you need to put in a lot of effort. The evolution of Street Fighting While the five new fighters are certainly the most eye-catching addition, most of the evolutions included in Ultra Street Fighter IV are actually ~under the hood~, in a series of modifications and reshuffles that are typical of Ono's work style and companions, in the continuous work of refinement and improvement that passionate users now know very well. It is a system capable of renewing interest in games over long distances which in this way manage to attract the public for several years after their release, and it is thus evident that these updates are designed above all for more expert users , the one that continues to be linked to the game well beyond the initial novelty effect, perhaps by participating in official tournaments or in any case able to compete at high levels in the online context. Above all these players are in fact able to understand and appreciate some introductions made by Capcom in Ultra Street Fighter IV,which, moreover, integrate very convincingly into the complex fabric of the gameplay. The possibility of using both Ultra moves instead of selecting only one of the two available, for example, introduces - for those who know how to handle them - an additional level of strategic planning of the resources of the various fighters, with a consequent increase in terms of quantity of attack or defense solutions, at the price of a certain reduction in power. The introductions of Red Focus and Delayed Standing may also seem like minor additions, but they turn out to be substantial changes for those who have by now assimilated the classic game mechanics, inserting variations of considerable importance within these. The first technique derives from the standard Focus but increases the amount of blows that the fighter can absorb and discharge, with a couple of consequences to bear in mind: the use of the maneuver requires a certain expenditure of the Super bar but also increases faster that of the Ultra, thus also placing a strategic choice on its use also to bring the possibility of exploiting the Ultra closer. Delayed Standing instead refers to the possibility of delaying the return to the feet of the fighter thrown on the ground by a few seconds. Although it may seem at first glance a curious and marginal addition, its purpose is to create some confusion in the perfect timing developed by the most experienced players, able to exploit the opponent's fall to the ground to prepare for the next moves, removing points of recovery time reference. Obviously, the new options made available as game modes are much more evident to everyone, especially as regards online interactions. We therefore point out the presence of an interesting Team Elimination mode, which allows teams of 3 players to face each other in a sort of elimination tag team, and the more marginal but somewhat requested by Online Training users, which allows two players to participate simultaneously to training mode, thus being able to try moves and techniques using a human opponent. Too bad that Capcom has not also included new Trials for the fighters introduced in this edition, leaving the mode in question essentially unchanged from the previous offer.", "date": "2014-06-03", "grade": "7.8"}
