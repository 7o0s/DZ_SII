The most evident is that Iron Tower Studio took ten years to make it, starting it when traditional RPGs had not yet found their market niche. The developer (initially the team consisted of only one person) has never hidden his goal, which was to react to the decadence of the genre, too easily associated with action with statistics. The title itself reflects this desire of his. He always admitted that it would not be easy to do and immediately declared that it would take a long time to complete it, because in the meantime he had to live. In short, his constancy must certainly be admired, also because in the end he made it by keeping all his promises. The second factor that makes The Age of Decadence unique is its intransigence: you won't find another RPG on the market that gives you so much freedom in managing your character, but at the same time punishes you for every stupid thing you do. It is not unrealistic to say that, from this point of view, we are beyond what we have seen in classics of the genre such as the first two Fallout or Arcanum. Do you want to face the lands abandoned by the gods as a warrior? You can, but don't expect easy fights. Are you interested in developing social skills more but are you afraid of not being able to continue? Don't worry, because you can proceed peacefully even just by talking to the other characters, that is, without having to throw even a stone. It doesn't take much to realize that you can choose the approach you want to the various situations, to the point that someone might initially be taken aback by such a vast system, which is only mentioned in the small tutorial. We have reviewed The Age of Decadence, a hardcore RPG for true connoisseurs The maze The Age of Decadence tells the story of a ruined world dominated by three houses and a few powerful guilds, who fight each other for absolute power and to discover what caused the collapse of civilization. Throughout the adventure, the player does not follow a direct line to the end, but participates in a series of events that lead to the resolution of the mystery. This is no small detail, because only in this way was it possible to give weight to the relationships between the factions and the influence they have on the player. Despite everything, don't think it's a poor title from a narrative point of view. In fact, it's quite the opposite. And how could it not be since it contains the beauty of six hundred thousand lines of text that extensively delve into its background? We're talking about a wide-ranging job, which has a difficult goal: to give the player the opportunity to explore as freely as possible the facts that will lead him to the ending, allowing him to choose the point of view to take on the whole story. In short, we are faced with a conceptually very complex title, which can enchant but also displace due to its complexity. It's actually very simple to play, as the interface is similar to that seen in dozens of other classic RPGs. The world is structured in closed and well-defined places that must be explored from top to bottom to find characters, missions and secrets (do you know any Baldur's Gate?). With the left mouse button you perform actions (talk, attack, open containers and so on), while with the right you move. The character management screens include a card with the various characteristics, in which the adventure points obtained by playing can be distributed, the diary with annotated events and missions, the map, useful not only for orientation but also for moving quickly and the inventory, which also includes the crafting and alchemy screens. Identity In most cases you decide what to do by reading and selecting one of the various possibilities proposed: The Age of Decadence always tries to offer multiple solutions to different situations, reaching an incredible variety of resolutions. Whenever possible, the skill used by selecting it is specified next to the action's description. For example, you can solve a quest using persuasion to convince a guy to leave the city (we won't give you too many details, don't worry), or you can kill him, or you can intimidate him, always to make him escape. There are other possibilities as well, but they vary according to the increased skills. In reality, Iron Tower was really sneaky from this point of view, because it very often happens that the decisions taken backfire again and again.ro or in favor of the player in later moments of the adventure, making the evolution of the plot dynamic and, in a certain sense, unpredictable. Going back to the example just given, our choice was to persuade the guy to leave by setting a trap for him: we lured him into an empty house by making him understand that someone wanted him dead, so we convinced him by crookedness. Apparently we had succeeded in our enterprise, but then we found the same character next to one of the most powerful nobles in the city who almost exiled us to punish us for having deceived him. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other similar examples. What is important for you to understand is the variety of the system described and the great replayability it offers: by facing a game as a mercenary and only improving your fighting skills you will experience completely different situations from those who have perhaps favored social skills such as acting, or those related to stealth. We have played The Age of Decadence several times on our own, creating different characters, and in certain games we have struggled to find moments similar to those experienced in the previous game. What did you say, gnat? The combat system is simple, turn-based and often used in a punishing way. Meanwhile, don't expect to create a super hero capable of exterminating entire armies with the laying on of hands alone: however strong you can make him, the protagonist of The Age of Decadence will always struggle in the face of multiple opponents. On some occasions then, the game voluntarily disfavours the warlike aspect. Not that a warrior shouldn't fight, but one is likely to be punished for being too rash. For example, you are not given the possibility to heal yourself during a fight and your health points do not go back automatically (imagine that a character mocked us because we asked him gods on the matter, telling us that enemies usually do not stop to make those who drink magic potions are going to kill). Thus, for example, it is not recommended to face two fights in a row against well-armored enemies, because you will almost certainly end up killed. The same goes if you have a character versed in sociability, but incapable in combat. In this case, arrogance against opponents is not simply discouraged, but actually forbidden, although it remains possible. Here, the greatest compliment that can be paid to The Age of Decadence is that it seems to have been written by a good master, eager to offer a story and interesting situations to the players, but not inclined to save them from their excesses: you played as a merchant and decide without a reason to offend two professional killers? They will definitely kill you, but don't blame the game, because it is only your fault. It is a great lesson, pedagogically speaking. All this freedom also brings some problems. The first is that The Age of Decadence is a difficult title and not suitable for everyone. The second is that you risk ending up in dead ends where the only way out is to load a previous save or, worse, have to start over. Above all, those who think they can create an all-round character will soon find themselves in unpleasant situations: it is better to specialize by excelling in a few fields, than to try to be able to do everything and fail in nothing. Another problem, secondary but evident, is the age of the game: technically, the ten years that have passed since the start of development can all be seen. Of course, playing you forget about the three-dimensional models from PlayStation 2 and the washed out textures, but we imagine that some of you would like to see your configuration gratified, which The Age of Decadence does not do in any way. From the point of view of the soundtrack, however, we point out a certain lack of sound effects, compensated by high quality music tracks, some of which are worth listening to even outside the game.", "date": "2015-10-25", "grade": "8.9"}
