Months, almost years of absolute silence and then, all together, chaos. And now, just a few days after the arrival of the final product on the market, we are finally ready to sum up and explain in detail what this Andromeda is like, what we liked about its gameplay and its narrative and aesthetic construction and what it didn't completely convince us. There have been many changes that this saga has had to face during its original trilogy and this fourth chapter is also fully part of this tradition to the point that it can be considered almost a sort of spin-off or even a new beginning perhaps with the potential to start another multi-episode epic. Only time will tell us if BioWare's bet was intelligent and well structured, but there is one thing we can already say at the beginning of this review, without the risk of being proven wrong. Mass Effect: Andromeda is a title which, although adhering to a specific aesthetic, a certain artistic cut and a precise way of being narrated, all typical elements of the original trilogy, is first of all aimed at a new audience that perhaps has not never even approached the original game and who could enjoy finding himself in his hands a third-person action, at times almost a shooter, much deeper and more multifaceted than this genre has accustomed us to. Let it be clear that the role-playing game mechanics are also there in their more complex tendencies such as craftsmanship, but paradoxically the title is almost more attractive to those who don't have its heritage in mind, and can therefore not launch into the usual nostalgic comparisons while enjoying the title in its newfound ~lightness~ and immediacy. Before going into details, we strongly recommend that you also take a look at our recent preview on the title, which deals with the first hours of the game and explains many of the gameplay mechanics in detail, and at the special we published with an attempt to answer five most recurring questions about the game, from the management of companions to the combat system. Mass Effect: Andromeda is huge and frenetic but lacks that epic that characterized the saga A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away As far as history is concerned, we will limit ourselves to giving some generic information with the precise aim of not running into any anticipation. This new episode of Mass Effect is set more than 600 years after the original trilogy and has practically no points of contact with the previous three chapters. Thanks to the interesting narrative device that sees the participants of the Andromeda Initiative starting from the Milky Way between the second and third titles and in full hibernation, no one is really interested in the epilogue of the story that saw Shepard having to manage and solve the problem with the Reapers. What does this enormous time dilation actually entail? First of all that Andromeda can be easily played even by those who don't have the slightest idea of what Mass Effect is, but secondly also that historical fans of the series can expect only very small references to the original saga that will often be difficult to grasp. No importing of old saves or explicit points of contact: everything will be completely brand new starting from the protagonists, the supporting characters, the star systems to explore up to, of course, the story told which includes unpublished events and antagonists. In short, BioWare's precise desire to meet a new audience, possibly more numerous than the previous one, is evident, eliminating any barrier to entry and maintaining ~only~ that style of design and that artistic sector that have always characterized the franchise. In Andromeda we will take on the role of one of the two Ryder twins to soon inherit the position of pioneers: our task will be to find a planet suitable for colonization in the new galaxy reached after a very long journey. Unfortunately we will soon discover that not everything has gone according to plan and we will have to deal first with a strange form of dark energy that threatens to destroy our spaceships, the Scourge, then with a robotic race that has built strange technological artifacts that are making it unlivable the planets selected for colonization, the Relictum, and finally with an alien species that does not welcome our intervention and is also looking forto analyze and discover where the power of this highly technological species, the Kett, comes from. Basically the plot is also quite interesting and, to ensure a minimum of familiarity, we will soon have the opportunity to meet most of the races that have made the history of the saga given that, like humans, also the Asari, the Salarians, the Turians and the krogan, embarked on the Andromeda Initiative. During the adventure we will meet another new alien race which, however, will almost immediately side with us with a prudent but friendly attitude: the Angara. Obviously it wouldn't be a Mass Effect, or even a BioWare title, if it didn't have teammates. Andromeda will place next to you six that you will meet in the very first hours of the game and that will become an integral part of the Tempest, the small starship that will allow you to roam across the galaxy (yes, the criticized system scan also returns, in a lighter but however boring) and which will represent the new hub for intertwining relationships and managing every single role-playing aspect of this chapter, including multiplayer. In short, it may seem that this new chapter produced by Electronic Arts has all the credentials to mark the beginning of a new sci-fi epic but in reality there are several elements of its plot that have not convinced us to the end. First of all, the ties with companions are all quite superficial, sometimes not very credible because they are too stereotyped and in any case not very interesting. There will obviously be both heterosexual and homosexual romances and it is crucial to underline that we do not want to highlight a problem of quantity, given that there are so many dialogues. It's more a question of quality and pleasure in spending hours and hours in the company of these six adventurers. Here, on this front, we would have expected a better job from BioWare, something that made us fall in love or even just get passionate about the personal stories of these co-stars but unfortunately we have struggled a lot on this front. However, it is the more general lack of an epic tone that has left us dumbfounded. The narrative arc of Andromeda is in fact not very memorable, at times even trivial, thanks in primis to a really weak antagonist, cut with an ax as regards his motivations and which we will very often forget also due to a narrative that is a bit ' too rarefied that focuses on the smallest and most specific events, leaving the main events too much in the background. However, know that it will take you no less than forty hours to see the end of this chapter, which you can easily double when the spark of total completion lights up. But how much action is this action RPG? The second crucial element we need to focus on is the gameplay. Mass Effect: Andromeda is, concretely, an action title with a strong role-playing component. We want to leave aside the age-old debate about how much an RPG is still there or how it differs from the previous chapters because we risk getting entangled in an endless discussion and we prefer to focus on the positive and negative aspects of the game made by BioWare. Starting with what's good in the developer's new project. Andromeda offers a highly action-oriented gameplay. It is controlled like the best-known action games with a third-person view: there is a view from the viewfinder, jumping, dodging which in this case is guaranteed by a snappy jetpack, the possibility of using three powers previously assigned to the keys on the fly shoulder pads, melee strike, and switching weapons and a handful of consumables via a radial menu that pauses the game. But mostly you shoot. It shoots a lot. Just the fights and more in detail that shooting component that has roots in the foundations of this Andromeda, are without a doubt the most successful elements of the game, also thanks to a completely automatic management of the covers. The action flows fluidly, frantically and in a particularly reactive way and the result is very satisfying to the point that even the multiplayer, although an end in itself and completely separate from the single player campaign, manages to entertain for a few hours without ever being frustrating or overly repetitive. The weapons, although limited to only four categories (pistols, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper carbines) plus the melee one, return a fairly pleasant and adequately varied feedback in the combinations of fire mouths that we can take up. It is the exploration of environments in rappinstead present the negative element of our judgment. Andromeda takes up very closely the subdivision of the scenarios already seen in Dragon Age: Inquisition, to stay at BioWare, or in numerous classic role-playing games. In practice, moving aboard the Tempest we will be able to reach a handful of explorable planets (five to be exact) and some citadels that act as hubs for collecting quests, plus the Nexus, the central nucleus from which to manage the Andromeda Initiative. Each globe will consist of a map of very generous but still limited dimensions, which we can freely explore on foot or aboard the Nomad, a vehicle that closely resembles the old Mako from the first Mass Effect. In short, the concept is that of free roaming with sandbox mechanics but which has nothing to do with the open world at Grand Theft Auto. These levels will be literally chock full of points of interest that both represent the numerous quests to be completed in the order you prefer, and aim to stimulate the player who can't resist the call of collectibles for their own sake. Even without reaching the negative peaks of Inquisition which for most of the exploration forced the player to succumb to dozens of ~fetch~ quests in search of this or that map or forcing him to kill ever-increasing numbers of enemies, in Andromeda the exploratory component tends however to be too rarefied and dispersive, soon even repetitive. In fact, we will find ourselves going back and forth to these areas that are often bare and artificially filled by the forced respawn of enemies in search of yet another mineral to scan or the tenth relic to unearth. In short, there is a huge distinction between the elements directly connected to the main mission or to that small circle of missions with a strong narrative character, and all the other assignments that will be commissioned to the Ryder twins and which after the first ten, fifteen hours, weigh inexorably on the freshness of the game resulting in mere fillers that will tend to get boring too soon. The multiplayer Recovering an idea already seen in some chapters of Assassin's Creed, Mass Effect: Andromeda allows you to manage assault teams to be sent to carry out some random missions (with a completely computerized management) and recover some loot to be used later in the single player, in the form of equipment and minerals for crafting. Some adventures that these squadrons can take on are called Apex missions and can also be completed in four-player cooperative multiplayer. It is a mode completely unrelated to the single-player campaign that will allow us to choose from various pre-configured characters to upgrade and equip and then use on the battlefield made up of five different maps. The action takes place according to the more classic horde mode with seven waves of increasing difficulty interspersed with some secondary objectives such as managing control points or retrieving information through terminals scattered around the location. The rewards, in this case, are all confined to multiplayer. There is no doubt that EA and BioWare will be adding new content in the coming months, presumably at no cost. Of skills, powers and other role components The qualitative dualism of Mass Effect: Andromeda also crosses the more purely role-playing component of this spin-off sequel. The loss of the class system has in fact contributed to rejuvenating those more anachronistic mechanics that would have kept away the very new players to whom the title seems to be aimed. But this lightening in no way means impoverishment because the evolution of one's avatar now takes place through the choice of 36 skills, each of which can be upgraded to six grades without any kind of limitation or prerequisite. The result is a huge level of customization that further emphasizes the action mechanics that characterize Andromeda's gameplay. Also because the exact same system is also the basis of the evolution of the six companions. There are further elements that try to underline the role-playing depth of this Mass Effect, such as the presence of some profiles that are unlocked and enhanced based on how we decide to invest our skill points, giving us further bonuses and making it even more ~tailored~ the configuration of the protagonist. There is the inventory, a perhaps a little too convoluted quest management system and the inevitable multiple dialogues that have always characterized the series even if any desire to give a moral value to our stories has been lost along the way.", "date": "2017-03-20", "grade": "8.0"}
