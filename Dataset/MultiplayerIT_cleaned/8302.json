Sega decided to abandon the ring some time ago, entrusting veterans with the burden of remembering Virtua Fighter, its fighting game series par excellence. SNK had already anticipated it, leaving Arc System to enjoy its niche of 2D animated sprites, with Capcom and Namco dominating the major productions. Tecmo-Koei's courage to once again want to have his say on the subject is admirable, especially for the launch window chosen for the new episode of Dead or Alive, with Tekken Tag Tournament 2 just arriving on store shelves. If there is a generation that is certainly not poor in fighting games, it is precisely the one we are living in, thanks to high-definition re-propositions that have managed to fully redeem franchises such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, unworthyly dropped off the radar in the recent past, and the Soul Calibur / Tekken binomial that continues to refine its structure by continuously improving itself. With the previous chapter, developed to be one of the Xbox 360 launch titles way back in 2005, Dead or Alive 5 takes its steps in insidious terrain, but the team's quality and desire for redemption - once led by the eccentric Tomonobu Itagaki - are ready to bring one of the most famous cast ever back to the podium it deserves. This time, no beaches with buxom damsels playing beach volley matches: summer is over, now it's time to fight for real. Times change, the soul remains Tecmo-Koei is one of those publishers that doesn't churn out large quantities of titles; reserved and often out of the limelight, sure, but able to stick his nails out and strike when necessary. We still remember the world premiere presentation of Dead or Alive 5 in Shibuya, Tokyo. Yoichi Arakawa, President and CEO of Tecmo-Koei, dressed in an impeccable white suit and with great calmness, a perfect symbol of Japanese education, repeated several times to the press how the company he leads has always produced software for its fans, and so it would continue to operate. At the time it could have seemed like a clich, almost mechanical, also given the recent trend towards westernization of Japanese developers and the outsourcing of historically Japanese brands to teams without slanted eyes. However, every now and then, we like to be surprised. Dead or Alive 5 succeeds in a challenging task: to shine with its own light in a minefield full of fierce competitors, and at the same time make its fan base happy. As? Very easy: without losing its arcade soul. For the uninitiated, Dead or Alive was born on a cabinet. It was 1996 when Japanese arcades welcomed the first title in history not produced by SEGA to use the Model 2 Arcade, a graphics engine licensed by SEGA itself. Dead or Alive 5 takes up that spirit, revamping and updating it. The gameplay confirms the goodness of what Itagaki gave birth many years ago: creating a fighting game that makes its strengths of reflexes, counter-points and spectacularity, all embellished by a cast of characters capable of continuing a plot that still intrigues and pleases today the many fans scattered around the globe. In short, the team that wins does not change. Where were we? It is precisely the Story mode that allows the title to look at competitors like Namco and Capcom without shyness, guaranteeing several hours of gameplay thanks to a storyline that runs through the events of all the playable characters. You don't need to have devoured tons of books to capture a somewhat deficient narrative, with some spatio-temporal inconsistencies that underline once again how Dead or Alive 5 was developed with the fan in mind. Any outsider to the saga would turn up their noses at the elements that instead made the franchise appreciate: the measures to the limits of perfection of the attractive protagonists (slightly diminished in this episode), the nicely rambling lines of dialogue, the evident illogicality of some clashes and purely Japanese artistic design lines. Tecmo-Koei does not dirty the brand that has grown and affirms its personality by providing a Story that carries on the events of Dead or Alive 4 in their usual style, without making it obvious and too real but rather ironically forced and jovial, with notoriously old characters weird, others that seem designed a videogame era ago and some new faces to throw a bit of novelty into the whole. With a total of 71 episodes and the possibility of replaying the chapters as many times as you want, perhaps in the hope of unlocking the missions that will gradually be inserted into the battles to make them more complex, the Story modeia is an addition that carries the franchise into the new decade in just the right way. Not the best, it's true, but perfect for anyone who loves the universe invented by Tecmo-Koei. The rest is not boring A fighting game is not such without game modes that define its potential and make its content attractive. From this point of view Dead of Alive 5 does not offer particular changes compared to what has already been seen and known, but this is not always a bad thing, especially if what is proposed has the advantage of not having any shortcomings. The Arcade Mode, which has always been the flagship of the production, does not disappoint and allows you to play the classic climb of the tower as tradition teaches. With seven difficulty levels, two of which can only be unlocked in advanced points, the player must roll up their sleeves as the complexity of the clashes, even at the Normal level, is visibly set upwards and few mistakes will be allowed. Versus allows you to take on local or CPU-controlled challengers, with the usual selection of characters and playing arena that can be easily changed from within the fight. To complete the picture, the Survival Mode and the Timed Mode are inserted. The first is nothing more than a traditional survival, in which you have to fight to take out the opponents who, one after the other, without giving a break, arrive in the ring. Interestingly, the entry window of the new challenger is very short and the energy recharged at the end of each fight is very limited, to the delight of the hardcore. In Timed Mode the focus is different: with a relentlessly descending timer you have to win round after round, bearing in mind that the difficulty of the enemies is incremental and what seems like a walk in the early stages will change drastically as the challenge progresses. As inevitable as it is fundamental for those less accustomed to the gameplay of Dead or Alive, the Training Mode promises to make you familiar with the combat system, with lists of moves from which to draw your favorites and the ability to customize the movements of the exercise partner . An online system could not be missing to make players from all over the world fight. Tecmo-Koei therefore opts to remove the superfluous and compress the bare essentials, to underline once again the arcade feeling with dry, direct methods and between which to advance not without difficulty. Random button mashing is very short-lived here. 3D philosophies Dead or Alive has always distinguished itself from the rest of the fighting games for a seemingly simple system, but which makes its basics the fulcrum of the fight. The Triangle System returns, an ideal example of how the Tecmo-Koei franchise is not based on rare reproduction technicalities but on the timing of the countermoves and on the calculation of distances to better manage the animation frames of the attacks. The functioning of the system is immediate: the shots have the better of the holds, which have the better of the parries, which have the better of the shots. A sort of rock-paper-scissors that emphasizes the fraction of a second and punishes in the event of an error with the opening of relentless juggles. Novices are also warned in this case: the possibility of carrying out counter-attacks on the 3 vertical axes of punches and kicks requires particular attention to each step performed, as the reaction speed, although almost surgical, can wear you out in a very short time time anyone who is the son of a gameplay devoted solely to attack. Adding bite is a novelty of Dead or Alive 5, the Power Blow, a blow that can be charged and ~aimed~ to throw the opponent to a point on the screen. Not infallible, of course, but the challenge for those who receive it is precisely to choose the ideal timing to carry out the defensive grip and avert the danger. The lateral step in the 3D environment takes its cue from Virtua Fighter, with minimal steps capable of offsetting the horizontal axis and useful for directing the imaginary battle line in a specific direction, perhaps to take advantage of a corner and a destructible element of the screen. The game environment finally returns to dominate, and can almost be considered the third opponent on the screen. With excellent destructibility of the arenas, each encounter is a mixture of strategy and awareness, as the area puts up weak barriers to mark the demarcation between the original environment and the attainable environment by receiving pressure in the specific sections. The attention to be paid to the geography of the arena therefore weighs considerably, since knowing how to place yourself on the map can make the difference between victory and defeat, especially by virtue of a cliffhanger factor, prexempt in some maps, which punishes anyone who doesn't recover quickly from the fall, leaving their guard mortally uncovered and allowing the opponent to throw it in sequence along the various vertical levels of the arena. Playstation 3 trophies 48 trophies are available, connected to all parts of the game. Unlocking the hidden characters and learning the fundamentals will be the first steps, and then continue with the execution of certain combos. The destruction of the environments will bring some trophies as well as the online has its weight, both in hosting and gameplay. The rest are linked to the modes and challenges inherent especially in Survival and Timed mode, while completing the Arcade mode completes the list. Beauty on screen Just to wink even more to the inhabitants of the thick square of fighting games, Dead or Alive 5 allows you to carry out battles both in single and in Tag team. With the ability to switch opponents at any time and not end the fight in case one of the pair is defeated, one might wonder how the game engine reacts in the face of constantly moving scenarios with multiple characters frantically treading them. The answer is more than positive. The engine is solidly anchored to 60 frames per second even in chaotic situations of explosions or electric shocks (they will be frequent), and this despite the polygonal models of the characters are really excellent. The movement animations are more than good with a sweat effect covering the skin while fighting, visible from the change of transparency of the clothes. The ~anime~ style of the previous chapters has been slightly overshadowed, with a more realistic anatomical design of the protagonists and less of a Japanese comic. The available roster has a total of 24 characters, a small number but which among some available immediately and others unlockable (with cameos from Virtua Fighter) is more than enough to show the attention to characterization of each one, with multiple clothes available and a voice acting American who does justice to individuals. The soundtrack is the ideal element to complete the excellent overall picture: with themes that alternate well between feudal tradition and rock avant-garde, the acoustic accompaniment restores to the hearing that arcade feeling so dear to enthusiasts, with sound effects of the fight that well render the blows inflicted and the sounds around the arenas.", "date": "2012-09-28", "grade": "8.0"}
