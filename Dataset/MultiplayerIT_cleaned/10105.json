A genre born decades ago with Andromeda Quest but which only had a name in 1993, by the editor Alan Emrich, on the occasion of a preview of Master of Orion. The peculiar formula that enthralled millions of budding galactic emperors finally merged with Homeworld, giving us a real-time strategy game that a couple of years ago was able to win several awards and surprise many users. A certainly unique title that has gained depth and balance thanks to the two expansions included in the package reviewed here, Sins of the Solar Empire Trinity, but which is not without flaws. The first, and most relevant, is the total lack of a story. An unsettling choice, because a science fiction full of starry skies, incandescent planets, mythology and unique atmospheres can only bring to mind space epics and dream adventures. It happens, therefore, that by playing with it we deeply feel the lack of a story mode, of a plot that takes us where no colonizer has ever gone before. Look dad! Without plot! Fortunately, the background is solid and gives us an idea of how the three factions are at war with each other and why they have certain technologies. In essence, three races intend to expand into the universe without too many compromises and diplomacy, initially unacceptable, has developed only in recent times, or on the occasion of the release of the second expansion. TEC is a fairly aggressive trading league that uses armored vehicles equipped with powerful ballistic weapons. A couple of nuclear suppositories settle the uninvited guest Instead, Advent arose from a sect that escaped Earth space during the intergalactic wars and developed as a liberal society based on biogenetic technologies and psionic abilities. The Vasaris, on the other hand, are the only alien race, once so powerful as to dominate the galaxy with the peaceful assimilation of the weakest and the destruction of the strongest, with an approach that closely resembles some empires of our past. After the loss of its central systems for mysterious reasons, the powerful empire has turned into a population of refugees trying to return to its former glory. To achieve this goal they rely on the few but extremely powerful units that distinguish the Vasari fleet. Set sail the space anchors! As we said, there is no plot and each game, single or multiplayer, is a large-scale strategic skirmish. But while some maps are small and fast, others are so large that they constitute campaigns in their own right and the atmosphere all in all defends itself more than well, almost creating the illusion that everything makes sense. The beating heart of Sins of a Solar Empire - and therefore of this Trinity package - is the management of the military forces which guarantee the basic defensive capacity and therefore allow the development of technology, the search for resources and the planning of invasions or diplomatic actions. At the center of the system we find the hangar. A skeletal structure, similar to the orbital shipyards of Star Trek, from which the frigates are able to colonize and build defensive systems. Frigates form the base of the pyramid and are divided into fighters, defenders, long-range attackers, support ships, siege ships, and colony ships. In the middle are the cruisers, more specialized and more resistant. Leading the fleet are instead the battleships, the capital ships, which are both a defensive resource and the spearhead during conquest actions. In any case, they can be used in the same ways in which we use frigates, and therefore also as support ships, albeit with all the bonuses that a flying aircraft carrier can have, which include a much higher structural strength than that of frigates. In fact, a mother ship can have a squadron of aircraft capable of nimbly fighting in space or a contingent of bombers that can quickly clean up the structures occupying asteroids or planets we are interested in. In addition to managing bombers we can develop the skills of capital ships that can gain experience by winning battles to get skill points to spend on certain offensive or defensive technologies. Basics In addition to the development of the fleet, it is important to develop the planets, both to increase the collection of materials and to draw on resources such as civilians who unfortunately do not grow on asteroids (ancient space proverb ed.). To leave a planet's orbit and begin exploration, it is necessary to move away from the gravitational well. Aarea subject to gravity that surrounds a planet and prevents the use of extra-planetary drive. To indicate the way out are the phase lane. Phase highways that allow you to get to the nearest planet without inconvenience. They are located on the edge of the gravitational well and like the latter are indicated by a luminous trace. The area subject to the force of gravity also constitutes the orbital area where to build defense, colonization and construction structures and also represents the main battlefield of Sins of a Solar Empire. It is very important to take into account the factors that characterize the area in which we find ourselves fighting. Some, in fact, not only provide economic or management bonuses but suffer environmental effects and have a different size of the gravitational well. Solar storms, for example, suck up antimatter leaving ships unable to use their abilities, while stars, in contrast, increase antimatter regeneration which allows us to increase the rate at which we use abilities but are large and slow to traverse. The location of structures must also be carefully considered. The most exposed place is certainly the one outside the gravitational zone of the planet, especially in the junction points of the phase lanes from which it is quite probable that sooner or later a scout or an enemy invasion fleet will emerge. So it might be wise to build several defenses in this area even if the moment enemies get past it we could have problems in the rear. Finally we come to the artifacts chapter. These are very powerful objects that we can find by exploring the planets and which guarantee important bonuses both for the management part and for actions on the field. Some of the most useful combat bonuses allow us, for example, to considerably increase the damage or decrease the consumption of antimatter. entrenchment In the first of the two expansions inserted in Trinity, the defensive technological tree adds a new dimension to the fights and offers specific skills that correspond to the peculiarities of each people, further increasing the specificity of the three factions in the field. The new defensive options obviously allow for new defensive strategies and radically change the gaming experience, as well as preventing the interruption of a long-planned invasion due to a sudden pirate attack. The construction of starbases, carefully developed in key points of our empire, can allow us to wipe out enemy fleets in the blink of an eye. The bases can be placed anywhere, but the development is quite expensive and it is good to make sure you can use skills such as phase shift inhibitor and the ability to harbor governments under attack which allows us to reclaim the gravity well of the related planet . But the defensive combination of mines and starbase can make the empire's core systems virtually impenetrable, so a prudent empire might decide to keep the most powerful technological concentrate of all Sins of a Solar Empire close to its heart. Note the addition of some diplomatic options that allow you to establish non-aggression pacts and trade relations as well as the possibility of adding commercial docks to starbases that allow you to increase revenue. Diplomacy The latest expansion to Sins of a Solar Empire adds a very useful speed multiplier, two difficulty levels and a few maps, but essentially, as the title suggests, is dedicated to expanding the diplomatic side of the title. The diplomatic technology tree allows us to enter into alliances, to pay pirates to direct their attention towards third parties, to formulate missions ourselves to propose to the other forces in the field and in this way adds the possibility of using an opponent to strike an enemy . Unfortunately there is no way to come to terms with the pirates on peaceful terms and it is good to make sure you have your defenses ready when the buccaneers turn their sails in our direction. In fact, pirates are much more fearsome than in the past and a third tech tree means a third way to spend money. And money, unfortunately, cannot be enough for everything. The diplomatic route is therefore demanding and fraught with dangers, even more than the military one which, at worst, allows us to always and in any case be attentive to direct threats. Furthermore, although the game explains in detail what to pay attention to in order to be at peace with the other empires, it is not at all easy to follow an additional management component. A sea of variables that overlap the basic ones and include thefleet power which again absolutely cannot be overlooked. On the contrary, a diplomatic ship is added to the fleet, essential for quickly creating opportunities for dialogue and being able to immediately benefit from all the bonuses that mutual agreements can guarantee. In any case, the possibility of a diplomatic victory represents a new type of challenge, a completely alternative way to win the game that is based on the amount of positive relationships obtained. Technology Sins of a Solar Empire is quite intuitive and not too dissimilar to many other real-time strategy games. Several shortcuts make our lives easier. Zoom is implemented simply and effectively. Just double click on an object and give us the scroll wheel to be able to observe it in close-up or reduce it to a speck of dust without the camera rejecting a millimeter. To follow a target by dedicating a camera to it we must instead hold down ctrl and then left click on the unit. Finally, pressing the shift key allows us to dose the zoom during battles and prevents our gaze from staring at an entire solar system while our fleet blows up in a corner. Everything else works through understandable icons and technological trees that take little time to decipher and allow anyone to quickly approach the gameplay of the Stardock title. The multiplayer component allows 10 players to challenge each other online or on the local network and also allows you to participate as simple observers. The Ironclad network is quite advanced and implements matchmaking, statistics and leaderboards for free. The sampled voices are excellent, the symphonies are suggestive and the new video effects are modest but spot on. The overall rendering is pleasant which does justice to the spatial distances and stellar combustions and above all allows us to witness delighted battles literally full of vessels, stations and turrets without losing a frame even on dated systems. Certainly asteroids and details leave something to be desired and the engine is certainly not the latest but it is still sufficient to hold up the game and give us the idea of a living universe that is absolutely worth conquering.", "date": "2010-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
