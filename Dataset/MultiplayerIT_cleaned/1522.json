{"name": "Republic: The revolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/republic-the-revolution-3.html", "text": "Rock 'n Roll Robots (?). In the shoes of this man, to whom it is our duty as players to give a name, we begin our rise to power in Novistrana, with the intention of deposing the current president by any means possible: dirty and even more dirty. The curtain rises on the charming city of Ekaterine, where we will have to contend with a fairly malleable electorate and with some not too difficult missions: a good gym to then launch ourselves into the actual game, but first things first. As soon as we left we find ourselves in front of the Elixir Studios masterpiece or that graphics engine that has been talked about so much at E3 and the like, which has made us cry out for a miracle and which instead has so little miraculous, unfortunately. The cities are very well made, nothing to say about this. The buildings are extremely detailed, the traffic and people are exuberant in polygons and so varied as to create a more homogeneous and dynamic panorama than that seen in games such as GTA3 or GTA3VC. The night-day cycle is a small show to admire, to see how the shadows change angle and how the light plays with the reflections of the windows of the buildings depending on the time of day and while all this happens the city moves accordingly : people leave their houses to go to work, in the evening perhaps they go to the clubs to have fun and during the night few wander through the deserted streets of the cities of Novistrana. It's a pity that all this is enormously burdensome for our PCs and above all for our RAM: in fact, in medium detail, the smallest city (Ekaterine) snaps as if seized by delirium tremens at every passage of the mouse at a close-up view. I tried (amd 2200+, 512mb ram and ati radon 9700) to turn up the detail level and the delirium turns into catatonic state per second which is rather frustrating than that. 2d or 3d?. But all this is nothing in front of the main problem of the uselessness of this engine. I align myself with the large mass of foreign and Italian colleagues who have declared that Republic, without a shadow of a doubt, is very playable from the present 2D interface that probably even a 386 could manage. Throughout the game you will never go around the 3D world except on occasions when, as a consequence of your action, some animated sequence does not appear, or in certain phases in which you will have to follow your alter ego for a walk around the neighborhoods in some investigation mission, during which you will have to pilot certain discoveries by clicking on the buildings containing particular clues, that's all. This is the maximum level of interaction with the three-dimensional environment that caused such a sensation and amazed us at past fairs (E3 and company...); sure it's a great sight, but very soon you will fully enter the rhythm of the game, you will forget about it and you will stop looking at the sun reflecting on the houses, the trees swaying in the wind and maybe you will stop clicking on every single city lupanare hoping that something will happen ... dirty. Politics and game schemes. The game, we said, can be conducted very well from the two-dimensional view, also because only from this view will you be able to speed up the course of events and overcome the frequent dead times. You live from day to day, so the game will be developed in four rounds (morning, afternoon, evening and let's see if you get there) during which you can assign actions to be performed by you and your henchmen. With the intention of gaining the favor of the population, balancing your nonsense with what people think and want, you will be able to take part in a truly vast and divided series of actions, as well as the neighborhoods and the very thought of the people, in three different ideologies. Politics, economy and brute force (I like it!) will be the three factors of approval of the urban crowds of Novistrana and you will have to choose which wave to ride or find a way to stay in the balance, why not, even between all three. Each ideology determines the feasible actions of your followers and the effectiveness of these in the districts in which you decide to act. During the game, your men grow with experience, receive new skills and can more or less conflict with your way of leading the party, if your ideology has deviated too much from theirs. As if it were a small RPG within the management game, you will also have to decide where to have your men live, to protect and hide them from possible assailants piloted by rivals or to avoid attempts at corruption that may distance them from your cause, pushesput them in someone else's arms. The resources you accumulate are the points deriving from the three ideological areas and can only be spent with actions of the same ideology. So if you control only financial districts you will receive only this type of support and you will be able to carry out only actions related to this ideology and you will have your men belonging to different ideologies: simple? Enough, however know that at the end of the shifts, therefore every new morning, the accounts will be done and you will receive the dindi you are entitled to. More on gameplay... Hence the absolutely not easy gameplay for novice politicians, with an absolutely steep learning curve, but which suggests what kind of complex work Hassabis and his companions have done to program this game as colossal as it is Orwellian. In short, a job for refined minds for sure: carefully follow the good manual in Italian, otherwise you will find yourself in serious trouble and you will spend the first two hours of the game not understanding anything and cursing Karasov in vain. On the other hand, once you get carried away with your first political campaign, the winning mechanisms will be revealed and you will realize how it can be too elementary to outrun the competition. Of course, Elixir has inserted a whole series of missions to follow, one still moves within a well-constructed plot, but even these obstacles will no longer be insurmountable once the interface is won and one understands the way ideologies and actions can interact with each other Is it a game, a set of games or a double pack of coasters? In short, until the last minute I didn't understand what the hell game we should expect and reading from the forums around, many expected a much more action game like Grand Theft Auto. Negative, what you see from the screenshots is just a window dressing, nothing else. The beautiful and heavy engine is useless, put it in your head. Having clarified the concept, we can say that the fears that I still expressed at the time of the interview with the guys from Elisir and with Mr. Hassabis in the lead, almost all of them have been revealed. We discovered that the game is a management game, we discovered that the super AI is there but you can't see it and that everything is very beautiful and complex but you don't know what it's for. It's strange to talk about Republic, it's like opening a box expecting to find something (imagine ONE something) and instead you find a lot of pieces, some very beautiful, of other objects and you don't quite understand why all this. Republic is one of those plastic eggs that are given to children for Easter: they put random things in there, there is no logic! (I had a difficult childhood, I know). In short, it is difficult to give a definition. They wanted to make the most original video game of the year and as a conception they have certainly succeeded, at a technical level we could discuss it for hours, but as a game they have managed to come up with a mediocre product, which has many more than positive ideas, but seems unable to explore many of them. Conclusion Either for the initial complexity, or for the idea itself, Republic is not a game for everyone, but surely those who love management could find it one of the most intriguing ever seen on the market. The gameplay, albeit with some risk of repetitiveness, repays the effort made to understand the basic mechanisms and the accuracy in building the world of Novistrana cannot leave you indifferent. If you are addicted to the Tycoon series and have taken away your dose this is for you, if you are frustrated neo-dictators as well, if you spend your days in pet shops staring at the ants under glass: you must have it. The others think about it very, very well. Pros: Impressive technical realization Engaging for all managers Good storyline Excellent soundtrack Remains one of the most original titles of recent years Cons: Very heavy 3d engine Can get repetitive No interaction with the 3d environment One name, one nation. Novistrana is a republic of the former Soviet Union, a republic on paper, since the head of government, President Karasov, was appointed by the executive: president for life. As in any self-respecting ~banana republic~, the daily routine is well marked: kidnappings, disappearances, mysterious political assassinations and absurd laws that criminalize anyone looking for a space to express ideas contrary to those of the dictator/president in office. Our protagonist overlooks this scenario, the neo-leader of a new political faction, who lost his parents during the yearsi of his childhood. His father and mother were kidnapped by the Karasov political police and probably killed in some dark dungeon of the Ministry of Interior in Novistrana.", "date": "2003-10-23", "grade": null}
