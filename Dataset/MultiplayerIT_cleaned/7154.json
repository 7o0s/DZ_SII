{"name": "Child of Light", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131178-child-of-light-la-nuova-luce.html", "text": "Even if the world of video games thrives on fads and trends, which are the ones that drive sales and allow dizzying collections together with the growth of the market, the variety of these productions is something that must never be questioned. Also because the potential audience is so varied that even unconsciously it needs to ~disconnect~ from classic genres from time to time to try titles that come out of the box, not only in terms of gameplay, but also visual and artistic. This fate often unites games in two dimensions, no longer attractive to the general public as in the past but often a forge of experimental productions that turn out to be real jewels. On 2D Ubisoft has created a respectable graphics engine, UbiArt Framework, and brought back the Rayman series with two two-dimensional platformers, Origins and Legends, in our opinion among the best in recent years. This engine has proved to be perfect for expressing Child of Light at its best, a new production by Ubisoft Montreal that wants to tell a fairy tale in the form of a light but not trivial role-playing game, through a narration set up as if it were a poem and completely dubbed in Italian. Fairy tale and role-playing game, all in two dimensions, this is Ubisoft's Child of Light Little Aurora We are at the end of the 1800s and Aurora, daughter of the Duke of Austria, has fallen into a deep sleep that has projected her into the world of Lemuria, threatened by Umbra, the queen of the night. The young protagonist can only watch her father fall into illness and the kingdom into disgrace, but the hope of saving everything lies in recovering the sun, moons and stars within the lands of Lemuria. Shortly after her awakening Aurora meets Igniculus, a small firefly that keeps her company and allows her to illuminate dark places and even blind her enemies, on the other hand light is the perfect antithesis of darkness and the path to follow to get the better of the corruption of Umbrian. Thus begins the adventure of the protagonist who will find herself facing strange creatures in the different settings available, but also meeting new friends who will join her in battle and who may have missions for her to accomplish. Aurora is able to hover in the air and accelerate with the pressure of the X key, Igniculus is controlled instead with the right analog (or with a second pad) and, using L2, the touch pad of the DualShock 4 or R3 is able to release light useful for solving some puzzles, projecting the shadow of objects, or as mentioned to blind opponents and take them by surprise. By exploring the map it is possible to open chests, collect power-up spheres and interact with non-player characters, in order to complete missions or simply learn more about the world of Lemuria. Enemies are visible on the screen and can be engaged by touch or completely avoided in most cases: an inadvisable choice because each game character has a level of growth and the value of enemies is fixed according to the setting inside of which we are. The combat system incorporates some elements of the exponents of the genre such as the legendary ATB bar of Final Fantasy or Grandia's own system, and reworks them in a personal key to offer an interesting version. Each character, ally and enemy, is positioned on a time bar divided into two phases, called Wait and Launch. Once the beginning of the second is reached, it is possible to choose the type of action between attack/defence/potions/spells: each one has a different preparation speed, and if one were to be hit during this period of time, the action is canceled and the character pushed back on the time bar. Obviously there are potions and spells to slow down / speed up the characters or not to be interrupted during the launch phase, all expressed with extreme clarity and without going too deep. Also during the fight it is possible to move Igniculus to blind the opponents and therefore slow down their movement on the bar; his energy reserve is not infinite and therefore you have to choose sparingly who to slow down, perhaps the next one who is about to attack or the most dangerous enemy of the group. Battle tale Another thing that must be taken into account is that each opponent is resistant or weak to a particular type of element, the more difficult ones also counterattack when interrupted or hit by spells and physical attacks, a good mix therefore to be taken into consideration when adopting the right strategy in relation to the opponent. Within combat they can eThere can be a maximum of two allied characters, but at each ~turn~ it is possible to change them without time penalties: especially during battles with the bosses it is desirable to alternate them by exploiting their specific characteristics, because each one is specialized in a specific field. This is because there is the classic skill chessboard, within which the points obtained at each level must be spent according to three distinct paths. Each upgrade is visible with a description, but you have to choose which direction to go in order to have a balanced and diversified group of characters. Inside the chests scattered around the map it is possible to collect the so-called Oculi, small fragments that can be used alone or combined to compose even more powerful fragments. These Oculi must be grafted into the weapon, armor or amulet and allow you to obtain benefits such as elemental attacks, greater resistance, speed or greater experience. The system is interesting even if underdeveloped: the combinations are not many or deep, rather it is a good idea to enhance each character with a different elemental attack, in such a way as to have all the possibilities available when facing enemies. Ultimately, Child of Light's combat system is quite dynamic and non-trivial, it doesn't go into too much detail especially in terms of levels and customization, but it's not as simple as it might seem at first. It must also be said that in the options it is possible to change, without penalties regarding trophies / objectives, both the speed of the clashes according to five steps and the degree of difficulty between normal and difficult; to experts of the genre we recommend the highest value to always have a fair level of challenge. Exploration and missions follow the lines of combat and are dynamic and simple to complete; the world of Lemuria is littered with secrets that are never too difficult to reach, the missions are clear and take their time but little gray way, as well as the environmental puzzles that you take ~home~ after a short time. As new settings are discovered, it is possible to move by fast travel and therefore if on the one hand the game dynamics are perfect, never boring or repetitive, on the other hand there is a lack of depth and typical elements of an RPG structure such as the management of the equipment, probably due to a precise choice by Ubisoft to focus on the overall experience linked to the narrative. Playstation 4 trophies We completed Child of Light in about 10 hours, collecting 19 trophies out of the 20 available and completing all side missions together with a good 80% of the secrets; the average duration could therefore realistically be around 8-9 hours, absolutely good considering that the game costs 15 euros. Once the main story has been completed, it is possible to devote oneself to any secondary activities that have remained pending, in the main menu the classic New Game + also becomes available which allows you to face more difficult enemies and maintain the levels and skills already achieved. Strangely, there is no gallery of sketches and artwork, which we would have liked a lot given the excellent quality from this point of view. Artistically sublime Child of Light is set up like a real fairy tale, with a narrative voice that underlines the most important passages and an extremely peculiar artistic style typical of large-scale production: Ubisoft claimed to have been inspired by productions such as those of Studio Ghibli, the drawings of very good Yoshitaka Amano (Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy X, Front Mission and many others, but also a freelance illustrator) and titles such as Vagrant Story which, in some ways, Child of Light visually recalls. The result is nothing short of excellent: each setting of Lemuria is delightful to see, artistically exquisite and full of personality, it manages to perfectly convey the idea of being inside a fairy tale. The graphic engine already used in Rayman Legends has also proved to be perfect for this purpose, the image is always fluid and clean, it often seems to be in front of a moving picture and each element is designed with extreme abundance of detail. Fascinating, we would say, also because the musical accompaniment is of a sublime level, thanks to the soundtrack composed by the Canadian artist Coeur de Pirat (real name Batrice Martin, only 24 years old) in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil Media. The result is being able to listen to exceptional pieces starting from the main theme created by the Bratislava Philharmonic Orchestra, which manages to express melancholy, energy, happiness and many other emotions at thethe same time, to the point of literally creeping into the head. The dubbing as mentioned is completely in Italian and quite good, it follows the exposition in the form of a poem with rhyming couplets but perhaps the texts are a bit heavy to read in some situations, albeit always peculiar and made with care. Graphics, soundtrack and exposition give a lot of strength to the narrative, therefore, which is perfectly packaged together with the world of Lemuria and its always well-characterized characters. If you dig deep, however, you notice how the story is not that much original or has particularly exciting moments, except for those audio / visual aspects mentioned several times; which are not trivial stuff, of course.", "date": "2014-04-28", "grade": "8.8"}
