{"name": "Ducati World Championship - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ducati-world-championship-recensione.html", "text": "Not just on Sundays Artematica, with this latest effort, probably wanted to offer players a gaming experience that is as long-lasting and varied as possible: in addition to offering different driving styles, ranging from the classic Arcade to accurate simulation, you will also be free to choose for which category of motorcycle racing, among four different options, namely Classic, Sport, Superbike and Racing, all cleverly characterized. The Classic category, as can easily be understood, will allow you to use classic street bikes, which are the intermediate choice between speed and handling, while the Sport category will see you involved in managing models such as the Ducati 998 and 999, which, while offering decidedly superior performance to the smooth version of the bikes, they are still far from the racing versions. Things will really start to get serious when you get on a Superbike or Racing motorcycle, including the very fast Desmo Sedici used by the Ducati Corse Team during the World Championships. In case you feel able to retrace the career steps of greats like Valentino Rossi, or better (given the licence), like Loris Capirossi, you can embark on the Career mode, where you will have to start from the bottom line, namely the C Class, going up to the sound of cups and first places up to Class A, where you will finally put the best bikes and, of course, also the best riders under your greedy clutches. Is the pink sheet enough? Each bike made available by the game, for a total of over 70 different types (obviously also including the variants), are defined by the classic values of speed, acceleration and maneuverability, which while representing defined standards, can be cleverly modified during the course of the game, and not only through the classic setup of your racing car: Artematica, determined to amaze, has made it possible to modify both the position of the pilot, choosing between aerodynamics, which therefore allows for greater speed, but a clear reduction in grip , and a more comfortable posture, which will produce reverse effects; these postures, while not going to distort the values of the bikes, add a pinch of strategy to each race, transferring a much greater sensation of realism to the player. To make the Simulation mode even more difficult, the possibility of choosing which brake to brake with has been introduced, whether the front one, the rear one or both, and obviously, the choice has precise consequences: using the front disc, for example, the bike will enter a slight drift, so as to maintain traction on the rear wheel when exiting a corner, in order not to lose too much speed, and precious seconds. to make the Simulation mode even more difficult, the possibility of choosing which brake to brake with has been introduced, whether the front one, the rear one or both, and obviously, the choice has precise consequences Is the pink sheet enough? However, although the more realistic mode requires a more reasoned approach, and a much greater amount of details to be taken into consideration, this is neither too demanding nor particularly difficult, largely passing over some factors, such as physics for example, making it even distant goal of pure simulation. Eh, the dear Fast & Furious The idea of simulation is lost even more when you become aware of other elements introduced by the developers, aimed at further ~enriching~ the gameplay, such as the physical health of your driver, exactly as happened in the Black Beans masterpiece, SCAR. You will therefore have to worry about not excessively damaging either the rider or the bike itself, under penalty of heavy penalties in terms of performance, until you reach the withdrawal from the race. Then when the adrenaline in your body has reached excessive values, conveniently measured by an indicator, you will have the option to relax by accelerating in an absolutely unreal way, like a sort of turbo, ubiquitous in all arcade and humorous driving games. Fortunately, this does not represent a particularly serious fault, considering that the Ducati World Championship does not present itself as a rigid simulation, but rather as a title that manages to unite those who simply want to race, and those who want to do it with a certain realism, without touching any of the two extremes: unrealistic lean angles and turbo adrenaline are welcome, because they only increase the fun. Old Fashion Unfortunately, there is no shortage of known complaints: without considering that the purists of the genre will find themselves faced with a title purely based on the arcade, the main limitation that DWC encountersit is given precisely by its aesthetic aspect. It is clear that the developers had to deal with a relatively small budget compared to competing productions, and therefore it must not have been possible for them to invest in a particularly valid engine; all the models, in fact, are designed in a particularly rigid way, covered with low-resolution textures (especially the motorcyclists' suits), and the few animations are summarily created, especially during crashes in the race, where both the bodies and motorcycles do not follow the slightest physical law. The lack of middleware that simulates some basic physical law, such as gravity and friction, will allow players to perform actions on the edge of reality, such as making curves with inclinations close to 90. Then the particle effects, or more generically defined as ~special~, are disappointing, which essentially boil down to a badly made blur effect, which should simulate speed, and effects such as smoke and mud on the screen, present if you launch into a dirt road, or the density of the rain, which does not significantly affect playability. Final comment Ducati World Championship is a title that takes full advantage of its license, but only and exclusively that, revealing a decidedly playable and very fun arcade setting, both thanks to the numerous game modes and the vast range of motorcycles from which we will be able to choose our medium, thus presenting itself to a vast audience who intend to spend several dozen hours in the company of a good title. It can also be interesting for its selling price: Ducati World Championship is in fact sold at a budget price, allowing you to enjoy several hours of fun, spending little. Pro Very affordable price Fun and immediate Music by Lacuna Coil! Cons Graphically poor Not recommended for purists of the genre Only an official license Finally a local product! Italy is certainly not known worldwide for its production of videogame software: apart from spaghetti and pizza, videogames baked by programmers from the Bel Paese are decidedly rare. Fortunately, despite the arid environment that surrounds them, some daredevil developers have decided to challenge this trend, publishing some more or less widespread titles: we are talking about Artematica, the same guys who gave us the discreet Druuna: Morbus Gravis and the much better Martin Mystere: Operation Dorian Gray. Today, the Italians are trying to tackle a particularly difficult mission: to unseat the MotoGP commercial series from the podium, taking advantage of the collaboration (and licence!) of one of the best existing motorcycle brands; and it is precisely from this happy marriage that the Ducati World Championship was born!", "date": "2006-10-05", "grade": null}
