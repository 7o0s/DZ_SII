This is one of the very few negative things that can be included in the review of Immortals Fenyx Rising, the new product from Ubisoft Quebec. The studio responsible for the controversial Assassin's Creed Odyssey is back on the market two years later with a fresh and damn interesting project. Capable of surprising and entertaining, without ever trying to overdo it, Immortals Fenyx Rising is one of the great surprises of this year and of this beginning of the generation, as well as the confirmation that something is really changing at Ubisoft. A story full of great ideas If you are among those who played the demo available on Stadia a few weeks ago, it will have immediately become clear to you how the idea behind Immortals Fenyx Rising was to play with Greek mythology and turn it over on itself, so as to create an amusing canvas of entr'actes on the verge of cabaret. The problem with that fraction of the title, extrapolated from its totality, was found in the fact that it only transformed events into a series of situations bordering on trashy, and more than a laugh they elicited a bored look. For this reason, the first of the great news, speaking of the substance of this new Ubisoft project, is that instead the narration works, entertains, blends well with the adventurous spirit and stylistic signature. Whether it is the result of some revisions of the texts or the simple knowledge of the context and of the totality of the narrative plot, what matters is that the story of Immortals Fenyx Rising runs smoothly and deliciously, with joy but without disdaining some important moments of reflection. The player plays Fenyx, a mortal being shipwrecked on the Golden Isle and likely the sole survivor of his vessel. After becoming aware of the presumed death of his brother, an esteemed Greek warrior, he is soon approached by a thief, who turns out to be Hermes and who will explain to him what is happening on the island. In fact, all human beings have been turned into stones and the fury of the titan Typhon is slowly transporting the world into oblivion. Even the other Gods are not ready to face him, now transformed into the shadow of themselves and deprived of their essence, confined in the depths of the crypts of the Underworld. On this assumption as tragic as usual a campaign then unfolds with a minimum duration of about twenty hours of play, which it is possible to double by wanting to complete everything that can be completed. What is strongly surprising about the plot of Immortals Fenyx Rising is its ability not to take itself seriously, to joke and make fun of the mythology to which it refers, but without disrespecting it. On the contrary, it is instead capable of illustrating many of the social and political subtexts of the Greek pantheon, with a lightness and an ironic attitude that is truly out of the ordinary. All seasoned with an exceptional couple to narrate in the background, teasing each other and putting on the plate the strengths and weaknesses of the greats of Greek mythology. Zeus and Prometheus are in fact there, constantly present, the first always controversial and full of himself, while the second close to mortals and Fenyx in this specific case, as the myth has been narrating for thousands of years. The relationship between the two, and the way in which this mixes with the stories of the main Gods to be saved and some iconic places, is certainly one of the most successful elements of the production, which clearly clarifies a fundamental concept that Immortals Fenyx Rising transmitted from the first to the last instant: the fun and passion of the team. On the other hand, that in Ubisoft Quebec there are many fans of Zeus and company is a fact. Two years ago Assassin's Creed: Odyssey had highlighted the desire to tell Greece and its myths, ending up however, at least for the writer, to exaggerate in quantity and without ever reaching a truly successful writing quality. Probably the need to remain entangled within some particularly obligatory directions such as those of an important series such as Assassin's Creed did not help the team to feel free to test and experiment. Immortals, born from the same passion but free from previous schemes, instead represents the great revenge of the team, which in record time managed to put on the market a well-structured, honest title, full of interesting situations. Between puzzles, swords and arrows If you were one of those who expected Immortals Fenyx Rising to be a miniature Assassin's Creed clone, or conversely a rosewater Breath of the Wild, you can begin to make amends. The truth is that the newUbisoft title shines with its own light, without overdoing it or innovating forcefully, but putting together a whole series of already known elements, adapting and amalgamating them in the best way. If we had to necessarily enclose it in a genre, this Immortals could be defined as a pure action adventure. This definition, now vague and approximate, however, contains the very essence of a limited but never banal experience, honest from the start with the player, but not for this reason unable to indulge in variations on the path and some interesting flashes in the design. In practice, our goal will be to wander around the map in an open world dozens of times smaller than that of the team's previous project, but still capable of being quite all-encompassing, especially thanks to the differentiation of its regions. Each of the macro areas corresponds to a specific divinity and this brings with it particular characteristics, iconic elements of the mythology linked to the character and, in some cases, even some variations in terms of biomes. During the adventure we will be called upon to restore four of the most important Greek deities to their former glory: Aphrodite, Athena, Hephaestus and Ares. Each of these, due to the work of Typhon, has lost its essence and thus also its appearance, turning some into a tree, some into a chicken. We are not going to tell you too much about this aspect, because the relationship between the deities, their past and the actions they regret or have forgotten, are the basis of all the successful storytelling of the game. What we will limit ourselves to saying here is that progressing in the main missions and helping the Gods will also mean growing and prospering, recovering new gadgets, making new friends and accumulating materials useful for Fenyx upgrades. Role playing The role-playing aspect is precisely one of those that, in an emblematic way, represents the solidity of Immortals Fenyx Rising. The Ubisoft product has no intention of being a full-blown RPG, just as the focus of its progression is not the accumulation of experience points and infinite skill trees. The immediacy of Immortals can be breathed everywhere, even in the design of each of its parts, capable of surprising for how genuine and fun it is. The customization, starting from a bland character editor with very few options, passing through the inventory menu, plays heavily on carrying out activities around the map. This is in fact littered with optional tasks, ranging from the simple killing of enemies so as to unlock otherwise locked chests, passing through mythical running tests, archery or the collection of specific objects such as ragweed. Once the required number of materials has been collected, it is possible to return to the hall of the gods and request the relative upgrade. Alongside the activities on the main map, the world is then littered with other places, called Crypts, which function as real mini-dungeons. These play a fundamental role, because in addition to being based on a series of very precise physical and logical rules, they also represent a source of a fundamental material for the game: Zeus' lightning. By hoarding and using this item, Fenyx's stamina can be increased. This feature is the basis of the gameplay, made up of controlled glides, climbs, sprints and skills. Each of these actions consumes resistance, until you find yourself tired and unable to continue, giving the title that minimum of attention to the planning of the next moves, without however becoming talkative and distracting. The environmental and logical puzzles, based on basic physics and leaving aside too bizarre solutions, go smoothly which is a pleasure, requiring a pinch of reasoning and still giving satisfaction at the end of the mini quest. This desire not to stress and frustrate the player has not turned into the lack of inspiration or the slavish repetition of always the same activities. In fact, almost all crypts have a key element to exploit, which is readjusted for the entire duration of the assignment and which you will hardly see reused in the exact same way in another one. What is really surprising, net of some obviously more successful places than others are the four main crypts (as well as a final phase which we absolutely do not want to tell you about), and they are those specifically related to the Gods. In these cases the situation becomes more detailed and demanding, leading to dungeons that can last up to an hour and which alternate puzzles with bare and raw combat. In these cases the game combinesa series of characteristics learned over time, he turns them on themselves and also adapts them visually and in terms of design to the god of reference and to the lore that distinguishes him. It is in these moments that all the team's inspiration really comes out: capable of playing with shapes, colours, weights, distances, the wind, as well as many other elements, masterfully extricating oneself from all these details. Combat system A good action adventure must necessarily bring an excellent combat system as a dowry, under penalty of boredom and frustration. We already knew that the Ubisoft Quebec guys are good from this point of view. Assassin's Creed: Odyssey made combat and the amalgamation with special abilities its real strength. Immortals Fenyx Rising starts from there, from immediacy and frenzy, careful to dose your cards well and not to overdo it even in this case The fundamental elements remain the light and heavy attack, always delegated to the backbone and the right trigger; as well as the parry, which is activated by pressing the two backbones simultaneously. The combination of these elements with mythical abilities, which are activated by exploiting resistance and without ever being able to abuse them, generates a dance on the screen capable of satisfying the player who has learned its dynamics well. Each enemy has unique characteristics on its side. Whether they are simple soldiers, up to cyclops, hellhounds and gorgons, the goal is always to charge the enemy's stun bar thanks to heavy attacks or special skills, and then continue to beat him once stunned. To make everything even more clear and outlined, the developers have seen fit to divide the weapons into two specific categories, which are flanked by the bows for ranged attacks. With the pressure of the right back, in fact, the use of the sword is activated, delegated to light attacks but ringed in rapid succession. Through the trigger instead you will be able to unload the power of your ax on the enemy, slower but very useful for quickly increasing the opponent's stunning. Simple, immediate, but not without depth. The presence of exponentially better hit feedback than in the past for the team, as well as the choice not to get lost in a brainy and dispersive loot system, has pushed Immortals to sobriety, which as you will have understood by now is the cornerstone of the whole production. Finding new weapons, as well as new breastplates or helmets, simply means changing the special perk you want to have active at that particular moment. Without affecting the strength and defense values which remain generic for the chosen category and which are raised from time to time in the Hall of the Gods, by spending some particular fragments. This choice, as well as the general feedback of the combat system, does not we hide that on more than one occasion it reminded us of God of War's past, also thanks to the distant camera and the immediacy in combat. We're sure that setting was one of Ubisoft Quebec's sources of inspiration. In the same way we believe it was with regard to the bosses, many in terms of number but perhaps not among the most successful elements of the production. A world full of colors We conclude this long review of Immortals Fenyx Rising by talking about its stylistic feature and its technical aspect. Specifically, we played and completed it in its PS5 version, but were also able to briefly test the PC version. The world recreated in the game is beautiful, colorful and very well inspired from a design point of view. It is clear that the narrative choice to limit the human presence makes it less ~alive~, but we are still talking about an open world several times less extensive than any other of the open worlds created by Ubisoft. What is really surprising, allow us, is finally finding us faced with a technically well-crafted title, which arrives on the market clean and free from bugs of any kind. This is also and above all possible due to an aspect largely touched upon in the course of this review: the limited experience, in its most positive form. Immortals doesn't go overboard in any respect. He is always consistent with himself and honest with the player and this has allowed the team to dedicate the right amount of time to cleaning up a code that seems almost from another time. Alongside a very interesting technical side, which on PS5 runs in its performance mode at a high and solid frame rate, we can also find a well-done Italian dubbing capable of rendering the ironic but at the same time passionate stylistic well. make the mistake of considering it technically poor.
