The Limbic and Kalypso Media series has managed to stand out in the flood of managerial and strategic titles of various types thanks to a very particular characterisation, starting from a brilliant idea: given that in these games it is essentially a matter of concentrating enormous powers in the hands of a person, why not directly exploit the classic stereotype of the dictator, somewhat unmasking the spirit that, like it or not, is intrinsically hidden in this type of product? And why not do it in an ironic way, essentially making fun of figures of this type? The result is an ingenious caricature which at the same time allows us to make the grimmest decisions by fitting perfectly into the complex management mechanisms and at the same time making fun of the whole system. Moreover, it must be said that we have gone from an always sarcastic but still rather ~serious~ vision of the first chapters to a progressive lightening of the tones in the latter, increasingly inclined to the goliardic spirit without renouncing the usual structural complexity of the game. In any case, do not expect to simply have to smoke a cigar and make it a law to wear underwear over trousers so that you can check that it is clean, like any dictator of the Bananas Free State in full ecstasy of absolute power, because Tropico is built on a solid simulation foundation. We therefore find ourselves having to manage a paradisiacal tropical country with an iron fist, implementing a policy generally based on totalitarianism and the cult of the leader but also taking care of a large number of economic and social aspects that still maintain a certain contact with the more serious simulations and accurate, in some respects even going beyond these thanks to a much more unscrupulous management of the workforce and of the people in general. Life as a President From the point of view of content and structure, Tropico 6 on Nintendo Switch does not differ from the original edition, so we refer you to the review of the PC version for completeness of information. A feature that may leave you a bit dubious at first is the total absence of a real Campaign in this chapter, following some trends of the series which has alternated chapters more set on a sort of continuous narrative with others more broken up into various missions , like the latter. On the other hand, presenting all the different facets of the development of a tropical country in different time periods ranging from the colonial era to the near future would not have been easy within a single cohesive logical arc, therefore the Limbics decided to propose a large group of 15 missions capable of staging in more detail every aspect of the political management of Tropico. These are different scenarios that address various problems and particular aspects of the management of the State, going into the various facets of the country's economic and social development, of population control and foreign policy, even if obviously everything tends to be tackled with the dictatorial look that is typical of the series. Tropico 6 substantially resumes the fundamental elements of the previous chapters, drawing in particular from the third and fifth chapter, however expanding the area of influence on which to act to an entire archipelago, which determines a more varied territory to control and consequently more activities and different game situations. The freedom with which it is possible to address the problems of political management remains and perhaps is further expanded, going from choices in the economic sphere to the influence on the life of every single citizen, on which it is also possible to act directly through various actions. Between the cruelest and most unscrupulous absolutism and a certain liberal approach there are numerous shades of medium to choose from, leaving considerable freedom to the player and allowing you to try different experiences as leaders of various types, both by tackling the missions several times with different than in the large sandbox mode that contains all the game elements. Precisely this great freedom of choice and approach could annihilate the less expert player, but on this aspect the excellent design studied by the developers comes to the rescue to guarantee a soft introduction to the world of dictatorial simulation: the interface, as in the PC version, is extremely clear and clean, so much so that what we are doing is always clearly understandablegoing and what the various options available can lead to. On the other hand, the way missions and sandboxes are structured also makes it easy to enter the management mechanisms slowly and progressively: beyond the exhaustive tutorial, even in the heart of the game there is always some point of reference to keep into consideration, some advice to follow and some requests to be fully satisfied or disregarded. The Nintendo Switch version Even in the PC version, Tropico 6 already appeared to be a particularly suitable title to be transposed to consoles, thanks to the great work done on the interface by Limbic, who already seemed to want to take into consideration the use of the controller rather than the classic mouse and keyboard. This work of reduction, simplification and increase in clarity is perfectly useful for this Nintendo Switch version, with the game that is enjoyable using the Joy-Con and with some minimal implementation of the touch screen, which however remains strangely little exploited in this case as well. such a game. In any case, we note how the interface is designed to ensure that the controllers lose as little precision and comfort as possible compared to the mouse, beyond some situations that are always a bit problematic to manage with controllers, such as the construction of the streets. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, however, it should be noted that the work done is rather disappointing: the drastic reduction of the resolution at the highest zoom levels enhances all the graphics defects in this version, which is considerably different from that of the other platforms. It is practically the same problem that we have seen in other games of the genre such as Cities: Skylines and recently in Railway Empire, namely the difficulty for the Nintendo console to reproduce a large and detailed world, guaranteeing a constant view of the map at different zoom levels . Also in this case the passage between the different degrees of framing is quite fluid and fast, but the resolution appears decidedly low and the anti-aliasing practically absent, making the representation of the colorful tropical world very crude. Another dubious element of this specific version for Nintendo Switch is the fact that it doesn't appear to contain any additional content or DLC to the original. Arriving more than a year and a half after the latter, and offering the full price of 50 euros (approximately), it would be reasonable to expect some additions or a sort of all-encompassing ~Definitive Edition~, instead of proposing the same package that is by now dropped sharply in price elsewhere.", "date": "2020-11-11", "grade": "6.8"}
