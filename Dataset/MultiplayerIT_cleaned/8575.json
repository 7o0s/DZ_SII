Now that the title is finally available for download, let's see if all this enthusiasm was really motivated... Flocks of black birds Crow runs strong on the track of the atmosphere, effectively proposing an intriguing and original narrative context that puts the user in the role of a crow with magical powers, who must fly over a whole series of scenarios in an attempt to defeat an evil entity represented from a scarecrow. The feeling is that of a dark-colored fairy tale, effectively brought to the screen by spot-on graphic choices, especially as regards the use of colors and some visual filters of considerable impact. However, it must be said that, beyond the initial idea, the plot of the product is the most vague and confused imaginable, narrated by very little explanatory real-time sequences and by text boxes, if possible even more nebulae: one almost gets the impression that the developers started with the starting concept in mind and then - not knowing quite where to go with it - they threw all the elements of the story almost haphazardly, making it fundamentally incomprehensible and causing a collapse of the player's interest from the early stages of the adventure. This imbalance is partially mitigated by the undeniable beauty of the explorable scenarios, created through Sunside's proprietary engine: we go from desolate lands to imposing castles, passing through caves, mountain paths and so on, all managed without particular uncertainties or declines of frame rates. The glance of the never so appropriate bird's eye view is undeniable, and if the polygonal models appear a bit angular up close, the final result is still of undoubted value. The sound is also good which, above all thanks to decidedly successful music, accompanies the game action in a more than appropriate way. Which, unfortunately, proves to be Crow's real Achilles heel, who tries the path of mixing genres with little success. The gameplay is divided into two parts, with the first requiring the user to fly over a scenario in search of gems and points of interest through which to continue in the next phase: the slow gait of the winged protagonist and the need to continue literally groping make these phases very little exciting, supported only by the aforementioned visual pleasantness. Fortunately, things improve when facing an enemy, with the view passing behind the crow and the action approaching the canons of rail shooters: following a pre-established itinerary, you have to move to collect bonuses and avoid obstacles and attacks, accumulating enough energy to perform one of the two spells supplied, one offensive and the other defensive. The pace here is much better, but the low level of challenge and some basic ingenuity end up debasing even these sections, which offer some real stimulation only if you aim for the highest score. Not even the splash of RPG elements given to the title is fully convincing: by accumulating experience it is in fact possible to spend points to increase three characteristics of your character, but the differences are so subtle that you almost do not realize the upgrades.", "date": "2012-04-24", "grade": "6.0"}
