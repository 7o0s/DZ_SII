{"name": "Iron Man", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iron-man_a.html", "text": "Appearing for the first time in 1963 in the comic magazine ~Tales of Suspense~, by Stan Lee and Don Heck, Iron Man is perhaps the Marvel character with the most reworked origins ever, probably because they must necessarily refer to a particular war conflict. Tony Stark is an American arms manufacturer who is wounded in the chest by mines in Vietnam and taken prisoner. To survive he develops, together with a fellow prisoner scientist, a system capable of keeping the splinters away from his heart, thanks to a series of magnetic fields. The bodice is completed by an entire bulletproof armor, which allows Stark to escape and rout his captor's small army: he thus finds himself depending on the device he has on his chest, but above all he thinks of using his own knowledge in the field of war to end conflicts rather than foment them. This is how Iron Man was born, formally Tony Stark's bodyguard, even if in reality it is the billionaire himself who wears the armor in case of need. Armor that has evolved in an incredible way over the years, passing from one model to another and acquiring a series of new technologies, as well as in the meantime the conflict in which Stark was injured is changed from Vietnam to the Golf War, for end up (in recent times, with the beautiful volume ~Iron Man: Extremis~, which in many ways inspired the film) in Afghanistan. In the game, we will already find ourselves with the latest model of Iron Man's armor, within a series of long stages in which we must destroy everything that moves, being careful to avoid enemy fire. The character flies and fires automatically, using the repulsor rays placed on the palms of the hands, which is often enough to disintegrate any opponent. However, power-ups appear from the ashes of the destroyed devices that can make us recover energy, enhance the repulsors (with only one degree of improvement: you shoot with both hands) or recharge the uniray. The latter is a bit like the ~smart bomb~ of the situation, a very powerful chest beam which wears out very quickly but which manages to pierce any armor. As mentioned above, the stages are quite long, definitely above average for mobile shoot'em-ups, but they don't hold particular surprises: the enemies follow one another continuously, with the gradual introduction of new types, but they don't have no intelligence. In practice, that is, they follow a really simple movement and attack pattern, which transforms them into cannon fodder in the face of our power, provided that you have a minimum of skill in dodging blows. Unfortunately this juncture highlights one of the lowest points of the game (already in itself far from a masterpiece), or the control system. On paper it is very simple and immediate, but in practice it makes the gaming experience truly terrible and cumbersome: first of all, it is not possible to mix two coincident directions, i.e. one does not move diagonally, and above all the inputs are received late, often with momentary blocks that can be the difference between being hit or not. To this we must add the uncertainties of the graphics engine: despite an ~old gen~ technical aspect with regard to mobile gaming, Iron Man's scrolling makes a beastly effort, shooting much more than it should. In short, the impression is that the developers have more than ever packaged a very careless and uninspired product, just to ride the wave of popularity that is inevitably about to invest the character. PRO It's the game of <strong>Iron Man</strong>, isn't it? Good number of enemies Nice dialogues between one internship and another... AGAINST ...but written in small letters Very questionable upgrade management", "date": "2008-05-08", "grade": "S.V."}
