Thus asking himself a question: what if there was a machine capable not only of allowing people to see spirits, but also possibly of stealing energy from them with each shot? This concept found a sort of consecration on Wii U in 2014, further developing the mechanics seen on Wii and 3DS a couple of years earlier and using the console's GamePad to simulate the use of a camera. On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the series, this last episode was chosen for a celebratory remaster, and here is the review of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water. History Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, the protagonist Yuri Kozukata The story of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is inspired by real facts, drawing inspiration from the dramatic events involving the so-called ~forest of suicides~ of Aokigahara and, in general, the theme of people who have always decided to take their own lives very topical in Japan. In this case, the events of the game revolve around the mysterious Mount Hikami: a disturbing place, which after sunset is haunted by spirits. The protagonist of the adventure is Yuri Kozukata, a girl who in the past was just about to take her own life but was saved by Hisoka, the owner of an antique shop who owns the legendary Camera Obscura: an ancient camera that can perceive ghosts, photograph them and possibly damage them so that they finally ~pass over~. However, Yuri is not the only character that we will find ourselves controlling in Maiden of Black Water: during the campaign, divided into fifteen chapters called ~drops~, we will also be able to take on the role of Ren Hojo, a writer who studies legends popular stories related to the concept of death, and Miu Hinasaki, a little girl that we will be able to save during our expeditions on Mount Hikami. The mountain is cursed, there's no doubt about it: people who visit it at night without returning are influenced by rancorous ghosts, who take possession of their bodies, driving them to suicide. Yuri can perceive these presences thanks to an innate ability which, in combination with the Camera Obscura, will serve her to shed light on the disappearance of a series of girls and on the mysterious woman who seems to have control of the black waters that flow in the depths of the mountain. Gameplay Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, Yuri explores Mount Hikami at night The gameplay of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is that of a classic survival horror, in many ways already dated at the time of the original publication. The control of the character is relative to the screen and the view can be adjusted freely, but there is really a lot of woodiness in the movements and therefore it happens to feel trapped and powerless when you suddenly find yourself in front of a ghost, fitting into the scenario in the simple attempt to retreat. The mechanics that regulate the combat system, therefore the use of the Camera Obscura, is managed on PS5 through a combination of standard controls and gyroscope, the latter called into question to tilt the lens and capture in the frame two spirits together or their flying manifestations and then snapping: an operation that gradually accumulates the energy necessary to launch the Fatal Frame, i.e. a powerful attack that often closes the battle. Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, the use of the Camera Obscura during fights In short, the camera is our only weapon in the game, and as such we will be able to enhance it between one mission and another, using the points earned to buy more or less powerful and more or less fast reloading films, but also mount different lenses and take advantage special maneuvers often linked to individual characters, which allow you to slow down enemies, take various photos in sequence or inflict additional damage on them. Clearly the experience does not end in the simple exploration of a scenario and in dealing with the ghosts linked to that place. For example, there are puzzles that must be solved by finding specific objects and using the powers of the Camera Obscura to unlock others, but the settings are actually few and backtracking, however narratively justified, soon becomes a cumbersome presence. Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, Miu and the Camera Obscura Maiden of Black Water's system can count on some interesting ideas, albeit half-heartedly implemented. For example, let's imagine that theversion Nintendo Switch in portable mode can take full advantage of the mechanics of real use of the Camera Obscura, but we expressed some perplexity in this sense even at the time of the review of the original for Wii U: the use of the gyroscope is not fast and precise enough and so in the most difficult fights it is a must to fall back on the analog sticks. The game undoubtedly boasts remarkable atmospheres and a sense of constant tension which, however, is not exploited properly to instill terror in the player, unless he is easily frightened . The jumpscare is practically completely missing, if not in a very delicate declination, and the degree of challenge in general is confirmed as permissive, providing us with a large quantity of healing potions and objects capable of counteracting the effects of the cursed water of Mount Hikami. Graphics and sound Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, Yuri is about to be attacked by a spirit If in terms of gameplay and structure Maiden of Black Water has obviously not changed compared to 2015, we were curious to understand how much effort had been put into the technical adaptation of the game to today's standards. Well, unfortunately there's nothing to be excited about and you can tell it right from the introductory sequence, already too dark and dirty at the time of Wii U and even more so inadequate today. The polygonal models of the characters seem in fact the only element towards which some attention has been paid, with a resampling of the textures and some modifications of the shaders which, in combination with the transition to a substantially higher resolution, have preserved the beauty of Yuri even on next-gen platforms such as PlayStation 5, which however can enjoy a frame rate raised to 60 fps. Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, Yuri's model looks very nice in the remaster Too bad that the geometries have remained unchanged, as well as the animations: the funny run of the girl still makes you smile. The big problem, however, are the scenarios, which in a horror game of this type play a fundamental role and which we see here constantly covered with low-definition textures, which give their worst in the closest shots and confirm that in this sense it has not been done practically nothing. The sound sector is a mix of disturbing sounds and verses, capable of contributing in an important way to the general tone of the adventure, and this edition allows you to listen to the dialogues in English or Japanese, but without subtitles in Italian. Finally, the extras are represented only by a traditional photo mode and a certain amount of unlockable costumes for the characters.", "date": "2021-10-27", "grade": "6.8"}
