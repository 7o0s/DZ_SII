{"name": "Enclave", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enclave_b.html", "text": "The difficult choice between good and evil Enclave, which is the most awaited XBox game of this summer, was born from a compelling story with a fantasy edge, probably inspired by other famous stories of the same genre such as Tolkien's ~Lord of the Rings~. Here too we find the struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness, between good magic and the much more dangerous fruit of evil and bad intentions. A lot of time has passed since May 2001, when Enclave amazed the gaming community by making a fine show at E3 2001 and winning numerous awards from the international press. The time that has passed has allowed us to witness the birth of XBox and to participate in the emergence of a console that was received coldly but has finally established itself with titles of the caliber of Halo, Dead or Alive 3 and RalliSport Challenge. Once the precious Enclave disc has been inserted into the XBox, one feels the sensation of being faced with a game capable of being placed side by side with the aforementioned titles with equal merit. The splendid animated menus herald the beginning of an unforgettable adventure that opens in a prison of the Outlanders in which we have been locked up. Note that after finishing the game for the first time (Light Campaign), we will be given the opportunity to restart the game in the ranks of the Outlanders (Dark Campaign). Shooter, RPG, action... It's quite difficult to categorize Enclave into a specific genre. Starbreeze Studios, the young team responsible for developing the game, have classified Enclave as a ~Fantasy third-person shooter~, but I think the definition is ill-suited to a title that has typical shooter elements but which develops more as ~ action RPG~. The setting, typically fantasy, historically places us in a hypothetical medieval period between castles, impregnable fortresses and cities enclosed by walls which are counterbalanced by the apocalyptic and infernal scenarios of the land of darkness. In full respect of the tradition of role-playing games, Enclave offers us the possibility of controlling no less than twelve characters (six for Light, six for Darkness), characterized by a different class, physical structure and peculiar abilities. Playing for the first time, we will initially control a brave knight, who will later be joined by the wizard, the druid (guardian of nature), the huntress, the female warrior (Halfling) and finally the engineer, an expert in traps and sabotage. The characters of darkness instead include the Berseker (fierce warrior), the assassin, the witch, the Lich (magical creature from the afterlife), the bomber and the goblin (evil goblin). The choice of one character rather than another proves to be decisive for the fate of the adventure since each of them has a different physical strength and, above all, a different fighting style. It is in fact possible to divide the characters into warriors, wizards and archers. While warriors use brute force as their only means of offense, wizards rarely resort to the use of weapons, preferring instead to use powerful magic and incantations. Archers, on the other hand, are endowed with limited physical means but with great skill in the use of bows, crossbows and anything else that can be thrown from a long distance. An arsenal for all occasions Enclave of the RPG genre ~steals~ its essence, putting it at the service of a game that makes action its strong point. During the adventure it will be possible not only to ~unlock~ new characters, but also to buy new skills and increasingly powerful weapons for them. The number of missions to be tackled is about twenty for each campaign plus additional ones that we will get by finding secret maps and objects. For each of the missions, not only the choice of the character to control but also, above all, of his equipment proves to be fundamental. Not being able to initially have large sums of money, we will have to carefully choose the objects and weapons that could prove useful in a given level. For each class of belonging (warrior, magician and archer), we will have the possibility to equip our character with a primary weapon, a secondary one, the bow and the crossbow. The variety of weapons is truly remarkable and varies from the small sword to the spiked mace, from the ax to the knight's broadsword. As far as magicians are concerned, the selection of spells is certainly less abundant but equally satisfying for the results produced. Among the spells we will find tongues of fire, ice birds capable of striking at great distances or energy barriers that strike to death any creature in the vicinityalready Just out of curiosity, with a particular magic we will be able to give birth to a mighty warrior from the earth who will stand between us and the enemies, in an attempt to clear our path. Our range of accessories can be completed by shields, armor, energy ampoules and ammunition. The latter are mostly made up of different types of darts and arrows to be used with bows and crossbows. Poisoned, fiery, magical arrows... there seems to be nothing missing from the Enclave's arsenal. Rescue, this stranger... Although Enclave is primarily an action game in the third person, it is possible to activate the first person view by pressing the black button. It must be said, however, that the first person view proves to be somewhat uncomfortable during the game and its use is advisable only if you want to use the crossbow. The control system is easy to acquire and suitable for every situation. With the left analog stick the movement of the character takes place, while the left is entrusted with the now inevitable function of adjusting the angle of the view. With the two triggers, however, it is possible to use weapons and perform other actions such as triggering mechanisms. Repeated pressing of the triggers instead leads to the execution of combos with the ~white weapons~ while pressing the triggers for a few seconds will call up some of the most powerful spells. With the A key instead the selection of weapons takes place and with the Y you can resort to miraculous ampoules of energy which prove to be very useful in the most critical situations. Finally, by pressing the right and left levers it is possible to proceed on all fours and jump respectively. Moving on to playability, I think it is appropriate to clarify immediately that Enclave is certainly an excellent game but not the masterpiece that many were waiting for. The gameplay is linear and runs the risk of becoming repetitive over time. This is made more concrete by the feeling that with the alternation of the missions, our task is always the same as well as the enemies to face are always the same. This is a defect common to many action games, fortunately in this case mitigated by other qualities that make the gaming experience rewarding anyway. Enclave is spectacular to look at and play and its violent nature is revealed in tight fights against 1, 2 or even 10 enemies, which lead to the incessant crossing of blades and fire. Enclave gives us countless emotions thanks also to the development of a captivating plot that will make us proceed on our way even if only for the desire to know the subsequent events. It should be emphasized that it will not be easy to reach the end of the twenty missions, due to a difficult level of difficulty although not prohibitive but above all due to a defect which, in my opinion, proves to be very annoying. The save function is in fact non-existent in the game phases and in order to save our progress on disk, we will have to wait to reach the conclusion of each mission. The consequences of this choice made by the programmers are felt right away since the missions are particularly long and demanding. It will often happen that you reach close to the end of the level, perish miserably a few steps from the finish line after at least a quarter of an hour of play and have to start the mission all over again. If this is repeated 2, 3, 4 times, the resulting frustration is largely justified. What do my eyes see! The technical realization of Enclave is probably the most spectacular aspect of the game, surprising enough to make it a small audio-visual masterpiece. High-resolution textures cover buildings, walls, floors and a myriad of objects that come to life, almost merging with the reality that surrounds us. On more than one occasion the realism and majesty of some views will hypnotize your eyes making you momentarily lose your sense of direction. Likewise, the polygonal models of the characters, the light effects, the dynamic shadows and even some poetic details such as the sky (impressive!) and the liquid surfaces are of high quality. However, such visual splendor is made less blinding by the increasingly hated nightmare of gamers called frame-rate. Although Enclave promises to ridicule Quake 3 Arena for PC in terms of performance, it must be said that everything on the screen weighs down the graphics engine to such an extent that the framerate remains rather low and far from constant. However, it is a venial sin and affects the eye more than the playability. The sound sector, let me tell you, yes merita instead a 10 and praise! The splendid musical accompaniment, created by a well-known composer, is accompanied by very effective sound effects that almost never break the great sensation of harmony felt by our ears. A ~fantastic~ summer Enclave is undoubtedly an excellent title and an almost obligatory choice for all Xbox owners. Nonetheless, disappointment is alive with what the game could have been with some minimal adjustments that would have elevated it to the status of a masterpiece. The extraordinary technical realization, an engaging plot and the spectacularity of the missions are certainly the most positive notes of a game in which some damned annoying even if not fundamental elements are out of tune. However, if you want to experience a fantasy adventure worthy of Tolkien's novels firsthand, then Enclave is probably the best summer purchase for your console. Pros: Fascinating fantasy atmosphere Graphics and sound at the highest levels Fun and spectacular Long-lived Cons: Graphics engine not always up to par In the long run a bit repetitive The lack of saves is unjustifiable Materials: Special Preview Screenshots Tricks A tale of demons, wizards and knights... The fate of humanity seemed sealed. The terrifying armies of the demon Vatar were about to annihilate the army of Celenheim when a mysterious figure appeared from the darkness who challenged the demon with his magical powers. He raised his stick to the sky and planted it violently on the ground, releasing all the force of nature. The sky darkened, the lands were engulfed in fire, and a deep rift began to divide the world into two parts, separating the light from the dark. Vatar was thus defeated and the world separated into the lands of the Enclave (Celenheim) and the Outlanders, the former inhabited by the peoples of light, the latter by evil creatures of darkness, formerly in the service of Vatar. Over the years, the Enclave's inhabitants developed a thriving and peaceful civilization and organized to protect the demarcated borders from the rift. On the other hand, the Outlanders grew up in darkness and chaos, preparing for the day when they would once again invade the lands of the Light. That day is near and the rift, now reduced to a large furrow, no longer seems able to stop the advance of the Outlanders, also determined to awaken the evil Vatar from the depths of the earth. Who will save Celenheim this time? Who will stand as a bulwark of the Light, of good and of civilization?", "date": "2002-07-26", "grade": null}
