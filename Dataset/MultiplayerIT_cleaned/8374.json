{"name": "Il piccolo Diablo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106923-orc-vengeance-il-piccolo-diablo.html", "text": "The scenes of collective hysteria that characterized the launch of Diablo III are still fresh in the memory of the most die-hard fans, forced to fight against the error messages that the poor and overloaded Blizzard servers kept returning. However the worst is over and Diablo III, with all its pros and cons has now been consigned to history. Trying to imagine the complexity of such a gameplay to adapt it to an ultra-mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet could really represent an incredible risk, that is, to end up with a copied and resized clone or, alternatively, with an overly complex and cumbersome for the still limited full touch interface. Chillingo, a software house that has been in the orbit of EA for some time, abandoned the playful colors and tones of ~Cut the Rope~ and thus decided to throw itself into the ~fray~ in a more adult way, presenting a game that draws from the famous ~diabolical~ trilogy with full hands: Orc: Vengeance. A title that therefore comes by heavily remodeling the reference target, winking at the ~hardcore~ players who traditionally don't get along very well with tablets and smartphones but, above all, trying to reach a point of balance in the gameplay such as to give it a own specificity. Vengeful orcs Orc: Vengeance is an adventure with a fully three-dimensional isometric view, in which the protagonist will have to face battles and puzzles until he reaches the final salvation. The similarities with the Blizzard masterpiece end exactly here but, as we will see, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The plot of the game develops through 5 chapters which see the adventures of a mighty ogre unfold; the kingdom of Argon is in fact in danger due to the resurrection of the terrible Dark Lord. According to tradition, this monstrous villain finds nothing better than the poor orcs to enlist in his legions and, for this reason, he enslaves them all as well as locking up those who do not show themselves faithful in dungeons. A daring escape from the prisons thus starts the game, while numerous manuscripts scattered throughout the levels will help the player understand the origin of the curse in progress in more detail. There is indeed something strange throughout the kingdom, given that the dead come out of the ground in the form of zombies or skeletons, but there are also huge spiders, bats and very unattractive worms in general; obviously each of these ~amenities~ must be faced and destroyed without any mercy. The control system, perfectly adapted, takes a few moments to master but in the end it is quite intuitive, especially for Diablo players: in fact, our ogre automatically moves to the position indicated by a single ~tap~ on the screen. Keeping the finger pressed will instead switch to ~running to the bitter end~ and the single pressures will only serve to change its direction. Engaging in a fight is just as simple, in fact it will be enough to always indicate with a single touch the opponent to be hit; more interesting instead the management of objects and spells, which must be activated through specific ~gestures~. Going into more detail, the ~Skills~ menu provides for a maximum of four slots that can be used in real time, of which only two are immediately available. Each slot can be associated with either the activation of a potion (choice of health, armor and mana) or the execution of a magical attack. Each of them can be activated by performing a specific movement, for example the first slot is activated with a double tap, the second with a slide, the third with a semicircle and so on; the player is given maximum freedom to use these properties depending on the type of combat envisaged. In the case of a boss battle, which takes place at each end of the chapter, it will obviously be more practical to arrange the health and armor potion as well as at least one effective magical shot at hand. Orc: Vengeance also provides a valid experience system, absolutely not comparable to that of Diablo but still well done considering the game medium; the items interested in leveling up are attack, defense, greed and revenge, the latter typically ~orc-like~ and the result of the particular context. All weapons, defensive and offensive, can then be upgraded through the game coins that are scattered around and as a reward after almost every kill; the arsenal is very vast, ranging from classic swords to single and double-handled axes and spears, as well as shields. There is a shortage of ranged weapons, but Orcs are known to prefer melee attacks. Efficacy tooof spells and potions is subject to paid upgrade. A small drawback, however, concerns the management of armor: accustomed to Blizzard's maniacal detail, it seemed instinctive to look for an item for the management not so much of the individual pieces (it was actually too much) but at least of the entire armor, which unfortunately is not possible. It remains to point out the excellent work done from a technical point of view: played on iPad 2 and even better on the new iPad, the title Chillingo really leaves you stunned by the quality of the three-dimensional structures, textures and animations. Certainly not everything is perfect and there are some smudges in some shots but the general glance is still remarkable. Too bad for the perhaps excessive repetitiveness of the environments (they are not recreated randomly each time unfortunately) and for a general lack of originality in the level design but, ultimately, also thanks to a sound suitable for the atmosphere, the promises of excellence can be said to be kept .", "date": "2012-08-13", "grade": "8.8"}
