{"name": "Stranglehold - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stranglehold-recensione.html", "text": "My name is Payne, Tequila Payne Midway's game is not a simple Max Payne clone, there is indeed everything that Rockstar's game showed us a few years ago, bullet time, double weapon, endless shootings and a good narrative component, adding however some features that make Stranglehold definitely easier, arcade, but equally more fun and accessible from the start. Like Max, Tequila can go into bullet time whenever, while framing an enemy, he jumps, rolls and somersaults worthy of the best Woo circus. We can interact, by activating the slowdown of time, with many parts of the environment. Handrails, trolleys and tables make us enter bullet time, giving us the obvious ability to aim more precisely. It's hilarious to see Tequila prowling the level on top of a restaurant cart while calmly taking out everyone brandishing two pistols! We will also be able to hit the henchmen of the gangs by shooting at objects such as signs, neon lights, crumbling roofs and the never too expensive explosive barrels. Killing enemies in the least conventional way possible gives us the possibility to gradually unlock some special abilities called Tequila Bomb as we progress in the game. However, the search for the effect shot is partially thwarted, in some situations, by some small bugs in which, for example, instead of surfing on a handrail, Tequila launches himself like a fish on it, with rather comical results, which sometimes come close to frustration. My name is Payne, Tequila Payne The Tequila Bombs, represented by a green circular icon at the bottom left, allow you to heal us, to fire a single shot, excellent for the most distant enemies (complete with a close-up of the projectile in flight), enter a sort of berserk mode which it gives us invincibility and immoderate volume of fire and finally hit all enemies present starting to spin like a top. The last feature of Stranglehold is the face off mode (just to stay in the cinematographic field) in which Tequila, surrounded by various enemies, must kill them all, as in the most classic of circular shootings. Here comes the bullet time, the direction tightens moving to a close position behind the shoulders. Novello Remo Williams, Tequila must dodge the bullets and at the same time take out the enemies, also with the help of elements of the environment providentially arranged above the heads of the killers. Definitely adrenaline pumping and well done. The sky in a room Tequila and his guns are the absolute stars of the game. But more than Tequila and his athletic verve, what stands out in the Midway title is the level of interaction and therefore the destructibility of the environment. The rooms are full of objects, furnishings and various amenities. Everything is a target, everything can be hit and destroyed. The gameplay is affected by this choice. Cover isn't forever, waiting for a henchman to reload crouched behind a wooden crate isn't a good idea, especially when the buddy charges us head-on with a shotgun. Two shots well placed and you find yourself in the open in full crossfire. As already written above, hitting some objects facilitates our gang cleaning work. In the first level it's all a bang of signs, neon and air conditioners. The sky in a room It goes without saying that jumping, reloading, looking for accurate headshots and shooting the neon hanging on the third floor becomes a rather complicated undertaking in the midst of swarms of bullets, but necessary especially in light of the Tequila Bomb prize. In some moments the developers have developed some parts of the level as a sort of small puzzle in which you pass to the next block only by hitting some points (many times marked, and when they are not marked it becomes quite difficult to find them) precise polygonal constructions. Nothing transcendental, but it is interesting to note how a room, rather than some villages by the sea, completely change their appearance just after the Tequila cyclone. Nothing remains standing, everything blows up, furniture, tables, windows, furnishings and sometimes even the roofs. More than Tequila bombs, Tequila is the real bomb! Graph ups and downs So much interaction with the environment has an obvious impact on the overall quality of Stranglehold's graphics. If the level design is excellent, the environments are full of objects and incredibly detailed (see the casino level) the same cannot be said for the polygonal models of the characters. Tequila is on average well done, while all the others report a decidedly lower polygonal work. The same thing can be said for the animations which sometimes give the impression of being rather jerky and woody. It is a pity to note how the maniacal work done for the ambienhighlights the difference in the realization of some of the polygonal models. Some cut scenes are emblematic of this problem, with clearly visible edges and gross anatomy. Graph ups and downs This is not to say that Tequila and the men of the gangs are insufficiently made, but the effect they make is what one feels when entering a luxury car built with some subcompact materials. Another criticality of the title is the camera, which creates many problems in the middle of the action, often forcing us to make quick adjustments that are detrimental to our rate of fire. If the video leaves something to be desired, the audio is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack is typical of films, indeed of games of this type and the sound effects are prominent with well recognizable weapons of each other. The same thing can be said for the dubbing, well done with decidedly in part actors. Bomb or no bomb? Stranglehold is pretty easy and arcadey. Contrary to the game of covering which should impose prudent conduct, there is absolutely nothing prudent. Seamless jump and shoot, shoot and jump. All terribly repetitive, but all terribly fun! You go into battle with your head down with the only goal of shooting everything that moves without paying too much attention to the incoming lead and any tactical merits of any kind. The weapons available and the Tequila Bombs confirm this feeling. Although they are well thought out in the immediate future, appreciating the difference between a shotgun and a 9 caliber submachine gun, in the end you will choose the shotgun even if the enemy is on a roof 50 meters ahead. So much for the dispersion of the pattern! Bomb or no bomb? The four special abilities, which seem to be the panacea for all ills the first few times you use them, will eventually be used only sporadically and not all then. What good is a single headshot when we have some kind of temporary invincibility and a spinning smart bomb? So this is another flaw of Stranglehold, the bad balance of the special abilities and the arsenal at our disposal. This does not mean that the gaming experience is heavily affected, the fact remains that by playing one gets the feeling that if the gameplay had been more refined and balanced, the Midway title would have definitely made a significant leap in quality. The A.I. of the enemies instead seems to have been well done. They move, cover and seek cover, not infrequently carrying out small concerted maneuvers. Comment Stranglehold, despite some partial but heavy graphical flaws and a gameplay that betrays its ambitions, is a very entertaining title. It perfectly captures the spirit of John Woo, enhancing it in a 100% action context which, starting from the footsteps of Max Payne, ends in an orgy of blood and bullets more similar to classics such as Smash TV than to the Rockstar title. Is this a defect? He would like to innovate a genre, but the application of some good ideas is ultimately superficial. Short game experience, about 6-8 hours, intense, very fun and adrenaline-pumping, but ultimately too arcadey and repetitive. Pros: Perfectly recreates the spirit of John Woo movies Complete destructibility of the environment Fast-paced and hilarious Cons: Fluctuating graphics quality Bad balancing of weapons and special features Repetitive and short-lived Stranglehold is available for PC and Xbox 360 and will be available for PS3. The version tested is the one for Xbox 360. Goals 360 The thousand points guaranteed by the 45 objectives of Stranglehold are not a very difficult obstacle to overcome. Most of them are obviously related to passing the stages and the difficulty level chosen to finish the game. Others, perhaps the most fun to obtain, are unlocked thanks to particular actions or the use (or even the non-use) of special skills. Given the destructive nature of the Midway game, the most interesting is certainly that of the maximum damage account caused by Tequila obtainable for the hyperbolic figure of 75 million dollars! More generally, therefore, the objectives are easy to achieve, perhaps just a couple raise a lot the level of difficulty to acquire them. Several years have passed since the shooting at the hospital, but Inspector Tequila is still out and about on the streets of Hong Kong with his two friends, Smith & Wesson. Then when one of his team is killed, all he has left is to throw away those few rules of engagement that he occasionally remembers to respect and start shooting at everything that moves. As per practice there are the classic double, triple and quadruple games between rival gangs, melancholy moments and obviouslynte flocks of white doves hovering in flight between a 9 gauge and a highly armored 5.56. This in brief is the storyline of the new Midway title which, thanks to the collaboration of His Majesty John Woo and Chow Yun Fat (Inspector Tequila), closes the events that began in 1992 with one of the films that changed the way of filming forever action movies, Hard Boiled.", "date": "2007-09-28", "grade": null}
