After years of working in the semi-darkness, however, it was the lucky pairing between ninja and fruit that made Halfbrick known to the general public; for those who don't know what we're talking about, just know that Fruit Ninja is basically a game in which you have to slice bananas, oranges, apples and so on by swiping your fingers on the touch screen. Very simple, immediate if not instantaneous, ideal for filling a handful of minutes, practically the prototype of gaming on the iPhone; and it is precisely the perfect harmony between the product and the platform that is probably the main reason for the success of the game. The idea of bringing Fruit Ninja to Xbox 360, more precisely by adopting Kinect, is therefore at least a reason for curiosity, if not even some perplexity, regarding the successful adaptation of a concept so linked to the original environment. Fruit juice The only real difference between Fruit Ninja Kinect and its equivalent for touch screen devices is in the method of control; for the rest, in terms of content and gameplay, everything is practically identical. The mechanics therefore remain linked to having to slice the fruit that is launched from the bottom of the screen, being careful not to hit the bombs and making the most of the various bonuses. That's all. The fundamental stimulus to continue is provided by the scoring system, which pushes you to try to beat your own records and those of your friends; to succeed in the goal you need precision, luck and skill in performing combos, i.e. slicing multiple fruits with a single blow. Of course there are also new backdrops and effects to unlock, but these are quite negligible side aspects. The methods available instead offer some subtle but incisive variations on the theme; the Classic requires you to avoid the bombs, under penalty of instant game over. On the contrary, Zen frees you from this worry, allowing you to focus only on the score. Finally the Arcade, in which the bombs do not determine the conclusion of the game but simply subtract points from the total. There is also a series of challenges, in which a precise objective is trivially imposed to be achieved within a certain time limit. Finally, the multiplayer mode is welcome, through which the company can be divided with a partner both in a cooperative and competitive solution; and integration with Xbox Live allows you to be notified immediately if a friend has exceeded their record, so you can immediately make an effort to regain your position. Xbox 360 goals Most of Fruit Ninja Kinect's 200 points is tied to quite affordable objectives that require you to perform certain actions or reach score thresholds in the various game modes. Nothing impossible with a little perseverance. Kinect blade Having said therefore of the contents, which in fact do not deviate almost in anything from the touch screen version, it is appropriate to discuss what distinguishes Fruit Ninja Kinect, ie the use of the Microsoft device. First of all a praise for the management of the positioning of the player in front of the camera; the software detects if the user is too close or too far away from it, and automatically resizes its silhouette on the screen, thus not requiring to physically move forward or backward. An ideal solution that deserves to be included by default in all Kinect titles. The management of the menus was much less successful, the navigation of which could undoubtedly have been studied in a better way. Returning to the game, it must be said that the exploitation of the peripheral is satisfying and pleasant; slicing the fruit with your arms (or even your legs) rather than your fingers actually adds something to the gratification of the gesture itself, and the precision of the detection is more than acceptable. If from this point of view Kinect brings a real benefit, on the other hand it is evident how the continuous and constant sudden movement of the arms makes the experience rather tiring even after a short period; even if this were not the case, it is the very nature of Fruit Ninja Kinect that makes the game sessions particularly short, because the repetitiveness of the action and the lack of real progression are more than truly evident in a handful of minutes. And in that sense it weighs a lotI talk about the price: 800 points are roughly 10 times the amount for which Fruit Ninja is sold on the iPhone (0.79 euros, 2.39 euros on the iPad), and the proportion is not really perceivable or justifiable either in terms of content nor for using Kinect.", "date": "2011-08-15", "grade": "6.5"}
