When mass bacteriological weapons hit the city, the protagonist of Skyhill was quietly holed up in the luxurious suite on the top floor of the hotel of the same name, far from the terrible events taking place on the streets and on the lower floors, with the citizens who quickly transformed into terrible bloodthirsty monsters. This at least for the first few weeks, because the ivory tower could not last long, soon forcing our anti-hero to leave his super-protected lair to go in search of supplies and remedy the shortage of food and goods before need. Despite the simplicity of the graphic style adopted by Mandragora and the terseness of the narrative elements, it is easy to get caught up in the particular atmosphere of this title, and it is indeed a pity that such a base was not then exploited much in the construction of the game. The way the madness of the biological apocalypse creeps into the fortress of the hotel, the slow and exhausting struggle of the protagonist for survival, with the need to constantly go out and return to the top floor of the building to hold out a little longer, in a war that soon turns out to be illogical and meaningless, if not for the simple postponement of one's end towards the impossible dream of salvation behind the exit of Skyhill, represents the very principle of survival and roguelike. Faithful to this vision, the game easily offers the side even to a certain intrinsic monotony and the scarcity of situations and enemies does not help in this sense to make the experience particularly solid and lasting, but the initial impact and the particular atmosphere that breathe between the floors of the skyscraper are easily imprinted in the mind for quite a while. Skyhill shows us a new kind of zombie apocalypse, all within a skyscraper Up and down Skyhill We therefore find ourselves having to explore the hundred floors of the Skyhill hotel trying to reach the exit on the ground floor, but the problem is that the journey cannot be linear. Each movement consumes the protagonist's energy, which can be recharged by finding food and various provisions or by resting in his suite on the top floor, therefore movements must be dosed considering how expensive it can be to visit the rooms on each floor and obviously the risk of meet the other tenants, who have mostly become bloodthirsty monsters. The path to salvation therefore becomes a careful movement back and forth through the floors of the skyscraper, often returning to the last one to recharge energy and carry out crafting and exploring the floors below in a very prudent way, trying to find the right balance between conquest of supplies and items for crafting and expending life energy. Like any self-respecting roguelike, even here if the protagonist dies he doesn't have a second life available, you are sent back to the beginning of the path with a new character and the possibility of unlocking perks that simplify restarting, according to the harsh law of type. Skyhill also offers some RPG-style features, in particular as regards the evolution of the character in its four basic stats, the unlocking of the aforementioned perks and the combat system which recalls the classic turn-based style with the possibility of choosing the objective to be hit with variable success rates, the latter aspect unfortunately not being studied much, at least compared to what we would have liked. By reactivating the energy in the floors visited and in some cases by unlocking the lift, it is possible to simplify the route and return in a more relaxed way to visit some areas, in a sort of progressive conquest of land towards the final destination, even if the scarcity of provisions and the continuous loss of energy, however, force you to remain alert at all times. The control system, which on PC was based on a classic point-and-click style interface, has been properly transposed to the touch screen of mobile devices, making Skyhill a particularly suitable title for this type of platform.", "date": "2016-09-16", "grade": "7.5"}
