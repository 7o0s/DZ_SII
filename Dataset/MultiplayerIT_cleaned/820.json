{"name": "Gothic 2: La Notte del Corvo - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gothic-2-la-notte-del-corvo-recensione.html", "text": "The island of Korinis finds itself rocked by strange and unpredictable earthquakes The only requirement to be able to play the title in question is obviously having previously installed Gothic 2, after the setup phase here is the first surprise, apparently not exactly positive, it is not possible to resume an old Gothic 2 save and start exploring the new areas directly from where we left off. Initially I confess that this choice left me quite perplexed, after playing the data disk I changed my mind, actually the increase in difficulty, the changes to the customization of the character, and some small tweaks to the plot would certainly have created many problems; and then let's face it all, if it hadn't been for this imposition, many of the gurus of laziness (among whom I modestly hold a leading role) would certainly have missed out on a really good game. The aspect that perhaps could have been better taken care of concerns the technical side of this matter, a popup or a message that warns the user when he tries to load old saves would have been more welcome than a simple block of the application... Once upon a time after this phase we start with the real game, I'll spare you the initial pappardella concerning the introduction of Gothic 2 and the connection with the first episode of the saga (in this regard, I refer you to the appropriate articles that we have baked with much love for years now ago), suffice it to say that once again the world needs your courage and skill to defeat yet another threat from the evil god Beliar. So far nothing new, how does the data disk fit into all this? Remember those old water wizard marpions from early Gothic? Exactly, just those funny guys led by the brave Saturas, the ones we had thrown that sensational bin at? Well, they are back, they remember us and believe me when I tell you they would be more than happy to welcome us by stamping a few balls of frost right on our noses... The island of Korinis finds itself rocked by strange and unpredictable earthquakes, the wizards of water, guardians of the balance between good and evil, are investigating these strange upheavals by analyzing some ancient ruins; our initial task will be to investigate not only the causes of these phenomena but also some strange cases of brigandage, arms trafficking and shady projects that aim to destabilize the already fragile balance of the area. The inclusion of the new quests has been treated in a meticulous way, like many of the aspects to which the Piranha Bytes have accustomed us. From the beginning (even from the first dialogue of the game) there are some tracks that introduce the data disk, it is possible to recognize them due to some almost imperceptible differences in the tone of voice of the voice actors (in this regard I would like to remind you that all the dialogues are accompanied from a speech that is nothing short of perfect). Despite this, in order to get your hands on the new game areas it is necessary to arm yourself with patience, as only with an adequately ~skilled~ character can you think of venturing into the canyons, beaches and swamps that make up this section. The new entries... Now let's see in detail the main aspects that this data disk introduces in Gothic 2. The manual speaks of a completely new world to explore, although this sentence may seem like the usual exaggeration, I can assure you that never as with The Night of the Crow, I was happened to get my hands on such a large data disk; and I'm not referring to some particularly tasty treats such as the Durlag tower of the legendary Baldur's Gate data disk, here we are talking about a truly remarkable amount of irons in the fire! Just to give you an idea, the new game area introduced occupies an area more or less equal to that of the Valley of Mines that Gothic 2 veterans know very well, and in which we can say almost half of the entire adventure takes place . Want some more numbers to make your mouth water? The data provided by the developers speak of 100 new NPCs (non-player characters) to interact with, 100 new types of monsters, more than 30 new magic items, 15 new weapons, 12 new spells and 5 new armor. Naturally, in order to be able to face and collect all this, it will be necessary to replay everything several times, given that as it should be, some objects, spells, armor and quests are reserved for very specific classes. But that's not all, we will have to deal with new guilds, pirates (go on with the grog!), water wizards, the water ring and a great return of many early Gothic characters in an unprecedented band of brigands . While the pirates and brigands spend their timewhile drinking grog, robbing and grabbing what they can from the poor inhabitants of the island, the ring of water watches over and intervenes to restore the balance between the forces of good and evil that rage in it. Basically they represent for the water mages what the paladins represent for the fire mages, the military arm, with a non-negligible difference, the water ring is a sort of secret society, whose members act in the shadows without revealing anything about himself. The only one of the new guilds in which it will be impossible to join is that of the water mages. Sin could have been a valid alternative to the group of fire mages, the only other source of magical knowledge of a certain value present in the game. The new entries... The new spells with which the more mystical players will be able to tinker are partly connected to the water element and partly connected to black magic (obviously in case our hero decides to rely on the evil god of evil Beliar); among the first we will have geysers, spears of ice, storms, fists of water and whirlwinds, among the second spells such as the wrath of Beliar, the cry of the dead, the spell subtract energy and various evocations (of insects , roots, stone guardians and zombies). The new monsters in the game, together with some of the new locations, certainly represent one of the most striking aspects of the graphic restyling made with this data disk; as we said, the official data speak of more than 100 new monsters, but actually playing the data disk it becomes clear that in this count also all those monsters already present in the original game whose characteristics have been retouched to adapt them to the new level of difficulty . Among the new entries there are new types of golems, swamp gas parasites (it is recommended to kill them from a distance, once they are dead they release an unpleasant toxic cloud), wild boars, swamp rats and other versions of monsters already seen in the past. We close the circle regarding the new entries by talking about the two new skills that will be available, it is the possibility of learning the so-called language of the Creators and the training of the amulet of the will-o-the-wisp seeker. While exploring the play area, it will happen to come across some old stone tablets, each of these is engraved with a particular formula, knowing the language of the Creators it will be possible to decipher its content and benefit from its effects; this language is structured on three different levels of difficulty, the greater our knowledge and the greater the ability of our character to translate complex tablets, capable of increasing a characteristic even by 20 points. The second ability introduced allows our character to use a nice spirit present in an amulet of enormous value. This spirit, once convinced to collaborate, will help you find objects of various types and of increasing value the greater our training in its use. I forgot, in addition to rings and amulets, it is now possible to wear magic belts, not that this will revolutionize the game... Let's go! So far we have talked about quite boring things: objects, monsters, spells, but how is this data disk to play? I confess that for me, historically very attached to this saga, it is not easy to answer. As I was pointing out to a dear friend (as well as a great cRPG player and member of the historical group that years ago populated the discussions of the it.comp.giochi.rpg newsgroup) a few days ago, it is very easy to indulge in ~i games of the past were better~, remembering only the good things of the great titles of the past and ignoring their obvious flaws. Gothic and its sequel were real masterpieces for me, they were able to offer very balanced gameplay, without forcing too much either on the action or on the dialogues, on the freedom of action or on a linear plot. Indeed, however, there were problems, first of all a too low difficulty, a very high number of quests in the early stages of the game, after which we were almost completely reduced to tackling the main plot alone. The inclusion of the new plot within that of Gothic 2 has been treated in an exemplary way Let's go! Now fortunately all this has been brought back to a more balanced scheme, the mass of missions typical of the first hours of the game has remained (fortunately), but continuing with the adventure you scale more gradually towards the end of the game. The inclusion of the new plot within that of Gothic 2 has been treated in an exemplary way, and this is no small thing if we consider the impact that the many new quests and the related experience can have.without accumulated. Naturally many missions can be traced back to the classic schemes that we all know (does ~find the key~ or ~kill monster~ mean anything to you?), we are still talking about Gothic, so don't expect Planescape Torment quests or Arx Fatalis puzzles, this although there are finally some more varied missions. It will happen to solve puzzles, to answer questions based on the texts found in different locations (which forces at least to read the main texts concerning the civilization that populated the new section of the island), and even missions to face by creating a sort of party, a sort of Copernican revolution for the series. How hard is the adventure As more experienced players will certainly remember, Gothic 2 was not what you can call a tough nut to crack. The difficulty, although at the beginning it seemed very well calibrated, after a certain threshold it made the game seem like a real walk seasoned with some slaughter based on monsters, ogres and even dragons. In particular, the latter represented the least convincing aspect, potentially immortal and fearsome beings, reduced to large colorful lizards to be sliced with a few strokes... Now, fortunately, the matter seems to have really changed, with the introduction of this data disk all monsters and game opponents have been retouched to be more difficult. However, don't be fooled by appearances, in the face of the many proclamations issued concerning this aspect, I too expected to find who knows what hordes of bloodthirsty monsters in the new play area. Apparently the situation does not seem to have changed that much, but it is when you return to the old world, and in particular in the area of the old mining valley, that you realize how much things have changed. As if that weren't enough, this increase in difficulty is also added to by a greater demand in terms of training points to enhance one's skills, even going so far as to have to use as many as 5 training points to increase a particularly advanced characteristic by just one point. Even the potions seem to have been retouched aiming for an increase in difficulty. Technique From a technical point of view, the game has remained almost the same, as previously mentioned, there has been a slight graphic restyling regarding the new play areas and obviously the new monsters. We are certainly not facing any graphic revolution, but the difference between the new monsters and the old ones that populated Gothic 2, on which the weight of the years actually weighs, is quite easy to notice. Even the new areas are distinguished by a higher quality in the textures (the canions are very beautiful), but despite this there have been no major drops in the frame rate. A sore point comes from the Italian localization, somewhat poor in terms of quality. In order to make a comparison with the old Gothic 2 reviewed exactly 2 years ago, I finished the game with the same PC, equipped with Athlon XP2000+, 512 MB RAM and 128 MB Ati Radeon 9500PRO, the results were almost identical, excellent fluidity practically everywhere, with noticeable drops within the city of Korinis. The disk space required for the data disk is about 800 MB, which added to the 2 GB of ~smooth~ Gothic 2 and a couple of hundred MB for the saves bring the space required to about 3 GB. To recommend a minimum configuration, I repeat what was said during the Gothic 2 review, a CPU of at least 1.2 GHz, 512 MB of RAM and a GeForce 3 Ti 500 / Radeon 8500 or higher video card. Let's sum up To conclude, we can only recommend the purchase of ~La Notte del Corvo~; the reasons? Soon said, an exciting plot that integrates well with the original game, a remarkable amount of monsters, NPCs, quests and objects, a totally new game area that alone has a longevity far superior to many other cRPGs. Add to this an increase in difficulty that finally fills the only big gap in Gothic 2, an honest selling price, in a nice package, not too invasive and much more beautiful than the usual DVD box... The defects of course there are and are above all in the somewhat subdued Italian localization, and in a somewhat dated aspect that could make the new generation suspicious of fans of PC role-playing games. Let me give you some advice, don't be fooled by its appearance, Gothic 2 with Night of the Crow will guarantee you many hours of fun, buy them and you won't regret it. Pros: A data disk that alone represents a new game New leveling of the difficulty Homogeneity with the old plot Cons:", "date": "2005-10-06", "grade": null}
