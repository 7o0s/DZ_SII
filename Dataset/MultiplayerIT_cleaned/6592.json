When it was released on the Japanese market in April 2000, it was immediately clear that it would be a Zelda chapter that was profoundly different from the others. First of all for the release times, not even a year and a half away from that Ocarina of Time which revolutionized the series bringing it into the era of the polygon and simultaneously marking one of the highest moments in the entire history of video games. Seventeen months between episodes of the main series on home consoles are the blink of an eye, a record surpassed only on the NES with the 13 months that separated The Legend of Zelda from Zelda II. We had to wait 7 years between A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, just to clarify. The fact is that Majora's Mask came with an enormous load of expectations, impossible to bear even for the broad shoulders of the hero in the green tunic; fans, still with the taste of triumph in the bright lands of Hyrule over the evil Ganondorf in their mouths, found themselves faced with a bleak, disturbing world, with an antagonist like the Skull Kid less iconic and an unconventional game design choice that required a stringent time limit before the catastrophic impact of the moon. The result was, despite the very high marks from the critics, a sort of box office failure: half of the copies sold compared to Ocarina of Time and thousands of players who, taken by the discouragement of the change of course, abandoned the game after the first bars. At the same time, however, Majora's Mask has become a sort of cult classic for fans, fascinated by the swaggering courage of an Eiji Aonuma who was rapidly climbing the company's hierarchies and intoxicated by the macabre atmospheres of the world of Termina. Mask game In reality, Majora's Mask shares much more with Ocarina of Time than it initially seems: the graphics engine is the same, as is the structure of the gameplay and the organization of the basic mechanics. To understand this, switching to control Link between one episode and another is an operation that does not require any effort, because the management of the character, the weapons, the actions and movements available to him are almost identical. Once the piece that allows you to slow down the passage of time has been discovered, which happens very soon, even the sense of oppression and urgency deriving from the three days of time available fades into the background, leaving room for a progression in game in many ways similar to that of Ocarina of Time. Many, but not all. If on the one hand it is a very recognizable Zelda, on the other it is also at the same time a chapter driven by an innovative vein and a heady sense of experimentation. Where Majora's Mask differs from its predecessor is evidently not only in the general atmosphere, but also in the balance. On the first point, it is clear from the introduction how this adventure of Link is far from the others: although it is the direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, the glory of the times of Hyrule seems to have passed and forgotten, with the protagonist riding Epona busy to go through a dark and eerie forest in the land of Termina. However, one does not perceive the sense of triumph of a recognized hero, but the solitude of a warrior who has probably become useless in times of peace. However, the characteristics that make this episode unique certainly do not involve only the plot: it doesn't take much to understand how the madness of the Skull Kid has outlined a terrible and disheartening scenario, within which one can only count on 3 days before the Luna falls on the earth causing its destruction. A period destined to pass quickly, but which Link can bring back to the first day by playing a magical melody on his ocarina; and this is precisely the ingenious keystone of the experience, namely the management of the time available and its recurrence. But even in the weight and reinterpretation of the fundamental elements of the franchise Majora's Mask offers some surprises. For example, there are only four dungeons: complex, interesting and always characterized by perfectly studied mechanics, but in any case no longer the absolute protagonists of the game's development nor the absolute centralizers of the fundamental moments of the progression, to be ~filled~ with the rest of the overworld . Indeed, it is undoubtedly the Zelda with more weight on the side quests and on the development of the characters, which become an integral part of the plot woven by Nintendo EAD: to be clear, aiming straight only at the dungeons means barely scratching the rind of Majora's Mask, tasting a small portion leaving the bulk in the piatto. And that would be a real shame, because the NPCs aren't just there to make up the numbers: on the contrary, the evolution of their personalities and activities during the day contribute to creating a world as lively as ever, made up of people towards whom one is inclined to to feel affection, like or dislike, but still to have ~something~, and to want to collaborate with them simply to find out what their destiny is in the last 3 days of Termina. Which obviously represents a huge achievement for a video game. The inhabitants of Cronopolis are not simple digital puppets with a few lines of text to repeat, but little creatures with emotions, grievances, joys, goals and tasks to carry out. However, all this effort, in the Nintendo 64 version, was not always fully perceived and appreciated by users, evidently inclined not to consider such an element as fundamental in a title of the series. Precisely for this reason, among the improvements and additions present in this remake for Nintendo 3DS, one of the most incisive undoubtedly responds to the name of Bomber's Notebook: in summary, it is the revised and corrected version of the equivalent present in the original , through which it was possible to keep track of the side missions provided by the various characters encountered. Now, however, the visualization of the actions and of the fundamental moments of the individual quests is annotated in a more complete way, both with notes that can be retrieved to clear one's ideas, and with a more precise temporal indication that places the events and movements within the three days of play. You can also set alerts intended to be activated at certain times so as to allow you to perhaps remember to meet someone or perform an action. A support that becomes a stimulus, and certainly not a shortcut, to have clearer management of one's tasks: the Notebook never suggests the solution, it does not facilitate Link's efforts, but allows you to have everything clear at hand, giving greater motivation to carry out tasks and duties. A boost that goes hand in hand with the collection of masks, twenty-four in total: some of them are essential for progression and allow you to transform Link into another creature by obtaining unique abilities, but a large part of them instead are only worn by the hero to gain very detailed skills that obviously fit with the development of the secondary missions. All this contributes to creating one of the most challenging Zelda episodes ever: not necessarily due to the level of difficulty of the fights, but due to the need to activate the synapses to understand the progress of the quests, the necessary requirements and the puzzles to be solved. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D is an opportunity to rediscover a masterpiece in dazzling form The 3D effect As mentioned in the body of the review, the three-dimensional effect in Majora's Mask 3D leaves you amazed not only for its quality and incisiveness, but also for the fact that these virtues are recognizable within a game from 15 years ago. In this sense, Grezzo has done a commendable job, including the function in question with discretion and intelligence, never overdoing it but at the same time making it something more than a forgettable accessory. The goodness of the new super-stable 3D present on the New Nintendo 3DS makes everything even more valid, to the point that it is natural to suggest that you always keep the slider in the active position. Time passes Majora's Mask is an extraordinary chapter for a multitude of reasons, from small details to the most important design choices. The march of time and the alternation between day and night is something so incisive and developed that it leaves us fascinated and amazed even today, let alone 15 years ago. In fact, it is not just a question of the simple fall of darkness for a purely aesthetic purpose, but of a progression that marks the natural activities and the characters who inhabit Termina. What is needed is not always there, available at all times: it is not the world that adapts to the player, but the exact opposite. And the objective of the adventure has an even more epic scope: there is no princess to save or a kingdom to defend from an evil rival, but an authentic apocalypse to thwart with only 3 days available. The management of this element, the sense of urgency and the (apparent) helplessness of the protagonist change the perspectives, providing a unique and extraordinarily seductive approach. And then there is obviously the artistic component, characterized by an almost moving inspiration both in the visual element and in the sound one. The first so gloomy, dark, derelict and tragic. The colors and the almost perceptible smells that it is would be enoughThey come from the screen to understand how we are on the brink of the end, but the presence of the Moon ever closer, ever more relentless, with that psychotic face that seems to leave no hope outlines the contours of an atmosphere that penetrates the bones. We are light years away from the aesthetic canons that are usually associated with Nintendo, and it is precisely from this uniqueness that Majora's Mask 3D draws an overflowing strength. The Grezzo team, the same one who had taken care of the remake of Ocarina of Time for Nintendo 3DS, has surpassed itself in the work of modernizing the graphics: the improvements are practically everywhere, from the polygonal models to the textures to the effects, to continue with the greater saturation of the colors that offer an aesthetically less monotonous glance. If memory sweetens the memories, just watch one of the many comparative videos between the two versions to understand the extent of the effort made. And even for a secondary component like the three-dimensional effect, there is room for surprise first and then for exaltation, above all when this is supported by the super-stable 3D of the New Nintendo 3DS. As for the soundtrack instead, it is enough to know that Majora's Mask can enjoy some of the best songs of a Koji Kondo in creative summers, capable of creating an accompaniment that does not just accompany the progression of the game, but literally mixes with it giving life to a unique and indivisible product. Beyond the audiovisual component, the group supervised by Aonuma then wanted to touch up other elements as well, so as to smooth out some of the flaws of the original: for example, the saving system has been improved, Link's behavior has changed in the swimming with Zora's mask, made a boss fight less frustrating, and more generally adjustments have been made throughout the experience. In addition, they found the unique qualities of the hardware appropriate, thus integrating the controls with the gyroscope for managing the first-person aiming phases and - even more useful - adopting the touch screen for inventory management and visualization of the map. All things that help to define the extraordinary effort put into the creation of this product.", "date": "2015-02-04", "grade": "9.5"}
