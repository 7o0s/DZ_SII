{"name": "Disney Melee Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disney-melee-mania-recensione.html", "text": "When a company can count on a huge universe of characters, it has several possibilities to exploit it in the videogame field. Among these, the creation of a MOBA has considerable potential, especially with a view to building a minimally complex game, as we will see in the Disney Melee Mania review. Not that the one made by the entertainment giant is a truly original choice, given that it is recently becoming a sort of trend - as demonstrated by the success of Pokmon Unite - but the shift of attention to an action-strategic mechanic like this, at the very least, it staves off the specter of further gacha or rosewater brawler invasions. On the other hand, it is a genre that adapts very well to a situation of this type, based on a group of characters that are also extremely large and varied, with heroes characterized by different abilities and which lend themselves to being put together in assorted teams even in rather bizarre way. We are thus faced with the strange show of clashes between Buzz Lightyear, Elsa, Moana, Wreck-It Ralph and other characters taken from various Disney classics within an arena, with spells and special abilities. We are quite far from the more technical variants of the MOBA, but Disney Melee Mania still works quite well: on the other hand, the developers Mighty Bear Studio have already made themselves known with the good Butter Royale always on Apple Arcade, a game that already showed a certain mastery of one's means, especially for projects in the mobile sector. What comes out is therefore an arena multiplayer action that includes significant strategic elements as befits the genre, but also remains very accessible so as to involve a wide audience, such as the one at which a mobile game based on a huge crossover between Disney worlds can address. A more appropriate evaluation is possible perhaps over a longer period, given the need for long-term support and use by a well-active community, but if nothing else it's already a good start. War of the Disney Worlds Disney Melee Mania allows you to create very assorted teams, as in the image The structure is based on the classic MOBA: the clashes take place between two 3v3 teams in a symmetrical arena, which also contains some neutral enemies to fight to get additional points. The aim of the game is to outrun the opposing team in terms of scores in limited-time matches, both by directly fighting against each other, trying to eliminate the opponents and send them back to the respawn point, and by completing various objectives such as destruction of the robots that are inside the map, the conquest of zones and more. Each character has different types of attacks, each with its own cooldown time directly proportional to the respective power, as well as specific characteristics such as movement speed and resistance. As with League of Legends and the like, success in the game relies heavily on coordinated team action and a balanced assortment of fighters, which currently requires a bit of additional tweaking from the developers due to the amount huge number of selectable characters. Disney Melee Mania still looks like a work in progress: it launched with 12 characters, with three more already announced and on the way, but it's clear how the roster will be progressively expanded, even just by looking at the available slots. Disney Melee Mania is a 3v3 team-based MOBA Even the presence of only one map is likely to change with the addition of more environments, so important elements such as the variety of fighters and game situations are likely to improve in the near future. For the moment, there are some balancing problems between fighters who are decidedly more powerful than others and, in teams of 3, it is almost always easy to find teams made up of the same characters, which creates a certain monotony, aggravated by the insistence on the same map. Even the matchmaking is not entirely clear, organizing clashes between players arranged on rather different levels of experience, which does not help the general balance, but they are all elements that should probably be included in the calculation of a game that is still in progress. For the rest, from a technical point of view, a good job has been done: putting together characters belonging to disparate films and series such as Disney requires a great deal of art direction to try to make everything coherent, and the solution in this case has been found in a greater thrust towards the caricatured, almost ~chibi~ aspect for the various fightsnts present, which manages to give considerable cohesion to the whole. The on-screen controls are also good, taking into account their intrinsic limits, even if in the most agitated situations some differences clearly emerge between the characters with more or less practical moves to perform.", "date": "2021-12-21", "grade": "7.0"}
