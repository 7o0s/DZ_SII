{"name": "Brothers in Arms: Art of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brothers-in-arms-art-of-war.html", "text": "The Brothers in Arms series has established itself on PC and consoles thanks to its many strengths. It is a first person shooter set during the second war conflict, characterized by a certain realism and an important strategic component. The popularity of the game meant that a mobile version was also produced in 2005, developed by the usual Gameloft, which changes its genre and passes from fps to the action game with a top view, strong in alternative sections that we also find in this new episode. The game immediately throws us into the heart of the action, which develops through five different locations divided into a variable number of stages. In the first phase we will have to be able to parachute and land in enemy territory avoiding attacks, after which we will take direct control of our character and we will have to move by exploring the scenarios and eliminating all opponents. The setting is the same as in the previous episode, as are the controls: you have to use the joystick to move, the 5 key to shoot and the 0 key to use the second weapon (grenades, rocket launchers and so on). The approach to the fights is a bit confusing, in the sense that it is difficult to escape the attack of the enemies and you end up doing whoever resists the gusts the most, unless there are shelters nearby. In this case, just reach the sandbags for the character to duck behind them, appearing only when we press the fire button. The aiming is automatic, so you automatically turn in the direction of the closest threat but you cannot select another target unless you move. As mentioned above, the game has numerous alternative sections in which the structure changes completely: sometimes we will find ourselves in command of anti-aircraft turrets, therefore we will have to shoot enemies before they eliminate us with a first person view and a crosshair; on other occasions, we will have the opportunity to drive armored vehicles to make our way through tougher than normal opponents. Ammunition is never infinite, so we will have to take advantage of all the boxes scattered throughout the levels. In any case, completing an internship will often prove to be a matter of a few minutes, in full compliance with one of the fundamental rules of mobile gaming but giving up a greater thickness. As far as the technical realization is concerned, this Art of War is presented in the best way. The characters are well drawn and animated, but the bulk of the work has been done for the stages: the use of colors is always excellent and makes the scenarios different, but above all you never get the feeling of repetitiveness of the locations that usually distinguishes mobile games. In short, the Gameloft guys have really done things right, giving the game a more than convincing visual aspect. Of course, it must be said that very little has changed since Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, but in multi-episode series it is a common practice. The sound is a bit of a surprise, because it's not based on MIDI music but only on effects, of decent quality even if far from brilliant. PRO Technically very well done Playable and fun A good number of missions... AGAINST ...often too short Mediocre alternative sections Scarce sound", "date": "2008-03-06", "grade": "S.V."}
