Here, today with The Cuphead Show review! we can begin by assuring you that no Saint will be disturbed by the calendar, but surely there will be plenty of room for laughter. On the occasion of the launch of the Netflix TV series, which as it is clear is taken from the homonymous horizontal scrolling bullet-hell shooter of 2017, which will take place on February 18th on the platform at nine in the morning as usual, we previewed the whole first season of The Cuphead Show and without too many words we can safely say that we are dealing with a real gem, tasty and enjoyable all in one go. The first season consists of 12 episodes, all lasting about fifteen minutes, and follows the misadventures of Cuphead and his brother Mugman on the iconic island of Calamaio, inhabited by talking cups, giant vegetables and creatures of all kinds, including the devil himself constantly looking for souls to suck and collect. Cuphead and Mugman live in a quiet little house in the woods together with Grandpa Bricco, but obviously there is very little or nothing that is peaceful when it comes to these two. Each episode represents a different adventure with many characters and faces that are sure to be familiar to those who have played and loved the MDHR video game. After all, the same trailer had given us an anticipation of the different characters that we would have seen/glimpsed within the TV series. Most, of course, are bosses who have given much more than ~just~ a hard time in the game. Each episode of Cuphead will have a well-defined enemy In the series, however, there are those who become true ~antagonists~ of the umpteenth mishap of the pair of cups, those who are simply passing through. We could define it as an easter egg rather than a real character. Although verticality is predominant, the common thread that sees Cuphead owing a soul, his soul, to Santanasso himself does not fail to appear in most of the episodes! And this is exactly where the TV series will start, up to one last episode where... well, let's say that Satanasso could become the least of Cuphead and Mugman's problems and that the future for this project could still be long. Light, fast, fun pills but... not naughty! A scene from The Cuphead Show! Let's get to the heart of this review of The Cuphead Show! but without ruining the taste of the surprise (although there is very little or nothing to spoil). As mentioned before, the TV series is literally a show to be enjoyed in one breath, if you are a bingewatcher; alternatively, you can opt for a more dilated fruition, enjoying a couple of fragments of this show in the deadliest times of the day. The plot is practically narrow, as we have seen. It is literally vertical pills that follow the bare minimum of horizontality. An episode doesn't have time to start it's already over. It takes a moment to enter the perspective of this format, otherwise the vision is almost missing something. Yet the irony and sarcasm, the characterization (albeit bland of the characters), the lightness of the contents, the incredible work done on the animation, cannot but make the vision pleasant and passionate. The style of The Cuphead Show! it is unmistakable The series, in fact, takes up the typical taste of 30s American animation inspired by that of the brothers Max and Dave Fleischer, also borrowing something from Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney, exactly like the game does. In this case, however, the rhythm is also marked exactly like the examples just given. We could almost define them as puns, captivating and amusing, open to a particularly large audience. The format is literally that of the animated strips in the morning or that opened the prime time. Almost as if it were an appetizer before the main course. Here, if on the one hand this certainly allows the show to expand its audience, leveraging on awkward, bizarre situations well paced by a rhythm that leaves the viewer ~little breathing space~, urging him more and more to go ahead in the vision, to at the same time, however, it loses some of that nastiness typical of the game. The point is definitely to take a character and get him into bigger and bigger trouble, those catastrophic situations where you fall off a cliff, a piano lands on your head, your soul is stolen and kicked back inside you, yeah takes more than one scbones, you risk burning and so on. The cheerful protagonists of The Cuphead Show! At the same time, however, some of that more subtle verbal ~violence~ is missing from the dialogue. That heavy inside joke that exasperates the tones even more, creating that typical contrast of adult animation between what we see and what we hear. Both in Italian and in English (the adaptation work is really excellent, the dubbing as well), the jokes are less ferocious, violent and rough than they were in the game. It is obvious that it is a product for families, with some subtler gags reserved for a decidedly more mature audience, at the same time there is a slight aftertaste in the mouth for wanting something more. Something that actually makes the difference, makes it shine and doesn't just make it a pleasant show but which doesn't demonstrate the same bite as the video game. Between past and present: the animation of The Cuphead Show! A scene from The Cuphead Show! Continuing this review of The Cuphead Show!, certainly another fundamental aspect, and which has been much noticed between the video game and this animated series, is that of animation. The 30s graphic style was the predominant feature of the game, especially when compared to the difficulty of the latter. Easy to be deceived by appearances, but the substance is quite different. In this case, fortunately, we can safely enjoy the show, but the digitization of the work certainly does not go unnoticed, both positively and, so to speak, negatively. Unlike the video game, the TV series is drawn by hand but not on paper, but digitally. And it wasn't MDHR itself that took care of it, but Netflix's internal studio. There are two main reasons: the first is connected with what has been said before, that is to make the product more attractive to a younger audience and very little accustomed to 2D animation which would be alienating. The second is merely a logistical question related to time. We all know the gestation that a game like Cuphead took. In the television sector, we cannot afford all that time, especially when we talk about streaming platforms and products that are not exactly mainstream (but which have a good basis for becoming mainstream). Cuphead and his brother Mugman on a rocket...with ice cream in hand Character traits are not lost. However, the animation is extraordinary, pleasant and enhances the atmospheres and techniques typical of 1930s animation, the work on details is truly impressive, at the same time the digital makes you lose a little that characteristic and exquisitely anachronistic vintage trait. It's not hard to get used to, above all because the work done is really excellent, but sorry for the loss of that patina which, more than anything, would have made The Cuphead Show! a truly one of a kind product without rivals. Instead, inevitably, the show is somewhat put on the same level as other similar ~adaptations~ released in recent years, resulting in it being less insightful, although it leverages a quite different format. The Cuphead Show!: a show for the whole family The characterization of the characters of The Cuphead Show! it is instantly recognisable Moving towards a conclusion and going beyond the more technical aspects we have just talked about, such as the orchestrated soundtrack that incorporates the atmosphere of the game and therefore of that more oldschool animation, we can safely say that The Cuphead Show! it turns out to be a pleasant and enjoyable product that makes you want to have more, much more. That pill to take from time to time, between breaks, almost as if it were a snack. It's easy to get passionate about the characters and get excited about finding some of them, such as the protagonists themselves or King Dice and Satanasso or, again, characters that we will only meet in the DLC, such as Ms. Chalice for example. The adventures are light and lively, somewhat with that ingenuity of anachronistic animation that perhaps strikes a more mature audience, rather than a younger one. Yet the type of character, the gags and the colors that dominate the series also know how to involve the smallest viewer, leading the format to be loved on a large scale. A rather curious scene from The Cuphead Show! We can certainly say that this is only the beginning and that, for the future, we expect greater insight into the dynamics themselves between characters, going a little beyond the concept of ~afternoon pill~ and working not only on captivating animation but also a more piqued narrative, with more bite and with the ambition to go beyond the surface.", "date": "2022-02-14", "grade": null}
