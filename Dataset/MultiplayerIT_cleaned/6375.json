Not at all intimidated by the intrinsic difficulties of such a project, the guys from Rayark have therefore set up Implosion - Never Lose Hope, an action game based on robots and mutant monsters that does not give up anything and which - surprisingly - works great. .. Implosion what a passion It only takes a few moments to realize that the 9.99 (11.49 in the case of the Android version which however allows you to play the first six levels for free) required to download Implosion - Never Lose Hope are anything but unjustified: the title it starts with a bombastic introduction in computer graphics and then continues with pleasant anime-style illustrations that introduce the user to the game universe. The setting is that of a distant future in which mankind has abandoned the Earth, invaded by a mutant form called Xada: the protagonist is Jake, a mech pilot who is sent to the planet to investigate the source of some strange signals and which inevitably he will have to face the monsters with bad manners. The story is not original but it is still much more accurate than the average of mobile productions, even if the narration is a bit confusing and is not helped by a didactic English dubbing to say the least. Not bad for a product that focuses entirely on the quality of its action, and that in this sense does a truly excellent job. The player must directly command Jake's mech within 34 different levels full of Xadas to be eliminated through a respectable combat system: by repeatedly pressing the key assigned to attack with the sword, you can perform quick hit combos , while using the right timing between one movement and another they get rid of the less rapid slashing but with much greater range and power. Maintaining pressure on the same virtual button by dragging your finger in the desired direction then allows you to fire the weapon supplied, while other commands placed around the main input allow you to dodge and perform one of the special attacks at the cost of a portion of the stackable energy by killing enemies. As it is evident, Implosion - Never Lose Hope behaves like a real action, and not only on paper: the gameplay asserts itself thanks also to a control system that is up to the situation, and tearing apart the Xadas is immediately reveals a fun, rewarding experience characterized by the right level of challenge. Implosion - Never Lose Hope is undoubtedly one of the best action currently available on mobile However, the developers of Rayark did not limit themselves to providing their title with a robust infrastructure, but they were also very good at enriching it with well-appointed design choices and a truly excellent content offer. Thus, the 34 stages are not only widely replayable thanks to the two levels of difficulty, a scoring system that rewards the best performances and a whole series of objectives to unlock, but they are also well differentiated from each other: alongside solutions mostly aesthetic (such as the camera that occasionally abandons its isometric position to place itself at the side or behind the protagonist), it is also appreciable to note that the mission requirements vary just enough to keep interest alive throughout the course of the campaign, not to mention the varied and well-constructed boss fights. There is also a pleasant RPG nuance linked to the enhancement of your mech: in fact, it is possible to obtain new parts by collecting them from defeated enemies or by purchasing them in the appropriate shop, and then inserting them in the appropriate slots to enjoy new skills or improvements in statistics. In this sense, Rayark takes a small earful of ears because the screens relating to the equipment are not particularly clear and intuitive (and even a short tutorial would not have hurt), presenting an overabundance of information that ends up weighing down navigation: a defect that can also be found in the game interface, characterized by a multitude of writings and indicators which - especially on the display of an iPhone - are undoubtedly a bit confusing. However, this is really the only misstep of a successful product from every point of view, not least the graphic one: in addition to the already mentionedquality of the interlude scenes, Implosion - Never Lose Hope stages well-kept scenarios embellished with defined textures, detailed polygonal models with excellent animations and above all a plethora of lighting effects that make the game action even more spectacular.", "date": "2015-04-29", "grade": "9.0"}
