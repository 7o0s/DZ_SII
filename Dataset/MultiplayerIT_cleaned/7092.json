An overwhelming success, further enhanced by a series of awards at the Game Developers Choice Awards, which prompted the developers to work on a port for PlayStation 4 and to continue supporting the Playstation 3 version with some additional content. Among these, the most interesting perhaps remains Left Behind, but in some ways, in its own way, even what we are going to talk about in this review should not be underestimated, given that it almost completes a broader picture in terms of offer and game options. The third and final DLC for Naughty Dog's masterpiece, which is part of the Season Pass and is obviously available on the PlayStation Store, in fact offers a mix of contents for both single and multiplayer modes, as well as a series of new trophies. The bundle, titled Realism, contains four new maps for online multiplayer, new weapons and a new difficulty level for anyone who wants to relive the main campaign with greater complexity. For the record, it is possible to purchase each content individually at a higher overall price, and all users, therefore even those who do not have the aforementioned Season Pass, will still receive a modified automatic rifle for free. But let's proceed in order. The Realism Bundle further transforms The Last of Us into an extreme fight for survival Extreme conditions The game mode called Realism for single player of The Last of Us (here you can read the complete review of the video game) offers users an additional level of difficulty for the campaign, and transforms it into a real extreme survival experience. Starting from the basis of the degree of difficulty Survivor of the original, which included among other things the disabling of the Listening mode, that is, the one that allows you to identify the closest opponents thanks to the sound of their footsteps, the new option pushes the accelerator of realism , just like its title says. Once you start playing, the first differences compared to the game without DLC seem only visual, in the sense that the classic information on the screen is missing, such as the character's health status or the number of ammunition available. But after a few hours even the differences in the gameplay come out, and the title becomes more and more difficult. Thanks not so much to an improved artificial intelligence of the enemies, which is confirmed to be good but slightly deficient in some of the behavioral routines that regulate their actions, but rather to their superior aggressiveness and greater resistance to blows, there is a certain underlying difficulty in deal with any type of conflict. This is because it is enough to suffer a well-aimed blow on the head with a large iron pipe, or a well-aimed projectile in a vital point of the body of Joel or Ellie, and you are immediately dead or, if you are more ~lucky~, extremely battered . If you want to survive, or try to do so even for just one more minute and therefore sell your life dearly, every move must be carefully weighed, every step must be performed carefully trying to exploit, where possible, the stealth component of the game more than in the past, constructively using the covers that the environments offer at the moment and the silent assassin skills of the protagonists. Even if even these don't always work, especially against the Clickers, which seemed even more sensitive to sounds and decidedly more aggressive. If we add to these aspects that even the resources found are more limited than in the past, that Ellie no longer supplies Joel with medkits and ammunition and that the checkpoints have been repositioned in such a way as to often force the player to repeat entire passages, it will be clear to everyone that the Realism mode is recommended only and exclusively for hardcore gamers or for those who, viscerally loving the game, have a lot, really a lot, patience . And if someone wants to exaggerate, we point out that once the adventure is completed the Realism Plus mode will be unlocked which we have not had the opportunity to try due to time constraints, but which we imagine is even more difficult despite the fact that the few resources accumulated in the previous one can probably be used match. In any case, for those wishing to purchase this single option outside the bundle to make the game even more difficult, the price of the package is 4.99. Far too much, in our opinion. Playstation 3 trophies The Last of Us:Realism adds 15 trophies to the original game, including two gold ones that are obtained by completing the main campaign on the Realism and Realism Plus difficulty levels. The others are unlocked by performing specific actions during multiplayer matches in each of the game's maps. As for the multiplayer component, the Realism Pack includes Redeemed Territories, which contains four new maps for online called Docks, Government Building, Coal Mine and Water Tower respectively. The first is set in the old docks where Joel met Robert, and is very suitable for close combat, with two sniper emplacements and a huge boat to exploit. The second is instead located in Boston, in an area that tends to alternately enhance both outdoor and indoor clash sessions. The Coal Mine set, on the other hand, is Colorado in the middle of winter, complete with sudden snowstorms ready to blur the players' vision and make fighting even more difficult. The area is where in the story mode Ellie has to do with David: it is large and scattered with abandoned buildings, ideal places to move to try to get around enemies or find shelter. There is also a bridge where you can stand for sniping. The last map is the Lincoln Water Tower, which despite initial appearances is structured in such a way as to push gamers into close combat with shotguns, or in furious hand-to-hand combat. Here too we point out that for each map there are new trophies to unlock. To close the multiplayer offer of the Realism bundle there are then four new weapons, whose characteristics seem to be designed on purpose to offer gamers new possibilities within the game dynamics for the Factions online mode. And just to stay on the subject, the Season Pass also allows you to get two survival skill bundles, called omni-tool and professional respectively, with new specialties for the characters, which can be tested before purchasing using predefined equipment. Ultimately, the Realism bundle has a fair amount of irons in the fire in its entirety, although in our opinion what stands out above the rest of its contents is the new ~extreme~ difficulty level which alone constitutes a nice addition to the game options by The Last of Us. And not only because it allows you to test your gamer skills, but also because it constitutes a valid ~excuse~ to return to visit that brutal but in its own way fascinating universe that we have come to know and love in an adventure characterized by a story with a cinematic cut and adult themes.", "date": "2014-05-28", "grade": null}
