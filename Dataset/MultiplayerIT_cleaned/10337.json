The Namco JRPG series has been one of the most revered by fans of the genre for years and the Japanese softco managed to produce an excellent title for a console that did not boast an exciting catalog of RPGs. Five years later, the new Nintendo console is also preparing to welcome an episode of the Tales saga and, ironically, it is a direct sequel to the aforementioned Tales of Symphonia: it will be up to its predecessor or a hole in the water ? Dawn of the New World concludes the story that began on GameCube not without several hitches A new world? The narrative premise of Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World is decidedly interesting, as it offers a rather original change of perspective: the story begins two years after the conclusion of Tales of Symphonia and the union of the two once separate worlds, Tethe'alla and Sylvarant. However, the final events of the prequel have had dire consequences for the planet, devastated by cataclysms and invaded by monsters. The story mainly has as protagonists two new characters, Emil Castagnier and Marta Lualdi, with very distant personalities (he is a great coward, she has courage to sell) but united by a common desire for revenge precisely against the protagonists of Tales of Symphonia , especially Lloyd and Colette, apparently responsible for their own tragedies. Marta's main mission, which Emil joins at the beginning of the game, is to awaken the lord of the monsters Ratatosk, but of course there will be a series of twists and unexpected events that will lead our new heroes to cross the path of many characters met in the prequel. Those who have never played Tales of Symphonia will find it rather difficult to appreciate a plot so strongly connected to that story, even if Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World often offers flashbacks and explanations of past events: the nostalgic effect is heavily sought after, both in interacting with old characters and in exploring places already seen on the GameCube. To tell the truth, the plot of Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World appears much shorter and lighter than the excellent prequel, the characterization of some supporting actors or adversaries is less marked and the screenplay fluctuates: the events in fact begin to develop in compelling tones only after several hours of play while the beginning appears rather bland and inconstant, however the definitive entry into the scene of the protagonists of the prequel coincides with the beginning of a narrative crescendo that culminates in an excellent ending. Generational change One of the characteristics of the prequel that Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World leaves behind is certainly the peculiar visual style: cel-shaded graphics and superdeformed models have been abandoned in favor of a less original but very convincing design. The three-dimensional models are well made and finished, they enjoy excellent animations and a clear and precise texturing, while the color palette used is truly perfect, especially in the creation of the various locations. However, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World is a game that technically resembles the episodes of the last generation, in particular Tales of the Abyss for PlayStation 2. The developers have not put much effort into reproducing the world of Tales of Symphonia and let a bit dumbfounded, for example, the decision to replace the explorable three-dimensional map with a simple menu from which to choose the destination from time to time. Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World, in fact, develops in the most classic and linear of structures: a new setting is explored, narrative cutscenes are triggered that will indicate the next objective, dozens of battles are fought and we move on to the next one. location. Linearity is perhaps the weakest point of the game, fortunately interrupted by frequent cutscenes (Italian text accompanied by a good English dubbing) and by the always fresh and fun combat system typical of the series: in fact, contact with an enemy triggers the loading of a battlefield in which we will control one of the four members of our active party in real time, using his spells and normal and special attacks in truly pyrotechnic combinations. The rest of the group is controlled by a discreet artificial intelligence to which some basic directives can be indicated or by other human players, for a maximum of three. In short, the battle system does not differ at all from the typical one of the franchise, texcept for a new feature: the capture of monsters. It is in fact possible, by satisfying certain conditions, to add one of the monsters faced in battle to the group: it can then be used as any member of the party, with its specific abilities. The idea is really nice during the first hours of the game but the feature soon becomes rather superfluous when the main human supporting characters join the party, decidedly more powerful and balanced than the domesticated creatures. As well as the cooking of food and drink or the simple synthesis of objects, even the capture of monsters turns out to be nothing more than an additional entertainment for those who want to sift through Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World to the max, before embarking on the phases ending of the adventure.", "date": "2009-12-04", "grade": "7.5"}
