The Xbox 360 version of Star Trek Legacy is very similar to the PC version, with the difference that the latter is plagued by numerous bug problems and malfunctioning features. Fortunately, the console edition does not suffer from all this and has been completely cleaned up by the Bethesda beta testers, the same software house as Morrowind and Oblivion, so to speak. Legacy sees you take command of a squadron of starship battleships across five hugely popular Star Trek franchises: the classic series, Enterprise, Voyager, DS9 and Next Generation. Legacy sees us take command of a squadron of battleships across the five hugely popular Star Trek franchises Unrestrained speed! The plot is a mere pretext to accompany us at the turn of each era to fight: a Vulcan scientist named T'Uerell will learn about the Borg during the years of the Federation and will look for a way to become their queen, passing from era to era and meeting on their way all five commanders of the Enterprise who in turn will try (or rather, we will try) to prevent her from rising to power. Obviously there was a need for a certain ~historical revisionism~ in order to allow the developers a plot that linked all the series, perhaps the purists will turn up their noses but in any case we feel free to say that as a revision it has been developed very well and it is consistent with many points in the saga. From the classic series to Enterprise Legacy, as already hinted at above, is essentially a space battle video game. The first two eras, those of the classic series and of Enterprise, have quite repetitive and very similar missions: choose the combat ship, arrive at the predetermined point and destroy all the enemies, the scheme is more or less always this. We start with a simple spaceship and by winning the first few battles we will earn captain-points which are useful for buying other spaceships later on. The problem is that the possibility of buying new ones is given to us before tackling the subsequent missions, and it is therefore difficult to understand - which ones - would be better to buy and which ones not. In any case, the game begins: the vast map, which can be activated from the pad, shows us a virtual plane that represents the space we can travel in the cosmos, the main planets and the objectives. the vast map, which can be activated from the pad, shows us a virtual plane that represents the space we can travel in the cosmos From the classic series to Enterprise By selecting a precise point on the map and pressing the Y key, the ~Warp~ is activated and you travel at the speed of light to your destination. Once we arrive we should expect the enemy attack, now by the Klingons, now by the Romulans and possibly also by the Borg themselves, and so on and so forth. Each ship has its own unique weapons, all of which are fired with the two analog triggers. To frame the enemy it will be necessary to position yourself in the right way because otherwise our attack won't even start. Generally the enemy will have to be at the stern or possibly at the bow. Most ships are rather slow and clumsy to move so it won't be easy to always aim optimally. It is also possible to increase or decrease the cruising speed to ~maneuver~ in combat. Above enemies will appear a double energy bar represented by the protection shield and the remaining ~life~ of the enemy. After destroying this shield it will be possible to start with the real attack. Next Generation Once we get to the ~Next Generation~ era, the variety of missions will be wider, and we will go from essentially shooter levels to something more reasoned. We will have to escort friendly ships, explore, propose diplomatic initiatives, research and supply ammunition and so on. The game becomes a little more fun like this, but we are almost at the end unfortunately. The missions are quite long, the first ones last about 10/15 minutes while the more complex ones can even last half an hour or forty minutes. There are two problems: there are no checkpoints and the game cannot be saved mid-mission, so in case of death we would have to start all over again, and this is not always exciting. Once we get to the ~Next Generation~ era, the variety of missions will be wider Next Generation To this we also add a strange management of the artificial intelligence: some missions are scripted with a pre-established time, or after a few minutes the ship or the base we were protecting explodes or is destroyed, even if at that moment it was not attacked by anyone. And all this will also force us to start over, which is a bit frustrating. Also because the game itself is not reallyfunny, the differentiation between the ships is not so marked, they all carry out the same attacks, good or bad, and the same ones are not so satisfying: with the left analog we activate the laser, which automatically locks on to the target and removes its energy (and therefore there is not even need to aim), while with the right analog you start the missiles, also with automatic aim (and therefore they don't even give the satisfaction of having made a good shot). Ranked and custom matches Up to four ships can be used simultaneously, switching between them with the d-pad. It is also possible to impart some basic orders: attack, defend, repair, and so on. A different way to play Legacy is offered by the full support of Xbox Live: you can host matches in custom or ranked games. The online gameplay is identical to that of the campaign, you use a combat ship and try to destroy the opposing fleets, which is all a war game has to do. An unprecedented tactical factor certainly takes over due to the game map, it is possible to escape the enemy with warp speed and go and hide near some lost planet, and then return to the attack once our damage has been repaired. The variety of the online game is certainly not exciting, and the technique simply consists in choosing the right ship and in the timing with which we press the keys, since aiming and firing are automatic. Moreover, it is not even easy to find classified departures in which to enter since the waiting times are on average long. This flaw makes the multiplayer mode frustrating, which still has something good to give away. The technical realization of Legacy The technical level reached by the programmers would suggest an ~old gen~ origin of the project: the polygon count is comparable to an Xbox production, as well as the use of effects, very sporadic and not too exciting. The spaceships are well reproduced, but they certainly don't stand out for their detail, and even the explosions are certainly not the best, so much so that they reach the level of some 128-bit productions. Yet a setting like that of Legacy doesn't need large polygonal structures, and the computational duty of the graphics card is thus greatly relieved and given the advantage to develop effects and ships worthy of the name that this franchise bears. Bethesda hasn't even broken down too much in implementing any sort of polygonal collision The technical realization of Legacy Even the choice made for the collisions is quite arcade, given that around each planet, base, enemy or friendly ship there is in fact an invisible wall that prevents us from approaching and makes us bounce with a somewhat unsettling effect. The feeling of ~space warfare~ is not recreated badly, despite the not astounding technical realization: on the screen there is a good number of combat ships but above all the music and sound effects are very, very good. They were obviously taken from the show as well as the voices of all the voice actors who ~appear~ in this video game. Unfortunately Legacy is all in English so, for the less accustomed to the Anglo-Saxon language, it will be a small problem to be able to play it. Goals 360 Star Trek Legacy offers players the usual 1000 points, divided into 36 objectives. Most of them are obtained in the campaign, where the sense of progression in achieving them is very good: as you progress through the story, numerous achievements will automatically be unlocked. The others will have to be conquered with online play or with particular positive performances: for example winning a battle without ever losing an ally, fighting without ever hiding in a particular level, saving certain objectives or ~simply~ completing some mission using only a space ship . The game is completed in a few days and allows you to unlock numerous achievements, for the other half a good commitment will be required in the online game and to replay the campaign once again at a higher level of difficulty. Comment An important franchise like Star Trek could certainly be exploited in a better way, but Legacy remains a good space combat game unfortunately plagued by problems that affect its playability and the potential fun it could offer. The lack of save points is bad enough, and the Bethesda title suffers from a lack of variety of situations and satisfaction in combat, given that the weapons are mostly auto-aim. Putting aside the technical sector, we note the audio which is very good and evocative: a little bit for the name that Legacy bears. pro Audio compartment Go through all the Star Trek series A must for true fans Cons Technical implementation No save points in the campaign Unsatisfactory multiplayer Star Trek Legacy is available for PC and Xbox360. The tested version is the one for Xbox360. The approaching celebrations for the fortieth year since the birth of the glorious Star Trek series has once again turned the spotlight on one of the most famous space sagas of all time, even leading Bethesda to make a game based on this very important franchise. There has always been a hard core of enthusiasts. This event, a space battle title set between the five series and with the original voices of all the captains of the Enterprise: these are the suppositions that could make any respectable ~trekker~ salivate!", "date": "2007-01-12", "grade": null}
