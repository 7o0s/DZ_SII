Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Doodle Jump and many other products of the same genre, more or less refined, have offered us hours of fun while we were intent on making our character jump higher and higher, moving him on the screen to impact the platforms necessary to make him reach higher , with the aim of setting a new record in each game. A more evolved and structured interpretation of the jumping game genre can be found, for example, in the recent Sonic Jump, which abandons the ~dry~ approach in favor of gradually more complex levels, full of enemies and pitfalls to avoid while searching to continue its ascent and to reach the ~finish line~ of the moment. Well, the Finnish developers of Cute Attack have seen fit to reverse the order of factors, or rather to create a vertical progression action game in which, however, our aim is not to go up within the scenario, but to go down. So here is Captain Clumsy, downloadable for free from the App Store and Google Play, and recently reached version 1.3.3. As already mentioned, the game sees us manage a fall rather than attempting a climb, by using the touch screen of our device to move the friendly pirate protagonist to the right or left to avoid obstacles and take the most appropriate routes. It is also possible to select the controls via accelerometer from the options screen, a solution which however seemed to us much less precise. Coins, chests and birds Our Captain Clumsy plummets from the top of the mast at the start of each stage, and then what? Its fall is slowed down by some balloons which represent, in fact, the vital energy available and which explode when it comes into contact with one of the many bad birds crowding the ship's sails. We must therefore move the character so as to avoid damage, while collecting as many gold coins as possible and, perhaps, some chests. Along the way we also find objects of various kinds: from barrels, useful if launched to clear the way from annoying birds, to cannons, which can project us towards otherwise inaccessible areas and allow us to complete the collection of precious items. Coins are important for a whole series of reasons: beyond the fact that by spending them you can get some useful upgrades, from a certain point on to unlock the levels it will be necessary to spend our virtual money. At first this mechanic does not create major problems, but in the more advanced stages the amount of gold required becomes very high and one is therefore forced to replay missions already completed to raise the amount necessary to move forward. However, we must recognize that the developers have not taken advantage of this to push towards IAPs, given that the coins materialize again in each stage and therefore their collection is only a matter of time and desire. The offer is completed by a technical sector that lives up to expectations, characterized by a funny and colorful design for the characters, as well as by an always ~readable~ scenario to allow us to make the right choices.", "date": "2013-04-20", "grade": "7.7"}
