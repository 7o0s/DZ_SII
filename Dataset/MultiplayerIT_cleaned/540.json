{"name": "Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords-recensione.html", "text": "Master of Civilizations? We are in the presence of a classic turn-based strategy - many points of contact with the famous Sid Meier saga, starting from the name!  in which the player, once he has chosen one of the ten available races (it is possible to create ad hoc ones) has the modest aim of conquering the universe. It is possible to achieve this objective by following different paths, mostly dictated by the characteristics of the chosen living species. The formidable Drengin, for example, can count on a first-rate war system, while for the Torians there will be no financial problems, given their commercial skills. So far, therefore, nothing particularly different from what the legendary Civilization has accustomed us to; once the game has started, then, we continue to glimpse abundant similarities with the Firaxis saga. In fact, initially you have only one planet where you can build buildings (which can increase population growth rather than economic or technological growth) and spaceships. In the first rounds it is possible to manufacture basic units (colonization, construction and exploration), but new discoveries become usable as scientific innovations follow one another. Pimp my ship The aspect just introduced certainly deserves further study. By default there are some pre-packaged and fairly balanced vehicles, the variety of which has been deliberately limited. This is because the programmers have decided to make available an internal editor that allows you to build spaceships yourself, starting from a skeleton and adding aerodynamic appendages (completely useless from a tactical point of view, but of sure scenic impact), engines, shields, weapons and a thousand other components with the most disparate uses: in this way it will be possible, for example, to equip even the tiny and very fast scout spacecraft with the newly invented space construction micro module so as to be able to reach that resource-rich meteorite on the other side before the others part of the galaxy. It goes without saying that this very lucky choice significantly increases the level of involvement of the player, who in this way can create personalized fleets suited to their tactical propensities. [C] Not even the guys at West Coast Custom could do better! It's me. cost a capital, but what a great impression with the galactic chicks! [/C] Technological baobab Another thing that immediately catches the eye is the exaggerated vastness of the technological tree of Galactic Civilizations 2: if you think that laser weapons alone have 25 updates, each of which can take several weeks (shifts) before being completed, you he easily realizes the importance of diplomatic relations with the other participants in order not to let his civilization miss the train of innovation. In fact, it will be possible to exchange military or economic alliances with the coveted updates, which, as always, are essential in order not to succumb to threatening rivals. Star Ministers The war aspect continues to play an important role, but is no longer fundamental. Suffice it to say that in battles where the arsenal gap is too large, the weakest units will simply disappear; in other circumstances, a 3D screen is activated where it is possible to observe the progress of the duels in the third person, just as if you were sitting in the stadium. Ships can be upgraded throughout the game, and should be watched closely as they gain experience with victories. However, war is not all in Stardock's strategy: there are, as mentioned above, several other ways to achieve control of the universe. What is surprising is the superfine AI with which the opponents have been equipped: in practice they seem to adapt dynamically to the player's choices. Those who prefer to try to achieve cultural dominance will see civilizations behave exactly as it would be legitimate to expect from a human being: those who recognize each other by politics and ideals - during the game you will have to choose alignment and government to give to the empire - will not resist in the surrender their planets to the most powerful rulers, while the opposing factions will seek asylum in every way by selling themselves off to the highest bidder in order not to be overwhelmed. The interesting thing is that, with a clever diplomatic network, it will even be possible to win the game without even building a combat ship! The 3000 engine From a technical point of view, Dread Lords comes with a clean graphic design that does not disdain some special effects, even if - objectively - we have seen games facing space with a visual vessel of a completely different impact. They also could have beenthe management screens are a little more accurate (the area reserved for the immense technological process, for example, is too scarce), but you get used to it quickly enough. Overall, the engine becomes functional to the game structure without weighing excessively on system resources: even video cards with a few months too many will be able to handle Stardock's galaxies with ease, while the role covered by the processor should not be underestimated, which becomes fundamental in maps with many participants. The audio subsystem, on the other hand, left us disappointed, mainly due to an uninspired and too repetitive soundtrack, so much so that some players will want to deactivate it after a few minutes to promote concentration. Even the sound effects are not very pleasant, while there are no voice comments except that of the weird video tutorial. Concluding... The longevity of the title is excellent, which offers challenges that are always different from each other, guaranteeing a high degree of replayability. There is a pre-packaged campaign and a random scenario editor, created by indicating particular victory conditions, races initially present, universe size... The absence of any online mode is a mole which, given the nature of the title, we do not want judge too harshly. Summing up, Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords impressed us favorably, above all thanks to the various situations offered to the player, often put in difficulty by very witty enemies. The advanced artificial intelligence, the different ways of conducting the games, the remarkable personalization of one's own race, make the game of Stardock extremely enjoyable and addictive: we are sure that many will answer no to the game's question when pressing quit: ~Are you are you sure you want to quit? Another shift never hurt anyone...~ [C] Let's conquer enemy planets with an invasion of elite soldiers Lamberto Sposini wears the summer 2943 collection [/C] Problems in Italy There is a small inconvenience that afflicts copies of Dread Lords arriving in Italy: in fact, the serial code included in the packs consists of only 25 alphanumeric characters against the 28 necessary for online activation. By following this link it is possible to circumvent the obstacle both online and via e-mail. Final comment Galactic Civilizations 2: Dread Lords is an excellent game that does not struggle to be recognized in a panorama that is not particularly crowded - that of turn-based strategy. The comparison with the milestone Civilization IV sees Sid Meier's title win with a certain advantage, while being inferior in certain aspects that have been treated with a lot of dedication here (especially artificial intelligence). The clean and pleasant graphics, the high longevity and the numerous touches of class with which the programmers have embellished their second work, make Dread Lords an obligatory purchase for all lovers of the genre, a choice not to be underestimated for those wishing to approach the first time. For them, however, the lack of localization in Italian could represent a considerable obstacle, given the numerous dialogue screens present. Pros Different tactics to face the game Realistic and demanding AI Excellent replayability Cons Only available in English Repetitive sound Interface can be improved The name Stardock Corporation is certainly familiar to PC users: it is the software house that created the famous WindowsBlinds, one of the best-known theme managers for Windows XP. The company has recently expanded its business by becoming a distributor of applications and video games, all of which can be purchased online; among these also Galactic Civilizations, the first playful work created by Stardock in March 2003. Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords is naturally the sequel to that title, which had received so much approval from the specialized press. There are two versions on the market: the standard one is joined by the Collector's Edition object of our test, which stands out for a greater quantity of modules with which to customize your fleet (an aspect that we will go into more detail in the continuation of the review).", "date": "2006-04-18", "grade": null}
