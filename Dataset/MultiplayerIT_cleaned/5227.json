Since the days of Populous we have wanted to have more and more power and control over the many little humans who populate our virtual world, influence their prosperity and technological progress, as well as help them survive during conflicts and the harshest famines. In 2013 Reus partially managed to redefine the rules of god games by relegating us to a two-dimensional world in which to think only of the management of natural resources, thus limiting the possibilities of interaction with humans. After three years, the Abbey Games title also arrives on home consoles, enriching the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One catalog with an interesting and well-crafted experience, even if not without defects. If you were waiting for a ~god game~ to be played comfortably seated on the sofa with a pad in your hands, Reus could be for you, but if you don't like the genre, it will certainly not change your mind. More than three years later, Reus arrives on home consoles: has the wait paid off? Plants, animals and minerals Taking on the role of an omnipotent God who makes use of the help of his four trusted giants, we have the task of bringing life back to an arid and desolate planet with the aim of recreating a natural environment suitable for hosting the most diverse life forms. Life always comes from water, and thanks to the power of the sea giant we can easily create a vast ocean near which to grow a lush green forest using the forest giant or a marshy environment with that of the swamps. Lastly, there is the mountain giant who creates mountain ranges and gives life to dry and arid deserts, which are also potentially suitable for human development. In fact, life can settle in any corner of the new terrestrial globe, provided it has the right resources available. In this sense, the giants have secondary powers that allow us to deposit resources such as plants, animals and mineral deposits on the ground that will be exploited by the nomads to give life to the first settlements. One of the peculiarities of Reus is that of limiting the player's powers to those of the four giants at his disposal, thus giving him full control over the management of the earth's surface and its ecosystem but denying him any contact with the humans who inhabit it who will continue for their road allowing ourselves to be influenced only partially by our actions. For example, after a village has been established, humans will autonomously choose which project to complete - whether it's a school or a production site to be built within a time limit - and we will have to provide him with the resources necessary for his completion by placing them within the boundaries of the village itself. This is where the complex transformation and symbiosis mechanisms come into play that allow us to go and evolve and modify the resources deposited on the ground to improve their yield and speed up the development of the population and the completion of its projects. This is probably the most complex and least intuitive mechanic in Reus that requires some initial study and numerous tutorial screens to fully assimilate. In fact, it is often necessary to resort to the powers of several giants to transform blueberries into more nutritious tomatoes, for example, or to dig deeper mines and speed up the extraction of minerals. Playstation 4 trophies Reus offers 29 trophies of which 14 in bronze, 7 in silver and 7 in gold to which is added the precious platinum Platinum. It starts from the easiest challenges like completing the initial tutorial to the most complex ones like finishing an Era with a high prosperity value and more projects completed. Sofa god Even the default duration of the matches - when the time runs out the giants fall asleep again and leave the planet to die - has proved to be a double-edged sword which, if on the one hand allows you to try your hand at short and intense matches, on the other underlines the lack of content to support a structured evolution of the populations and makes the title too repetitive especially in the initial stages of a new game. Nonetheless, it is satisfying to witness the creation of the first settlement and follow the evolution of human groups under our control, but it is a pleasure far from that of feeling ourselves the creators of the destiny of an entire race. Wars with other peoples or excessive greed caused by the abundance of resources are problems that will always have to be solved indirectly through resource management, it being understood that we always have thefinal solution of destroying the villages and their population in order to keep intact the balance that we have laboriously created. As far as the control system is concerned, the work done by the development team to adapt them to the pad of the Sony and Microsoft home consoles was commendable: despite the limited amount of keys available, we absolutely did not regret the mouse and keyboard, managing to manage without too much giant headaches , lands and resources using the analog sticks and back buttons to move between the various menus. In this sense, the choice of the developers to give life to two-dimensional planets of which we only see the outer shell helps a lot, thus freeing themselves from the certainly more complex management of a three-dimensional map. Also very useful is the possibility of pausing the game during the most agitated situations in order to give commands to the four giants without wasting too much time. Finally, the audiovisual sector conquered us for its simple and colorful artistic direction, but we could not help but notice an excessive simplification of the menus and the user interface, as well as numerous problems regarding the localization of the texts.", "date": "2016-10-17", "grade": "7.8"}
