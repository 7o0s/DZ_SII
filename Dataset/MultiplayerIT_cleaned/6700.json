Serial reproduction has always been a bit of a basic principle of the genre system that characterizes video games, but with the expansion of the landscape, especially through the mobile market and indie productions, it has reached almost worrying levels. The Stumble Guys review cannot ignore the awareness that this game is actually a clone of Fall Guys, however, everything cannot be reduced to this one negative consideration either, because objectively it has very positive elements and, in fact, fits in spaces left free by the title to which it clearly refers. The concept is always the same, in principle attributable to the battle royale, but mediated through a series of challenges that recall Takeshi's Castle, or the good old ~Mai Dire Banzai~: it's about overcoming a series of tests that put us in competition with a large number of other players, through knockout rounds that require different actions to be performed. It is a matter of arriving before the others or resisting longer, or making your team win through a series of actions to be performed that change, even substantially, depending on the level in which we find ourselves, with the constant sword of Damocles of direct elimination in case you fail to enter the maximum parameters placed at the beginning of the challenge. The gameplay mechanics are clearly derived from those of Fall Guys, but there are also some new introductions that demonstrate a minimum of initiative and fresh ideas. Only one will remain Stumble Guys, a picture from one of the obstacle courses The aim of Stumble Guys is to remain the last active player in the game, through matches of three consecutive knockout rounds, during which the amount of players halves each time until you reach the last one standing. The standard levels, usually used at the beginning of the game, are very close to those made famous by Fall Guys: lots of funny characters, all with modifiable skins and aspects, find themselves running inside courses full of obstacles, with the need to reach the finish line before the others in order to return to the first half of players and avoid elimination. The removable elements and the clumsiness inherent in the cartoonish competitors do not make crossing these levels easy at all, further complicated by the crowd that is created between the players and the latter's obvious willingness to overwhelm others by any means available, with somewhat hilarious results. Stumble Guys, one of several challenges that appear in the levels The smartphone control system relies on the classic virtual stick with a touch screen key and, beyond the intrinsic discomfort, it works quite well proving to be reactive at the right point, even if the action is certainly more confusing on mobile platforms, between controls less precise and the chaos that can emerge on small screens. The obstacle courses are interspersed with different levels, in which we have to face various challenges: a sort of team ~capture the flag~, a level in which we have to resist the longest possible by avoiding lasers, another in which we have to stand last under constant bombardment and other multi-event mini-games of this type, all extremely simple but also well designed to provide a fun challenge to play with a significant amount of opponents. The design of these gameplay fragments is a bit fluctuating, alternating good ideas with other rather trivial and less developed ones, with the obstacle courses probably remaining the best moments of the game. Between imitation and micro-transactions Stumble Guys, another scene from a steeplechase The reasons for the success of Fall Guys are clearly identifiable: it is a game devoted purely to expanded multiplayer, with a humorous tone and led to the most demented gags, or a formula that has already shown that it can be explosive if exposed through streaming and social networks. With these premises, it was only a matter of time before direct competitors came forward and, in this case, Stumble Guys managed to establish itself in a brilliant way by taking advantage of some fundamental shortcomings of the Mediatonic game. It immediately offered itself as free-to-play and above all it immediately filled the space left empty in the mobile sector: the coup de grace was then given by the removal of Fall Guys from Steam once it was moved exclusively to the Epic Games Store, providing the game Kitka Games with a perfect assist to impose itself on PC as well. The result was devastating: 163 mimillion downloads and 21.5 million dollars from its soft launch, which took place way back in 2020, to today. There is an obvious difference in terms of production values between the two games, but we are still talking about technically rather simple and functional. In this sense, Stumble Guys keeps a low profile to be able to run better even on extremely limited devices and therefore finds the right mediation between graphic simplicity, cartoonish style and general fluidity even with 32 players on the screen. The element of substantial detachment between one and the other can perhaps be found in what is the most critical point of the Kitka Games game, i.e. the free-to-play structure with microtransactions, which instead of maintaining a pure model with purchases in - exclusively aesthetic app introduces some features that can make it tend dangerously towards pay to win. In this case, these are some emoticons that represent real ~perks~ able to offer clear advantages in the game against the other players, which is obtained only at the end of the premium battle passes and therefore upon payment of the in-game purchase. app.", "date": "2022-07-24", "grade": "7.0"}
