But you know, time changes everything, and the unexplored frontier of the past has been brutally colonized with the prairie that has left more and more space for the advance of concrete and skyscrapers; and it is precisely from this urban and contemporary context that the events of the third chapter of the saga take shape, a modern transposition of the western imaginary where, however, it is always the dear old lead that reigns supreme. The beautiful, the bad and the ugly Directly from the hot and seedy suburbs of Los Angeles the policeman Ben McCall, together with FBI agent Kim Evans and Eddie Guerra member of the DEA, have to deal with a Mexican drug cartel that has stretched its tentacles up to the high spheres of US power. Involved in this singular and improbable special team, the three lawmen, so different and conflicting with each other, have the task of sabotaging the cartel's business, placing the blame on a rival gang and at the same time protecting a precious witness, all in a scenario of possible imminent war between the United States and Mexico. This third Call of Juarez therefore gives us the opportunity to impersonate not only McCall (descendant of the homonymous protagonists of the previous episodes of the series) but also the other two agents, thus being able to replay the same campaign from three different points of view; in fact, each character has personal secondary interests related to the story. In addition to this albeit marginal characterization, the protagonists differ in the type of weapons that can be used at the beginning of the mission (three in all: a rifle and two pistols); however, the choice of character does not in any way influence the development of the events that always and in any case arrive at the same, albeit not too obvious, epilogue. The unusual trio, however, also offers the possibility of playing the entire campaign in online cooperative with three players, both privately and publicly and it is certainly in this capacity that the dynamics of Call of Juarez give their best. While not distorting the structure of the title at all, the numerous shootings lend themselves well to being tackled with human companions, especially considering the lack of usefulness of our colleagues if they are controlled by the CPU. However, what leaves a bitter taste in the mouth is how, despite the presence of several co-protagonists, the campaign, even when faced in a cooperative, suffers from the same limitations found in a solitary game: that is, an excessive linearity of the situations and of the approach to clashes, underlined by a respawn of enemies that is not too invasive in terms of numbers but excessively obvious with opponents who literally appear on the scene. Even the conditions of the clashes do not shine for originality: in fact the developers of Techland, although they have stuffed their product with peculiar situations such as that of facing break-ins in the rooms by breaking down the door and thus activating the most classic of bullet time, or the need to advance of cover in cover to get around some enemies (a feature, yes, which is enhanced in cooperative), in the long run they have not managed to make these episodes supported by real level design needs, with the result that they end up appearing as gimmicks with the aim to try to dampen the linear progress of the player. Foggy forests and dusty cities A positive feature of Call of Juarez: the Cartel can be found in the artificial intelligence of the enemies, which while not reaching the qualitative peaks admired in Halo, at least allows gang members not to be too inclined to act as helpless targets; indeed these do not disdain to resort to the use of covers and to circumvent the player, and to this is added the fact that there is no radar to identify hostiles. The missions follow one another maintaining the usual structure of advancing and shooting at everything that moves (perhaps paying attention to civilians) alternating with some scenes on board vehicles; and here too the cooperative mode appears to be the best choice, while the driving sessions tackled alone with the CPU used as cover fire prove to be anything but unforgettable, if not even monotonous. In walking sessions the level design offers a modest freedom of movement giving an initial feeling of large spaces rather thananother apparent, even if the enemies are always arranged on a single linear path so that any alternative approach to the levels is largely mortified. The same goes for the heterogeneous arsenal made available to the three agents, which is progressively expandable during the game by leveling up our alter ego. The guns available are numerous and range from automatic rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles and many types of pistols and the ever-present revolvers. Pad in hand, the feeling of the different weapons is pleasantly recognizable and it is also possible to hold the two pistols at the same time to maximize the volume of fire, but it is the game itself that does not offer us a complexity of events such as to be able to exploit all this paraphernalia properly, so that the entire campaign can easily be completed using only the basic equipment. Once a certain number of kills has been reached, it is possible to use the Concentration mode which slows down the action for a few seconds, allowing you to liquidate more enemies with maximum precision. What seems to be missing in particular is a cinematic and spectacular cut to the action, something that can worthily support the narration of events (which in itself offers a rather interesting script) even during the gameplay phases and not only during the scenes of 'interlude. During the game, the different inclinations and secret interests of the protagonists are highlighted by some secondary objectives to be met, useful for raising the score at the end of the mission, but all this translates into concrete only in stealing some secret objects from the shooting scenes, being careful not to be discovered by the two agents, this appears as yet another element that would have deserved a more profound development. Playstation 3 trophies About half of the trophies are unlocked by completing the campaign on a normal level. For the silver and gold trophies it is necessary to finish the game with all three characters and also on difficult, while the remaining prizes are destined for the multiplayer and cooperative sector. The west has aged badly Although it does not shine for its originality in the highly inflated panorama of FPS, this third chapter of the saga of the treasure of Juarez is not however attributable to major defects with regard to the mechanics of the gameplay that performs the task even without great qualitative and original peaks. The most substantial defects are rather in the technical sector which relies on the owner Chrome Engine now in its fifth version. It really seems that this engine has reached its evolutionary limit, and it can be glimpsed in particular by the presence of an aliasing that dirty the image and by a definition that does not seem to reach the 720p standard. Even the models of the characters and the animations (in particular those of the blows delivered with bare hands) do not shine for their realization, while the game environments in their simple austerity sometimes also offer interactive elements such as destructible vases or columns or the possibility to blow up virtually every automobile encountered; certainly this interactivity is mostly accessory and not functional to the gameplay, but at least it gives a touch of personality to the action. More appreciable, however, is the variety of settings that are encountered during the entire campaign, from forests to abandoned landscapes of the old west passing through the suburbs and nightclubs of a Los Angeles that is anything but friendly. The soundtrack is without infamy and without praise even if in the moments of greatest reference to the western imaginary the lack of a quality main theme is felt (and in those cases one cannot but think of the genius Morricone). Call of Juarez: the Cartel also offers a competitive multiplayer component where it is possible to choose which faction to choose between cops or criminals; here the limits of the not too refined mechanics for competitive play become decidedly heavier and also the game maps obtained from portions of the campaign levels are small and uninspired, which makes this component of the package absolutely forgettable given in particular the centrality of the countryside.", "date": "2011-08-04", "grade": "6.4"}
