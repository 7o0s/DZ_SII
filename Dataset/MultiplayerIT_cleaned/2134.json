{"name": "Mondiali FIFA 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mondiali-fifa-2002.html", "text": "Questions of habit When I get hold of an EA title by now I'm used to not getting too excited in the hope of being faced with a completely new, improved product that has left behind many defects that had plagued past editions. In fact, there is always hope, but it fades as the game progresses. The 2002 FIFA World Cup Start Menu consists of only four options: Friendly, 2002 FIFA World Cup, Options, and Bonus Materials. As you may have guessed, the fulcrum of the game is the FIFA 2002 World Cup mode where you can choose one of the different national teams in the selection menu and lead your squad of 23 players to final victory. First you will have to face the elimination round. By finishing first in your group you will be sure of having gained access to the final stage of the competition. The gameplay of FIFA World Cup 2002 does not differ much from that seen in the other previous episodes. The keys for player movement as well as those for crossing, running and shooting are unchanged as are the keys on the shoulder of the pad for special movements such as double step or change of direction. Each action you perform will depend on the time you spend pressing the corresponding key. A meter consisting of a light bar will appear every time you make a cross, shot or pass. The longer you keep pressing the button, the more the level of the bar will color and the result will be more strength to the command you are using. In any case, the variety of movements is truly vast: you can make special plays, class plays and dribbles or defend the ball with your body to avoid letting it blow you away. The strongest players are marked with an asterisk which signals their presence on the playing field: these players are much faster, more dynamic and have a more powerful and accurate shot than normal players. Unfortunately the gameplay is extremely simple and you will be able to score goals by running with the same player from one side of the field to the other. All the colors of the world! Even if the gameplay leaves something to be desired from the point of view of the ease with which you will defeat your opponents, however the graphics sector seems to be the best department overall for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. First of all, there are all the stadiums that will host the 2002 World Cup, both Korean and Japanese . The presentation of the matches is very suggestive: with the spotlights off, colored lasers will give life to figures that will move on the field at the entrance of the two teams. The players are made with faces very similar to those of their real-life counterparts even if their movements on the field are not always faithfully reproduced. When you score the first goal of each game you will see a special animation and a special way to celebrate it. The replays are well done and capture the action from every camera angle. The most spectacular thing is certainly the crowd that fills the stadiums. If you play with Brazil, you will not fail to notice the glittering yellow gold that covers the stands and blends with the colors of the national team you play against. This visual effect is well suited to the party atmosphere that reigns during the match and furthermore the cheering is also supported by a good sound composed of stadium chants and rowdy screams of the fans who rejoice for a goal or protest for a bad foul committed against one of their favorites. When you see a yellow card or expulsion regardless of the good workmanship of the animation you will notice a particular effect never seen before in a football game. In practice, the drama of the event will be fueled by background music worthy of a thriller that will follow one another while the referee will approach to commission the penalty to the player guilty of the foul. Finally, the soundtrack is very catchy and was composed and produced by the talented Bob Buckley and created by the Symphony Orchestra. Waiting for June...
