Vince Zampella managed to prove it to himself and to the world with Titanfall, his first chance for redemption after having ended up from stars to rags, in the blink of an eye, passing through the back door, like a thief, forced to abandon daringly the software and the saga of records that gave birth to it. A great demonstration of creative vitality for his Respawn Entertainment, because even if the imprinting, the starting point, is the unmistakable one of Call of Duty, the new development team set up by the founder of Infinity Ward has been able to build a multiplayer experience that has plunged into a landscape in which everything seemed to have been said by now with a great little talk to do. An FPS that, if you really can't help but look at the world through the lens of comparisons, represents an ideological alternative to Battlefield, the ~field~ modes of Halo or Section 8 more than Call of Duty: the true essence of Titanfall is in fact already all in its name, in the descent of those mechs through which an extremely personal vision of the battlefields is created, which revises the usual infantry-vehicle logic through a pilot-robot dualism characterized by a series of interdependence relationships or hostility, a dynamism and the adoption of totally fresh ways of thinking about the clash. Perfect center? Not really, given that if the formula was missing, they were a bit of mass and finishing capable of making the blow dealt more effective. We are referring to the far from abundant amount of weapons, accessories, specialties and other material with which to customize pilots and titans, and therefore experiment with different game setups, for the benefit of maintaining interest in the medium / long term, and a nice slew of contour features that in a multiplayer are assumed to have been acquired for eons, some of which are already present in the CoD signed by Zampella, and therefore even more culpably missing. Our verdict on Titanfall's first DLC, Expedition, and what's new in Update 3 Three new frontiers Correcting the running shot in a multiplayer title is complicated, because if you choose to insert new modes and other content via DLC, such as new entries in the arsenal, there is always the risk of fragmenting the community or creating the perception, founded or less, that the game is tipping towards pay to win. For Titanfall's first paid add-on, Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Arts have therefore opted not to expand or revise the basic formula, preferring to expand the experience through a more conservative path, that of the classic map pack. Three arenas added by Expedition - Swamps, Confrontation and War Games - sold at a ~price per map~ in line with what is now the standard imposed by... Call of Duty (yes, it's a spiral of risky references Fission Mailed). If Titanfall was already a title that pressed on vertical gameplay, Paludi pushes the concept further: the dense bush that surrounds the marshes that give the map its name allows the pilots to move at different heights from the ground, from tree to tree, while at an enormous collapsed trunk stands out in the centre, which if covered in its entirety allows you to reach the highest point of the arena and take a real bath of vertigo. Galvanizing to play even aboard the titans, due to the extremely jagged and irregular morphology of the terrain, made up of paths, bifurcations, gorges, hills and clearings of various sizes, Swamps offers the cybernetic giants a multitude of ideas for managing shelters, ambushes, pursuits and airy vis  vis comparisons, and therefore potentially it is an excellently structured map, but in practice it does not prove to be suitable for every modality. The games at Attrition and Cacciatore di Piloti, in fact, often run the risk of getting bogged down, becoming long and tedious, due to the numerous refuges scattered throughout the territory, among which the central maze of ruins often chosen as a preferential ambush point stands out for many players with a passive attitude. Things go better when there is a goal at stake and the participants are therefore basically encouraged to discover themselves in order to obtain it. Comparison is certainly the most anonymous on a visual level, given that it takes up the typical industrial setting seen several times in the base game, already quite generic of its own, whose appeal is further diminished by the artistic choices of Respawn, which do not cover properly, as instead in other cases, the somewhat modest characteristics of the graphics engine, tending to offer the most ungainly graphic impact. Be careful, however, to underestimate it, since it is a solid and ve arenavery well designed. The idea that characterizes it is the ~stratified~ structure, which once again praises verticality: under the warehouses, bridges, bases and other installations that form the main complex there is a whole other floor, wet for the most part from the water, which brings to the depths of the matches a series of channels, gradients, ramps and connecting routes to the upper area through which an endless number of approaches can come to life. The only contraindication Survival Titan, where perhaps thanks to the positioning of the spawns of the two teams, the matches tend to turn rather quickly into botched royal rumbles, in which it can also often happen to find yourself outnumbered already after a few moments landing in match. Giochi di Guerra is instead a real jewel both from an aesthetic-conceptual point of view and from a planimetric and playful one. The map assumes that you move within the same simulation that is the background of the Training and therefore welcomes you with a different sequence from the usual launch from the shuttle. On a scenographic level, the arena is dominated by aseptic surfaces, cloaked in an elegant lacquered white that the Source renders very well since the times of Portal, with some borrowings from Tron and Deus Ex: Human Revolution to enrich a cyber-futurist base which in some areas blur with a ~pixelation effect~ in glimpses of a realistic mold, as if you were inside a short-circuited Matrix. The assumption on which the map is based is finally completed with the killings of pilots and titans, who instead of collapsing and falling apart dematerialize (an assist provided by the typical ~no blood~ plug-ins that have always been running on the servers of various PC titles ). Structurally, Giochi di Guerra is a classic urban scenario for medium and short-range clashes between buildings, streets, squares and alleys, which recalls with all due proportions that masterpiece by Carentan, the map of the first two Call of Duty later revived in Modern Warfare as Chinatown. On an already extremely valid and playable starting point, up to the best things that several of the Respawn guys made when they were in an office with ~Infinity Ward~ written outside, the Titanfall quid is then grafted through a series of long suspended corridors within which it is possible to embark on exciting wallrun rides second only to those of Ascent, giving the navigability of the map and the consequent adoptable approaches an energetic burst of speed, dynamism and flexibility. Textbook. The long road to maturity Simultaneously with the launch of Expedition, Update 3 of the game was also released, a patch which, in addition to a long list of balances, which will surely be the subject of heated discussions in the coming weeks, as happens in any multiplayer FPS (by the way: from these parts we are in favor of not carrying the flag with titans in CTF), it puts a welcome patch on a couple more fronts. The first is that of completeness: although still in beta, the possibility of customizing the match variables from top to bottom has been introduced in private matches (from respawn times to titan construction times, from the type of AI to be deployed on the field to its lethality, and much more). The five customizable classes are joined by two more to be developed with reference to each of the game modes. Read: now it is possible to choose between seven custom classes of pilots and titans, which among other things can finally also be renamed to manage them with greater ease. Experience points are now actually earned at the end of the game, without having to wait for the return to the lobby, while the scoreboard also appears in the post-match report and it is easier to deactivate the voice of any harassing players. Filters have been introduced for the cloud of Challenges contemplated by the game, bringing their consultation to almost normal levels. These are welcome additions compared to the rather immature state in which the game was launched in terms of completeness and comfort of the online infrastructure, but there is still a long way to go, given that it is still missing the ability to vote on maps, an essential feature that has been taken for granted in lobby-based multiplayer for years. In the same way, there is still a long way to go from a technical point of view: in addition to streamlining navigation through the menus, still extremely slow, and optimizing performance, which continues to be incongruous compared to what is put on video, today the problem of synchrony is more topical than ever. The gameror it continues to misbehave on that front, with V-Sync stubbornly limiting the frame rate to the monitor's refresh rate even when disabled. Which with the arrival of Update 3 is finally no longer a problem for those who have a panel capable of pushing values above 60Hz: owners of 120 and 144Hz monitors will be happy to know that they can now enjoy the fluidity and responsiveness of the commands that was legitimate to expect. But this becomes a problem for others: it took the community very little to discover that the logic of the game is linked to the frame-rate. In other words, the more the engine grinds frames per second, the faster gameplay elements such as reload times, Smart Pistol lock-on and weapon bursts go, offering an undue advantage to those who can go beyond 60 frames per second. A sensational mistake, bordering on incompetence, which threatens to create profound discontent and abandonment. In short, try again Vince and please do it ASAP.", "date": "2014-05-16", "grade": null}
