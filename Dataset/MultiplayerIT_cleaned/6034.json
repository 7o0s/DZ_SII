{"name": "SBK 22", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sbk-22-recensione.html", "text": "Annual sports titles have the inevitable defect of proposing few novelties, spread over several editions, and are therefore unable to concretely renew the experience from time to time, except for aspects such as statistics, athletes, teams and so on. . The introduction of new modes is greeted with enthusiasm inversely proportional to the frequency with which this happens. In the case of SBK 22, however, the scenario is different and somewhat bizarre. In fact, we are talking about a series that returns after ten years of absence, and that Milestone wanted to take back with the intention of adapting it to the current standards of its driving games, in particular the recent MotoGP 22. The result is a product that is unique in its own way, to the extent that it seems impossible to compare it with previous editions. Equipped with a clearly recognizable beating heart and now characteristic of the Italian team, but at the same time devoid of acute notes, listless in structure and visually only discreet. We will tell you the rest in the review of SBK 22. Structure: nothing new under the sun SBK 22, a race in Career mode The SBK 22 start screen gives you access to a total of six modes, all quite traditional, and the inevitable editor. There are quick stipulations, in this case the Round (i.e. the race weekend), the Championship and the Time Trial, a competitive multiplayer for up to twelve players, a tutorial to get familiar with the driving model and of course the Career . It is the latter that constitutes the core of the experience, but structurally the developers have not invented anything new: it is possible to create a rider and create a team from scratch or sign a contract with an official team of the 2022 WorldSBK championship, looking for to satisfy their requests in terms of performance and placements in the hope of gaining sufficient prestige to find a better placement, possibly even during the current season. The managerial aspect of the Career takes the form of the possibility of freely managing the staff, therefore hiring new technicians and replacing the ones we have, trying to pay attention to the budget, and use the characteristics of each member of the stable in order to develop technologies useful for improving the motorbike in terms of engine, chassis and electronics: a fundamental element to remain competitive. Before going out on the track it is possible to make the last adjustments, again by operating manually or relying on the engineer, who will automatically modify the set-up on the basis of the our needs. In any case, those who want to speed up operations as much as possible should know that during each event qualifying can be skipped, but it is necessary to try at least three races: the Tissot Superpole Race, Race 1 and Race 2. Gameplay: winning team does not change SBK 22, the starting grid Let's go back to the initial speech: it is clear and evident that it is impossible to compare the gameplay of SBK 22 with that of the old SBK Generations released in 2012, and in the same way we can take it for granted that Milestone has treasured the experience gained over the course of these ten years to make his riding model more solid and consistent. However, a comparison must be made and that is with the aforementioned MotoGP 22 (here is the review), given the many similarities in terms of bike management, riding aids that it is possible to activate and, in general, the philosophy behind the game; which is also in this case distinctly simulative, ruthless to the point of not forgiving even the slightest mistake, spoiled by an unhealthy relationship with the rewind function, which is used every time to remedy a mess, giving life to an annoying sequence of tests and mistakes. SBK 22, an exciting chase We were talking about the beating heart of SBK 22, which is there and beats strongly: you feel it when you face the straights with a knife between your teeth, looking for the trail and the cue needed to ring in that last overtaking before the finish line; or when you close a curve at the limit, in the hope that the bike doesn't end up on a slippery curb just as you're opening the gas. It takes a lot of effort on the track, and when we manage to make sure that our efforts are rewarded, there is a lot of satisfaction. The model is adjustable, with three main presets and the ability to customize the assistances in order to obtain a compromise that it is comfortable for us, increasing or decreasing at the same time the aggressiveness of the adversaries, but the braking offers few discounts and it takes a while before using it well. Fortunately, the developers have decided not to be too taxing on the impacts, and so you can go to Godere a certain margin of tolerance when touching other bikes, without immediately crashing. Technical realization: an average racer SBK 22, our rider rejoices after a positive result The parallels with MotoGP 22 are also evident from a technical point of view. The graphics of SBK 22 move at 60 fps on PS5, without uncertainties but at the same time without offering the visual impact on which the most famous productions can count. There is obviously no dynamic weather and the lighting system appears only discreet, as well as the effects applied to the surfaces. There are numerous assets reused by the other Milestone racers, for example the animations in the pits and in the closed park in case of victory, but there are also several glitches that highlight a perhaps not too careful finishing phase. The sound sector is essential, devoid of commentary or musical accompaniments of depth: it is only the motorcycles that speak for themselves, but for enthusiasts this should be enough.", "date": "2022-09-15", "grade": "7.5"}
