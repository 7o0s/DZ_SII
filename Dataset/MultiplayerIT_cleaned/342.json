{"name": "Miami Vice: The Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/miami-vice-the-game.html", "text": "The streets of Miami The context on which Miami Vice: The Game develops is quite common for a detective story: Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs are a pair of policemen engaged in the eternal fight against crime, drug lords and terror of Miami, ranging from classic genre settings such as imperial-sized villas, large warehouses and garages in the middle of the night. The game is configured as the classic third-person shooter that exploits - the now widely cleared - camera a la Resident Evil 4, or three-quarters just above the shoulder of the protagonist. While the choice of one or the other of the two protagonists will not bring any particular benefit, it will be the player himself who will modify the characteristics of his virtual alter-ego by altering the reputation and defense parameters; trying to be clearer about it, it must be said that at the end of each mission the player will receive an evaluation based on some data such as wasted shots, those hit and the weapons used, based on these values he will be assigned to the player a certain amount of ~reputation~ which is then useful during the game to go and make contact with the drug dealers in the area. Continuing through the various levels, the two policemen will find themselves recovering parcels of drugs to be used later at the end of each mission as exchange material for information regarding subsequent missions (the position of the enemies, deactivation of the cameras, ...) or more simply to earn money to buy new weapons or new clothes. The transition from one mission to another takes place within a kind of stylized map of the city of Miami, where the player will have the opportunity to meet with drug dealers to sell the drugs found during the mission, or to buy and sell information. weapons and clothes. It is in this particular phase of the game that the gamer will be able to modify his defense or reputation points, going to buy particular clothes capable of modifying the characteristics of his character: the more defense points he will have, the easier it will be to complete the missions and the less reputation points will be received at the end of each level, as reputation increases, the ease of negotiating with drug barons (characters to whom you sell large quantities of drugs) will increase, but will leave resistance to enemy fire unchanged. Hell and mini-games in South Beach One of the most interesting novelties regarding Miami Vice: The Game is represented by the use of a whole series of mini-games (or small applications) which become part of the action itself; in addition to the aforementioned strategic management of the flow of drugs recovered in the missions and of one's reputation, during the levels it will be possible to find some special objects called FlashRAMs, which represent real memory cards to be decrypted thanks to a strange game similar in part to asteroids, and which will give access to a variety of weapon bonuses. Although the ideas behind the game seem to be able to put the final product on the list of ~good games~, a whole series of defects, inaccuracies and lightness inevitably downgrade it to a product -unfortunately- barely sufficient. First of all longevity: the adventure is damned short, it is possible to finish it (not by completing all the objectives but by doing the right thing) in three hours or a little less; the artificial intelligence of the enemies does not shine, leading the poor gangsters to continuously expose themselves to the fire of their character, and moreover the enemy is only sometimes affected by the blow inflicted in a vital area (in some cases the single blow to the head is mortal, in others -mysteriously- not); the graphic sector suffers from the technical limits of PSP 3D (partly inherited from psx itself) with invisible walls, treacherous angles that mortally interlock Crockett and Tubbs and a whole series of textures that are sometimes decidedly uninspired. The game is afflicted by a whole series of problems that directly affect the gaming experience, defects almost certainly resulting from a delay in development. Hell and mini-games in South Beach However, the cameras weigh the most on the game, often bugged in the cover phase (when the character is behind an object for cover) forcing the player to move and find a new point from which to shoot at enemies. The picture of defects is completed by one of the worst audio sectors of recent years: although at times the music can be considered inspired and ~on point~ (referring to the Miami Vice series), the audio files of the enemies are nothing short of scandalous in their incessant , monotonous and annoying repeateditivity. Miami Vice: The Game is a good attempt and little more. Apart from some interesting gimmicks and an at times amusing action, the game is afflicted by a whole series of problems that directly affect the gaming experience, defects almost certainly resulting from a delay in development (the catch of having to develop a game based on a movie being released in theaters is that no delays or extra months are allowed to fix the flaws). However, the control system saves itself without exception: the game was born and raised around the PSP commands and adapts perfectly to them. Pros: Interesting reputation management Mini-games blend well with the rest of the game Great control system Cons: Enemy AI has room for improvement Camera is frustrating Voice acting is unlistenable and annoying The luck of being able to develop starting from an already known concept is certainly that of being able to concentrate more on all those aspects that are often ignored or abandoned in video games due to lack of time: innovations on the genre. And this is the possibility granted to the Rebellion, fathers of the surprising Rogue Troopers and From Russia with Love, when they were contacted to develop the video game inspired by the brand new Miami Vice film, a revised, renewed and on the big screen version of the 80s serial conceived by Michael Mann. Will the developers succeed in the arduous task of faithfully following the path indicated by the film and at the same time not falling into the trap of playing the insipid clone of many other clones? The answer is a little more complex than a simple yes or no, to find out all that remains is to continue reading.", "date": "2006-10-11", "grade": null}
