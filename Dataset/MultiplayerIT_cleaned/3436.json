The light that illuminates part of the room comes from inside a four-door bookcase: behind the glass doors, around a hundred High Grade, Real Grade and Master Grade are preparing to welcome another Gunpla into their ranks. In short, you will understand that the new Bandai Namco Entertainment licensed title did not end up in a random PlayStation 4, but in that of a rather passionate fan who launched the game with a certain enthusiasm. Are we really in the presence of the definitive Gundam game? Gundam versus Gundam The Gundam multiverse is made up of so many different series that it is now impossible to precisely define the nature of this Mobile Suit that Yoshiyuki Tomino invented forty years ago. Developing Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2, Bandai Namco Entertainment was mainly inspired by the atmospheres of the first animated series, setting aside angel feathers, Psycho Frame, G-Drive, neural connections and so on. The lean and dry style of the game follows a credible realism especially with regard to the Mobile Suits: slow, heavy, oversized. They are the best part of a game that, visually, seems to have come out of a PlayStation 3. The models are carefully crafted and faithfully reproduce the features admired on the small screen. The level of detail is impressive, in this sense, and reaching a certain rank it is possible to customize them significantly, changing colors and adding small details. Bandai Namco has drawn on the boundless Gundam catalog to deploy an inventory that includes not only the Mobile Suit of the same name, but also the lesser-known mechas that we have seen piloting enemies and supporting actors. The Gundams are there, of course, but they hide in the prize boxes that we can buy with real money or exchange for a special currency that Bandai Namco gives out with a dropper every time you connect to the servers or complete some daily objectives. Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 is a free to play title that discounts this advantageous nature in the most banal way possible: through the lootboxes. The microtransactions are not particularly invasive, and it is possible to play each content without spending a cent, but this translates into a slow and exasperating grind of the experience points and currencies necessary to buy the individual mechs or the lootboxes in which, perhaps, if God want, we will be able to find some famous Gundam or maybe even just an enhanced version of our favorite Mobile Suit. In case you were wondering yes, you got it right: Battle Operation 2 is practically a giant-sized mobile gacha. Mobile Suits are essentially divided into three categories: Raid, Support and General. Each of them is more or less suited for a certain role in battle - for example, Support-type Mobile Suits are more suited to attacking with cover fire from the rear, being particularly vulnerable in close combat - so it makes sense to build the team in balanced way. The fights, in fact, deploy six players per team, and in this sense Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 gives its best when played in company, actively communicating and coordinating attacks. The experience literally changes from day to night, also because there is no single player mode or campaign with a real story, but only a competitive mode, ranked or not, in which to face the other human opponents who wander around us in the headquarters where you can socialize and spend the currencies earned in battle. On the ground, in the air and in space Maps and game modes change roughly every two hours, and this leads to two rather annoying problems. Beyond the obvious impossibility of always playing the maps we prefer, sometimes we will be precluded from deploying our favorite Mobile Suit since some can only be used on the ground or in space, while others are characterized by a numerical potential that could exceed the limit imposed on rotating maps. For this reason it is advisable to grow several Mobile Suits at the same time, enhancing them with the many accessories and the plethora of weapons that we can find in the lootboxes or buy selectively by spending the hard-earned virtual savings. Unfortunately it isall much less immediate than it seems. The small community and the questionable matchmaking dynamics force very long waits before a match begins. After the exhausting loads and queues, we finally find ourselves playing on a battlefield that can be land, air or hybrid. The control system is rather cumbersome and requires some practice, however it is important to underline that its heaviness, in a certain sense, reflects that of the Mobile Suits. Unfortunately, this is a distinctive feature that only hardcore Gundam fans will probably appreciate, those who may be able to identify themselves better and observe the game dynamics from a more accommodating perspective. To all the others, however, it will seem like an unresponsive and even less intuitive control system. It must be said that Bandai Namco has not made a particular effort, especially with regards to the feedback from the weapons, which is practically non-existent. Each Mobile Suit can equip up to four different weapons based on the category it belongs to, meaning that only some mechs can wield sniper rifles or missile launchers, while only one category of Mobile Suits can strike repeatedly with Beam Sabers. The reload times of weapons - including lightsabers - are much longer than usual, which is why it is better to change weapons while waiting for the previous one to reload: a ploy which, in the heat of the action, can be much less automatic than how much you look. In general, the game does not give a vivid sensation of impact when landing a hit from a distance or at close quarters. Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 isn't exactly a shooter, but even as a third-person action title it lacks something that makes the battles more engaging and visceral. The experience wants to be above all strategic, with a series of interesting mechanics that unfortunately don't always work as they should. Generally, the team that earns the most points at the end of the game wins, by defeating the opposing Mobile Suits or conquering the respawn points on the map. Players aren't confined to their mechs: they can actually leave the cockpit and slowly soar around the map in their jet backpacks, perhaps to repair their own mech with the appropriate equipment. Mobile suits not only possess a generic vital indicator, but also a distinct condition for the head and legs that affect radar and movement, respectively. Pilots, on the other hand, can affect the fight in unexpected ways, capturing objectives, sabotaging respawn points, calling satellite fire and even stealing unattended opposing mechs. A well-coordinated strategy between Mobile Suit and foot pilots can be the difference between victory and defeat. Unfortunately, however, in the face of all these excellent ideas, Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 remains a title that is not very fun to play. The inconvenience and rigidity of the controls, however faithful to the sources they may be, certainly do not soften a learning curve which, during the first hours, can become unsustainable. The limited variety of maps, the uninspired design of the same and the overall mediocre quality of the graphics do not argue in favor of a simulation experience that only the most hardcore fans of Mobile Suit Gundam will be able to appreciate.", "date": "2019-10-11", "grade": "5.0"}
