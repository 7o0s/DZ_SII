{"name": "Deer Hunter 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deer-hunter-5.html", "text": "Hunting! Now we just have to choose the equipment: we will have different weapons available, from bow and crossbow up to the most modern sniper rifles. There is no shortage of pistols and shotguns, as well as different types of ammunition and various equipment, including sights, gps, decoys and smells to attract prey and more. Then we can choose the place (there are several game reserves and many have unpleasant surprises, such as mountain lions! Be careful if you meet one!), the time of year, the time of day and so on. The 3d engine is very fluid and functional. It is not a latest generation engine, but the environment is rendered well, and together with the natural noises, it completely immerses us in this bucolic atmosphere. If you really don't feel like hunting deer, take a walk among the trees. It is very relaxing! If, on the other hand, you want to try out your sniper rifle by now, follow my advice carefully. Deer generally move between two places that are always the same: the grazing area and the resting area. In the morning and at noon they will then go to graze and then return to the resting area in the afternoon. Then shortly before sunset they will return to graze, and then retire definitively to their ~lodgings~. While instead during the mating period the males will spend less time in the grazing areas to go looking for a female. Sometimes, attracted by the calls of hunters, they move away until they arrive in open areas, where a good hunter in position can shoot them from a distance with a sniper rifle. Deer have a great sense of smell. Indeed, when they sense danger approaching, they strike hard on the ground and some small glands secrete an ~unpleasant~ odor which keeps its companions away from the danger zone. So first of all a good hunter must mask his natural smell with specific smells used on these occasions (just a sprinkle every now and then!) and then use the typical calls. Of course, it would be even better to avoid the deer being downwind, or it will be able to detect you anyway. Furthermore, it is also important to choose a good stakeout area: trees, bushes and tall grass are right for us! Now that we've spotted our prey we just have to hope it gets closer. Running towards the deer as if we were playing quake is not exactly the attitude to have! We have to wait for the right moment, take aim and shoot. If you're lucky, you might knock your prey down on the first shot. Remember to collect it by clicking on it with your little hand, or you risk not having any scores or trophies for your feat A different title than usual It is possible to participate in a ~virtual hunting season~ and therefore hunt at different times of the year, always in the same reserve, and also see the evolution of the species over the years according to realistic genetic rules. In some periods it will not be possible to use rifles, but only bows or crossbows. And let's not forget that we can use different means to move around the reserve boats, vehicles of various types and even horses! This is a peculiarity of the game that certainly makes it something more than a simple ~deer hunt~. In fact, the hunter becomes prey and the hunter prey the moment you find yourself in front of a huge bear, a pack of wolves. You may even decide to hunt bears only, but be careful because they are not easily shot down. You will need the shotgun and large caliber ammo. There is no multiplayer mode. There are two modes: competitive and open. In the first case we will have to compete with other players. The winner is whoever gets the most points (the assignment of which depends on many factors, from the type of prey to the difficulty of hunting using certain weapons instead of others) in several rounds with variable time limits. While in the second case the hunt is ~open~, in the sense that we will be able to hunt with others in a cooperative way without worrying about anything except wandering around the woods with the others and bringing home some trophies. Deer Hunter 5 is definitely a real hunting simulator, detailed down to the smallest detail. Worth trying even if you are not passionate about this activity. Thumbs up! Introduction Honestly speaking, I'm not a fan of hunting. It is also a ~sport~ that is not practiced very much in Italy, as is the case in other parts of the world. But I have to say, trying to look at Deer Hunter 5 from the most objective point of view and without being swayed bymy personal beliefs about this activity I must say that it is a good simulation. Surely it is the most realistic and realistic deer hunting simulation I have ever seen. On country notes perfectly in line with the genre of the game we thus begin this adventure. Creating the hunter is very simple. Just give a name, choose the skin you want most and voila. We are ready for the hunt! Creating your alter ego is important for storing statistics, information on the currently simulated hunting season and above all, to always keep your trophy collection updated!", "date": "2002-06-13", "grade": null}
