The way these titles are used on devices that are essentially used for something else, together with the fundamental and in many respects unsolved (not to say unsolvable) question of an interface that can best adapt to each different type of game has forced us to concentrate on different concepts. Over time, these have developed strands and genres of their own by launching the mobile market towards its own independent path from that undertaken by standard gaming platforms, at least for a large part of current production. So then it's not surprising to think of a racing game that becomes a sort of rhythm game, with the car to be driven on winding tracks using simply the touch of a finger on the screen. It is an extremely simplified vision of the racing game, obviously, so much so that it hardly fits into the definition in question, yet in the specific context of the video game on these platforms it works wonders. In short, the evaluation of a mobile title must always be ~situated~, contextualized for use in the palm of the hand, because even a game that on paper may seem disarmingly banal, or the thickness of a sheet of paper as a design gameplay, it can prove to be an addictive pastime. The downside is that a title structured in this way can have a short life, and then the developers think of some solution that can lengthen the interest once the simple mechanics start to get stale, and in this perspective we must consider the constant progression system and lootboxes included in this Drift It! With 3 you can buy the content you love on the Google Play Store with phone credit For customers 3 who use an Android device, having games, apps, music and much more is even easier and more fun. On the Google Play Store, in fact, it is possible to obtain the contents by paying them with the residual credit of your SIM or through your postpaid telephone bill. To do this, simply choose ~Debit to account 3~ or ~Activate Billing 3~ as the payment method of your Google account. This configuration can also be made just before purchasing any content, by accessing the menu next to the price of the content you are about to purchase to change the payment method.

Time to derub Drift It! essentially transfers the concept of the endless runner in the context of a racing game, a solution to tell the truth already seen in other meanings but present here with its own rather peculiar form. The car runs undeterred following the pre-established path, all we have to do is touch the screen to start the drift and lift your finger to finish it, being very careful to perform these operations with the right timing. The drifting areas are in fact indicated by golden stripes on the track and the difficulty lies in starting the drift as close as possible to the beginning of the strip and concluding it as close as possible to the end of this, considering that an attack too early or in delayed release determine game over. It may not sound very attractive, but it will be due to the speed with which you run on the winding tracks, the graphic effects or the fever of the multipliers (which are activated by ringing drifts with optimal timing) but Drift It! it's really hard to let go. At the slightest mistake you start from scratch but the fact of being able to immediately return to the game triggers the classic mechanism of repeated attempts which can lead to even rather long sessions. The other basic element for the affection of this game is the fact that at the end of each mini-session experience points are obtained, which allow us to level up and open the famous lootboxes, present in industrial quantities. These provide random rewards between upgrades for the various components of the car or the car itself, distributed with different degrees of rarity. The lootboxes are distributed free of charge at each level-up but to speed up the progression it is also possible to purchase them through micro-transactions, just as happens in the cases that make users so angry on consoles, and which instead represent practically the norm in the mobile sector, with often quite aberrant results (but not in this case, fortunately). The presence of a nice head-to-head multiplayer also provides a further starting point to vary the action a little, which in fact risks becoming somewhatnto mince within a few days of intense session. The distribution model is the classic free-to-play one with micro-transactions and advertising, but the latter are so invasive and continuous as to make at least the in-app purchase essentially mandatory to eliminate them, which costs 2.49 euros.", "date": "2017-12-21", "grade": "7.0"}
