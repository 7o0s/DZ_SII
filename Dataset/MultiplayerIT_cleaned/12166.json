It is a concept now widely cleared, which however the new action RPG developed by the Chinese team Kuro Game is keen to reiterate. Halfway between NieR Automata and Honkai Impact 3rd, the game puts us in command of a group of fighters in charge of free the planet from the hordes of Corrupted that have invaded it, using spectacular combos and special maneuvers within the short but intense missions that make up the long campaign. History Punishing: Gray Raven, the first character that we will be able to control. There are many narrative references of Punishing: Gray Raven to the aforementioned NieR Automata: from the post-apocalyptic setting to the characters that we will have to control during the game, often female. Constructs, as they are called: individuals equipped with peculiar abilities and cybernetic implants capable, among other things, of deactivating their pain centers to transform themselves into real war machines. Each fighter boasts a narrative background that can be explored further or beautifully ignore, focusing rather on the live action. However, it would be a pity, because among the verbose dialogues of the interlude sequences there is more than one interesting cue; as well as on the enemy front, robots controlled by a sort of collective mind, a plague that responds to the name of The Punishing. Gameplay Punishing: Gray Raven, one of the campaign scenarios. In terms of gameplay, Punishing: Gray Raven is an immediate and fun action RPG, which does not give up the typical elements of the genre (see the numerical representation of the damage inflicted) and includes the inevitable gacha aspects that have long characterized most of these productions , but it's really a pleasure to play thanks also to a dry, precise and essential touch control system. In fact, it is enough to touch a single button to launch attacks, a second button to dodge (which, when performed perfectly, gives life to a special bullet time that amplifies the effectiveness of the blows), subject to cooldown and therefore not repeatable at any time. infinite, and a series of small icons that appear as we beat our opponents, allowing us to launch a whole series of spectacular special maneuvers, including a devastating finisher. Punishing: Gray Raven, some characters allow you to attack from a distance. You can compose a team and upgrade its members, switch from one to another at any time (again provided you wait for the end of a cooldown period) and take advantage of their characteristics to defeat different enemies, which also include large boss. The management of the dodge is not as precise as that seen in Honkai Impact 3rd, which was based on the now classic Bayonetta, but this simplification does not trivialize the experience. very short and without depth or complexity, which are completed quickly to embrace the concept of mobile gaming, but end up dissatisfying those looking for a certain type of consistency from a production of this kind, which would have been perfectly capable of offering it given its many qualities. Technical realization Then we come to the graphics, which can be adjusted from the options in order to bring the frame rate to 60 fps and improve the overall visual impact. On iPhone 12 Pro these settings are managed without problems and, above all, without overheating the device as often happens in these cases. The glance is also truly remarkable, thanks to the excellent use of cel shading and a rather inspired design. The scenarios inevitably pay the price, being re-proposed within the same paths and thus covering the heavy needs of a rather long campaign . From the point of view of numbers, however, the game picks up thanks to the many different enemies that we will be able to face, as well as the characters themselves that we will be able to unlock with the credits earned up to that point.", "date": "2021-07-28", "grade": "8.6"}
