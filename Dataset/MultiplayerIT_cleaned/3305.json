The question of the day is the following: how complex is it to involve parents who are no longer teenagers and make them feel part of a structured entertainment journey? As we opened the packet - inside a stylus light years ahead of those tested on DS and 3DS - we often asked ourselves, long gone from the casual gaming era but mindful of the crosses and delights of a strange phase of this industry. The answer is that it's complex, really: children of a daily passion we think that gaming is an activity for everyone, that it's easy to pick up a pad, control the action on the screen with coolness and coordination, that the most scripted are democratic, but none of this is true. Mom has her own small skill in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe but it ends there, so after a few tracks she looks at me and wants to go back to sudoku, addition, memory games and, only in those moments when she is exalted, speed games and reflections. Brain Training, today, is an excellent reminder of the times that were but, unlike the DS periods, it is more structured to remain and sink its roots in time, day after day, bringing in a high and even very tall demographic target, unaccustomed to spending time in front of a screen. Horizontal sensors Simple, intuitive, immediate: Nintendo has built the entry into the new world of Brain Training in the fastest and most painless way possible, rattling off Dr. Kawashima's notions and clarifying the new multiplayer soul of the software from the beginning. It remains the mainstay of daily training, made up of random exercise tests and targeted training, but this time Nintendo implements a party-game factor in its multi-million dollar franchise. We want to start from here because the Quick Training, playable in landscape mode, best embodies the most divisive aspect of this Brain Training: the use of the IR sensor. Owning a ~Fat~ Switch, the possibility of detaching the Joy-Con and exploiting the IR of the right hand gives new emotions in Kawashima sauce: Chinese Morra, Digital Calculation and Digital Training are a sort of tutorial, while Bird Counter, Flag Raiser and Cube Counter are the actual minigames of challenge with a friend. Fun and functional, what is proposed convinces in the short and medium, keeping the bar of interest at a good level in returning to pick up the console to challenge someone to play with their fingers in front of the infrared sensor or count quickly by pressing the triggers of the Joy-Cons. What clashes, however, is the impossibility of playing properly on Nintendo Switch Lite: the impossibility of detaching the Joy-Con forces a greater weight in vertical gaming, while the absence of IR inevitably cuts out some mini-games. A sin of gluttony, of course, since the development will certainly have started before the conception of the Lite version, but also a paradox, since Brain Training is one of those completely portable products. We are sure Nintendo, before releasing the title, asked itself this question countless times and is living very well with the answers since the core of the experience remains daily training, perfectly manageable on both models, and a different market today than to the explosion of casual products 15 years ago, therefore also more informed and ready for any technological cuts than a Lite version. Apart from this, the party cut gives that touch of novelty to a well-established set of expectations, providing some additional element to bring in, precisely, the mother and make her play Chinese paper or hand-eye coordination exercises. Little is not. I subtract, you add, he remembers Training the brain with Brain Training is a well-known operation: Kawashima came many years ago to tell us that our brain mass was almost beyond the point of no return, therefore today as then the curiosity to find out how much we have aged is there. Thanks also to a more inviting price than the average, Brain Training by Dr. Kawashima provides, in the middle of the Switch's life cycle, that casual mood taken up by Ring Fit Adventure and rightly carried forward for completeness of offer. Although no longer aura of novelty or virality, the software remains a valid example of Nintendian craftsmanship: coherent, precise, studied in detail, engaging and rewarding, Brain Training is today a more mature experience, no longer new but more aware and capable to declare herself without overdoing it, simply doing what she would haveand always wanted to do: support daily use, keeping the brain trained through play. Its mini-games, gradually unlocked, are mixes of familiar and new activities, a fusion of math, logic and memory that picks up on old habits - no tutorials teaching how to write the digits, sometimes resulting in frustration in the software not receiving that that we wanted to write - and projects them into a title that responds to those needs, in full expression of its heritage. There are 13 mini-games available for training, including Sudoku, an evergreen that everyone likes a little, even those around who didn't know Brain Training existed but who magically find themselves picking up the stylus and writing numbers. Up to now, after a few days of use, we enjoyed pulling the plug for a moment from more demanding products, lying down even more on the sofa, taking Switch vertically and doing a bit of testing, aided by an aura of nostalgia and the desire to remembering what it meant, many years ago, to carry the Nintendo DS around to let people try brain training software who even less than today knew consoles or video games. In short, casual gaming, the humble one, which does not have microtransactions but which, with a well-finished showcase and good content, manages to take those who really don't know this world by the hand. The endowment is completed by the inclusion of a future online competitive mode, an interesting addition but currently awaiting a dedicated update.", "date": "2020-01-04", "grade": "S.V."}
