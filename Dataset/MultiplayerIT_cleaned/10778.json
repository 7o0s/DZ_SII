{"name": "AWAY: The Survival Series", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/away-the-survival-series-recensione.html", "text": "In the video game industry it often happens that the dynamics imposed by the market become yokes that creatives are no longer able to submit to. The examples are numerous and Breaking Walls is added to the long list of software houses founded by a small number of programmers. Behind this project we find the three co-founders Nathanal Dufour, Laurent Bernier and Sebastien Nadeau, people who for one reason or another worked on the Far Cry, Assassin's Creed and Prince Of Persia series. Series deals with their first work, successfully funded on Kickstarter, where it raised 135,000 of the pre-established Canadian dollars 60,000 and above all convinced the publisher Game Seer to inject one and a half million US dollars into this ambitious project. AWAY begins by introducing a baby sugar glider (otherwise known as a flying squirrel) as he returns to his den after a hike with his father. A tremendous gust of wind destroys the alcove and takes away the adult male, leaving the female and the two cubs to grapple with the tough game of survival. What in the first few minutes would appear to be an interactive documentary on the life of the delicious flying animals, also thanks to the voice-over commenting on their every movement, soon takes on more playful and less realistic contours. In fact, the world had profoundly changed about twenty years earlier, due to an unspecified event that made the ecosystem even more inhospitable, erasing all human forms. But the heart, especially the small one of sugar gliders, continues to beat strongly, proving that life always wins. The one chosen by the developers is a sort of middle ground between the two styles and, in all honesty, we would have preferred a story more close to reality, also in relation to the Discovery Channel documentary cut. More platformer than survival One of the hardest sequences in the game While AWAY may at first glance seem like a copy of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, in practice it's a very different experience. In fact, it could be categorized as an extremely guided platform game: the survival derivation that has accompanied it since its presentation, which took place over two years ago, is barely sketched and consists of feeding the squirrel with a few berries. In addition to jumping from one trunk to another, taking advantage of its incredible elevation capacity and peculiar glide, the petaurino will have to deal with nature's pitfalls, hiding in the foliage to escape predators such as eagles and foxes, or facing openly snakes and scorpions. Fortunately, there is the sixth sense which, once activated, allows you to highlight the dangerous areas of the level. There would also be some side missions that will turn out to be just sketchy (nothing to do with an open world environment), as well as skills that are unlocked simply by performing elementary actions such as running or fighting, but do not appreciably change the behavior of the player. 'animal. Probably in the initial projects of Breaking Walls there was a greater layering that has been abandoned in favor of a more linear structure. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but certain ideas shouldn't have been left on a dead end, but rather completely removed. The biggest problem with AWAY, however, is to be found elsewhere, and in this case in the control system, confusing to the limits of acceptable. Our glider, in fact, often gets stuck in the branches or under the rocks, or goes about its own business during gliding. Not to mention the fighting phase made unmanageable by the lack of the command that blocks the view on the selected enemy. Thus, situations bordering on frustration are created: pressing a key with a moment's delay can force you to repeat entire sections of the game. Unfortunately, there are other even more serious bugs, mostly related to the commands (it may happen that the squirrel stops attacking), or to the activation of certain events (for example we managed to proceed in the level by not respecting the instructions imposed by the game). Soft tail Clash of the titans At times, AWAY's graphics are truly noteworthy, especially considering the small size of the development team. Merit of the high level of detail of the protagonist, with a mention for the tail hair, very realistic. The proximity of the shot means that the eye falls above all in that area, and in the landscape on the horizon which can give some truly breathtaking views, especially at the beginning of the adventure. However, focusing also on the surrounding fauna, one realizes that the medes has not been dedicated to all animalsima realization care, especially to secondary ones such as lizards and spiders. The animations would also have needed some refinement work because, especially during jumps, they are jerky and unnatural. The sugar glider moves within an earthly paradise minimally conditioned by the catastrophic events mentioned by the narrator. Sure, here and there you'll find grass-covered helicopter wrecks, or some ~out of place~ whale skeletons, but overall, it's hard to believe that the world of AWAY is the result of a global catastrophe.Overall, however, the result obtained with the Unreal Engine is very valid even if you pay dearly in terms of hardware resources. At maximum quality, at Ultra HD resolution, our reference system stopped just above 40 frames per second and in this case there aren't even the magical supersampling technologies to relieve the load on the video card. On less vitamin-rich systems expect slowdowns if you are not willing to come to terms with the graphics settings. A herd of deer bursts into Away The soundtrack, created by Mike Raznik, makes its presence felt positively especially in the final and most lively part of the game. Up to that moment the headphones are filled by the narrative voice (in English only) which respects the canons of the Discovery Channel-style science communicator, therefore it is good. The subtitles are bad, not so much for the quality of the translation (even if there are some terms left in the original language), but because they are often not synchronized with the speech and some sentences are completely missing. To complete the story it takes just over six hours, to which a handful is added for the exploration mode, which is not very interesting.", "date": "2021-10-02", "grade": "5.0"}
