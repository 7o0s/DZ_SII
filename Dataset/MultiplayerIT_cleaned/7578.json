Therefore it is with great curiosity that we are going to this review of Badland Party, a new game that brings back the brand with a new chapter capable of introducing some interesting innovations such as multiplayer. The mechanics of the game are basically what we have seen already in Badland and in Badland 2 with some marginal additions, but that's not a problem: it's a game mechanism that always works well and even a simple proposal of new levels and new situations is enough to make it interesting. On the other hand, a Badland could not be missing from the Apple Arcade collection, a development environment in which the Frogmind creature finds its place perfectly, given the attention dedicated to original projects and the care taken in the creation of the games offered by the subscription service Apple. The title does not mislead: although that ~Party~ may suggest a lightening of the typical mechanics towards a hit and run multiplayer approach, in the style of mini-game collection, we are not at all faced with such a situation. This new chapter is to all intents and purposes a continuation of the experiences seen previously, with the possibility of also experimenting with a form of multiplayer that does not essentially change the basic gameplay, but still provides an original reinterpretation of it. Also in this case we find ourselves moving a funny winged creature along intricate paths, trying to make it flutter without running into deadly traps and following the movement of the screen, with some variations that work well to refresh the classic dynamics a little, but without distorting it and proposing itself as a simple more of the same enriched. On the other hand, this is quite precisely what we want, from a new Badland. Classic gameplay with some variation Badland Party, a screenshot of the game The gameplay is always the same: it is a matter of making ~Clony~, the bizarre protagonist, fly around, trying to go through the intricate levels without running into the various deadly traps scattered around, making him reach the end of the path and possibly saving the greatest number of clones scattered along the way. A touch on the screen makes the protagonist perform a brief flutter, but you have to try to dose the touches precisely in order to maintain the best flow of movement, find the right trajectories so as not to hit obstacles and possibly make the creature bounce or roll following the various elements of the scenario. The characteristics and movement of the Clony are modified by activating some machinery and implementing transformations, which contributes to substantially vary the game action, as well as the possibility of obtaining copies of the protagonist by collecting special power-ups, with the aim to get as many clones as possible to their destination. Multiplayer Badland Party, various players have Clony with different appearance As mentioned, the basic structure takes up precisely the one seen in Badland and Badland 2, but there are some variations applied in this new chapter, first of all the presence of multiplayer. In Badland Party it is possible to take part in the Campaign together with other players, in online multiplayer, locally or even using the same device, which for the occasion features different interaction areas each dedicated to a different player. The structure of the levels does not change, but in these cases some different dynamics are applied which require a certain collaboration between the players or a competition to see who reaches the finish line first, with a system of bonuses and malus linked to the ability to remain within the same screen or not. In principle, the introduction of multiplayer does not bring a significant evolution to the gameplay, which is still based on the characteristics gained in the previous chapters, but it can represent an interesting variation for those who have played other games. Also the fact of necessarily having to rely on a friends list, in the absence of an option for ~quick play~ online, severely limits this game option. Additions or Evolutions? Badland Party, picture of a tangled situation Another nice addition is the possibility of unlocking new characters, which allows for a certain degree of customization by changing the appearance of the Clony, even if the issue remains rather marginal. Generally speaking, the new additions aren't exactly a huge evolution of the original concept, but that's not truenecessarily presents a problem: the Campaign, which can be played easily in single player (occasionally with the support of artificial intelligence, or with the possibility of alternating between different characters in real time), is above all a continuation of what we have seen in the previous chapters . However, it is able to propose several new situations on the original structure: boss fights, different situations and a good dose of new levels (about 40), all elements that are enough and more to make it a very interesting game. notable improvement is the technical one: Frogmind has clearly worked to rejuvenate the look of the game, while keeping its particular style intact and all focused on the contrasts between lights and shadows. The result is a graphic that recalls the typical atmosphere of the series but which is also more accurate and elaborate, especially as regards the richness of the scenarios and the animations. It also makes the game a bit heavier to handle on less advanced devices, but it's really nice to look at.", "date": "2022-05-12", "grade": "8.3"}
