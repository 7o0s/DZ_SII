{"name": "Super Runabout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-runabout.html", "text": "The Fiat 500.... The game begins by proposing us to choose whether to face adversity using the means and resources of the city police or those of an undefined private company. Our choice will influence both the type of cars that can be used, and (even if only in part) the type and purpose of the missions. The Fiat 500.... For each of the two scenarios you will have to face 6 missions, and for each objective successfully achieved new vehicles will be made available which, in addition to the initial 4, will provide a good fleet of cars, including a glorious Fiat 500, a Peugeot 405, a jeep military, all for a total of 32 vehicles to be destroyed during driving actions. But how beautiful it is to go around with the Vespa..... Each car can then be customized as desired, in fact in Super Runabout, despite being an action game and not a driving simulator, importance has been given to the possibility of setting and personalizing one's vehicles for the various missions; therefore, by accessing the garage option we can configure some simple parameters of the cars to our liking, or use pre-packaged settings that can make the vehicles either more suitable for a high top speed or to stay on the road with dignity. But how beautiful it is to go around with the Vespa..... But are these settings useful and can they really be seen in the game? We can say yes, a car with very hard suspension compared to one with the same settings as soft actually responds differently to our driving and a pickup truck is much less drivable than a racing car .... but in some situations (such as jumps) the physics of the cars is partly distorted allowing us to ~sail~ for a little too long in the air or to carry out very long and utopian rollovers. But these elements do not negatively affect the game which does not aim to be a driving simulator but an arcade game Hopping through the American streets The landscape in which we will drive our cars is really well done and great attention has been paid to details, in fact we will have to be careful of pedestrians, cars circulating in traffic, poles, buses and everything that is usually present in a real town. Realism that is accentuated by the possibility of interacting with everything on the screen; we will therefore be able to crash into poles, break shop windows, collide and make cars and trolleybuses overturn, actions which will also serve to increase our mission score and earn the money we will need to repair and upgrade our cars. Hopping through the American streets The game maps are really large and it is often possible to open alternative routes in city traffic by taking alleys or making huge jumps on the bumps present. The damages suffered by our vehicles are reproduced in a discreet even if not exceptional way, there are dented doors or crooked bumpers ... but there is still a lack of subtleties such as broken windshields or parts of the car lost on the road In conclusion?? The aim of the game is therefore summed up in completing the missions assigned to us which can vary between recovering objects, chasing and stopping cars or reaching certain locations in pre-established times. Note how in this third episode of the series the police are no longer an opponent always present in the streets, but are reduced to being a possible game campaign to undertake. In conclusion?? As far as a general assessment of the game's graphics is concerned, first of all we note how the resolution does not appear among the highest reached by the Dreamcast, with a non-optimal management that causes jaggies here and there and which also determines a loss of detail in some situations of the action. Cars are also, in some respects, a bit crude.....we have stop lights that light up, white smoke when we skid or accelerate from a standstill and wheelies from motorbikes...but we often get the idea of driving little boxes instead of real cars 18 In conclusion we can say that this Super Runabout is a good game but nothing exceptional, suitable for those who want to spend some time running around the city testing their ability to hit obstacles and the rexistence of your car. Attention attention, the presence of explosive devices has been reported between the 5th and the 12th go immediately on site.......VRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOMMM!! Super Runabout is the third episode of the Runabout guide series produced by Climax which, after having created two versions for the PlayStation, has landed on the screens of the Dreamcast. This game, like its predecessors, is based on free action within city areas aimed at recovering certain objects or pursuing various objectives, always having time as the primary opponent. The city that will see us engaged in reckless driving is San Francisco and in order to conclude the various missions proposed, various means of locomotion are made available to us ranging from the aggressive racing car up to the vespa passing by pickup trucks and 500 d era.", "date": "2000-11-30", "grade": null}
