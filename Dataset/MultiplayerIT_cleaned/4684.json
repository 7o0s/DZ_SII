What better reason to dedicate a sequel to it? So it was and Rock of Ages II: Bigger and Boulder saw the light in an August finale particularly crowded with interesting releases, passing a bit on the sly. Too bad, because it's an excellent game that oozes eccentricity from all pores and deserves some attention. The fifteen game levels have very different visual styles and they are all very nice to look at Rolling Stones Let's clarify one point immediately: the concept of Rock of Ages II is identical to that of Rock of Ages, without major variations. Then there are again two characters who are confronted by throwing heavy boulders along winding levels to make them crash into the rival fortress, with a very simple strategic section in between which consists of placing obstacles in the path to slow down the opponent. The first one who manages to break down the door of the enemy castle with well-aimed blows wins, crushing the occupants. When we talk about well landed blows we mean given at maximum speed and carried with a boulder that is as intact as possible. The obstacles have the exact function of slowing down the boulder and crumbling it, trying not to let it reach its destination. A destroyed boulder is a missed shot, which brings us back to the strategic phase. The news are almost all side by side and they are not few. But let's proceed in order. Solitary players will have four modes to choose from: the campaign, which we will discuss in a separate paragraph; the war mode, basically a one-on-one in which you select a map and face a single opponent with the standard rules; the obstacle course, in which the participants compete in levels with obstacles placed by the CPU, which are the same for both; and the time trial, which does what it promises, which is a speed challenge on paths without obstacles. The online modes are basically war and obstacle course, just played against a human instead of the AI. In reality, the time trial mode also has an online side, given that the rankings are global and therefore players from all over the world are confronted. If you want, however, this aspect can also be ignored and you can limit yourself to winning the medals (gold, silver and bronze) by going below the indicated times. Atlas against all As already mentioned, the core of Rock of Ages II is the single player campaign. In the first episode we played the role of Sisyphus who, in order to free himself from the yoke of the gods, had to go around smashing the castles of his opponents. Later his place was taken by Atlas, who at the beginning of the game we see making God angry by sliding the Earth... to the ground. Now, don't expect a coherent plot from the ACE Team title because there isn't (half a species yes, but no more). The protagonist of the game is Atlas Yet there is so much storytelling of excellent quality. Each new battle is in fact introduced by short animated sequences created starting from the iconography of the character we are about to face. For example, we will see the pictorial version of William Wallace fart Mel Gibson while he was trying to convince an army of farmers that he is the real William Wallace; or in a level dedicated to Salvador Dal we will have to face a flaming giraffe, which is one of the recurring symbols of his paintings. The iconography of the enemy also determines the style of its level. Thus Van Gogh's layer is composed of objects taken from his paintings and modeled with strokes inspired by his brushstrokes; while the Bologna level has a historical reconstruction of the city as a backdrop and the entire competition takes place on very high suspended platforms. But the game dynamics? The strategic section, where obstacles are placed on the track Unlike Rock of Ages, the sequel does not offer a linear series of clashes, but a map, which represents Europe, on which you have to choose who to face, rolling our beloved boulder against them. By winning, new paths are unlocked to reach new opponents and to grab extra obstacles to use in the strategic phase. The operation of the map is really intuitive, as is that of almost all other aspects of the game. Only the strategic phase requires some meditationextra ion, both to be understood and to really give some fruit. One of the defects of Rock of Ages II is precisely the difficulty of understanding the effectiveness of the placement of obstacles, given that the courses are very long and that, except on rare occasions, one cannot waste time observing the behavior of the opponent, in the small window that shows its run, to adjust accordingly and take the necessary countermeasures. In addition to new obstacles, by winning races you can unlock new boulders, each with its own characteristics Furthermore, at the beginning of each game only a few of all the available obstacles (the basic ones plus the unlocked ones) can be selected, a possibility that even proves to be penalizing, because it makes it even more impalpable to understand the effectiveness of their placement. In short, one perfects oneself with training, and this is not a bad thing, but it would have been nice to have some more verification tools so as not to have to proceed only by intuition. Overall however, Rock of Ages II is an excellent title, which offers something more than its predecessor, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. Also note the marked improvement in artificial intelligence, which now offers a more heated challenge and does not regret the absence of a human opponent. In short, we can consider the new work of ACE Team as the consolidation of an already exploited idea, which we hope will achieve similar success.", "date": "2017-09-10", "grade": "8.4"}
