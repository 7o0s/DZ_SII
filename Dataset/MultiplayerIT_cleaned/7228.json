Despite their simplicity, these are experiences that can be quite engaging, and in some cases hide even a minimum of depth behind the incredible immediacy. We have asked ourselves the fateful question many times: could such a production ever be successful on a ~fixed~ platform? Well, One Finger Death Punch provides a more than eloquent answer to this question. The prerogatives of the indie game developed by Silver Dollar, already available on Xbox LIVE and making its debut on Steam, are in fact typically ~causal~: acting on just two buttons, in this case the left and right click of the mouse (or two keys on the keyboard or of the controller), we have to control a martial arts master grappling with virtually infinite hordes of opponents who arrive from the right and left side of the screen. Our alter ego does not move directly, but moves in one direction or another based on the number of shots that are placed here and there, according to a scheme that simply provides a range of action and a focus on the precision of the attacks, given that at the end of each stage we will be given a different recognition depending on how many times we have made a punch or an empty kick. One Finger Death Punch offers a fun, fast-paced and challenging experience despite its simplicity Kill Bill The start screen of One Finger Death Punch offers the possibility of accessing two modes: the campaign, with three degrees of difficulty to unlock, and the survival, which also has three variations. Let's start with the latter, which presents itself as the traditional challenge to those who resist the most, trying to eliminate the greatest number of enemies using a single bar of vital energy and, therefore, using up all their resources in terms of promptness and accuracy. Among the variants there is the Blind Survival, or the same formula but without the visual indications that make it clear what type of opponent we are dealing with. Precisely from this speech we start to analyze the campaign, made up of an enormous amount of stages often and willingly equipped with different rules, in which we are simply asked to defeat a certain number of enemies, survive until the time runs out, destroy a total of scenario objects or accept a confrontation that unfolds over several rounds of increasing difficulty. The campaign numbers are one of the most striking things about the offer, given that we are talking about dozens and dozens of missions: an excellent solution to buffer the speed with which it is possible to complete the levels, and which in many cases manages to provide an escape from the intrinsic repetitiveness of the action. Hokuto's Violent Hand Wave! As mentioned at the beginning, the gameplay of One Finger Death Punch is particularly immediate, but at the same time not trivial. Using the mouse controls, you have to click on the left or right button as soon as an opponent enters our field of action, ringing spectacular combos that are enhanced in an excellent way thanks to short ~slowdowns~ and the presence of sound effects that manage to make the idea of the impact is very good. It is precisely the impact that makes the difference between a valid combat system and a mediocre one, as we always say, and the developers of Silver Dollar have been able to demonstrate in this case that it is possible to obtain this effect even without using detailed and modern graphics. indeed ranging in the field of extreme stylization, proposing characters that seem to have come out of a road sign but who produce fantastic moves, sometimes staging a large dose of violence (with impalements, eyes that fly away, bones that break and heads severed) which is however inevitably dampened by the stylistic solution adopted. The strength mentioned in the introduction lies, in this case, in the differentiation between the opponents: there are the standard ones, which must be eliminated with a simple blow in their direction, and others which, depending on the colour, must be hit two or three times sometimes, they move from side to side or give life to short fights in which you have to quickly reproduce the inputs that are shown on the screen, like in a crazy rhythm game. It's a formula that's much easier to prove than to explain, and it's like a classic ~gaming drug~ after just a few minutes of play.", "date": "2014-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
