{"name": "Guilty Gear XX Accent Core - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guilty-gear-xx-accent-core-recensione.html", "text": "We thought that the availability of ~classic~ Wii video games should be limited to Virtual Console titles, but the arrival of the latest incarnation of Guilty Gear proves us wrong. In this case, we are faced with Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, or a reinterpretation of Guilty Gear XX with some changes regarding the characters and game modes. We will have the beauty of twenty-three immediately selectable warriors and five modes: Arcade, Versus 2P, Versus CPU, M.O.M. and Survival. Slash! As mentioned, Accent Core is an ~enhanced~ version of Guilty Gear XX, with the action at the center and little room for everything else. A choice that is already felt from the Arcade mode, in which you face the usual sequence of opponents until you meet your all-time rival and the very powerful Isuka, without however knowing anything about the history of each character. Not a small lack, especially considering the fact that this episode is the only one available for Wii and that Nintendo console owners may have never tried Guilty Gear before, therefore they know nothing of the relationships that bind the various Sols (available here also in an alternate version), Millia, Bridget, Potemkin etc. There is very little to say about Versus modes, while the story is different for the MOM options. and Survival, very similar: in both you have to defeat the greatest number of enemies relying on a single energy bar, but in the first case the goal is to cause enormous damage and earn medals. To get familiar with the controls there is a special mode (Training), although the most important lessons are learned during real games. Finally, you can visit the Gallery to enjoy a series of beautiful illustrations, which are unlocked as you complete the game with all characters. Heaven or Hell? Before analyzing this product in its mechanics, a fundamental point needs to be clarified immediately. Unfortunately, there are still very few video games developed specifically for the Wii and for its peculiar control system: very often we see products, especially cross-platform ones, in which the controls are more or less well ~adapted~ to use with the Wii-mote and Nunchuck. In the case of Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, this type of configuration proves literally disastrous, robs the game of its depth and makes the overall experience simplistic, imprecise and frustrating. We will be able to use the Nunchuck analog stick to move the character and shake the Wii-mote to strike with the sword, with the simple variation of holding down the C and/or Z buttons to perform special moves; or, alternatively, we can use the d-pad to deliver the four blows (kick, punch, heavy or light sword blow). In both cases, the result is terrible: it is a type of control completely unsuitable for a fast and technical fighting game like Guilty Gear, and the simplification relating to special moves is disarming as it is excessive. In short, with Wii-mote and Nunchuck this product turns into a (very) pale imitation of itself. Using a Classic Controller or a GameCube joypad, things change radically, fortunately, so much so that one or the other accessory proves to be mandatory in order to enjoy Accent Core to the fullest. The d-pads of both controllers do not shine for comfort, but they prove to be quite precise during the execution of the various ~crescents~, with a clear superiority of the Classic Controller as regards the layout of the buttons. In action! From the first games we realize the maturity reached by the series, born to play the role of ~third pole~ compared to similar products from Capcom and SNK. The characters are all armed, therefore they possess a certain variety of offensive maneuvers, but above all an extremely varied and picturesque characterization: alongside the stereotypes of fighting games we also find original and even bizarre creations, such as the girl who fights with yo-yos ( lethal from medium range), the ~possessed~ guy who faces the enemy with a completely unnatural guard, the cyborg who hides weapons in every part of his body, etc. The differences aren't limited to aesthetics: each character has a particular approach to combat and a series of unique special moves, which can be combined with each other to create devastating and spectacular sequences of blows. The speed of the clashes is quite high, you can also parry in the air and there are various evasive maneuvers available, so much so that you can base your strategy on simple movements as well as move on to advanced techniques. The game offers the possibility of adjusting the level of difficulty and the number of rounds per match, but unfortunately there is a sharp increase in each caseof the challenge when it comes to the final two enemies, of disproportionate skill compared to all previous opponents. This is a typical approach of the ~King of Fighters~ series, which however only produces episodes of frustration... Technical realization Remaining in the context of 2D fighting games, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core comes with really excellent graphics, which make extensive use of zoom to emphasize the spectacular nature of the action and can count on very generously sized sprites. The twenty-three characters available all enjoy the same care in the realization, with a good level of detail, excellent animations and a certain number of ~poses~ which can be seen both before and after the meetings. A similar argument can be made for the stages, very numerous and well done, full of animated elements, with one exception (the final location, really awful and bare). The use of colors is always excellent, as is the sound sector: the music that accompanies the fights is really beautiful, and the effects are effective. The game performs very well in terms of loading, always fast, while it lacks an online multiplayer mode that could have made a difference in terms of longevity. Comment It is true that the Wii is a console dedicated to ~particular~ video games, but it is equally true that every now and then one can feel the need for a classic title like this Guilty Gear XX Accent Core. Wanting to be critical, it would have been more reasonable to propose episode XX ~smooth~, thus preserving all the elements of a non-essential but interesting plot; however, the new incarnation of the series lets itself be forgiven for the quality of the gameplay, the number of characters available (all different from each other!) and really excellent bitmap graphics, made up entirely of elements already seen in previous episodes but which on Wii is all unedited. If you are a fan of 2D fighting games and the Virtual Console has not yet managed to satiate your appetites, this is a title to be taken into great consideration. With a single imperative: it must be played with the Classic Controller or, alternatively, with the GameCube joypad. Pros Engaging, playable and rich in depth Excellent graphics for characters and stages Excellent control system with the Classic Controller... Cons ...disastrous with Wii-mote and Nunchuck Balance of difficulty questionable Lacks an online mode", "date": "2008-03-20", "grade": null}
