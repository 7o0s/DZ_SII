Not satisfied with the appreciation received on the Microsoft console, the Dutch team has well decided to repeat on mobile platforms, obviously including iOS among the target markets for a high definition version and refined in various aspects, but which however has also lost some elements for the street. Jetpacks, pirates and power-ups The protagonist of the game is a bizarre legless soldier who, wearing a jetpack and embracing a rocket launcher, is called to track down and eliminate the pirate Blockbeard. This leads him to go through a series of almost fifty levels full of equally armed enemies, a number less than the 80 of the Xbox Live Arcade version, but which undoubtedly proves to be more than enough for a mobile game, where nothing excludes the other scenarios will be introduced soon with a free update. The vast majority of levels ask the player to dispose of a certain number of enemies scattered across the screen, flitting from side to side of the confined arena and aiming to strike with bazookas, but although there are a couple of challenges alternatives, such as timed missions or scenarios in which to grab a football and perform a touchdown or a set piece after having covered the entire level, the developers have not proved able to give the game a minimum of variety in the gameplay. And indeed, in addition to not having undergone any enrichment, Rocket Riot HD has even lost what was probably the most popular option of the XBLA version. If in the original version you could challenge seven other friends at the same time, on iOS the game has no multiplayer mode, either online or locally, and it's a real shame considering how much fun it would have been to chase your rival around the levels while meanwhile he blew up any point of the scanario by bombarding it with missiles. Let me be clear, nothing excludes that in the near future the developers decide to distribute the multiplayer mode in the form of downloadable content, but certainly the fact that it is not present from the beginning can only leave a bad taste in the mouth. As for the control system, Rocket Riot HD tries to please everyone by making three different alternatives available, two via a touchscreen interface and one involving the device's motion sensors. In each case you never have that immediacy and responsiveness of the controls seen in Infinity Field and other games of the genre, but if Codeglue's shooter lacks in playability, it recovers abundantly with the nice audiovisual experience it manages to offer. The game arena constantly changes perspective giving a pleasant sense of three-dimensionality, although the game mechanics remain anchored to 2D, while each destroyed block and each piece of wall blown up scatters hundreds of small fragments throughout the level. The impression is thus that of moving in the midst of a riot of fireworks, and even when the screen seems ready to explode, there are so many objects in sight, the framerate has never shown signs of uncertainty. In the same way, the soundtrack is as crazy as it is spot on, composed of sometimes exhilarating and sometimes ridiculous songs. Too bad that everything is lost in the enormous repetitiveness of the action, considering that the levels will have to be tackled almost all in the same way, while the sporadic battles with the bosses never require a strategic approach, simply leading the player to shoot in bursts and dodge incoming bullets. To add a minimum of meat to the fire and make up for the lack of additional modes, there is at least a long series of power-ups which, if necessary, can benefit the player or put him in difficulty: some increase firepower, for example by enlarging their missiles or multiplying them, others are activated only after a certain period of time, still others negatively affect the controls or one's aim. Finally, although there are several objectives to unlock through Game Center and which encourage you to replay levels already completed, in terms of extra content the game is limited to the various secret characters: every time you face new enemies, these are made available in a special menu, allowing the player to impersonate over 100 different avatars.
