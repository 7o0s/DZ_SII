Ace Attorney, Capcom has seen fit to bring his latest work, Ghost Trick: Detective Ghost on iPhone and iPad. It is a product of exceptional quality, an action puzzle that mimics an interactive cartoon and offers us an interesting and engaging story, full of extraordinary twists and told in a style that is very reminiscent of the late Osamu Tezuka. both in terms of dialogue and character design. The game was published on the App Store in a ~demo~ version: it is possible to download it for free and complete the first two chapters, then decide whether to purchase three additional packages at the price of 3.99 euros each or opt for the complete unlock of the eighteen chapters at the price of 7.99 euros. If you've peeked at the vote at the bottom of the page, you'll imagine what our advice might be: Ghost Trick had already largely conquered us in its original version for Nintendo DS, and this iOS re-edition looks as good as it could, thanks to a almost perfect touch control but above all high quality graphics and sound, which thanks to the Retina Display and the audio capabilities of Apple devices can finally express their full potential. Four minutes In Ghost Trick: Ghost Detective we control a character named Sissel, who at the beginning of the story discovers that he is a ghost. His body is there, lying in the middle of a landfill, but apparently the night is destined to claim further victims. Detective Lynne, another important protagonist of the game, is in fact killed by a killer right before our eyes. Luckily we can do something, as a mysterious talking lamp explains: we have the ~power of the dead~, which allows us to travel back in time, precisely to four minutes before a person dies, as well as interact with inanimate objects to try to change the future and, therefore, prevent things from going wrong. There's just one problem: we can't go back to four minutes before our own death to avert it, and by dawn our spirit too will vanish into thin air. The only thing we can do, therefore, is to use the hours that remain to find out who is behind our death and try to protect the people who seem to be involved in the same dark plot. The development of the game is simple: during each chapter events occur that we passively witness, reading the dialogues of the various characters and observing what happens within the scenario. When and if someone dies, we can switch to ~ghost mode~ and move our spirit from one object to another, via an energy link, until we reach the corpse. At that point it will be possible to go back in time and interact with the setting (in ~trick~ mode) in order to change what will happen from there to four minutes. The concept seems complex, but in reality it takes a few minutes to become familiar with the powers and the dialogues will always help us with small suggestions, preventing even the most difficult and multifaceted puzzles from becoming frustrating. During the plot, new elements and new powers will then be introduced, but anticipating something would be a real crime, given that the greatest strength of Ghost Trick: Ghost Detective lies precisely in the plot and in the way it is told to us. As mentioned at the beginning, the iOS version is better than the original for Nintendo DS from all points of view: high resolution graphics (a ~resize~ of the original, but well done), perfectly clear sound and an interface only slightly modified, in which the functions of the objects are described in a small box on the right side of the touch screen.
