Surely the strong point of the GC version is not to be found in the single player mode, extremely stingy with surprises for anyone who has already had the opportunity to play the GBA edition. In fact, with a move that is certainly not exciting, the programmers have decided to transfer what was seen on the Nintendo laptop in an almost identical way, without making an effort to introduce new mini-games or extras of any kind. Indeed, in some respects the final result is even lower than the first appearance, since the hilarious introduction skits to the various characters have been eliminated. For heaven's sake, the game remains one of the funniest and most original titles that have appeared in recent years, but fans of the first edition will hardly find the desire and stimuli to re-face the same situations emulated on home TV. On the contrary, those who are virgins of the latest title dedicated to the anti-hero par excellence will be welcomed, or rather catapulted into a chaos made up of over 200 mini-games lasting a few seconds each, in rapid sequences made up of quotes from the past or ex- new, but in any case capable of snatching from the smile to the big laugh in front of the humor and the craziness of the situations offered. In what other games are you called to pick your nose, peel a banana, drop a cherry on a slice of cake and catch a dog's paw, all in the space of a handful of moments? The magic of Wario Ware has always been this: to offer an enviable variety of very short minigames, all united by the minimalist control system, and therefore accessible to anyone. One, a hundred, a thousand Wario Nintendo's decision regarding this conversion for Gamecube was therefore to leave the single player element semi-intact, focusing all the news on the multiplayer mode just mentioned in the episode for GBA. The result, from this point of view, is certainly valid, and capable of transforming a quiet evening with friends into a real show but not perfect. The structure of the multiplayer section is basically divided into a dozen different ~approaches~ to the genre, obviously with the mini-games always protagonists as a common denominator. Variations on the main theme go from predictable to totally insane, managing to pretty much satisfy every palate; if the simple head-to-head challenge is pleasant but certainly not very original, the same thing cannot be said for example of the doctor's game, in which you are called to take turns to face a mini-game while paying attention to the requests of a doctor with good more than a few wheels out of place... only to be subjected to the judgment, through more or less vigorous applause, of the companions. Or you can bring out the cooperative spirit and try to literally shed ~light~ on the dark screen, allowing a friend to complete a minigame. Or, on the contrary, give vent to the evil spirit, strolling happily with one's character on the monitor while the unfortunate person on duty desperately tries to succeed in the umpteenth test. There is even a version of Othello adapted to the occasion... and we stop here so as not to take away the pleasure of the surprise. So in such an exhilarating picture, can there be weaknesses? Well yes. From the outset, let's eliminate any consideration of graphics and sound, clearly very far from the Gamecube's capabilities but perfectly in line with the simplistic and immediate spirit of the title. On the contrary, what weighs the most in the final evaluation of Wario Ware Mega Party Game$ is exactly what makes it great: simplicity. The immediacy of Nintendo's production soon proves to be a two-sided coin, proving to be as perfect for involving even the less skilled with video games as it is the bearer of a certain repetitiveness during prolonged sessions. In this sense, once the surprise effect for the various multiplayer modes is over, we are inevitably faced with a product destined to ~burn out~ rather quickly. All this amplified to the nth degree for those who have already stripped the GBA episode well, who will not find particular stimuli in this case. Lastly, the need to have playmates of more or less the same skill level should be underlined, unless you want to witness unfunny one-way challenges in favor of the most experienced of the company. Comment Wario Ware on Gamecube is a title whose evaluation is much less simple than one might think. For those who have never had the opportunity to try the GBA version, even in the face of the reduced selling price, it could certainly be a perfect purchase. While losing a bit the sense ofits nature that made it perfect for a portable experience, and despite offering a disappointing single mode, the fun of discovering the mini-games and multiplayer mode would undoubtedly be more than enough to justify the expense. But for lovers of the first version, the GC edition probably offers too little, at the same time losing much of the ~magic~ that made it successful and failing by its very nature to compensate for this deficiency with a sufficiently robust multiplayer aspect. Pros: Unique style and fun Extreme immediacy Excellent for those who have never played Wario Ware ... Cons: ... much less for lovers of the GBA version single mode really disappointing repetitive in medium-long game sessions Probably not even Nintendo expected to be so successful with Wario Ware for GBA, the crazy collection of minigames that quickly became a real cult for many gamers. In an era in which the predominant direction seems to be to offer ever greater complexity and realism in every aspect, on the contrary Wario Ware has offered a gaming experience based on pure and simple, immediate, but no less satisfying fun. On the contrary. A few months after the original, Nintendo seized the opportunity and therefore created a Gamecube version of the aforementioned title, with the firm desire to replicate the success obtained by also giving ~home~ players the opportunity to enjoy Wario's madness.", "date": "2004-10-06", "grade": null}
