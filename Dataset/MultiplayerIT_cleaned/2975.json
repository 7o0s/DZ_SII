{"name": "What Happened", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/what-happened-recensione.html", "text": "What happens when you want to mix the themes of Life is Strange and the style of Silent Hill? If the pairing seems strange to you, it is understandable but the review of What Happened talks about a title that can be summarized just like this. The psychological thriller developed by the independent studio Genius Slackers puts us in the shoes of Stiles, a high school student whose life is all a huge mess: family traumas, bullying, youthful love and drugs mix in this psychedelic journey through the boy's subconscious, who struggles against himself to be able to overcome the depression in which he is drowning following events that have quickly spiraled out of his control. Presented like this, the idea has a certain charm above all because the themes are not the lightest and the right tact is needed to deal with it, especially when the staging - verbal or visual - does not skimp on the grotesque and violence. Descent into madness The fundamental problem of What Happened is that it has emphasized the madness and the surreal too much, forgetting the presence, on the other hand, of a player who must find a meaning in what he is doing, a reason that pushes him to continue and is not the inertia, a hook capable of keeping him anchored to a visually well-constructed but too confusing inner journey. The game revolves around Stiles' same problems and paranoia in an almost obsessive way; it wouldn't be a bad thing if we consider the whole of the protagonist and the complexes that afflict him but the feeling is that of being involved in an eternal circle that seems to lead nowhere. It doesn't matter if the consequences are good or bad for Stiles, whose fate is linked to the understanding we show towards him. The obsession is exacerbated through a series of visually captivating sequences, sometimes even horror, but without real gameplay and in the most ~articulated~ cases without an indication of what to do or how to proceed. Mind you, we are not talking about wanting food ready but about being equipped with the tools to understand what is happening and how to continue. Instead, having pressed the hand on Stiles' inner hell and drug use that doesn't help him in ordering his thoughts and emotions makes it difficult to find a direction in which to move; the solution sometimes seems to be to go in circles until the next scene is triggered, in a continuous alternation of situations which, if at the beginning they may seem impactful, moving forward are only a burden and a nuisance. A dead end tunnel This gives rise to the idea that an attempt has been made to lengthen the stock in a game which unfortunately, given the almost total lack of interaction, limits itself to making us pass from one scene to another, seasoning it with madness and offering fragmentary pieces of that puzzle which is Stiles' life. However, by applying so much pressure that there was no shortage of situations of real annoyance towards the protagonist. What Happened is hampered not so much by its nature as a walking simulator, because there have been games like What Remains of Edith Finch able to tell a drama in a touching and surprising way despite the brevity, managing to involve the player despite the reduced gameplay minimal terms, as from wanting to drag too long a story that could be resolved much faster without losing any of its kaleidoscopic madness. In addition to an inspired aesthetic, the game also enjoys the conflict between Stiles and his own mind, which instigates him to let go of everything and push himself to suicide by continuing to talk to him all the time with a convincing dubbing, able to tread the tones at the right moment - along the lines of the whispers of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We are our enemy and in this respect a good job has been done, with Stiles' mind becoming his cruel alter ego that we wouldn't have minded addressing more directly. For the rest, unfortunately, What Happened gets lost in a loop of scenarios almost completely devoid of interaction, on the one hand an excellent reflection of a drifting mind like his but on the other hand forced down the player's throat, which he surrenders to his rules in the vain hope of finding a motivation to continue, a light at the end of an all too long tunnel. In all this, the characters underlying Stiles' suffering do not help: where the settings and the boy's alter ego are very accurate, they are obviously a step backwards both in terms of graphics and characterization. Their jokes are weak, unconvincing and despite being a central part of the story they fail to convince when, on the other side of the scale, we have very different attentiona for other game elements. There is no doubt that What Happened would have needed more filing and overall cleaning but its major limitation is excessive length, often made up of dragged situations that in an eternal roundabout revolve around the problem without ever going all the way. If not when it's too late. For the moment there is no Italian localization but the team has ensured that it will be included.", "date": "2020-08-04", "grade": "5.0"}
