Released on 30 June 2014 a few months late, the title was the fastest in sales for the small Belgian software house, a significant breath of fresh air that relaunched Swen Vincke's team on the market and laid a solid foundation for the future of the series, inaugurated with Divinity Divine in the ~distant~ 2002. The success of the Personal Computer version has allowed the developers to also concentrate on the console conversions, an in-depth work which, in addition to adapting the elaborate control system for the joypad, is resulted in numerous interventions on various features of the game, so influential that Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition will also be published on PC and given to all those who had purchased the original work. We've thoroughly tested the PlayStation 4 version and here's what we think. The improved version of the highly acclaimed Divinity: Original Sin arrives on consoles Pair game For more intimate details of the title, we refer you to the PC review edited by our good Armani, who awarded the work of Larian Studios with an excellent 9, here we will focus on the peculiarities of the Enhanced Edition and in particular on the shaped control system for the DualShock 4, but not before having made a quick overview of the intrinsic qualities of the Belgian production. The incredible success of Divinity: Original Sin is inextricably linked to its delicious recipe, which involves a creative and satisfying turn-based combat system, a rich narrative characterized by gripping dialogues and an underlying complexity that is few rivaled in modern RPGs , drawing liberally from the classic school of the genre. It is, in simpler words, a rather punitive hardcore production, with an anthology of contents and a depth of the past; just think that even simple exploration is decidedly less guided than in more recent similar works. The two protagonists of the game are the so-called Hunters of the Source (or of the Origin, as it is sometimes indicated in the Italian subtitles), sent by their Order to the seaside city of Cyseal to investigate the mysterious murder of Councilor Jake, a whodunit for which many suspect his wife but that the most refined minds connect to the intervention of the Onigromancers, a dangerous sect capable of using dark arts and maneuvering the energy of the Origin (Source). As happens in any self-respecting role-playing game, it is possible to shape the heroes according to the traditional classes suggested, from the wizard to the warrior, passing through the thief, the cleric and so on, despite the freedom granted in the creation editor and the number of attributes, talents and abilities is so wide and varied that it is possible to make a plethora of intermediate solutions. Among the most interesting features, moreover, there is the possibility of casting spells even with characters not inclined to magical arts (through the so-called Scrolls), a detail that considerably increases the tactical-strategic range of one's team. One of the great novelties of the Enhanced Edition lies in the possibility of playing in two with the shared screen, a dynamic local cooperative that adds to the already excellent multiplayer sector on the net, linked to the classic ~drop-in drop-out~ system. When the two players leave the same playing area, the screen splits allowing total freedom of movement on the map, supported by a view that in this new version can be rotated 360 without the previously imposed limits, to the full advantage of the exploration factor . The flagship of the work is the strategic approach to fighting, which in the Enhanced Edition is enhanced by a renewed artificial intelligence shaped by Larian Studios by carefully studying the behavior of the players. This evolution is evident in the new Tactical Mode, which unlike the Explorer and Classic modes (respectively the easy and normal difficulty level), puts the players before much more sneaky, tough and cunning enemies. To this is added the Honor Mode, in which a single save slot is accessible which is inexorably canceled when the team dies: a real ~mission impossible~ suitable only for the most expert and daring players. In terms of narration, among the most interesting aspects of this revised and corrected version there is the dubbing of all the dialogues, a mammoth work embellished by the presence of new non-player characters, rewritten lines of text and a completely new ending. Italian players can also count on subtitles in our language, a feature not available at the launch of the PC version and edited by a team of willing modders. The result, while presenting some small flaws, is overall positive. The finishing and balancing work carried out by the software house founded by Swen Vincke in 1996 also concerned various quests, to which new mechanics in party management must also be added, from the transfer of objects to the possibility of setting a character for the automatic repair. Playstation 4 trophies Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition has a total of 55 Trophies divided into 47 bronze, 5 silver, 3 gold and one platinum, the latter related to unlocking all the others. Most of the objectives are intimately linked to the plot, and the most difficult to conquer are those dedicated to completing the new modes of the Enhanced Edition, namely the Tactics and the very difficult Honor. Finally, there are some hidden trophies. Power is nothing without control The most consistent interventions in this new version of the title mainly concerned the interface and the command system, adapted to work very well also on the DualShock 4 and on the Xbox One pad. Text and icons have been enlarged to make them easier to read on large screens, and menus have been refined and modified to streamline the player's action, although the overwhelming amount of options, settings, items and attributes to manage results in a final result that is at least laborious, requiring a few hours of practice to absorb most of the mechanics. The turn-based battles, however, allow you to take all the time necessary to diligently prepare your war strategy. The organization of the inventory is still a little problematic, given that a lot of time is spent analyzing the objects and transferring what has been collected between one character and another: fortunately the ~loot~ of Divinity: Original Sin is almost always interesting and useful, especially when it comes to rare equipment. Going back to the control system, Larian Studios could not have done better than this, and every single key of the DualShock 4 has been exploited properly. With the left analog stick you move the selected character, while with the right you rotate the view, manage the very comfortable zoom and clicking on R3 you get suggestions on the objects present in the area. The digital cross has a function for each direction: Up enables tactical vision by viewing the battlefield from above; Down activates the ironic and very useful stealth mode; Right sets the attack mode and Left forces split screen even when not needed. During the clashes the triangle button plays a fundamental role, since it allows you to switch to the skill bar where the scrolls related to spells and objects are also manageable; X represents the classic selection button, circle is used to pass the turn, square intervenes in different types of menus while R1 and L1 scroll through selected objects and enemies. The L2 key, in combination with the triangle, is linked to the selection and subdivision of the party, while R2 activates the new Radial Selection Panel with an infinite number of secondary menus, among which we find Inventory, Character, Skills, Crafting, Diary and Equipment . With the touch pad you view the map, finally with Options you access the saves, the points of interest for the teleportation and the classic general settings. As you may have guessed, this is a rather rich and deep system, not as effective as the mouse and keyboard combination in terms of ~workflow~ but capable of making a product of this thickness accessible even on consoles. From a purely technical point of view, while not presenting the same graphic cleanliness of the PC counterpart to the maximum detail, the Larian Studios title is pleasing to the eye and artistically cared for, with some additions compared to the original version as regards the effects. The fluidity stands at thirty frames per second in most cases, even if some shots are recognized in the most chaotic situations and playing in two with the shared screen. Good dubbing, soundtrack andaudio samples.", "date": "2015-10-27", "grade": "9.0"}
