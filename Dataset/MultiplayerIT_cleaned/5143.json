It's 2013 and Pantera launches a playground editor project on Kickstarter. Almost two thousand people decide to finance it and make it come true. The game, if we want to call it that, launches in Steam Early Access on February 27, 2014. Almost three years have passed since then and the definitive version has finally arrived. In the meantime, the genre of playground simulators, little frequented at the time, was enriched with new and very valid competitors: the complex but complete Parkitect, the horrendous RollerCoaster Tycoon World and the excellent Planet Coaster. In short, orphaned fans of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series suddenly had a choice. Meanwhile, the title of Pantera Entertainment has practically stopped, apart from a series of updates that have enraged the buyers of the first hour. Let's be clear right away: Theme Park Studio is not a video game in the canonical sense. Starting it you will find yourself in front of something more similar to an application, moreover very complex. The aim is to build amusement parks, but it doesn't go beyond that, since there is no economic simulation. Once the work is finished, the park opens and visitors can be watched crowding it, but without having to worry about sold tickets or failing miserably because perhaps a roller coaster in the shape of a gigantic penis has been built. In short, the most strictly playful part does not exist, except to go around admiring one's work or that of others. The latest updates in particular have been dedicated to the implementation of VR functions. For the most critical, they were wasted resources, given that among the buyers of the game there are very few who have a viewer (perhaps they were hoping to sell a few more copies). Obviously there was no shortage of criticism from the community, which didn't look kindly on the work of the development team on a new feature, when there was still a lot to do on the basic title. More an application than a video game, Theme Park Studio is finally complete and we have reviewed it Playground for whom? Finally however Theme Park Studio is out and it's hard to say that it isn't what it wants to be: the most complex and complete playground editor on the market. The problem is that it is not possible to frame it in terms of use, in the sense that as an editor it is far too complex for an audience that is not ultra-dedicated. We're not talking about the average player of any RollerCoaster Tycoon, but someone who really dreams of designing a playground. In Theme Park Studio, even placing a road is a complicated operation: you choose the segment, define its characteristics, attach it to an anchor point, manipulate it to adapt it to the project you have in mind and then move on to the next segment. At certain times it seems to be working with professional software, even if it must be said that many of these have much more intuitive interfaces than the Pantera Entertainment title. In short, it is true that you can change many parameters that competitors dream of, such as those related to the physics of the attractions, or the routes for visitors to follow, it just doesn't make much sense to do so. It's like someone created an editor for a game that doesn't exist. At this point, talking about the outline of Theme Park Studio is not secondary, given that it is a title that can only survive if it has an active and productive community. Currently, unfortunately, this is not the case. There is something in the Steam Workshop, but it is limited to a handful of interesting works, which can be seen quickly. Probably many have been held back by the excessive difficulty of creating a complete park, which requires many hours and, initially, the consultation of the substantial tutorials offered. However, it must be said that some custom attractions are better than the default ones, with the latter being considered as a mere starting point. Do you think that Theme Park Studio allows you to import meshes and models created outside the game and animate them, as if it were a real graphics engine. Nice, too bad we're always there: who is it for? Someone who can create and animate the 3D model of a carousel is unlikely to devote his time to Theme Park Studio for glory, while the average user will not even understand what the hell we're talking about. Above all: if one is able to make a 3D model of a carousel and animate it, he can directly build the entire park in the 3D graphics program he is using... he would have even more outlets to show it! The competition Another big problem of the title of Pantera Entertainment is the aforementioned competition and not only due to the fact that Planet Coaster and Parkitect (We'll leave it alone because it's horrendous) allow you to manage the park that has been built, but also because with less effort in Planet Coaster you get results definitely more beautiful to look at than those of Theme Park Studio. In short, the title of Frontier outclasses that of Pantera for graphic quality, with the latter appearing old and outdated even in front of the not excellent RollerCoaster Tycoon World. Sure, Theme Park Studio's largest number of features allow you to create anything, but no matter how hard you try, you'll never get as impactful as learning to use Frontier's title editor, which relies on a much more advanced graphics engine. Let's also assume that Planet Coaster visitors have their own artificial intelligence and move naturally through the parks, while those of Theme Park Studio follow pre-set paths (these too can be modified, just to add complexity to the whole) and have really woody animations. In short, the comparison is quite merciless. Let it be clear that we do not want to diminish the good the Pantera editor is able to offer, we only believe that it is right that at the end of reading you are aware of what you are facing and that you should not expect an heir to Theme Park, but more a distant cousin of Maya 3D or Photoshop. If the idea intrigues you, then buy it, otherwise forget it and look elsewhere.", "date": "2016-12-02", "grade": "5.0"}
