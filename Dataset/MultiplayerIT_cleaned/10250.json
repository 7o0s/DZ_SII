The last episode, for example, offers the beauty of twenty minigames divided into five different categories, to please everyone and offer entertainment characterized by a certain variety. The categories consist of card games, strategy games, action games, puzzles, and word games. The number of games in each category varies: in the case of card games and puzzles, there are five minigames, down to four for strategy and action games and two for word games. The control system is based entirely on the touch screen, so once you have created a profile you can control everything using the stylus. There is also a local multiplayer mode that allows us to challenge a friend both in the event that he also owns a copy of the game, and in the presence of a single cartridge (via DS download). Card sings The first category, that of card games, is undoubtedly the most immediate for most people, since it is enough to know the rudiments of poker to try their hand at it. The Target Royale minigame, to begin with, shows us a board made up of three rows of five boxes each. Each row is marked by a multiplier (5X, 3X and 1X) which precisely multiplies the score achieved in that location. We have to take the card that is shown from time to time on the top screen of the Nintendo DS and place it on the board, with the aim of making combinations such as two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, etc. in the same row of boxes. Each stage requires a minimum score to pass, so you have to choose your cards carefully and often take some risks. In case you don't reach the necessary score, it will be game over. Of a different tenor is the Poker Slide minigame, in which our goal is to move the squares of the board shown on the touch screen so that it is identical to the one on the upper screen. Finally, Nine Hole is a sort of reinterpretation of the classic ~solitaire~ that we all know. Strategy and action Fuse Line stands out among the strategy minigames, in which we control a cursor that has to draw boxes on the screen with the aim of ~capturing~ moving objects. The squares must be fixed before the object touches their limits. Then there is Chef Memory, or the classic memory game in which you have to identify two identical cards on a board (in this case represented by the ingredients used by the chef for his dishes) to eliminate them. On the action minigame front, we have the nice Cannon Fire: the player controls a cannon that must be adjusted through three different selectors to fire its projectiles at annoying blobs that crowd the DS's upper screen. In Slime Assault, however, the enemy is made up of hordes of slugs that proceed vertically and that we must eliminate by releasing bombs at the right moment. Electro Maze also deserves a mention, a minigame in which precision matters more than anything else since we have to move a sphere with the stylus inside an electrified labyrinth: every contact with the walls results in a painful shock. Puzzles and words The offer is completed by the puzzle and word games categories. The first, very crowded, offers us minigames such as Recall, in which we are simply asked to reproduce sequences of shots after they have been performed by the AI. Or like Dice King, in which we are dealing with a board made up of dice with different faces: our goal is to move the ones that interest us most so that the combinations indicated on the upper screen are created. As far as word games are concerned, we have the bizarre Sea Word, a minigame that sees us control a small fish intent on transporting letters enclosed in air bubbles to safety, with the ultimate goal of composing a certain word. All minigames have ~achievements~ to unlock that make the challenge even more interesting. The graphics of TouchMaster 3 are functional to the action, it is always easy to read and the choice of colors ensures good liveliness. Too bad for the music, very repetitive. In conclusion, we are faced with a well-made title, with decent level minigames and quite various in the offer.", "date": "2010-01-14", "grade": null}
