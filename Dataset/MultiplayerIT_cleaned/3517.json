{"name": "LifeAfter: Night Falls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lifeafter-night-falls-la-recensione.html", "text": "The survival genre with a post-apocalyptic setting and realistic setting has now been thoroughly explored in the videogame panorama, but still remains little exploited on mobile platforms, mainly due to technical limitations. Also for this reason, in this review of LifeAfter: Night Falls, we find ourselves appreciating the relative novelty of a game of this type that seems to have been transported by weight from the PC to the mobile one, with decent results. Moreover, it is a concept common to various smartphone productions by Chinese developers and publishers (NetEease, in this case), who tend to conceive the mobile platform as a sort of portable micro-PC, with the positive and negatives that can arise from such an approach. As far as the former are concerned, such an ambitious approach leads precisely to introducing types of games into the mobile panorama that were not previously found there, often with even remarkable technical results, but the intrinsic defects that derive from these solutions are often linked to usability, with rhythms gaming, interfaces and control systems that are not very suitable for use on small screens. In most cases, such titles are paradoxically played more willingly on PC emulators than on the platforms for which they were intended. LifeAfter: Night Falls falls within this vision quite precisely, even if it does not lack a certain originality in certain game solutions, which is rather valuable in this area. It's a survival game in which we create a character and his dog and then try to keep them alive in a vast explorable world full of various types of threats (zombies and mutant creatures), with the need to fight, collect resources , build a shelter and possibly collaborate with other survivors. Gameplay: A mix of elements There are several suggestions that emerge when playing LifeAfter: Night Falls, given the mix of elements that make up its gameplay, including exploration, combat, crafting and social dynamics. The idea that comes closest could be that of a State of Decay with greater emphasis on crafting, given the need to balance the solo sortie with the attention to the management of a shared shelter, in this case with the collaboration of others human players. The objective is the reconstruction of some humanity after the spread of the zombie epidemic, therefore the actions are not aimed only at the survival of the individual but also at the construction and maintenance of a sort of micro-society. The mechanics of the game are set up in this sense, which alternates between fighting and crafting, searching for resources around the world and more or less organized and demanding events to obtain loot useful both for strengthening the character and improving the base. The control system with virtual stick on the touchscreen carries the intrinsic defects of this solution, even if it must be said that it is quite reactive beyond the lag that can emerge from the connection to the server. The fights are a bit cumbersome and not very dynamic due to the control system, but they are based on the use of a wide range of weapons and take place on creatures that are also different from the standard zombies, as in the events against more powerful creatures, therefore a certain variety of game situations is also noticeable. The graphics are remarkable, staging a large and detailed world, with different environments and with a good representation of character models, even if all this richness can easily burden less performing portable hardware. The major problems of LifeAfter: Night Falls emerge more in the long term and are related to the balancing of the loot and the crafting mechanics which tend dangerously towards pay to win. The simplest crafting is based on the use of found materials for the construction of new objects, as per tradition, but to obtain more precious things it is necessary to use the shards, to be invested in different tiers. These are rather rare objects which, however, do not often seem to lead to the desired results, which determines a certain frustration due to the imbalance created between the effort required to collect certain materials and the rewards obtained from them, with the suspicion that a such a severe random dynamic tends to push towards the purchase of resources with real money.", "date": "2019-09-02", "grade": "7.8"}
