{"name": "Tengami", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140955-tengami-insostenibile-leggerezza-orientale.html", "text": "Gentlemen, you have just read the world's first video game review written in the form of haiku (maybe not exactly compliant with the true rules of haiku, but be patient, you do what you can), the famous short Japanese poem dating back to the 17th century which has had so much success at home and, for some decades, also in the Western world. This is not only because the first work by NyamYam, a British studio created by former members of Rare, is set in a distant and fabled Japan, and in fact at every end of the level it also offers us a poem on this style, but also because of the lightness , the hermeticism and, alas, the brevity that distinguish it. Already available for a while on iOS systems, Tengami lands on Wii U without any substantial changes, except for a higher price. Tengami is the first work of a studio of former Rare artists, which evidently lacks a game designer. Cherry blossoms Just look at the photos around here, and better still any trailer, to immediately realize one thing: Tengami has an exceptional graphic impact. And this not by virtue of billions of polygons or technologies with a strange name that allow the pores of the protagonist's skin to be reproduced with absolute fidelity, but of a surprising artistic direction, which skilfully blends the strokes now light now clean, now very colorful now more suffused, but always incredibly poetic and atmospheric, with traditional Japanese painting and prints, with the concept of animated book, those books, so to speak, that almost certainly all of us had as children, which opened and instead of simple figures popped out (pop-up books, they are called not by chance in English) of true three-dimensional paper compositions, which reproduced landscapes or architectures, which changed from page to page and which, in the most complex and best-made works, could even be change within the same page. The whole adventure, which is essentially a classic point and click, seems to take place within such a book, with the changing settings giving rise to a very pleasant effect and many puzzles based on this concept. In short, it starts very well, you are immediately transported into the wonderful atmosphere, to which the audio department also contributes. The music is by David Wise, also ex Rare, author among other things of the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack and therefore a kind of guarantee, who however apparently is not always at ease with traditional Japanese instrumentation, especially when he uses it to compose modern and very pop tending motifs. In any case, the acoustics should also be promoted, more than for the music, which can still be listened to in the worst case, for the skilful use of silences and very atmospheric sound effects, such as the placid movement of water in a cave , emphasized by the echo and nothing more. Harakiri The experience starts off so powerfully that you hardly notice that we don't actually know exactly what we're doing. The adventure starts with our brave samurai sitting in meditation under a completely bare cherry tree; at one point he gets up and goes away, starting to wander, following the indications of the nib, through a splendid, dark forest, followed by a somewhat irritable white wolf. Only at the end of the first level do we discover what his real goal is, that is to find those cherry blossoms that will restore the lost spring to the previous tree. For a game of this kind, which focuses so much on the setting and atmosphere, and which refers in style to what are in any case books, that is, the storytellers par excellence, giving up telling a story is not a small lack. We are not referring to the method: leaving all the narrative premises in the background, light, which intervene only occasionally with very delicate interludes and even with a haiku, is a potentially valid choice that fits well with the general style of the product. Instead, we are referring to merit, which is nothing more than a weak pretext to introduce us to the splendid scenarios, when, precisely by virtue of the remarkable visual and atmospheric component, it could have dared much more. Yet, faithful to the ~Miyamotian~ concept according to which ~gameplay comes first~, we could still pass over it if the substance of the title was at least comparable to its aesthetic frame. Unfortunately this is not the case. The exploration of the scenarios, which are actually very linear, begins pleasantly precisely because the scenarios are so beautiful; but soon one realizes that on rather extensive levels the sensitive points, in which something happens, are very few, and the slowness of the protagonist, who presents only a speed in his gaita, it quickly becomes exhausting. Then, every now and then, the puzzles arrive: in reality there are two or three different types that repeat themselves continuously (not even that much, but this only by virtue of the brevity of the experience), and many are either so evident as to be devoid biting, or simply incomprehensible, only to be evident if you use the appropriate ~Clues~ option. The best are those, predictably, that are based on animated book mechanics, for example with the scenario that changes from time to time allowing us to build a road towards an otherwise unreachable point, but even these do not go beyond a mere ~trial and error ~ which stops being interesting after the first time. In short, Tengami curls up in its very basic concept of lightness resulting, with its sporadic and at best not exceptional puzzles, interspersed with long and tedious walks, a truly light and very little substantial experience, and definitively performs harakiri when it arrives to the final in a very short time. Definitely too little even for the price of 4 and a half Euros on the App Store, let alone if it rises up to 8 on the eShop! The Wii U version would also have a sort of secondary objective on its side which consists in finding the ten ~Miiverse Stamps~ hidden in the scenarios, which, as the name suggests, simply allow you to share the discovery on the Nintendo social network, again too little, as well as the ability to take advantage of HD to better admire the wonderful backdrops, which we really would never stop praising. Indeed the show on the television is magnificent, vibrant, breathtaking and delicate at the same time; but then why not provide an alternative control system to the one with the stylus? Of course, the latter is immediate and perfect for the type of game, but on the GamePad the graphics, which remain splendid, don't do the same. It must be said, in fact, that the long walks from one puzzle to another certainly allow the player to move his gaze from the pad to the big screen, and at least to feast his eyes in the midst of so much smallness and boredom. It would make you want to take screenshots of what you see on the screen, print them in full size and decorate your home and office; then, however, they could offer us this directly, a collection of splendid Japanese scenarios, without pretending to build a game around them.", "date": "2014-11-20", "grade": "5.0"}
