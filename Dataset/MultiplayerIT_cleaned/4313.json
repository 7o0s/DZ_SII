After working on Space Run, a space-themed title that combined strategic dynamics with tower defense mechanics, the transalpine team took inspiration from famous productions to try to shape a new action game with an isometric view that privileged strategic planning over to the direct management of the attack phases. Thus was born Masters of Anima, an interesting single-player experience that gives a nod to games like Overlord or Pikmin, allowing the user to shape and manage ranks of warriors at will, enslaved to the unwavering will of a resolute hero. A young apprentice and his army The story from which Masters of Anima takes its cue is very simple but functional in framing the figure of the protagonist and giving him an excuse to embark on the arduous journey that awaits him. When we first meet Otto he is no more than a young apprentice dedicated to summoning combat troops; those same creatures that centuries ago were fundamental to cage the evil and destructive power of the Golems, restore peace and usher in a long phase of prosperity for the world of Spark. Otto is still a novice of the noble art, but incidentally he is also the betrothed of Ana, who happens to be one of the most renowned and respected sorceresses of the order. Precisely because of this disparity of roles, the awkward but stubborn protagonist decides to take the test that can allow him to become a master in turn and enjoy the rank and respect required to get married to his beloved. Not even the time to complete the exam and the situation precipitates: the evil Zhar breaks the balance and frees creatures that have now fallen into oblivion, but above all he imprisons Ana by tearing her soul into three parts enclosed in as many crystals. Determined to save his partner, Otto embarks on a desperate journey in search of the stones in which the heart, head and body of the woman have been set. To succeed in his intent, he needs to learn to resolutely master the techniques learned in years and years of lazy training, and this is where the player enters the field. Otto's abilities evolve over the course of the journey, allowing him to exponentially expand the number and variety of troops that can be called upon on the battlefield. At first, you only have access to the Protectors, stubborn guardians who don't really have many problems attacking more powerful and equipped targets with white weapons, but who, if necessary, can also be useful for moving objects or destroying obstacles that slow down the advance of their leader. Continuing the story, four other units can be enabled, each with sectoral prerogatives. There are, for example, the Sentinels, legions of archers essential for carrying out attacks from medium range; the Catalimanti on the contrary soon assume a crucial strategic function, allowing you to absorb soul spheres from enemies and then convey them towards the protagonist. In this way the amount of troops that can be summoned can grow exponentially, reducing the risk of running out of resources and facing certain death, given that Otto is anything but a warrior and with the mere strength of his stick he will extract very few rabbits from the cylinder. Playstation 4 trophies Masters of Anima offers a total of thirty-one Trophies, of which 15 in bronze, 10 in silver, 5 in gold and the ever-present Platinum. Since there are no secondary modes, they can all be unlocked during the course of the story. Hoplites come to me! Clearly things start to get more interesting as soon as you gain access to the more advanced categories that make up your own small army. In addition to the factions already mentioned, the Commanders and the Invokers find space. The former are used to provide frontline support but are also able to transmit Otto's Battle Cry to nearby troops, improving the effectiveness of combined attacks. The second group is the last to be activated and, as the name suggests, has the prerogative of generating further supporters to support the protagonist. In addition to the raw combat phases, the summoned hosts prove to be fundamental for the purposes of environmental interaction and in solving small puzzles. For example, the Protectors are able to move heavy boulders or can place statues and other objects in specific places on the map, while the Sentinels have an easy time knocking down obstacles located in high positions. Since this is a title that requires an approcor strategic, Masters of Anima expects to understand how to arrange one's allies in relation to the type of opponent one has to face. The decision does not fall exclusively on the distribution in the field - which, moreover, maintains a prominent role - but also envisages the variable distribution of the troops. With some opponents, for example, it is more convenient to opt for a massive engagement from the medium range, while for others the encirclement prevents some types of attack and decreases the probability of receiving offensives capable of compromising the deployment. Often deciding to distribute units in small groups can be a great way to cover the battlefield capillarily and preclude large losses with a single well-aimed Golem attack. Obviously this choice comes to the detriment of the careful management of losses, which in any case in some situations becomes a sort of necessary evil in order to be able to progress. What has turned out to be interesting is precisely related to the fact that the aforementioned approach does not constitute a general rule. Conversely, a constant reading of the field and of the opponents you have to deal with is necessary. In this sense stimulating trial & error mechanisms end up triggering which presuppose an analysis and understanding of the most suitable approach to the situation at the moment. All these factors are subjected to a further variable that should not be underestimated: the anger of the enemies under attack. If it takes too long to eliminate a threat, it will become progressively more difficult to manage the matter and limit losses. Precisely in these situations, the areas of the arena hit by explosions or alterations of state become more frequent and end up decimating the few remaining troops in a few moments, effectively nullifying any hope of taking home the life. To corroborate everything we think the Tree of Skills, to which you have access at the end of each mission. By doing so, it is possible to invest experience points to increase Otto's abilities or increase the effectiveness of each individual unit on items such as attack power, range, resistance and more. Similarly to what happens in Pikmin, also in Masters of Anima it becomes preferable to try to sacrifice the least amount of units possible, partly because it is preferable not to waste resources and partly because, at the end of each main battle, you receive an overall rating that takes into account various factors, including the amount of direct damage Otto took during the run. From a graphic point of view we are faced with a title with necessarily limited production values, however the playful experience is overall enjoyable and satisfying, sufficiently fluid and free of technical problems. The bright chromatic tones play their part by placing the limits of the polygonal structures of characters and scenarios on the back burner. Finally, we point out that, despite being dubbed in English, the title can be used with Italian subtitles.", "date": "2018-04-10", "grade": "8.0"}
