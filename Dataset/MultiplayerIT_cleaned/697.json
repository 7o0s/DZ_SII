{"name": "Amped 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/amped-3-recensione.html", "text": "A snowboarder chasing glory. The only things Amped 3 has in common with the other episodes are the snow and the name, everything else has completely changed. The serious approach of the series has given way to a cool setting, full of references to the pop culture of MTV and the 70s, with stylish menus and cut scenes made in the most incredible ways (from animated puppets, to cartoon animations, up to patchwork-like techniques in video) in a kaleidoscope of colors and images that could very well appear on some national television channel. The story mode, which is the real heart of the game, sees the player in the role of an emerging snowboarder, who sets off, together with a group of friends, to conquer the mountains on which he gradually has to compete in descents, jumps and tricks impossible. The problem is that in the Italian version of the game only the messages that teach the techniques to be performed and those that explain the objectives to be achieved in the various missions have been translated, while all the dialogues have been left in English without subtitles, which penalizes the usability of the most peculiar feature of Amped 3 is very much. And it's a shame because the care taken in the making of the films and cut scenes is manic, in addition to the fact that it is a production rarely found in a video game. Be careful not to hit too many muzzles on the trees, however, after the boos the snowballs of the spectators will also arrive A snowboarder chasing glory. Once you have created your alter ego with a very wide range of customizations available (and many others are unlocked by progressing in the story mode), the actual game begins and here the other novelty immediately emerges. Each mountain is visible thanks to a map that indicates all the places where the events take place and on which you can move with the table, with a sled or, when you descend too much and have to go back up to reach a place you have already passed, with a snowmobile. By selecting an event, you find yourself at the closest ascent point and proceed from there until you reach the right place. To progress you have to pass the tests required for the main story but, in addition to those, each mountain has dozens of other events that are used to accumulate money to buy items and to increase one's fame and skills. A further novelty is the presence on the slopes of spectators and other snowboarders who react to the evolutions performed and which influence an approval rating which is used to accumulate the points necessary to unlock items, events and new mountains (there are seven). Be careful not to hit too many muzzles on the trees, however, after the whistles there will also be snowballs from the spectators, which fortunately can be answered with a special combination of keys and with equal malice! Very soft snow. To be able to dominate Amped 2 you had to be a master of the pad with a thousand possible combinations, performed with perfect timing. This feature must have frightened many users, so much so that with the new episode the series has undergone a sharp turn towards the speed and immediacy of SSX, unfortunately in a slightly too decisive way. In the blink of an eye, after learning the minimum necessary familiarity, you find yourself making the most incredible combinations without ever falling off the table. It is possible to chain together very long series of tricks, grinds on trees, cable cars and on the various ramps scattered everywhere, creating very high scores and spectacular sequences. Over the distance, however, the thrills given by the uncertainty of a dangerous landing or by the fear of making a mistake due to a clumsy passage are lost and the difficulty in continuing is given almost exclusively by the less and less generous time limits within which to complete the missions . if you manage to get carried away by the new game setting and are looking for some healthy entertainment, Amped 3 offers endless content Very soft snow. The sensation given by the snow is very good on all the different types of surfaces reproduced, from ice to off-piste, and the variety of tests to be overcome is high. Timed pursuits, extreme slaloms, challenges to the latest technique, up to sled trials, where you have to crash into rocks and trees to get as badly as possible, or hang gliding flight tests, in which the engine shows off polygons with no limit of horizon or clipping. In short, if you manage to get carried away by the new game setting and are looking for some healthy entertainment, Amped 3 offers endless content which, combined with the possibility of obtaining ever higher scores, the various medals obtainable and online rankings they give him longevityof great thickness. The regret remains of the lack of any multiplayer mode both online and offline, if we exclude some tests expressly designed for two players. To balance this shortcoming, a simple but effective editor intervenes which allows you to insert ramps, loops and other elements on the tracks to create even more daring routes, in order to create increasingly incredible evolutions. Very soft snow. Musical tops. Lots of snow, ice, rocks, trees everywhere, and as far as the eye can see. These are the things that Amped 3's graphics engine manages to do well and does them with a stable frame rate, adding bump mapping on all surfaces with a particular attention to the realization of the clothing of the boarders, in all the dozens of variations available. The Indie Built title manages to effectively recreate the idea of a series of vast mountains, teeming with skiers and spectators, but, undoubtedly, in the title park of this next generation start, it leaves the task of exploiting the hardware to other games of Xbox 360 more thoroughly. Apart from the elements just mentioned and the clean image given by the high resolution, in fact, the 2k games game is not surprising and fails to fully satisfy the desire for technology which undoubtedly leads to the purchase of new hardware. The speech is completely different as regards the soundtrack, which is confirmed as one of the strengths of the series. 300 original songs, from hip hop to R&B, passing through Alt Rock, Punk and Pop, which you will also find yourself listening to outside the game sessions, comfortably lying on a sofa. Comment Amped 3 is one of the games that most closely manages to recreate the spirit and feeling that identify the culture of snowboarding. Snow everywhere, over the top music and a package full of style and gimmicks that will delight lovers of this type of atmosphere, as long as they don't let themselves be held back by the lack of translation of the dialogues in the cut scenes. Fans of the series, however, will only turn up their noses in the face of such a radical change of course, which eliminates the technicality and depth that made it a unique title among games dedicated to the universe of winter sports. If the guys at Indie Built had softened the formula in more moderation and if they had managed to include an online mode in time, Amped 3 could have aspired to become one of the most complete games of the Xbox 360 launch. As it is, it remains recommended to snow enthusiasts looking for the right title to have fun, relaxing, in front of a nice TV set with an audio system capable of doing justice to one of the most impressive soundtracks around. Pros: Insane Story Mode Over 300 original songs Extremely longevity Cons: Only in name by Amped Decent graphics No online mode Winter has also arrived for the world of video games and it was practically impossible for any developer to miss the opportunity of the Xbox 360 launch in December to bring a game related to the world of snow onto the market. 2k games took care of it with the new episode of Amped, the third to be precise, after the first two chapters had been published under the aegis of Microsoft Game Studios for Xbox. Amped has always been considered the snowboard game for technicians, the real alternative to EA's SSX, with the same difference between Project Gotham Racing and Gran Turismo. The first devoted to spectacularity and the second all technique and simulation. What happens once the simulation edge is abandoned in favor of a crazy story, a cool style, and an arcade type of game that is all about jumping and speed? We asked ourselves after a few minutes with the pad in hand and you can read the answer between these lines.", "date": "2005-12-14", "grade": null}
