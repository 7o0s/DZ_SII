In a panorama of titles dedicated to the vastly populated undead, someone will perhaps remember Trapped Dead, released in 2011: it was a sort of Commandos set in any The Walking Dead, in which the internal development team at Headup Games had inserted some ideas worthy of note, however irremediably overshadowed by obvious problems of various kinds. In the review of the game written at the time, we couldn't help but highlight both things, saying goodbye with a final 6.5 and the hope of seeing something of higher quality in the future: despite the fact that for months and months we had lost track of this brand, almost forgetting its existence, a few weeks ago Headup returned to the office with a new announcement, published jointly with the Bigmoon Studios team, which was entrusted with the fate of Trapped Dead: Lockdown. For the occasion, the game dynamics of the first chapter have been set aside in this new project, presented in a renewed way in terms of men and contents, at least as regards the theory: the practice remains to be verified, and we obviously are here for that. Zombies, zombies and more zombies: Bigmoon Studios presents us with its Trapped Dead: Lockdown Is there more than zombies? Although in some aspects Trapped Dead: Lockdown wants to distance itself from its predecessor, in others it remains more or less similar to the game we saw in 2011. Starting from the scenario, typical of a classic zombie movie you can't: the story puts us in the shoes of a character who just has time to enter a town invaded by an infestation of the undead, before the authorities decide to decree a state of siege, preventing anything that walks or crawls out of it. Each of the five selectable protagonists will thus be destined to follow its own plot line, based on the choice of the feasible class between marine, butcher, assassin, sheriff and assassin, each of which comes with a different set of skills in its possession: the Hitman for example is a firearms wizard, while the exorcist uses his spiritual energy to shoot fireballs at zombies. The butcher, needless to say, prefers hand-to-hand combat, slicing everything that comes his way. In terms of gameplay, Trapped Dead: Lockdown abandons the Commandos-style dynamics of its predecessor, turning its attention more to naked and raw action: on balance it is a real hack and slash, within which those who are the same developers of Jagged Alliance: Back in Action have inserted a series of dynamics taken directly from the genre of RPGs. In short, nothing new under the sun, neither in form nor in content: by killing zombies it is in fact possible to level up, earning points to increase your attack statistics along with other tokens to spend to acquire specialized class skills. There is also the presence of inventory and equipment, with weapons and clothes able to offer different bonuses to the wearer: however, it is above all a management system with very little intuitiveness that remains impressed. A zombie in company, a zombie alone In addition to the setting, Trapped Dead: Lockdown also retains some of the problems encountered in the past from its predecessor: although the efforts made to file at least the most macroscopic gaps are evident, it is clear that the cleaning work should have gone on for some time yet . To such a picture is added a user interface bordering on nervous breakdown, which even after playing quite a bit leaves menu management at least convoluted, with parts where it is necessary to confirm one's choices through additional clicks and other where instead the changes are immediately recorded, thus leaving the player in a perpetual state of confusion. We must also take into account a lack of clarity of the skills that make up the tree of each character, selectable in a limited set to be associated with some slots on the character screen divided between active, passive or weapon-related skills. Although on the screen you get to find a sometimes high number of enemies, the poor artificial intelligence ends up ruining everything, offering situations bordering on the comical, such as the one in which a zombie arrives shotrunning towards us he inexplicably ends up backing off, suddenly starting to run in the opposite direction. In the light of a deficient artificial intelligence, using the classes specialized in ranged attack one encounters a very low level of difficulty; so low as to lead the player to give himself to the wildest hack and slash, rather than to diversify his game strategy based on the controlled class, exploiting his skills and equipment properly. The presence of a series of bosses could give the game that level of challenge that is lacking on the rest of the occasions, if it weren't also in this case for some rather macroscopic design problems: the first of the largest zombies we have encountered, for example, we took him out from afar without any problem with the exorcist hitting the cross, without even realizing he was being attacked. At this point, it is clear that not even the cooperative multiplayer mode can improve the fortunes of Trapped Dead: Lockdown: what has been the most publicized component undoubtedly offers the possibility of having fun together with three other friends between zombies and blood sprayed everywhere on the screen, mitigating with the presence of other human players all the shortcomings that appear more evident in single. In the long run, however, the paucity of the offer inevitably ends up coming out. What's good? You may be wondering at this point what is there in Trapped Dead: Lockdown that can give this title a reason to be played. Despite all the flaws, the Bigmoon Studios title offers moments of good fun, even if already inflated and seen elsewhere as the possibility of using vehicles to massacre zombies. After speaking negatively about the interface, moving on to the technical sector we can find something else good, even if we always go through ups and downs: a rather varied design of the settings is in fact contrasted with the absence of details for the different pieces of the equipment, while as regards the sound we record a good level of dubbing: it is a pity that the dialogues are substantially reduced to the bone, with obvious sentences that end up wasting the ability of the voices called into question.", "date": "2015-03-25", "grade": "5.5"}
