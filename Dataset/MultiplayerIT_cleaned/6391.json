Nanni Moretti said it in Palombella Rossa and she knows it well who has had to answer the question ~Do you find me fat?~ at least once in their life. However, how many video games do you remember where words were an integral part of the control system? In fact, none come to mind for us. In Verbis Virtus, developed by the Italians Indomitus Games, it is proposed to fill this gap, its main feature lies in fact in the ability to cast spells by reciting the magic formula directly into the microphone. The idea itself is so captivating that you just need to read the description of the game to immediately imagine yourself in a Skyrim-style scenario incinerating hordes of monsters screaming ~FIREBALL!~, as if we were an armed and pissed off version of Harry Potter. The reality of In Verbis Virtus, however, is a bit different. In Verbis Virtus gives us the ability to use our voice to cast spells! Do you speak Maha'ki? In fact, we are not dealing with a first person shooter in which the voice becomes a weapon, but rather we are faced with a puzzle game in which our words are the tool to face and overcome the various puzzles. The story of In Verbis Virtus tells of mystical and arabesque atmospheres, of a man who has dedicated his life to studying an ancient language, Maha'ki, but who now finds himself, for reasons unknown to us, in a vast desert. His only companion is an one-eyed amulet, and his only hope for life is a structure resembling the ruins of Petra, Jordan. Trapped in this mysterious temple, our alter-ego will read inscriptions that will give him complete knowledge of the Maha'ki and the ability to cast spells. We meet the first spell by venturing into a cave illuminated by crystals and luminescent flora worthy of Pandora, its name is Lumeh Tial. Feeling a little silly, but also vaguely skeptical, we press the left button and say the words, a moment later a little glow appears in our hand. Instantly, an incredible feeling of power snakes through our nervesit works! Clear your throat At this point we start doing some tests, to understand how accurate the game's voice recognition system is and we discover that it is based not so much on the exact pronunciation, but on the tone. A bit like it works with cats in short. This means that if we yell Havada Kedavra nothing will happen, but if we say ~Ueee Iaaa!~ it might work instead. Too bad that at the moment there is no possibility to customize the spells, we already had some ideas on a couple of not bad formulas. Being a game based on voice recognition, In Verbis Virtus allows you to gradually improve the word identification algorithm and to choose whether to pronounce the magic formulas in English or Maha'Ki. From this point of view we must say that the developers have done an excellent job, because we had almost no problem activating the spells for the entire duration of our test, even without acting on the recognition. Only in the most agitated phases did we notice some uncertainty. Once the (long) moment of euphoria is over, we use our newfound power to overcome a dark and crevassed area and land in a large area of great atmosphere, illuminated by a starry sky and ethereal lights, which does full justice to the Unreal Engine used by Indomitus Games. Ray of light! Here we will find the second spell, a ray of light that can be used to open doors and defend against the first threats: small creatures that run along the tunnels and can do a lot of damage when they attack in groups. Later we will encounter more serious dangers, for which we will have to take other countermeasures, but for the moment the beam of light may suffice. Thanks to the second spell we will be able to unlock a new area, in which, by tackling one of the first real puzzles in the game, we will obtain the power to activate some switches with our voice. We won't reveal what this puzzle is, but let's say that in the world of In Verbis Virtus spells are not necessarily the only solution, sometimes you have to read the texts that are scattered around and that can provide useful clues to resolve the situation. Continuing in the game we will be able to unlock powers such as telekinesis, healing or teleportation. There is also a fire spell, but unfortunately it serves more to overcome some magical walls than to satisfy role-player fantasies. If it is true that the ethereal atmospheres of the game did not go well with the mechanics of a first person shooter, from the point of view of offensive spells perhaps one could dare alittle 'more. Looking at the flaws, the game could have needed some more cleaning work. It can happen that you get stuck in a wall, the tutorial instructions are sometimes rough and sketchy (even if the whole game is obviously in Italian) and in the most excited moments the voice recognition rarely fails. In short, we see that In Verbis Virtus, despite having successfully passed the Steam Greenlight test and being available for purchase, still needs labor limae, just to stay on Latin. To tell the truth, a longer duration would not hurt either. Of course the price is low, but for 20 euros on Steam you can find titles that can last even longer than the approximately three, four hours that could be enough to finish it.", "date": "2015-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
