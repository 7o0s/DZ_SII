It is clear that the primary target is Xbox players, hence the simplified interface and the fairly basic gameplay which in the clashes between the units is reduced to a simple ~rock, paper and scissors~ system. Since this review aims instead at a PC audience, where the genre is much more established, it seems appropriate to compare the title with others in its category. Before talking about the actual gameplay and the, unfortunately few, exclusive functions of the version for Windows 10 systems, it is fair to point out that once again Microsoft has not limited itself to developing a simple port, the game uses the DirectX 12 libraries and in its settings has a complete editor of graphic options to achieve the perfect configuration based on your hardware available. Although the game interface remains similar to the Xbox version, a submenu allows us to manage and map all the keys on our keyboard, in order to have full control and be able to apply our strategies more effectively. Halo Wars 2 also comes to PC with a fun and fast-paced experience The PC experience Although the first technical impact with the PC version is excellent, we find ourselves once again with an interface particularly similar to the Xbox version, not suitable for gameplay via mouse and keyboard but still appreciable. In fact, the same radial menu for the creation of buildings, troops and for the selection of the leader's powers appears, which almost clashes since you are not playing with a controller. Camera management via mouse and keyboard is already more fluid than what was seen on Halo Wars Definitive Edition and unit selection takes full advantage of the pointer, creating a selection rectangle of the desired size, as it should always be in such a game. The only real benefit of the PC version at this point, other than the 4K resolution and unlocked frame rate, is the ability to create up to ten custom groups, for faster management of your drives. With troops selected, by holding down the Shift key plus a number from 0 to 9 on our keyboard, we can assign our selection to that group, in order to access it quickly. Although the same function is present on Xbox, unfortunately limited only to the 4 directional keys of the pad, on PC it is undoubtedly more effective and the clashes are much more thought out. While on consoles it is very simple to find yourself with a chaotic pile of units that clash, here it is easier to order and create real formations to displace our opponent. The gaming experience is good, fun, and very fast-paced that sets Halo Wars 2 apart from other, already calmer games. The gameplay remains absolutely unchanged, with the bases featuring modules for the generation of resources and energy or for the development of troops chosen from infantry, vehicles and aircraft. The control of the map, therefore, is therefore not based on taking an area richer in resources or on building any fortifications. The advantage is gained by controlling the various heights, perhaps by placing snipers or units capable of striking from very long distances, by building as many bases as possible, in order not to leave them in enemy hands and to have a faster production of resources and troops, or by blocking the passage of enemy troops by interacting with controllable bridges and barriers arranged according to the chosen setting. In closing this paragraph, the experience on PC is satisfactory, it is far removed from other titles of its genre but it succeeds with determination in its goal, which is to be a simple, intuitive and suitable real-time strategy game for a slice of wider and novice users. Is it worth it? Spending a few words on our actual experience with the title, Halo Wars 2, as already mentioned, in the PC version is far from many titles of its kind, but it is right to understand that the category of users to which it is aimed is already far from that of his fellows. Evaluating it as an RTS, we end up with a frenetic game, faster and much less technical than others, accompanied by equally elementary game dynamics. Infantry beats aircraft, vehicles beats infantry, aircraft beats vehicles, with such exceptions as anti-aircraft vehicles, anti-infantry infantry, andetc. The technical level is excellent, confirming itself as a fantastic title to be enjoyed in maximum detail, both as regards the campaign component and for the lively multiplayer battles full of satisfying effects and explosions during the battles. Despite the absence of cross play, search times have remained quite fast, similar to the Xbox One version, despite the official release of the title being scheduled for February 21, 2017, limiting the online population to Ultimate Edition owners only. A clear sign that Play Anywhere is a welcome and functional feature, given the possibility of keeping the game synchronized on two different platforms, it will not be uncommon to switch from your Xbox One to your laptop perhaps reaching your friends on one or the other platform . While we're still a long way from a great PC interface, the results are decent and the overall experience is enjoyable. When it comes to a game, the key element is often entertainment and in our case, Halo Wars 2, succeeds in its purpose admirably by offering a co-op campaign, a competitive multiplayer with various modes and maps, and the intriguing Blitz where strategy turns into a card game. Whether you're simply curious or a die-hard fan of the genre, it's still worth giving it a shot, although it's clear that the main target audience is Xbox One. Last technical note, to be used as a comparison, the game manages to run on our test configuration at 1080p and 60 frames per second with all details maxed out.", "date": "2017-02-19", "grade": "8.0"}
