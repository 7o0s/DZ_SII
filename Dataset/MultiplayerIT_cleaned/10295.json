{"name": "N.O.V.A.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73175-nova-marine-spaziali-francesi.html", "text": "Although the quality of Gameloft productions on the iPhone is rarely questionable, perhaps some more in-depth discussion could be made regarding the originality of the products of the French house, often more or less clearly ~inspired~ by highly appealing console titles. Thus, in the field of fps, after the excellent Modern Combat: Sandstorm which recalled Call of Duty, with N.O.V.A. Apple smartphone users are bound to be faced with a real Halo clone. Master Chief who? Protagonists, enemies, weapons, vehicles, levels; all in N.O.V.A. it is a sometimes cheeky reference to the Bungie title, almost bordering on plagiarism on some occasions. Whether this could possibly be a matter for Microsoft's lawyers, frankly it doesn't matter; unless you feel an unbearable revulsion for the production methods of the transalpine label, what remains is probably the best fps currently available on the App Store. The plot, really deep as a puddle, barely acts as a glue for the various levels of the adventure; the protagonist is a former soldier called by the government to fight an alien invasion capable of threatening the future of humanity. The control system is the one already successfully adopted in the case of the aforementioned Modern Combat: virtual stick for the movements of the protagonist, slides on the screen to move the gaze and some keys delegated to shooting, weapon management and the use of a special skill Able to temporarily freeze enemies. There is also a shield to represent energy, endowed with the power to regenerate itself after a few seconds and which therefore guarantees a further tactical key to the clashes. Everything works in a more than convincing way, and the possibility of acting on the sensitivity of the controls offers the ability to adapt to the preferences of each player. Certainly there isn't the reactivity or precision of a classic control via pad (without bothering the mouse and keyboard), but everything flows without frustration, with all due respect to the detractors of the touch screen. The level design, while performing its function discreetly, perhaps represents the weak point of the Gameloft production; linear and devoid of interesting insights, it merely accompanies the player from start to finish also thanks to an arrow indicating the direction to follow. Partially to the rescue come decidedly choreographic scripted elements and some puzzles, which however never deviate from the formula ~activate the X panel to continue~. However, all in all, it is a venial sin that only partially reduces the ambitions of NOVA, and which in any case does not prevent the game from representing one of the highest points of the large Gameloft catalog on the App Store. This is also thanks to the technical component, really prominent; the rocky and very fluid frame rate does not show hesitation in supporting environments rich in details and enlivened by high quality textures. The abundant dozen levels offer environments ranging from the alien ship to the forest to the snowy planet. The enemies, although in reality not very varied and moved by a rather basic artificial intelligence, offer an appreciable challenge especially if they attack in a group. In addition to the single-player campaign mode, N.O.V.A. it can also count on a robust multiplayer section both locally (bluetooth or Wi-Fi) and online for up to 4 players; in this case the game becomes a sort of Quake III, with five rather small arenas, very dynamic gameplay and the activation of the jump, which on the contrary during the story is linked only to some contextual actions.
