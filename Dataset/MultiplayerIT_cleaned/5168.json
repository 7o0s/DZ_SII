Thanks to the technological advances of today's world, there are those who do it by sitting inside an aircraft or, with greater disregard for danger, by wearing wingsuits that allow you to experience all the adrenaline of a bird's flight. For a few days now, thanks to virtual reality, there is a third possibility dedicated to those who want to fly while sitting comfortably in their slippers in their living room. To make all this possible is Eagle Flight, a title developed by Ubisoft Montreal and recently arrived on PC and PlayStation 4, with support for the most popular viewers on the market. Born as a simple demo dedicated to virtual reality, the project then expanded to become a full-fledged game, giving players the opportunity to play the role (or perhaps we should say the feathers) of an eagle. As we are about to see, Eagle Flight does its job quite successfully, so we just have to put on the PlayStation VR and spread our virtual wings. Thanks to some well-chosen choices, Eagle Flight is one of the most appreciable titles on PlayStation VR Swooping over Paris Eagle Flight presents the player with a single or multiplayer game mode, plus an additional one of free flight. As a backdrop to all of them we find a city of Paris completely abandoned by man, where greenery has slowly taken possession of the buildings, while animals of all races have populated the streets instead of cars. In this context we are called to experience the adventure of a young eagle, going through a story that starts from the very first moments of life in the nest to fall in love and beyond. It is told through a series of missions of different types, but more or less similar to those we would expect from a flight simulator. It starts from simpler tasks, such as crossing a series of circles placed in the air, and then moving on to more difficult objectives, such as making evolutions through the narrow tunnels of the Parisian subway or flying together with your partner, protecting her from the attacks of enemy birds. We soon realize that the simple initial stages are intended to familiarize ourselves with the control system, and that the difficulty level of Eagle Flight is by no means trivial; on the contrary, in the more advanced stages the game requires a growing commitment which could discourage those who do not like ~trial and error~ type mechanics. Those who want to constantly test themselves will also find an evaluation system that assigns a certain number of stars to each mission faced, thus making it replayable especially by perfectionists intent on getting the most out of every situation. In case you don't fall into the latter category, you'll have around four hours of flight in a rather pleasant way, before giving yourself up to the multiplayer mode. The latter presents a single typology derived from the classic capture the flag, in which two teams made up of three players each challenge each other to bring home the largest number of prey placed among the buildings of Paris. To do this, in addition to their flying skills, each eagle can count on a wave to shoot through its beak, capable of killing the opponents hit. Even without inventing anything new, Eagle Flight's multiplayer mode manages to entertain thanks to the presence of other human beings, which obviously gives the online game a more unpredictable and profound component. Ubisoft Montreal's effort builds its qualities above all on the possibility of testing a mastery of the ~medium~ that is far from obvious and rewarding in the successful phases, as we are about to see. PlayStation 4 Pro Like other titles released after the arrival of PlayStation 4 Pro on the market, Eagle Flight also presents some improvements dedicated to the enhanced version of the Sony home console. In particular, Ubisoft Montreal was able to give the PlayStation 4 Pro version a greater draw distance, combined with a level of detail that limits the pop-in problems found on a normal PlayStation 4. On the latter, however, the game remains fully enjoyable. Playstation 4 trophies Eagle Flight features a total of 35 trophies, divided between 1 platinum type, 4 gold, 10 silver and 20 bronze. The four gold trophies require the player to fly over 1,609 kilometers, complete the story mode, collect every collectible, and earn three stars on each mission. The rest of the trophies are divided between the two offline and online modes, in the latter case requiring the victory of 200 games, eliminating 1,000 enemies and so on.Street. We use the head Making a flight game for virtual reality presents challenges that are by no means trivial, which Ubisoft can claim to have tackled brilliantly: thanks to the ideas of the developers, the risk of suffering from motion sickness is in fact reduced practically to a minimum, even for particularly predisposed individuals. The first smart move was to put the beak of the eagle in front of the eyes of the wearer, thus giving the player the impression of being on board something instead of moving in the sky in the first person. The second guessed choice is linked to the controls, as simple as they are effective: in terms of movement, the controller is used only to increase or decrease the speed of one's flight, thus blocking the direction of movement to the one pointed to by our head. The latter is in fact determined by the movements of the player's head, who can then look towards a building or another piece of scenery to automatically move towards it. In the most intense phases of aerial combat, the possibility of performing sudden turns by tilting the head to the right or left can be useful: the greater the angle of displacement with respect to the normal position of the head, the greater the speed with which our eagle performs the 'reversal in the game. Based on the reasons just described, the only livable sensations of malaise playing Eagle Flight are linked to the muscles of the neck, to be preserved by avoiding making unnatural and sudden movements, capable of causing possible contractures. From a technical point of view, Ubisoft Montreal has adopted other wise choices, preferring cartoon-style graphics in pursuit of a level of detail that at present would be difficult to achieve on PlayStation VR. The Paris that is presented to us is thus still enjoyable from the top of the Eiffel tower and the Notre-Dame cathedral, while a pleasant soundtrack curated by the veteran Inon Zur accompanies us during our evolutions on the roofs of the French capital. In the story mode, on the other hand, the choice to use a narrative voice similar to that listenable in a documentary is appreciable, for obvious reasons more than suitable for telling the life of an eagle.", "date": "2016-11-16", "grade": "7.5"}
