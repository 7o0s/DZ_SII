{"name": "Suikoden V", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/suikoden-v.html", "text": "Once upon a time in the East... The first difference that catches the eye between this fifth episode and its predecessors is certainly the design of characters and environments: the story this time is set in the far east of the world of Suikoden, in an era between Suikoden IV and Suikoden. It is therefore another prequel, this one, and it will also show us old acquaintances and their past, such as the charismatic Georg Prime. But let's go in order. The protagonist of Suikoden V, the alter ego of the player, that is, is the prince of the Falena empire, a ~queendom~: although almost untranslatable in Italian, this word still indicates a ~kingdom~ where, however, power is held mainly by a queen. And the queen inherits from time to time the very powerful Rune of the Sun, a symbol of royalty, power and prestige. Too bad there is a side effect, as our hero and his trusty group of companions will discover, initially composed of the trusted bodyguard Lyon, the knight Georg and the combative aunt Sialeeds: in a fit of rage Queen Arshtat has in fact literally dried up a small village, ruining the life of a small people guilty of a small insurrection. Despite the peacefulness of the kingdom of Falena, it is obvious that something is changing, and with more and more countries on a war footing, the thought that a Rune is able to drive the ruler mad is disturbing. In an uproar of increasingly epic and daring events, our hero will find himself embarking on a long journey, crossing his path with the fateful 108 Stars of Destiny and a powerful and mysterious enemy who, in the shadows, plans the conquest of the Runes and the rise to an indescribable power... Starting off a little quietly and slowly, the main quest-line of Suikoden V soon reveals itself as a majestic web of events and twists: court intrigues, political plots, betrayals, deceits , heroes and assassins... there are many elements that make the plot very enjoyable, adult and full of suspense, to which must be added a fabulous characterization of the various characters, especially the main ones, rich in facets and anything but trivial. A striking example, the Prince's aunt, Syaleeds: as sexy as she is brilliant. One step back, then always forward After the very special battles in pairs of Suikoden III and those with a party of only four members in Suikoden IV, Konami has decided to recover the old style of Suikoden and Suikoden II to characterize the random clashes of this fifth episode: so we return to the party of six players, who are given individual orders at the start of turns, during the fight. However, a very original peculiarity of this traditional battle system is the possibility of changing the formation of the party, selecting it among the many that will gradually become available: by changing the arrangement of the six heroes on the field, in fact, you will get particular bonuses, adding a nice strategic element to the various fights. Of course, there are also the combined attacks and the magic of the Runes, the latter which can be equipped at will to the various characters. In its traditional nature, therefore, the Suikoden V battle system turns out to be fun and varied, and above all particularly rapid: in fact, all in all, the numerous random encounters will not weigh. On the other hand, if the exploration of the various, beautiful locations is sometimes characterized by random fights, the narrative line obviously does not fail to once again offer the pitched battles and the epic one-on-one duels that made the series famous: in this case Konami has opted for a combination of all the episodes of the series, introducing some strategic elements of Suikoden III into the mass clashes and the naval clashes of Suikoden IV, mixing everything with the classic ~scissors, stone and card~ relating to the various units that made the old wars in the initial bilogy highly enjoyable. The duels take advantage of the same Chinese morra system, this time made much more excited by a time limit for selecting the attack, and epicized to the maximum thanks to careful management of the shots and spectacular animations. Suikoden V presents itself as an RPG which lacks nothing of what makes a title of this genre complete. One step back, then always forward Having said that, Suikoden V presents itself as an RPG which lacks nothing of what makes a title of this genre complete: the locations are enormous, sometimes even excessively so, and exploration often requires a lot of time, between shops and small shops (also in this episode the weapons are strengthened thanks to the blacksmiths), coaches to learn new skills, objects to find and recover. And there's no shortage of themand canonical 108 Stars of Destiny, linked to always different and intelligent sidequests: to complete the game to the max and see the true ending, the player will have to get busy and recruit them all, using clues and intuitions. And this time Konami has thought of it really well, because there is something new: there are not ~only~ 108 characters that can be recruited, but the protagonist will eventually be joined by key characters in the story who are not part of the 108 Stars, a good ten more, some of which are ~alternative~ and others exclusive. Consequently, the operational base is inevitable: the recruitment of new characters in the Prince's army will expand the size and possibilities of the building, adding shops, mini-games and goodies of various kinds. Route change In Suikoden III it was decided to opt for fixed cameras that followed the movements of the main character on the screen, elegantly changing shot to adapt to his position, while in Suikoden IV the three-dimensional environment was completely explorable with a camera freely manageable by the player : in Suikoden V, however, Konami has preferred to adopt a classic but extremely functional system, adopting an isometric shot of the various locations in which the polygonal model of the Prince moves, in which the camera can only zoom in on him to better capture the many graphic details of the environment, which often escape the maximum distance of the camera. Thus we discover extremely refined textures and a wise use of colors that make every place a joy for the eyes, detailed with care and elegance. However, what is most striking is the direction of the non-interactive cutscenes: if the very clean graphics already leave you pleasantly amazed, it is the fluidity and realistic nature of the animations that leaves you speechless. The characters seem literally alive, in their movements and expressions, and the wonderful Japanese character design helps a lot, and the incredible attention to detail, especially for the costumes (the charisma of the Moth Knights is also due to their very elegant clothes) and for weapons. Even the fights are characterized by excellent graphics, with very fluid animations (forget, therefore, the woody ones of Suikoden III) and elegant, especially in the casting of spells and in the execution of the most spectacular combined shots. The price to pay for this very high graphic quality is a slightly above average loading duration, so much so that Konami has even reintroduced the small running sprite of the protagonist to highlight the ~Now Loading~ during the black screens between a screen and the 'other. Finally, the visual rendering is intertwined with a respectable soundtrack: although they do not reach the glories of the soundtracks of Suikoden II or the latest Square Enix masterpieces, the music of Suikoden V is varied and very pleasant, above all suitable for the various narrative segments, epic just enough in the most exciting moments, battles and boss battles in particular. One last mention obviously deserves the excellent dubbing: the interpreters have really outdone themselves, especially giving the cutscenes an impressive realism and naturalness. If the general narrative quality of the series has always been indisputable, the same cannot be said of the audiovisual quality or of the game system: especially Suikoden IV was a real slap in the face for fans of the Konami saga, despite the goodness of the gameplay all in all traditional. Suikoden V is the return to the ancient glories of the saga, at times even better than the second episode's acclaim: there is an excellent plot, unforgettable characters, a well-kept, deep play apparatus, full of details and possibilities. All blends with the tradition of the series: an army to assemble, side-quests of all kinds, pitched battles, duels to the death, secrets and goodies in profusion. The artistic quality of Suikoden V marks another point in favor of this excellent RPG, an excellent alternative to the masterpiece of the year Dragon Quest, thanks to excellent graphics (especially in design) and a more than good soundtrack. The excessive loads, the slowness of the prologue and the fights that are a little too easy are the only thorns in the side of one of the best JRPGs ever made. Must-haves. Pros Exceptional story and characters Technically well-finished Traditional yet rich and deep gameplay Cons Loads a bit too long Difficulty fluctuates It was natural that the proud Konami did not want to leave the task of closing the saga on PlayStation 2 to the disappointing Suikoden IV, but few believed that it would be able to raise one of the series from mediocritythe RPG most loved by gamers: the fourth chapter, however remarkable narratively, was certainly not up to the third episode or, even less, the second, considered by many to be one of the best titles ever made. Yet, Suikoden V not only reaches the excellent level of Suikoden II but, let's be clear, it practically surpasses it. It's a strong statement and Suikoden II fans will hardly be able to see the spiritual heir of their favorite game in this fifth chapter, but believe us: it will only be enough to pass the long prologue to immerse yourself in one of the most beautiful adventures that our hobby favorite has ever given us...", "date": "2006-07-17", "grade": null}
