It was a fighting game characterized by stages equipped with two floors on which to move freely, as well as by a control system that united all the characters and made the experience fully usable even by those who do not understand ~crescents~ and other classic combinations for the genre. Naruto and his companions could also interact with the locations, destroy objects and collect others to throw them at the opponent. The fighting techniques obviously culminated in the application of the spectacular special moves, available as soon as the chakra bar was filled. With Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 we have witnessed a mainly technical evolution of the series, with an improvement in the graphics sector but above all with a multiplication of characters and stages. The developers also tried the card of alternative modes, which put the normal one-on-one fights in an ~adventure~ context based on exploration and dialogue. For this Ultimate Ninja 4: Naruto Shippuden it was even decided that these modes should form the core of the product rather than, as previously, an extra of moderate interest, unfortunately with terrible results in terms of fun and longevity. Let's see why. master mode After the classic introductory sequence, Ultimate Ninja 4 shows us a perhaps more sober startup screen than in the past but far from concretely rich. The three modes available are the Master Mode, the Hero Mode and the Free Battle. The first is somehow an evolution of the ~adventure~ sections present in the previous episodes and is the only one that is based on the events of the Shippuden series. Naruto, in the company of the ever-present master Jiraiya, is still training to become the strongest ninja around (after all, his dream is to become Hokage of the Leaf Village) and during his training he comes across a girl who is about to offer herself in sacrifice to a demon to save your village. In an attempt to save her from such a cruel fate, the young ninja follows her inside the caves where the evil creature dwells, and there he finds numerous opponents to face. It is simply the incipit of a saga divided into two parts, which takes a few hours to complete and which stands as a ~preparatory mode~ for the Hero Mode, whose stages must be unlocked using the memory fragments that can be collected only in this context. As mentioned, the mechanics that regulate the Master Mode are the same already seen in the ~adventure~ sections of the previous Ultimate Ninjas, therefore Naruto can move freely in a three-dimensional environment, break objects to collect their contents, refer to a map to reach the areas of interest and face fights in a very different context from the one-on-one clashes we are used to. Let's also say that the Master Mode does not shine either during the exploration phase or during the fights: both are extremely boring and simplistic. The level design, in particular, practically does not exist: you proceed from south to north on the map or the opposite (in fact there is also a lot of backtracking...), while in certain situations you have to look for the right path in areas really narrow, in which perhaps the view is spoiled by the presence of an annoying fog fixed on the screen ... far from a panacea for the eyes of the player. Hero Mode and Free Battle The Hero Mode resumes the events already narrated in practically all the games taken from the Naruto anime, therefore the training with Kakashi, the clash with the ninja of the Sand Village, the arrival of Orochimaru and the departure of Sasuke. The problem is that the internships are not accessible from the start, but must be unlocked using the ~memory fragments~ collected during the Master Mode. Furthermore, not all the events to be unlocked (which are preparatory to each other) constitute a battle, indeed very often it is only a textual sequence that liquidates a phase of the story. When the fights finally arrive, they take place according to the classic mechanics of the Ultimate Ninja series but you have to complete them as if they were missions, therefore hitting certain objectives set before the clash. Dependence so much on the Master Mode actually neuters the Hero Mode, and when you get to try Free Battle you realize that this Ultimate Ninja 4: Naruto Shippuden lacks a ~story mode~ or a ~ arcade mode~, or the classic ~tournament~ in which the fights follow one anotheruntil the final showdown. Since this is a fighting game, this lack is truly inexplicable, even more so once it is noted that the total characters available have increased (now they exceed fifty) and also the internships (eighteen). Trying your hand at the Free Battle, or rather a simple quick encounter with characters of your choice, only confirms the unfortunate choices made by the developers, who instead of enhancing the fights (which from the first episode, in fact, would need some news) have made up their minds to put mediocre, slow, boring and repetitive sections of exploration first. The clashes use the control system that we already know, therefore the X button to jump, the Square to throw the equipped object, the Circle to attack (in combination with one of the four directions of the d-pad) and the Triangle to activate the chakra when you want to perform a special move. Technical realization Although the polygonal models of Naruto and his supporting characters remain the same, the graphics of the game are literally divided in half: on one side the three-dimensional environments of the Master Mode, on the other the two-storey stages of the ~standard~ fights. A division that does not reward the first mode at all, with locations that are almost not at all interactable (with the exception of the crates to be broken ), visually repetitive, devoid of detail and inspiration. The ~fog~ effect that can be seen in the early stages is really an attack on the eye, and in its mediocre realization it somewhat summarizes the general quality of these sections. On the other hand, the one-on-one stages are literally on another planet: good animations, great character design, very colorful stages with a great level of detail, as well as various interactable elements. A large number of locations have been ~recycled~ from previous installments, but the new additions are also of good quality. The special moves that use the chakra are as usual very spectacular and vary according to the ~version~ of the character (for example there are differences between the young Naruto of the first series and the adult one of the Shippuden series). Unfortunately it is not possible to enable the display in 16:9 nor activate the 60 Hz, while for the audio you can choose between the voices in English (horrible) and Japanese, in both cases subtitled. The sound sector is based on effects and sounds already heard but still effective, while the music moves between highs and lows, without however any particular peak.", "date": "2009-04-26", "grade": "6.0"}
