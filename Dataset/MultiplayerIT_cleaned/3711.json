{"name": "Pathway", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pathway-recensione.html", "text": "Pathaway is Indiana Jones in pixel art. From the Nazis, to the supernatural, passing through the occult, there really is everything, including dogs and exotic scenarios. Basically we are talking about a turn-based tactical adventure with procedurally generated scenarios and battlefields and a splash of survival here and there, which mimics the classics of the genre, however, choosing a lighter approach, despite the not exactly affordable difficulty. To the adventure We are in the thirties, on the threshold of the Second World War, and the Nazis are busy carrying out the usual research concerning the legends of the whole world to obtain occult powers that make them more fearsome. That's when Indiana J... no, Indy had nothing to do with it. In its place a group of characters committed body and soul to stop the Nazis first and then the consequences of their crazy actions. All this translates into five campaigns of increasing difficulty in which, selected between two and four characters, you have to overcome a randomly generated map by pursuing certain objectives. The gameplay is really simple and straightforward: junctions are generated on the map that form a path to the final goal. The player must follow them by facing the events that will be proposed to him. They range from simple narrative sequences, in which choices must be made through a multiple selection system very similar to that of a graphic adventure, passing through camps to be exploited for healing, shops, up to the preponderant tactical sections to which we will devote the next paragraph. The contents of the junctions are completely unpredictable, a feature that allows you to replay the campaigns several times without feeling too much the weight of failure. Too bad that the number of events is limited overall and therefore it is easy to meet again even after a short time. As we will see, repetitiveness is one of Pathway's main problems. The events are essentially used to give us some information on the scenario and to make us accumulate resources, be they new equipment or ancient artifacts to sell to obtain funds. The events also earn experience points, which allow you to improve the selectable characters. As the roguelike tradition has it, characters keep the progress made once they die, so visiting as many junctions as possible is essential to progress in the game, since the advanced campaigns require characters stronger than the base ones to be faced. It should be noted that apart from the equipment and state of the characters, the events of the junctions have no influence on the story told by the game, which is instead linear and all too predictable. The tactical sections As already mentioned, often and willingly proceeding in the expedition we will find ourselves facing the so-called tactical sections, i.e. turn-based combat that we can define a dehydrated version of an XCOM mission: once our units are positioned on the map, in an area usually very limited, we will have to try to kill all the opponents by exploiting the abilities of each character, as well as the covers offered by the scenario. The system works according to the classic consumption of action points per turn, which allows you to move, attack or use special abilities. Like everything else in Pathway, these sections start out great, only to become dull over time. Meanwhile, they all look alike from the start to the end of the game, apart from the different enemies (undead, Nazis, various creatures and so on). Also they are really badly designed. For example, the positioning phase is completely useless, since in most cases the enemies are not seen before they move and sometimes it is not even clear where they will come from, since they appear on the map without criteria. The rest is even worse, because the only real choices to make concern the covers, since the enemies think like tanks. In fact, artificial intelligence in most cases limits itself to advancing the opponents towards our units, with the difficulty dictated by their number and by the fact that it is often not clear where they come from. Forget the encircles of XCOM 2, or the refined maneuvers of Mutant Year Zero in short. In Pathway the CPU deigns at best to use some cover, even if not always the best available, and then engage in absurd behavior such as stepping back in front of one of our half-dead men or aiming at an alternative target instead of delivering the coup de grace to one who is already weary. This doesn't mean it's an easy game, just that there is no explanation for some behaviors, exceptand perhaps the desire to make it more affordable for the average player. Another big problem concerns the selectable characters: it is true that they all have unique skills, but in the long run the game system does nothing to differentiate them that much and in strictly tactical terms it makes little difference to use one or the other. The result is a trivial gameplay that constantly gives hope for some evolution that never comes. By playing, new characters are unlocked and the advanced enemies have slightly more complex attack patterns than the first ones and do more harm, but basically the strategies for dealing with them are uniform. Gorgeous pixel art From a technical point of view Pathway is a show, so much so that it is almost species to see such a beautiful pixel art used for such a silly title. All game objects are beautifully drawn, with excellent use of the graphics palette. The lighting system is also done with great skill, so much so that at times it is hard to believe that this is a 2D title. In truth there isn't a single element that is poorly designed or subdued, and it almost hurts to see such work wasted on gameplay that can't keep up with it. The only flaw, if we really want to be picky, is the repetitiveness, in the sense that in the long run the recycling of scenarios makes itself felt a bit. However, there's really nothing to complain about, considering that the areas and maps are procedurally generated. The soundtrack is also excellent, clearly inspired by Indiana Jones' Williams. After all, Pathway was born from there, so it is normal that the references are strong even in the soundtrack.", "date": "2019-04-19", "grade": "5.5"}
