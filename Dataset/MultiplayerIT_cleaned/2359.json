The work of Terrible Posture Games was released last year on PC (through the Epic Games Store, still available now for free), but only now arrives on the console of the big N (for a fee). Let's see what we think in our review of 3 out of 10 Season One. 3 out of 10 Season One | Review 3 out of 10 Season One: Meet the main cast of the game 3 out of 10 is described by the developers themselves as a ~playable sitcom~. The game is divided into five episodes of approximately 30 minutes each. We will follow the story of a ramshackle team of developers, Shovelworks Studios, who are working on a new game. The adventure begins when Midge, an animator, joins the studio to replace the previous animator who literally exploded from overwork. The premise and the whole plot are built on the absurd, with the aim of treating the internal problems of a development studio lightly. Over the course of the five episodes we expect, for example, human sacrifices and dystopian companies using war robots. The cast of 3 out of 10 consists mainly of the eight team members. Each character is extreme and comically symbolizes the most negative figures in the industry. Viper, for example, is the artist of the group and wants to impose his own tastes on each game (extreme gore, inspired by his favorite video game series, basically a parody of Gears). Then we have the human resources officer, Francine, who seems disinterested in the well-being of her colleagues. How not to mention Jeb, the CEO of the company who has no idea how the development of a video game works and is only able to issue senseless orders. Each episode touches on hot spots in the world of development, such as the relationship with fans who are immediately ready to tear apart (literally) a studio because a video game does not meet their expectations. There is also talk of the world of education being more interested in making money than actually teaching students how to work in this industry. Or even just the need to restart development after years, because management suddenly changed their mind. Furthermore, the fulcrum of the story is the vote of the game: that ~3 out of 10~ (3 out of 10) which is the title of the work. Indeed, Shovelworks Studios is a terrible development studio and all of their games have never received more than three in critical reviews. Midge, our ~protagonist~, has joined the team to make sure that doesn't change. In fact, the girl is being blackmailed by a shady figure who appears to be part of a secret government agency. Why did an unknown group of developers get the attention of someone so important? Why is the quality of a video game the subject of a conspiracy? We won't find out. Already, 3 out of 10 Season One gives us no answers and defer any explanation to a Season 2 that is ~coming soon~. Herein lies one of the main problems of the game: the general plot is almost nothing. Each episode is semi-independent and chronicles one of the aforementioned ~world development hot spots~. The characters themselves are not deepened and remain anchored to their initial characterization. Even in terms of writing, the adventure hardly comes across as comical. The criticism of the world of development is intriguing and reading between the lines will make the most informed enthusiasts smile, but it won't make them laugh. We're not talking about a Big Bang Theory or an interactive How I Met Your Mother. Minigames what a passion 3 out of 10 Season One: The battle royale themed minigame Clearly we are always talking about a video game, so in addition to the narrative there is an interactive side. 3 out of 10 offers us a whole series of mini-games: Terrible Posture Games has staked everything on variety, almost in an attempt to cover most videogame genres. We will have a kind of sports game inspired by American football, a stealth section, arcade driving games with timed checkpoints, 2D brawler, a Legend of Zelda-style dungeon crawler (the original), a pinball machine, some puzzle games of various genres and more. Each minigame starts, ends, and is never repeated. The effect is that we will never be bored by the more playful side of 3 out of 10, but at the same time this means that the game does not have a precise videogame identity. Each minigame will be immediately forgotten, also because victory is not mandatory: they can even be skipped without any penalty. Minigames only reward us with stars, a collectible. Some are also hidden throughout the levels and must be found by exploring. Not that therereason to do so, if not the simple desire to complete the game 100%. 3 out of 10 Season One: The Driving Minigame", "date": "2021-03-02", "grade": "7.0"}
