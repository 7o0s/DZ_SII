The future no longer exists, in the sense that the human race is doomed to extinction. Who can save us if not the two most scurrilous protagonists in the history of video games? Time Gentlemen, Please! is a graphic adventure that makes nonsense its leitmotif, presenting absurd situations, hallucinating and unconventional puzzles and, above all, a deadly verbosity. Combine the huge amount of text present with the general vulgarity of the dialogues and you will touch the sublime with a finger (but also with an armpit). Among the options it is possible to adjust the level of racism of the dialogues, but why deprive yourself of it by taking away a large part of its appeal from the game? Obviously everything is played on a comedy level and there is nothing really offensive, unless you have signed up for the Moige. Playing we got lost in the whirlwind of irreverent jokes and surreal situations that make up the narrative, only feeling sorry when we got to the end. It had been years since we had been involved in an adventure so overflowing with text, to the point of passing over some flaws that failed to ruin the feeling with Ben and Dan, flaws due mostly to the general poverty of the production (which, however, demonstrates how it is possible to create something interesting with little, both in terms of play and style). Magnum P.I. is waiting for us! Despite the chosen style, evidently not aimed at realism, it should be noted that the puzzles are never absurd or impossible to solve. Of course, there is no shortage of paradoxical situations that require you to think in terms of the game, but there is never the feeling of having been deceived and, above all, if you read the dialogues well, you can often get hints to move forward. There are actually some defects and it is fair to mention them. First you need to know English well, otherwise most of the jokes end up in vain becoming impossible to catch. Secondly, the interface is a bit cumbersome and requires that to perform each action it is necessary to select a specific icon by pressing the right mouse button. The most complicated part, however, is the management of the objects in the inventory, with the pointer going outside the borders causing it to close unexpectedly. Nothing dramatic, really, but in the long run it can be annoying, especially when you have to open it many times in a row to take or combine objects.", "date": "2009-11-30", "grade": "9.0"}
