In an attempt to free himself from the curse that afflicts all those who have worked with the sands of time, the Prince will have to go to the place where the magic powders were created, go back to the past and stop their genesis: only in this way can he save by the demon Dahaka who haunts him. This being brings with it one of the novelties of the Warrior Spirit given that in some sections we will be chased by this infernal creature and the usual difficulty of the game will be added to those of performing the right combination of actions in a limited time. Initially one is almost thrilled to face these passages but it must be admitted that the coordination developed in these points will later make the various schemes easier to deal with. The other component that has taken on a much higher thickness is that of the fights, the aspect which, together with an inadequate longevity, was one of the weak points of the first episode. From this point of view, one can only praise the work done by the Ubisoft programmers: even if the ~perfection~ of a Ninja Gaiden remains at another level, this time the Prince proves to be decidedly mature also in his action component thanks to a set of varied combos that allow him to produce spectacular sequences worthy of the best action movies. The interaction with the walls and columns will prove to be not only useful, but decidedly inviting to make the deeds of our noble digital alter-ego even more fascinating. And this time some end-of-level ~boss~-like peeps out that will represent a decidedly inviting variation on the theme. The Prince's Gymnastics Even if the sense of surprise that had enveloped me during the experience of the first episode could not inevitably return, the platform component has remained the real strong point of the Prince: the immense rooms in which to find the most unusual handholds for flying and/or jumping from one side to the other, they continue to exert an immense fascination and few games manage to bewitch the way Prince of Persia does. Our digital alter ego continues to enchant us with his ~Yuri Chechi~ movements of videogames and even if the programmers wanted to play too much in some points in making the search for the way out complicated, we can only commend the core of the Warrior Within interactive experience. Fortunately, once again there will be the powers of time which, in the event of errors, will limit the number of curses directed at the programmers. ...the immense rooms in which to find the most unusual handholds to jump from one side to the other, continue to exert an immense fascination... Perplexities arise instead in the choices made to make this second episode more durable and long-lived than Sands of Time. If the lack of extras cannot be considered a problem, the decision to implement a large dose of backtracking (ie revisiting the same places in different circumstances) did not satisfy me at all. Surely in this way the hours of play are definitely increased (although there is no timer, let's say that we should be around 8pm) but at times, a repeated viewing of the rooms of the immense building (which turns out to be the only room of gameplay for the vast majority of the adventure) will lead to a vague sense of boredom and repetitiveness and this could be jarring. Princely visions Coming therefore to comment on the audiovisual aspect, I can tell you that the one for PC is undoubtedly the best version from a graphic point of view than those for the three home consoles. A medium-level configuration (1.5 GHz processor and 128 megabytes of video memory) is enough to set the graphic parameters to the maximum and not encounter excessive problems in the frame rate. In this way, on your monitor you will see in addition to excellent particle effects, a truly high detail of environments and characters so much so that in some rooms (remember the second tower then you will tell me ...) you stop for a few seconds to admire all the interactive elements present and moreover of mammoth dimensions. The excellence of the animations has further increased compared to the first episode as well as the reproduction of light / shadow points (from this point of view at Ubisoft they really have a particular quid ... just think of Splinter Cell ...). However, the character design has not yet been promoted given that in addition to the Prince himself, the outline of the belligerents and the scantily clad beauties whoevery now and then they will peep out, fail to achieve the goal of that glamor they tend to but do not arrive. Even the musical component has undergone that dark metamorphosis we mentioned earlier, presenting itself with decidedly rock-like motifs and melodies that recall Arabic and oriental scales. The end result is good but a numerically more substantial tracklist would have been more favorably received. The localization in Italian remains at sufficient levels even if we would have gladly done without some Halo-style voices. The dubbing of the Prince by the handsome and dark Gabriel Garko is more than enough but, if it hadn't been written on the game packaging, at least whoever is writing to it would never have recognized the actor's voice. Comment The return of the Prince of Persia on our hard drives can only be greeted with joy on our part. The sequel to Sands of Time confirms that Ubisoft's noble saga is undoubtedly the best action-platform production on PC and Warrior Spirit, while losing the surprise effect of the first episode, confirmed the programmers' great level design skills. In the list of merits, a prominent position deserves the combat system revised in an appropriate way and which also guarantees a certain thickness to the title from this point of view, even if still far from the ~perfection~ of Ninja Gaiden. The new dark attitude of the Prince should also be promoted which, although probably generated by marketing reasons, appeals to the right point. If PoP 2 does not reach a full 9 but stops at some decimal below, it is due to the presence of an excess of backtracking which leads at certain moments to a sense of boredom (and then it is better for a game to last a few hours less. You don't find ?). However, venial sins that only minimally affect a decidedly positive total judgment. Pros: Platform component at the highest level The dark attitude is fascinating Improved fights... Cons: ...but far from the ~perfection~ of Ninja Gaiden Excessive backtracking Some definitely avoidable style lapses Welcome back Prince! Just one year after its arrival in style on the latest generation consoles and PCs, the Ubisoft title returns in a new reincarnation. After the spectacular introduction and the interactive tutorial on board a ship in a storm, the first annotation is certainly the style adopted: forget Sands of Time and its 1000 and one night atmospheres. Warrior Spirit is far from a fairy tale and in addition to dark and decidedly dark colors (however appreciable), the buttocks on display of a very bad opponent and other avoidable style falls (such as the sadomasochistic allusions of the enemy warriors) immediately make it clear that the not too hidden intent of the programmers was to interest a more mature audience, accustomed to the crimes of Grand Theft Auto, the beheadings of Mortal Kombat or the slang exclamations of Need For Speed. It is more than legitimate to operate under these profiles and we did not mind the change of attitude at all but certainly some elements turn out to be a little too kitsch, above all in reference to a very noble series... in every sense.", "date": "2004-12-15", "grade": null}
