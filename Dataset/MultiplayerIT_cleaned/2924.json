{"name": "Kandagawa Jet Girls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kandagawa-jet-girls-recensione.html", "text": "There are anime - and consequently video games - born exclusively to tickle the imagination of the public, in which sexualization is the key word and the plot is as useful as Julian Ross's cardiologist. The review of Kandagawa Jet Girls talks about a game that is one of these and saying to follow it for something other than the generous shapes of its protagonists is a bit like, in reverse, justifying that Free! you watch it for plot as you rattle off the entire anatomy textbook on Makoto's back. Born as a multimedia project by Kadokawa, Marvelous and Egg Firm, it began in the autumn of 2019 with an animated series and can be said to be still in an embryonic phase, since it lacks all the corollary that surrounds these productions: films, action figures , OVAs, pillows, mousepads, et cetera. However, a video game was developed, Kandagawa Jet Girls precisely, released in Japan in January and migrated to the western coasts only recently. Story and structure of the game Although marginal, a story exists in Kandagawa Jet Girls and focuses mainly on the duo, also the protagonist of the anime, faithfully reproducing their plot: Rin Namiki, determined to follow in her mother's footsteps by becoming a legendary Jetter, crosses her path with Misa Aoi and the the two together will climb the rankings to win the Kandagawa Cup. In their ascent to success they will face the most disparate contenders, as much as the motivations that drive them to compete: from honour, to pride up to the conquest of the last keychain in the shape fish for sale in the shop - no, it's not a joke but it shouldn't surprise you. In case you have already seen the anime, the story of Rin and Misa may not interest you that much but the game allows you to wear the skimpy clothes of the other participating couples as well, offering a little insight into the character and personality of the girls. Each campaign is developed through twelve missions, the focus of which is obviously the competition after a short interaction between the characters. There are eight levels within which to compete and although we cannot deny them the vivacity of the color palette, we are quite lacking in terms of differentiation. Of course, Kandagawa Jet Girls is an adorable (kawaii, they would say at home) product, with bright colors and presented through a visual style... let's say prominent however, beyond this, the gameplay itself is reduced to a minimum, becoming repetitive and very predictable after just a few races. Deep without being funny The main problem with Kandagawa Jet Girls is that it's not fun. Looking closely, you can see the basis of what could have been an idea along the lines of Mario Kart in jet ski sauce and with protagonists from fifth upwards - where by fifth we do not mean gear. Power-ups of different types, weapons and special objects to be used in battle, together with exclusive stunts and obstacles to avoid, could have made the game engaging in that carefree way that all in all can be found in products aimed at pure fanservice. Fighting with shotguns or water pistols while our partner, guided by artificial intelligence, maintains control of the track could have had its absurd charm if the races hadn't been so simple to take us into first position after less than thirty seconds , and then leave us for the next few minutes to go around in circles on our own. Many racing games have elastic AI, where opponents can always catch up to us in order to create a certain sense of challenge - here, however, it is not achieved. The initial doubts regarding the depth of the racing mechanics have been dispelled, because in fact the elements needed to do a good job are there (including the possibility of modifying your jet ski so as to make it more efficient), only they are not used properly. The problem is not in the content but in the form in which it is proposed: slow, with water physics bordering on the acceptable, too simplistic and with repetitive levels. Adding further downside is the fact that the slow gameplay is a sort of necessity to avoid constant screen flickering - at least for the PS4 Pro version. There is no sense of challenge in Kandagawa Jet Girls but even setting aside any glitches in difficulty, one does not feel involved in the slightest and has to fall back on a series of pleasant, albeit short-lived, secondary activities. Considering that we are talking about a game inspired by an ecchi anime, it is not surprising to find a minigame in which the pilot washes her jet ski but there are even moreh and others no less bizarre. The points obtained in these extra activities can be spent on customizing girls and vehicles, an aspect of which the game is not lacking like other Marvelous titles. The problem, however, is always there: the minimum of involvement offered does not go through the main aspect, the competition.", "date": "2020-09-03", "grade": "5.0"}
