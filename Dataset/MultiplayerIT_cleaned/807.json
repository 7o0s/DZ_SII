{"name": "Recensione NHL 06", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-nhl-06.html", "text": "With the 2004 edition, which certainly improved the defects of the previous one, which was absolutely too arcadey, the EA saga resumed its imprint halfway between immediacy and simulation and, like 2005, the 2006 edition continues along the same lines. The Canadian programmers have included several innovations that we will immediately analyze and which, in a context that is always cared for and perfected beyond belief by all the official statistical data offered by the NHL and NHLPA license, make the title really interesting and at least worthy of being tried. First of all, the biggest novelty is represented by the possibility of skating and deceiving opponents with feints and counter-feints using the left analog stick, this obviously allows you to always invent new solutions and makes the offensive game truly spectacular and satisfying. The evolutions reserved for champions were then confirmed, which can also be performed here using an analog stick, this time the right one, and which allow you to easily avoid the opposing defenders. These two possibilities offered, focusing much more on spectacularity and simplicity of execution, risk in fact making any scoring too easy, we therefore advise you to set a level of difficulty from medium to high to enjoy a healthy and competitive challenge . always inventing new solutions makes the offensive game truly spectacular and rewarding Another decidedly positive addition is given by the new sniper scope that allows you to control the strength and direction of each shot thanks to the movement of the right analog stick. Every time we press the button to make our shot, a small crosshair will appear in the goal net thus allowing us to place the puck over the goalkeeper's shoulders with surgical precision. The biggest flaw that we have found is that the whole game perhaps lacks a bit of ~reactivity~, given that the developers, focusing a lot on the animations of the puck, the hockey stick to be clear, and the possibility of feints by moving it, have certainly distanced from other titles of the past in which the puck and the bat seemed glued, however to the detriment of the reaction speed of our champion. However, we really liked the new control system, with all that it entails. THE RUSH IS BACK The real heart of the game is certainly the Dynasty Mode, in which we will have to manage a franchise as an executive-manager in an attempt to make it the most prestigious of all time. Certainly not a mode for everyone, given the wide range of statistics and data to be taken into consideration, but a simple and well-maintained interface still facilitates the hard work of a ~Moggi of Hockey~. A convenient system of fictitious emails informs the player of the news and of the most important decisions to be taken, thus facilitating management. The possibility of taking control of a team even during the current season was then added, in order to be able to revive a franchise in crisis and thus be rewarded, in the event of a positive outcome, with generous rewards. Technically we must say that the programmers have done a valuable job and the control system certainly gives the player great freedom, totally favoring the offensive and spectacular game THE RUSH IS BACK Finally, we cannot forget the well-kept editor, truly surprising, which allows you to recreate a hockey champion from scratch, do we want it similar to us in appearance? A few adjustments and our virtual clone will be ready. We will then be able to insert him in any of the teams of the league and he will be treated, and possibly exchanged, as if he had been a professional in the sector for some time. Technically we must say that the programmers have done a valuable job, the control system, which we have already talked about, certainly gives the player great freedom, totally favoring the offensive and spectacular game. The physics of the disc and the animations of the players are of considerable importance, and if at a first quick analysis the whole graphic sector seems almost the same as last year's, after a few games we will notice the graphic improvements inserted in the polygonal models of the players or in the game menus themselves. Finally, let's not forget the possibility of playing online on the Electronic Arts servers, in the countless games we played the connection has always remained stable and fluid. An excellent option, already present in the 2005 version but which is a pleasure to find again, giving the possibility not only of creating single games but also real tournaments on Xbox Live. EA anticipates winter by bringing us to the cold of the NHL hockey arenas, and it does it with quality and some innovation. We really liked the control system that opens up new possibilities for lovers of spectacular action. As always, a level above all other games, the statistical sector, licensed by the NHL and NHLPA, and the similarity of the polygonal models with the real champions of the American league. The confirmation of the online mode can only make all Xbox Live subscribers happy, who will thus be able to continue the challenges already undertaken with the previous chapter. Definitely one of the best hockey titles released for this generation of consoles, we go too far stating that it could perhaps be the best, EA has really done things right this time around. Pros New control system Very nice both in appearance and content Online mode Cons Low level of difficulty Very demanding season for newbies Cross-platform NHL 06 is also available on PlayStation 2, Nintendo Gamecube and PC. The substance of the EA title remains unchanged in the different formats and above all, at least from a graphic point of view, the PC version stands out, which is very similar to the Xbox one. The online features are obviously present for all platforms except for the Nintendo console. On the online game front, we only had some problems with the Sony service, which sometimes presented a certain delay between the interaction with the joypad and what was present on the screen. Also very punctual this year, hockey made in Electronic Arts lands in the Italian shores hoping to capture not only the attention of the small group of fans of this sport, but also the less savvy players and more arcade lovers.", "date": "2005-10-14", "grade": null}
