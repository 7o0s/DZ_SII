{"name": "Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crusaders-thy-kingdom-come-recensione.html", "text": "Point of the situation A brief summary of what was said in the previous episode: Crusaders is a rather classic RTS, which is more reminiscent of the Ground Control mechanics than those of the good old Age of Empires, seasoned with interesting role-playing elements. Your game will begin with having to choose which leader to play, among a pool that goes from a fictitious Roger of Hastings, up to Robert of Naples, passing through the various Lothar, Goffredo, Pietro Luigi and Pierpaolo of Terni (no, this doesn't exist for fortune). your game will begin with having to choose which leader to play, among a pool that goes from a fictitious Roger of Hastings, up to Robert of Naples, passing through the various Lothar, Goffredo, Pietro Luigi and Pierpaolo of Terni Point of the situation The choice will not be an end in itself, but will bring precise bonuses and maluses that will follow you for the entire campaign: by opting for a Hero you will be able to obtain considerable advantages from a military point of view, perhaps being able to deploy heavy troops from the beginning of the game or you can count on fast riders, but you will have to deal with the disadvantages that this choice could bring from an economic or religious point of view. The game mechanics don't just end in mere combat, but will also require you to do a lot of micro-management work when you and your soldiers return to camp. Strategy The management aspect of Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come will take place between one battle and another: you will have the task of administering not only which troops to recruit, but also their training, the skill points acquired and any captain appointments. All of this, obviously, will require the investment of a lot of hard cash: currency that you can acquire by successfully completing the primary objective of your missions, but also by carrying out a whole series of secondary quests assigned by the other factions participating in the great crusade (we refer you in the box on the side for further information). The reward will not only be vil money, but also reputation points, which you can use to obtain favors from allied factions and tasty bonuses, and faith points, a real innovation of this new Hungarian game. Faith, used many, too many times to justify bloody massacres, in this innocent title will have the function of guaranteeing your troops indispensable bonuses to face the angry Turks and to guarantee your troops the indispensable resistance to fatigue that crossing a fiery desert brings : it will only be religious furor that will give the soldiers the vigor (another parameter to consider) necessary to not succumb to the first assault. As the most experienced players will know, it is tremendously risky to tire your troops by making them run from one part of the map to another: if the vigor value (identified by a colored dot) becomes reddish, get ready to suffer heavy losses , even against opponents much weaker than your units. Tactics Comment We must not fall into the mistake of considering Crusaders as a clone of Medieval 2; in reality, it is a title that boasts excellent graphics and decidedly valid game mechanics, especially since the classic mission structure is lightened and enriched by the possibility of dedicating yourself to the management of your troops. However, the game is plagued by some problems: the first is given by the heaviness of the engine, which, while giving truly exceptional glimpses and battles, limits itself to generating a maximum of 30 frames per second, leaving you dangerously at the mercy of collapses in fluidity. Another criticism is given by the repetitiveness: the alternation between missions and management is very fun, the variety of objectives and situations too, but in the long run it can lead to boredom, despite the over 40 missions available. For the rest, Crusaders is an extremely enjoyable game, which will cheer up this March, not too rich in RTS thanks to its reduced selling price. long can be boring The Quests If you think that the objectives are simple ~destroy the enemy~, ~defeat all enemy units~ you are wrong: often you will have to defend villages, exploit the darkness for stealth operations, free prisoners, assassinate enemies and, of course, conquer cities. In short, a fairly faithful reconstruction of the First Crusade, albeit with some welcome licenses: plate armor was invented many years later, for example. Poetic license, but which make their dirty impression thanks to the splendid graphics. Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come is available for PC.
