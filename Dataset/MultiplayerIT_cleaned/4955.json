The production, on the other hand, is one of the interesting ones and although it proposes multiple mobile game mechanics, behind it there are the minds of those Frozenbyte geniuses. If the name of the software house in charge of the project made you ring some bells, it is because you may have already tasted some of their work in the past, perhaps thanks to the surprising Trine 2. Has-Been Heroes, however, is a very different game, a title that puts on the physics side and spectacular settings to focus everything on the gameplay. We find ourselves in our hands a roguelike of those who do not forgive, a difficult and often frustrating game but which hides original ideas and some nice gimmicks under this hardcore title skin. A mix of elements that has led Has Been Heroes to be evaluated in a confused way, criticized above all by those who have failed to appreciate or understand its more complex mechanics and idolized by those who have instead overcome the steep initial barrier. The truth, in our opinion, obviously lies somewhere in between. An excessively difficult and punitive title, to the point of being frustrating in many of its aspects Because studying is important but fighting more The heroes of the kingdom are now retired. The great white dragon was defeated years ago, and with no threat to the kingdom, retirement has come early for our leaders. However, the king has one last very important task for his brave soldiers: to accompany the two princesses on their first day of school. However, the road to reach their destination will not be easy since hordes of undead have awakened with the intention of killing the two heirs to the throne. The plot, as you may well understand, is rather unrealistic and we sincerely would have preferred something more significant to guide our deeds. We perfectly understand the desire to keep the tone light and light-hearted but a further stimulus to continue the adventure would still have been appreciable. Instead, you will find yourself playing just for the sake of progression and when this fails you may decide to leave the game prematurely, without the worry of missing an interesting story. And trust me, there are plenty of reasons to abandon Has-Been Heroes. The Frozenbyte production will slap you, use you as a rag and then throw you into a corner. It is a title that does not forgive, which does not allow deconcentrated games made to spend a few carefree hours and there is nothing in the whole adventure that can make you think that you have reached a point of arrival. Every time you take a step towards completing the game, Has Been Heroes will put you in front of an even more difficult challenge, throwing you back into the abyss from which you have been trying to climb since the very first start. It's certainly not the first punishing roguelike we've played but we believe that the developers have gone really hard this time and the line between difficulty and frustration is just too thin. To go ahead in Has-Been Heroes you need determination and knowledge of the game mechanics or the first level could also be the last you will see for an infinite number of games. What's so difficult? There are very few things to say about the gameplay itself. With a two-dimensional and three-lane structure, the title will launch hordes of undead against you and you will have the simple task of knocking them down one by one as if it were the most classic tower defense. To get to damage the skeletons, however, you will first have to destroy the stamina bar that protects their life points and, only then, try to kill them permanently. Stamina is the most important element of Has Been Heroes, the one everything revolves around. The simplest enemies will have only one square to remove while the most difficult opponents, or bosses, can even have over fifty units. Every single attack that your heroes bring to the enemies serves to remove one of these squares and once finished the enemy will remain stunned for a few seconds, giving you time to reload the attacks, reorganize your ideas and launch the decisive assault. What complicates a system that at first glance seems basic is the number of predetermined attacks available to each hero, which will require painstaking planning to ensure that the number of attacks is precisely aligned with the enemy's resistance, on pain of nullifying all your efforts up to that point. It's the classic case of actually seeing how it worksona everything is simpler than explaining it, which is why we refer you to our dedicated live. The number of enemies on the screen and the speed of execution required then raise the difficulty until it is intolerable for the average player. To this you will obviously have to add recharge spells and abilities, spells with effects that can be combined with each other and even hundreds of items to buy, so as to improve the statistics of your heroes as they progress through the labyrinthine levels of the game. As if you were in a gamebook, you will be able to decide which road to follow, which crossroads to take and which battles to avoid, simply by clicking on the direction you want to follow. It is in this that Has Been Heroes could have given much more, adding a more marked narrative to the player's choices, perhaps guiding them through drawn scenes or the classic humor of the Finnish software house. The progression is mechanical instead, a continuous search for chests and sellers in a desperate attempt to enhance the heroes, a situation that bursts like a soap bubble with yet another inevitable death. Has Been Heroes adopts a permanent death system and at game over you will lose all the objects collected, the keys to open the chests and even the spells collected up to that moment. You will only be able to keep the souls of defeated enemies to be delivered to the gates of heaven, souls that will guarantee you in a new game to find new objects in the chests, in a substantially infinite cycle. In the lucky event that you manage to complete three entire dungeons you will then obtain the soul of a new hero (there are about thirty to unlock), equipped with unique spells and abilities and in possession of different combat mechanics. The heart of the game, however, remains almost unchanged, proposing a marked repetitiveness, taken for granted for the genre but perhaps too pressing given the amount of attempts that will be required to complete the title. The story is light-hearted and the design of the characters follows this slightly light humor, visually and even through funny animations, even if not particularly cared for. However, those colors and that visual impact that made us fall in love with Trine are missing. The special effects are nothing memorable and the endless hosts of undead that we will face do not bring the variety necessary to stimulate curiosity in the player, who will not feel eager to get further to find out which enemies await him. Of course, there are skeletons armed with two-handed swords that kill us with a single blow, skeletons that heal, skeletons that make themselves invulnerable and armored skeletons but we are always talking about a pile of animated bones and the variations on the theme are essentially irrelevant.", "date": "2017-04-03", "grade": "6.0"}
