The Swedish development team practically invented a genre on mobile, taking advantage of the touch screen to allow players to literally control a bike or skateboard with two fingers and perform crazy stunts in order to score as high as possible .In this case the vehicle is different, it is the dreaded scooter, but the concept is the same: using the index and middle fingers as if they were our character's legs, we will have to control the direction of the infernal contraption we are on, take the traditional ramps and produce more and more elaborate tricks. Gameplay Touchgrind Scooter includes scenarios with even dynamic elements. On the gameplay side, Touchgrind Scooter is one of those games whose functioning is easier to prove than to explain. It's really about driving a scooter with two fingers, in this case through seven scenarios (three accessible for free, four for a fee: 9.99 euros for the complete package) and three different modes, all characterized by the same focus: performing stunts and scoring points. The mechanics now hide very few secrets for those who have already tried any episode of the series: you can perform various types of rotations, combine several maneuvers together and so on; the important thing is then to resume the right attitude before landing, on pain of a disastrous fall and the reset of the adrenaline counter, which acts as a multiplier. Touchgrind Scooter asks you to perform stunts by controlling the scooter with two fingers. In short, don't expect big news, beyond a general refinement of the experience (but the controls are still a bit difficult and not very precise when it comes to steering) and a progression system that appears relatively generous at first but then is more stingy, forcing you to try and try again the paths already beaten to find the record and maybe take shortcuts that we hadn't noticed at first. Ultimately, there is no shortage of variety: the aforementioned three modes consist of a free session in which to ring tricks before the finish line, a challenge in which we are asked to correctly perform certain maneuvers in sequence and an asynchronous competitive multiplayer in which we can challenge a friend to whoever can do better in the same scenario. Structure Touchgrind Scooter, one of the more colorful settings in the campaign. As mentioned, the contents that Touchgrind Scooter makes available to us are a sort of demo, with three freely accessible scenarios (provided, however, that certain levels of experience are reached) and four that must necessarily be purchased: it is a now a traditional approach for the series, but the fact remains that 9.99 euros are a lot for a package like this. Fortunately, the settings all turn out to be quite interesting, they boast backgrounds and characterizing elements, but above all alternative paths that we can discover and which they give you the opportunity to experiment also in terms of stunts, so as to reach the finish line in a different way and with a higher number of points. There are also tons of cosmetic items and customizations to unlock as you level up. Technical realization The Touchgrind Scooter graphics basically resume what we saw three years ago with Touchgrind BMX 2, with few differences in terms of effects and generally similar solutions as regards the rendering of the scooter and the design of the scenarios, which however in some cases reveal more dynamic and interesting. The touch controls are not always precise, as already reported, and we encountered a fairly obvious problem of overheating of the terminal playing with an iPhone 12 Pro. The music that accompanies the action is nice, but if you want it is possible set your Apple Music or Spotify library as a soundtrack: a useful feature certainly.", "date": "2021-06-19", "grade": "7.0"}
