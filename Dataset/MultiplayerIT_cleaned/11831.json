{"name": "Digital Chocolate Cafe: Hold 'Em Poker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/digital-chocolate-cafe-hold-em-poker.html", "text": "Historically, mobile gaming has often and willingly drawn on the world of card games, poker in primis. The reason is obvious: it is a genre that works regardless of the technical aspect, therefore even mobile phones with a monochrome display could run some great poker games. Now that the technical characteristics of the terminals guarantee respectable results, even with polygonal graphics and so on, the genre of card games has also undergone an evolution and has adapted to the new possibilities from all points of view. Recently we have seen simulations of sports poker of great depth, and the new product branded Digital Chocolate also refers to the ~official~ rules of this classic game. With a whole series of side elements, though. The Digital Chocolate Cafe is a virtual meeting place created by Digital Chocolate, which has also set other titles before it. In the specific case of Hold 'Em Poker, we can play a quick game to familiarize ourselves with the interface and controls or create an avatar (customizing its appearance) and start a career that will lead us to participate in various tournaments with big prizes up for grabs . At the end of each game, then, we will be able to take a tour of the room and possibly buy a series of objects that will be able to characterize our character in a more marked way. But let's go back to the central theme of this title, namely poker: as anticipated, we will play according to the official rules of the WPT federation, therefore with six people around the table, two cards each and the rest which is shown by the dealer after each round of betting . The developers have tried to emphasize the behavior of the various participants, with different sentences that distinguish their mood depending on the progress of the match. Everyone starts with the same amount of money and is eliminated when it ends, so whoever is left alone at the table wins the game. As in the most realistic poker simulations, we will often find ourselves with terrible cards and we will have to carry out bluffs to at least win the pot, hoping that the others will bite. The game takes the trouble to promptly notify us of the value of our cards, so as to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to a hard defeat. The development of the match is therefore very articulated and full of depth, even if it does not shine for speed and there is no way to increase the reaction speed of the artificial intelligence. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, Hold 'Em Poker has well done graphics, which show us the venue with a three-quarter view and a good level of detail. The characters are well characterized and can be enriched by numerous different objects. What matters most, however, i.e. the quality of the interface, leaves something to be desired: the writings of the dialogues are very small and it is hard to grasp them quickly because they are not emphasized in any way. The cards are always legible, except when those of the opponents are also shown (in the form of tiny thumbnails), while the expedient devised to show the remaining money to each character (represented by a series of chips) works very badly in practice and renders difficult to understand what the situation is: a numerical representation would have been better. The sound sector, as usual, does not go beyond the essentials but boasts an independent volume adjustment from the phone: this is a very significant advantage when you have one of those smartphones that (absurdly) do not allow level adjustment release in games.
