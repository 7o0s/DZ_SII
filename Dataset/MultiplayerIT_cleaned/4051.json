An era in which, like huge dinosaurs, these titles crushed any genre under their unstoppable paws, and in the videogame forums there was almost more talk of tuning and mufflers than of any other topic. That era is now only an empty memory, either due to the constant change of fashions, or due to the difficult evolution of structures where almost everything has already been tested or conceptualized... yet no one seems to have bothered to warn the Playground Games of the What. In fact, the British team has been wearing the tyrannosaurus costume with glory for years now thanks to the Forza Horizon series, perhaps the only remaining bulwark of that arcade sub-genre that has always made speed and spectacularity its pillars. However, the Horizons are not courses focused on accessibility and mindless fun, but the natural evolutions of everything that came before: a shiny ball of ingenious original or already seen elsewhere, beautifully held together by a solid driving system like few others. We therefore approached the Forza Horizon 4 review with the certainty of finding another excellent product, enriched by a long list of new features and a British setting that allowed the development team to ~play at home~. The level reached, however, still amazed us. Seasons of the heart The new setting of Horizon is, as already mentioned, a beautiful section of Great Britain, which goes from the magnificent Edinburgh to the English village of Ambleside. Obviously we are not talking about a precise reproduction of that area - however idyllic it would be largely unsuitable for racing cars - but of an invented map, in which only some areas of interest are realistically recovered and each road is carefully positioned to encourage exploration and adrenaline-pumping races. In any case, the beauties of Scotland and the British countryside do not represent the main novelties of this chapter, because in Forza Horizon 4 the impact of the landscapes fades slightly to make room for the introduction of the seasons: a periodic climate change of the entire map , capable of modifying not only aesthetically every single track, but also heavily influencing the gameplay. After all, the new baby from the Playground Games almost entirely takes up the basics of its predecessor, and therefore re-proposes mechanics close to Forza Motorsport, ~softened~ slightly to favor sudden hits and off-road. Only this time the influence of terrain and weather conditions is greater due to improved physics of the wheels, which leads them to react more realistically to changes in temperature and much more sharply to the type of road travelled. Playing with the aids activated the difference is barely perceptible (although the impact of the variable terrain from season to season is more noticeable), but with a good driving position and traction control deactivated you will sweat a lot on mud and ice, as well to perceive the significant differences between wet, slightly icy or perfectly dry asphalt. Of course, in addition to this good god there was also a general rebalancing of the cars - now the control and weight distribution of a car seem as important as the other statistics, where previously a large number of players aimed at V12s and didn't give a damn - but it is still too early to evaluate how much and if the work done is actually impeccable. The progression accelerator The scalability of the gameplay remains one of the best qualities of the Playground Games title, and not so much for the facilities as for the artificial intelligence: there are no trains in Forza, nor any type of elastic effect; here the opponents have extremely varied behaviors, and their performance increases significantly from difficulty to difficulty, for a general level of challenge that is perfectly adaptable to any type of player. For heaven's sake, we're not dealing with perfect virtual drivers, and some hiccups from the AI do happen - just as it's true that their reactivity leaves something to be desired in many situations - but it's still nice to notice different behaviors on the track, or sometimes ~human~ errors ~ during particularly difficult competitions. How much of all this is due to the Drivatar technology (which takes data from the behavior of the drivers on the web and translates them into their virtual counterparts) is difficult to quantify, yet among the racing of this type it is undeniable that there are really few titles capable of offer tight and hilarious competitions like those of Forza. Choosing to gradually increase the level of strust is undoubtedly one of those factors to take into consideration when evaluating the progression within the game, an element that can often be criticized in extended titles such as the Horizons, since they tend to be reduced to a simple succession of competitions divided between various disciplines. Here, this fourth chapter takes up the philosophy of Forza Horizon 3, but applies it with a force never seen before, thanks to a frightening amount of competitions, very well calculated secondary activities, the usual inevitable exhibitions (now almost a trademark of the series) and big news related to the online sector. To these, then, are added a monstrous fleet of cars - it has approximately 460 cars, without taking into consideration the DLCs - and an internal achievement system that takes into consideration your level in the individual specialties (including secondary things such as the success of your web looms, photography skills, and so much more). Unreachable content Let's go into detail with a nice list: a stylistically atrocious solution for an article, but absolutely mandatory today, because Forza Horizon 4 has so much content that we are forced to write with the game on in the background so as not to lose pieces along the way. And let's start with the classics, given that in the Playground creature there are respectively: road races, dirt track races, sprint challenges, Cross Country, clandestine races with lots of traffic and an inordinate number of speed cameras, crazy jumps and roads dedicated to drifting ready to assign you from one to three stars. However, that's obviously not all, since we've already mentioned the exhibitions - crazy, partially scripted racing where trains, jet jets and a host of other more or less unpredictable vehicles compete against each other, fabulous for flexing the muscles of the engine - but we haven't yet. talked about the ~story missions~: alternative activities that see you in the role of a stuntman, put you driving very fast cars, take you to the challenges of a drifting club or, even, at the service of an annoying streamer passionate about games driving. These weird ~quests~ are a fairly brilliant gimmick within the main campaign, as they allow you to drive vehicles that are impossible to obtain at the beginning of your career and break the pace greatly; however we admit that at times their implementation seemed a bit rushed to us, given the simplicity of some of the chapters (certain missions really last a couple of minutes or so). Although it could have been done better, there's really no point in protesting: in a monstrously rich game like Horizon 4 these extra tasks are just the icing on the cake. On the other hand, the competitions fill an already huge map (and full of signs with various effects, from gaining credits to that of influence), increase by leveling up until the final challenge is reached for each single category, and they are all customizable in a convenient menu before the start as in the past, which can be tackled with various vehicle classes, or even included in seasonal championships. Yes, because the first phase of the campaign allows you to test all four seasons one after the other with dedicated exhibitions, but once finished, the first group of Forza Horizon 4 competitions opens, kicking off a weekly change of seasons ( change every Thursday), with a series of temporary competitions and other online-related goodies. And speaking of online All together towards that ravine The Forza titles have always been rather relaxed as far as competition is concerned: amusing experiences, with a multiplayer that is not particularly aggressive - counters permitting - and some modes far from those of classic racing. However, Horizon 4 has decided to partially change the tune, with the introduction of ranked team adventures and leagues. We specify: in the game map you will always be connected if you want, with the other players free to wander around and carry out their activities undisturbed (but not to come upon you, given that ghosting is activated for anyone who is not part of your team); in addition to the normal street challenges, however, you will have the opportunity to face ranked races - not immediately unlocked - which, based on the results obtained, will place you in various seasonal leagues at the end of which you will get various prizes including cars, customizations for your driver and much more. Don't worry, classic online has clearly not disappeared, and there are also Forzathon Live events, which see specific areas of the map ~activate~ and offer multiple cooperative challenges to obtain points that can then be spent in the Forzathon shop. And for the record, there don't appear to be any microtransactionsoni of sorts in the game. The Forzathon shop is still a store whose items for sale change every week, and the points necessary to purchase are obtained both thanks to the Forzathon live events and by completing timed challenges (they can go from simply owning a specific prestigious car to completing certain goals). Parallel to these tokens, the only other currency are the classic credits, obtainable through spins of the wheel of fortune - also seen in the old chapters, and increased here - or the simple victory in the various competitions, with variable modifiers based on the difficulty and activated aids . We searched the menu and the shop quite a lot, and there doesn't seem to be any benefit to the game other than the VIP Pass, which doubles the winnings in the race if purchased. Not that it means much, considering that the primary source of big cash is almost always the wheels of fortune. It must be said, however, that in Forza Horizon 4 you will be more inclined to spend than in the other chapters, due to the presence of really expensive properties scattered around the map. Obtaining all of the houses is entirely optional, that's true, but they're a symbol of well-being that's nice to show off, offer useful fast-travel zones, allow you to get extra surprises, and serve as a useful hub to run on your own vehicle. all the action previously relegated to the central area of the Horizon Festival. In short, a very pleasant addition, which only suffers from the lack of dedicated customizations. The colors of Albion Inside your shelters you will also find all the goodies seen in the old Forza waiting for you, with some significant additions: the personalization of your own pilot, in fact, with a large number of clothes and objects to choose from (the same cannot be said of the faces, rather numbered); the tuning menu and the very complete livery editor, where once again it will be possible to download the works and modifications to the cars of other players or make your own public; and the Auction House, a great source of cash if you randomly obtain Bludgers that you don't want to use. Within these four walls you will also be able to unlock the inevitable ~forgotten jewels~, or abandoned cars for the map in unmade and well-hidden garages, which will be repaired by the champions of the festival to then be shown off among your possessions. They are predictably legendary British cars for the most part, which will be periodically revealed as you progress through the championships, and will lead you to make the most of the ~drone mode~ so as not to waste too much time hunting for treasure. Not that it's a bad thing to wander around the Horizon 4 maps looking at the landscape, on the contrary. Technically Forza Horizon 4 is after all one of the most extraordinary games ever seen within the genre: a splendor both for the quality of the game map and for the care placed in the hundreds of usable cars. Everything is incredible: number of polygons of the cars, reflections on the chassis, atmospheric effects, vegetation, and the ancient charm of Edinburgh is clearly superior to the coldness of the city area of the previous chapter. Now, to obtain such an exceptional glance, the Playgrounds have ~cheated~, and moved away from the British lands not only morphologically but also stylistically, pumping up the saturation of the colors and making certain areas much more ~poetic~ than in the realities would be nothing but a monotonous succession of fields and grazing animals; however, the end result is absolutely exceptional and makes a location potentially much less varied than those seen in the past, all the more unpredictable and surprising. A similar care can also be found in the sound, where in addition to an exceptional soundtrack linked to the various radio stations (the one centered on classical music occasionally starts the theme of Halo, just to specify which one is our favorite), there is a lack of considerable care for dubbing and engine noise. And if all this isn't enough for you, keep in mind that a track editor will also arrive in the future, with which players will be able to draw any route on the map. So everything perfect? Are we really facing the absolute zenith of arcade racing? Well, yes, Horizon 4 is quite possibly the highest peak touched within this genre, and the lavish praise so far should be enough to convince you. However, it is not completely without flaws. The graphic improvements have in fact made the title rather unstable on Xbox Base, where the 30 FPS hold up for most of the races, but the frame rate tends to stagger heavily during exhibitions or in areas full of vegetation when the weather conditions are particularly", "date": "2018-09-25", "grade": "9.5"}
