{"name": "We Happy Few", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/we-happy-few-recensione.html", "text": "We Happy Few builds its lore on the basis of a rich mixture of references: narratively the quotations of 1984 are wasted, there is the element of the control of emotions through mandatory synthetic drugs seen among others in Equilibrium and, in general, a dystopian society that has decided to face the post-war period through isolation and stunning. On a playful and structural level, we are instead dealing with a large sandbox whose procedural nature is revealed only at certain times; a scenario in which to move trying to mimic the behavior of the people around us, under penalty of identification and violence to oppose through a combat system reminiscent of Dishonored (however substantially less sophisticated and brilliant), or to escape by giving oneself fleeing and hiding in the tall grass or in plain sight, sitting on a bench in the Assassin's Creed style of the good old days, but holding the sheets of a newspaper tightly stretched to show off tranquillity. After a long period in Early Access, the new Compulsion Games project finally debuts on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One: will it be true Joy? Story and characters We Happy Few takes us to Wellington Wells, in an alternative 1964: the British island has decided to cut ties with the rest of the world, choosing to forget the past and build a present based on the illusion of happiness. All the inhabitants have to take a synthetic drug, Joy, at regular intervals, which allows them to keep their smile and optimism, keeping doubts and critical thoughts well hidden. However, when the journalist Arthur Hastings comes across an article that reminds him of his brother Percy, whom he had promised to find, he puts the job aside and decides to skip his dose of Joy to regain some lucidity, however being discovered and chased by colleagues and police officers. Taking refuge in the sewers, he emerges in the outer area of the city, inhabited by outcasts who have refused to hire Joy but who look with great suspicion who comes from the center. These first phases introduce some fundamental concepts for the We Happy Few experience: our character must always adapt to the environment in which he finds himself, possibly changing his clothing and habits, moving from one place to another and collecting specific items to complete the missions of a campaign aimed at revealing the secrets of Wellington Wells. Arthur's story is the longest and most substantial of the game, but not the only one: we will later find ourselves controlling two other characters, in this case Sally Boyle and Ollie Starkey, going into the story of some figures linked to secondary quests, but not only. The transition from Arthur to Sally and then to Ollie implies a heightening of the difficulty, in the form of constraints that the woman and the man must submit to avoid entering a debilitating condition. In this regard, compared to the Early Access version, the survival elements of the game have been substantially softened: our avatar still needs to sleep, eat and drink, but avoiding doing so will not condemn him to death, but will affect his resistance to fatigue and , accordingly, the combat effectiveness. In fact, the stamina indicator determines our ability to attack any enemies, also on the basis of the weight of the weapon we hold and the physical characteristics of the character, with Arthur representing a balanced figure in this sense, Sally who is more fragile and inclined to stealth actions, and finally Ollie who stands as the classic wiry and resistant type. Missions, mechanics and rules of engagement Depending on the area in which we find ourselves, as mentioned, there are rules that must be respected in order to go unnoticed and avoid being chased by an angry crowd, a situation from which it is possible to get out alive only by fleeing and hiding, if and when possible. In this regard, a clarification must be made about the artificial intelligence of NPCs, which is typical of action stealth: do not expect realistic reactions or a precise perception from possible enemies, given that this type of approach would have made it impossible to hide and recover situations of alarm, turning every misstep into a rout. In the central district, hiring Joy may be necessary to pass certain checks and devices that identify the ~curmudgeons~ (as those who refuse to take their dose are called), but in general it is suspicious behavior that determines the state of alert of citizens and cops - running around, rummaging through dumpsters, picking locks and stuff like that. At night there is alsocurfew, so even just being noticed on the street can give rise to very unpleasant situations. In some cases, however, we will be forced to do so and we will therefore have to use our stealth skills, possibly distracting the guards with the throwing of a bottle and avoiding detection by the patrolling drones. It goes without saying that the dress code requires you to be impeccable... except when visiting some private clubs, frequented by slightly eccentric people. Outside the walls, the rules are obviously less stringent, but even in this case there are night patrols and you have to conform to the rags that the outcasts often wear. Similar to BioShock, it is possible to rummage everywhere to obtain raw materials to be used for the creation of a wide range of objects, through a crafting system that becomes more and more sophisticated and at some point even allows you to upgrade bludgeoning weapons, increasing their effectiveness and resistance. It can happen that you run out of medical kits or healing balms, but fortunately the system indicates where it is possible to find the ingredients necessary for their creation: doing a little ~shopping~ around the map is the best thing before tackling the missions. In the event of a clash, as mentioned, the first-person combat system is unfortunately crude and spoiled by a very approximate collision detection, although even in this situation things can improve through the unlocking of new skills. In fact, by completing the quests we will get experience points to spend to improve our character's abilities in various aspects, increasing his total health, silence, power in battle and even giving him the possibility of engaging in incorrect behavior in public without being noticed: a boon to significantly accelerate the exploration of the central areas of Wellington Wells. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-one We Happy Few Trophies can be obtained by completing the game's campaign, but many achievements are linked to side missions or particular actions. There are those related to numbers, such as killing a hundred enemies or surviving for fifty days, as well as those related to collectibles scattered throughout the levels. The use of specific tools, such as the Atomizer, and the reading of the abundant diaries and newspaper articles that enrich the ~lore~ created by Compulsion Games are also rewarded. Implementation and technical problems There is no doubt that We Happy Few is a very ambitious project, able to offer an experience that we didn't think could be so consistent, made up of main and secondary missions which however tend to repeat the pattern of searching for an object, asking us often of tediously covering large distances to go from one target to another. There are shelters that can be unlocked and allow you to move quickly from one area to another, but it also happens that the lack of materials can make it difficult to escape a certain situation, condemning you to some inevitably frustrating game overs. During our tests, however, it happened to encounter some bugs, for example a policeman who did not detect the clothing necessary for access to a certain place, which made us waste a lot of time. To this we must add a series of more or less serious glitches, some stylistic inconsistencies and a general lack of personality in the level design due to the procedural generation, as well as a localization of the texts in Italian that suffers from subtitles that often mix lines of dialogue coming from even distant NPCs, which have nothing to do with the conversation we are having, or which have been left in English. Having said that, the cartoonish style of Compulsion Games, which we had already appreciated in Contrast, finds full realization and a precise identity in the game, enriched by a truly fascinating and suggestive choice of colors as regards the scenarios, very different if observed below the effect of Joy or not: taking the drug emphasizes the colors and liveliness of the streets, which light up like rainbows, while the ~down~ on the other hand projects imaginary insects and bats on our heads, in the general darkness. Performance on PlayStation 4 Pro is generally solid, with a stable 30 frames per second in most situations, loading felt a bit too long and in some moments exploration requires some random waiting time for the rendering of the scenarios, however spoiled by a constant slowness in the texture pop-up. The music is perfectly suited to the atmosphere of We Happy Few, and the dialogues in Englishese appear convincing, although the ~british~ pronunciation is not helpful where you want to do without subtitles.", "date": "2018-08-13", "grade": "7.2"}
