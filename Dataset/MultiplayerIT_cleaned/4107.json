Capcom to produce a worthy sequel. Drying out concepts, structures, formulas and paragraphs, after removing a couple of physiological innovations from this edition, we had already talked about Okami HD a few months ago and it was easy to applaud a good conversion of a product that only became legendary many years later. Looking back, the Japanese creative era on PlayStation 2 has experienced many highs, but not all have reached the most: Okami is the first of a non-trivial list of products that are now widely recognized and appreciated, but at the time the domain of a few close friends. We will therefore not explain to you who Amaterasu or Issun are, nor how many iterations the brand has produced in its twelve years of life. Today we will focus on the cornerstone of a unique console with an equally unique twist: Okami in motion. Draw Let's start first with a curious analogy: Okami on Switch takes up the artistic logic of the Wii edition, allowing you to control the famous ~brushstroke~ via the left or right joycon gyroscopes. The legacy works even better here: the precision of the stroke is the daughter of a movement entrusted to the wrist, finally free from pointing, which makes the action of painting an optional addition able to comfortably fluidify the playful flow. After the long tutorial, the speed of managing the brush using the gyroscope comes out naturally, making the search for infrared arm a thing of the past and thus allowing you to draw lines quickly, precisely, without getting tired. The choice whether to use it or not is left to the player but its effectiveness grows in the advanced stages, in those moments when you have to smear the canvas with more than just a straight line: let yourself get carried away with this style of play and you will have your satisfactions. What does kind of ironically is the practical impossibility of using this excellent type of controls in total portability: the adoption of the gyroscope inevitably works in table and docked mode, but we find it difficult to think of seeing you on the bus holding Switch with one hand and using the other to draw. Oh my gosh, you can leave the controls to one of the joycons while it's attached to the body of the machine, but that's the furthest thing from advice we can give you. We still have to discuss the Touch option, but once again it doesn't seem easy to manage on the move. These elements, however, lead us to the greatest innate value of this conversion. Okay everywhere Trivially, it is exactly like this: a delightful, graceful, full-bodied and well-packaged adventure is for the first time since its conception available with absolute dignity in portable mode. It all works great, just like it does on screen or on better-performing consoles, but it does it everywhere thanks to Switch. The resolution stops at 1080p docked, of course, but you understand for yourself that a port that also sees its cousins - even PC - run forcibly at 30 frames has very little to envy; indeed, we go so far as to say that it can even look down on you precisely because it is an experience to carry around. Options side, the possibility of viewing it in 16:9 or 4:3 returns, as well as activating or not the mini-games in the loading screens. On the performance side, on the other hand, tiny drops of absolutely sporadic frames do not ruin even a second of an exceptional product, nor do they manage to undermine the whole of some textures that are clearly not updated but which, thanks to the sublime graphic style, timidly join the context without necessarily being a right in the eye. Kamiya's masterpiece therefore manages to land perhaps in the best possible way on a small but versatile console thanks to a no-frills conversion job: HexaDrive has once again managed to give new life to the product that more than any other represents the ex-Clover . The experience of enjoying Okami HD on the go, perhaps with stop-and-go sessions, proves to be an excellent trump card for Capcom, a port that hasn't shocked anyone given the growing installed base of the machine but which certainly allows a virgin user of Okami to be able to use it at a price that is still manageable, despite the dozen years that separates us from its first release.", "date": "2018-08-12", "grade": "8.8"}
