The formula is quite simple and aims to create games with consolidated mechanics and strongly focused on the 2D style of the artist Dan ~Synj~ Paladin, a harbinger of the experience accumulated on Newgrounds Flash. The result is that of an animated comic full of hilarious animations. Even BattleBlock Theather does not escape this description, continuing the visual trend of the development house. In this case, however, we are going to beat the territory opened up by Little Big Planet, that of highly customizable puzzle platformers based on the online community. The similarities don't stop there, since the work is almost a fun and amused tribute to the most creative platformers of this generation, starting from the award-winning Super Meat Boy up to much less well-known exponents, such as Adventures of Shuggy and NIN2-Jump by Cave, a title we have already reviewed and widely appreciated. Follow us to find out more. A crazy adventure Although the nature of BattleBlock Theater is strongly devoted to online, the developers have not ignored the needs of the single player, setting up a story mode with a duration ranging from six to eight hours. The protagonists of the game are funny paper humanoids with interchangeable heads, who ended up in a very inhospitable manor to be kidnapped by a cruel militia of cats, who enjoy themselves by setting up sadistic competitions against the poor unfortunates. As one of the prisoners, we must work to save our friends by facing the various tests contained in the rooms that make up the house. In each level it is necessary to reach the exit trying not to leave the skin in the numerous traps present in the blocks that compose them, from lethal laser beams, electric saws and sharp spikes. The real purpose, however, is to collect green diamonds scattered throughout the level, since they represent the bargaining chip to free our companions from prisons. These objects are cleverly positioned in the maps and require a careful study of the level design, as if this were not enough we find ourselves facing dangerous monsters that will make life very difficult for us. Our character can count on melee moves and above all a series of precious gadgets to face enemies, such as frisbees and grenades, which must first be purchased on the black market by collecting balls of wool hidden in the levels. The use of these weapons proves to be fundamental in multiplayer, given that we have the possibility to choose them as we like to face the various modes. The single player campaign is therefore a fundamental element of the package, almost a huge tutorial to then face players from all over the world in the best possible way. The power of fantasy Another flagship of the Behemoth production is the level editor, beautifully done and more accessible than that of Media Molecule, even if the ambitions are obviously very different. The intent is to give the player the means to set up a playable map in a few minutes and to be able to share with the community, given that with the simple use of the back buttons, the various types of blocks to be positioned are reviewed, while a very simple set of settings allows you to set the vertical or horizontal development of the map. We managed to build one in less than ten minutes and it was curiously reminiscent of The New Zealand Story by Taito, on the other hand we are incurably nostalgic. If, on the other hand, you don't want to invest time in your creations, you can limit yourself to downloading and facing those of other players. Once the single player is finished and our creativity has been unleashed, it is time to launch online to discover that this is precisely the main dish of the package. We were impressed by the number of modes present, starting from the possibility of tackling the campaign in co-op up to a series of challenges, both versus and in teams, which demonstrate truly considerable creativity. Among the most popular certainly stand out those where we have to color the blocks of each map with the colors of our team, or a delusional game of football very similar to capture the flag, where any means is legitimate to bring home the victory. At the end of each match, a careful report of the match follows, complete with the assignment of special prizes to the best players. A truly commendable completeness, a few hours after the release the servers were already full of players, certainly a good omen for the futureof this production. Xbox 360 goals Battleblock Theather presents 30 objectives for a total of 400 player points, to conquer them you have to face all the modes proposed by this game, and we assure you that it will take some time. Among the most hilarious are the achievement earned by dying a certain number of times (consolation prize) or by repeatedly killing your teammate (the traitor). Good luck! All online passionately Technically Battleblock Theather maintains the quality standards to which The Behemoth has accustomed us, with a splendid two-dimensional style full of humor that inevitably recalls Flash animations. The action is shown as a theatrical performance, complete with a screaming, delirious and noisy audience, characterized by an irresistible nonsense and reinforced by an off-screen commentary at times hilarious (unfortunately in English). The atmosphere in some ways recalls the scribbles we used to do on school desks, with that somewhat childish cruelty capable of eliciting a laugh in the face of the many death sequences of the protagonist. The music moves on the same level, embracing a dizzying variety of styles, from electronic to folk, painting every moment of the game to perfection. The only defect that we feel we can move towards a substantially perfect graphic realization is the stylistic exasperation, which may not please everyone, but on the other hand this is Paladin's trademark and is more a factor linked to tastes than anything else. personal. For the rest Battleblock Theater is certainly not a game that comes from new ideas, but the demonstration of how it is possible to capitalize on these ideas by churning out a package rich in terms of content and open to all players.", "date": "2013-04-07", "grade": "9.0"}
