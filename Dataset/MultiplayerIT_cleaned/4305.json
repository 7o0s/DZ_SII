In fact, a few years ago Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims was spotted on PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, a game in which a funny god traveling on a cloud had to keep his pilgrims alive, eliminating their enemies. Also from Dakko Dakko after Floating Cloud God has actually also arrived on the market Scram Kitty and his Buddy on Rails, but it is precisely the floating god who has found a second youth in recent weeks thanks to Pop-Up Pilgrims, a game released exclusively for PlayStation vr. The goal is once again to save the pilgrims in the role of the Cloud God, however adopting a different approach compared to the previous one, which recalls the timeless Lemmings in its mechanics. If you have a viewer at home and are curious to find out more, all you have to do is keep reading. Playstation 4 trophies Pop-Up Pilgrims offers a total of twenty-five Trophies. The platinum one can be obtained as usual by collecting all the others, but in the case of this game it basically means reaching the end perfectly. The six bronze Trophies can be obtained by bringing at least one pilgrim to complete the same number of worlds in which the levels of Pop-Up Pilgrims are divided, the twelve silver ones are linked to the collection of some collectibles and the scrolls of the Floating God, while the gold can be unlocked by completing worlds without taking losses. We use the head You know those children's books that once opened create three-dimensional scenarios? They are called pop-up books and from their name comes that of Pop-Up Pilgrims, a 2.5D game in which we are called to bring pilgrims to their destination by making them travel safely between one platform and another. The invasion of the world by a group of demons caused them to steal the Floating Cloud God's sacred spells, stripping him of his powers. However, the god remains as a guide for his devotees, who thus leave on a mission accompanied by those who show them the way to salvation. As mentioned, Pop-Up Pilgrims works in a similar way to Lemmings, although compared to the latter it is a little less punishing for the player: the pilgrims move by themselves on the platforms that make up the levels, but recognizing their edges without diving below. Instead, they go back, thus drawing a cyclical path that the player must however secure to avoid problems. In order to familiarize those with the viewer in their head with the dynamics of Pop-Up Pilgrims, the first levels are obviously simpler, to then complicate things thus requiring more timing. The use made of virtual reality for game dynamics mainly concerns the movements of the head, through which it is possible to choose a pilgrim to ~control~: not completely, given that he will continue to move through the aforementioned path, but thanks to the pressure of the R2 key it is possible to make him jump to move from one platform to another or make changes of direction. From this point of view, the main problem lies in the fact that pilgrims travel most of the time all in groups, so sometimes the selection passes from one to another without us wanting it: in the event that a jump has been made, it can therefore happen that it is not who we wanted to do it, with consequences that can lead to his death. The latter is not to be taken lightly, firstly because not bringing all the pilgrims to the end of the level prevents you from obtaining the maximum score (there is a system similar to that typical of the three stars on mobile), secondly because the dead acolytes do not they are found at the next level. In the event that too many followers are lost along the way, one must therefore go back and improve the performance in the levels where they have expired in order to be able to move forward through the sixty levels proposed by Pop-Up Pilgrims. All before the eyes The use of virtual reality that is made by Pop-Up Pilgrims does not include movements: the wearer of PlayStation VR in fact remains stationary in his point of view as an external observer, keeping the whole scene in front of him. Since there is no dynamism, there is therefore no risk of experiencing various ailments. The only peculiarity of Pop-Up Pilgrims paired with virtual reality consists in the already mentioned movement of the head, with which the pilgrim to whom you want to perform an action is selected. For the rest it acts as in a non-VR game, in combination with the control device which in this case is the DualShock 4. From a technical point of view, Pop-Up Pilgrims looks liken colorful and pleasant graphics, with models inspired by the oriental tradition that seem a bit like a mix between Chinese and Japanese. The animations of the various characters are quite nice, thus making this game overall enjoyable in virtual reality net of the usual limitations imposed by the use of PlayStation VR. A slightly different speech instead for the soundtrack, which in the long run ends up a bit tiring, as well as for some somewhat particular audio effects, such as the disturbing comment with which the Floating God should celebrate the completion of each level.", "date": "2018-04-13", "grade": "6.5"}
