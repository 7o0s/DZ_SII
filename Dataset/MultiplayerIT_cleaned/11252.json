{"name": "Soul Bubbles - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-bubbles-recensione.html", "text": "A thousand blue bubbles The short initial tutorial shows us exactly what we will have to do in the game's numerous stages, and how to do it. Our character, in fact, is not the protagonist of the action, but only a go-between, a tool that visually translates the action of the stylus on the touch screen: in fact, by drawing vectors, we will ensure that our alter ego blows with more or less force to move the bubbles. But the bubbles are the crux of the matter: we will have to be careful of the thorns, the sticky plants, the creatures who want to break or steal them... Fortunately, we will not only have the breath available, but also three different powers: the ability to cut bubbles, the ability to draw them and the ability to deflate them. We can activate each of them through a direction of the d-pad, which also serves to navigate the map of the level. By keeping the d-pad pressed to the right, we will be able to cut the bubbles by drawing lines on them, and recompose them in the same way: this is an indispensable procedure when the bubble has to pass through very narrow channels. The ability to draw bubbles is activated with the d-pad pressed up: at that point, simply draw a circle on the screen for a bubble to appear. We will be able to deflate the bubbles when they are too big, being careful not to burst them: just tap the stylus on the bubble while pressing the d-pad to the left. Pressing the d-pad down finally moves the map screen to the touch screen, allowing us to point to a point we want to go to and be transported there immediately. Another way to navigate the map is to press the stylus on the edges of the screen to scroll the location in the relevant direction. The developers have thought of making all the character's skills available to the player right away, instead of unlocking them as you progress. Puzzle Bobble? To complete each stage, we will have to close some forest spirits in a bubble and transport them to a special container, which is located on the other side of the map: once this is done, we will be able to access the next level. However, the degree of completion also depends on other factors, in this case the collection of some magical particles (those that generally show us the way to go) and particular objects from which the spirits are attracted: when they are in their vicinity in fact, the little guests of our bubble will turn into cute little hearts. The developers thought of making all the character's abilities available to the player right away, instead of unlocking them as you progress, but the gameplay is not affected in the least by this, on the contrary: there are numerous other elements that increase the thickness level-by-level experience. Apart from the enemies, which must be taken care of differently depending on the type, we will in fact have to face natural obstacles of all kinds: wind, water, rocks, plants ... all things that can influence the journey of our bubble in various ways , sometimes representing the key to overcoming a difficult area. Technical realization The character design visible in the interlude scenes, angular and sometimes not very inspired, must not be misleading: it is just a small gray area within a much more interesting and luminous composition. Indeed, Soul Bubbles boasts exceptional graphics, which go beyond technicalities for their own sake in favor of brilliant artistic solutions, which exploit the effects of light and a phenomenal choice of colors as few titles have ever done on Nintendo DS. The scrolling of the stage is fluid, the animations of the various characters are all fun and well done... if we want to find a ~technical~ flaw in the game, perhaps a more practical solution could be found for scrolling the map, perhaps by calling into question the pressing a back button while moving the view on the scenario with the d-pad. The sound consists of catchy and discreet music, which accompanies the action in the best way and, together with the effects, contribute to creating an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. Lastly, the control system takes full advantage of the peculiar technical characteristics of the dual-screen portable console: where it would have been impracticable to have to blow into the microphone to move the bubbles, the use of the stylus and the touch screen appears perfect, with a such precision as to make life easy for us even in the most risky situations. Comment Soul Bubbles turns out to be a welcome surprise, a little jewel made of inspiration and playability, which, thanks to the strength of its ideas, for once disintegrates the demarcation line that distinguishes products for ~expert gamers~ from thosei for ~casual gamer~. In fact, the new Eidos title almost never puts us in difficulty, but makes us enjoy the artistic and technical solutions adopted: the ability to blow, together with the three special skills, gives our character complete control of the bubbles, which must be pushed within the internship sometimes delicately, sometimes decisively, in an inertial context of the highest quality and precision. Soul Bubbles has beautiful colors, a unique atmosphere (underlined by a very spot on sound) and a damn solid gameplay: if you want to take a break from the ~usual~ video games and you own a Nintendo DS, there couldn't be a better choice right now . Pros Pleasant graphics Precise and immediate control Rich in thickness Cons Navigating the map is a bit difficult Never puts you in difficulty Undertone drawings during cutscenes", "date": "2008-08-12", "grade": null}
