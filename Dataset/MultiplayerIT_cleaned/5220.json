As we have written several times in the past, the combination between the American company and the London developer has been a real panacea for the character of the Bat Man in the videogame field, given that action games have come out of this collaboration who, net of some defects, have been able to satisfy the public of enthusiasts and perfectly recreate the universe of the popular DC Comics character. And not just visually. The skill of Rocksteady Studios, in fact, was also that of not limiting itself to implementing a videogame transposition of some other entertainment work starring Batman, but of creating an unpublished screenplay together with Paul Dini, which on the one hand has its roots in vast literature dedicated to the masked hero, on the other hand he reworks it a little and adapts it by placing it in a new reality with ~original~ stories. Hence, after the third chapter entitled Batman: Arkham Knight, which sealed the generational leap of the saga, Warner Bros Inc. also re-proposes its two predecessors previously released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC, on the new consoles, with the collection Batman: Return to Arkham, remastered by the Virtuos studio using the Unreal Engine 4. Batman: Return to Arkham brings Rocksteady Studios' first two Batmans to the new consoles From Arkham Asylum to the streets of Gotham City The collection therefore includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City updated graphically specifically for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, plus some optimizations and the presence of all the DLC released after the launch of both original titles. The first game on the list, Batman: Arkham Asylum, is set in the criminal asylum of Arkham, a gloomy neo-Gothic building where criminals deemed insane are locked up. A night seemingly like many others in Gotham City, the fake quiet of the suburbs, on a dark and seemingly peaceful island, is broken by the roar of the Batmobile: Batman has captured the Joker and is bringing him back to Arkham. Justice seems to have got the better of Evil again, but with certain criminals never take anything for granted: Arkham is a powder keg ready to explode, and the Joker knows this well. So just a moment of distraction and a well thought out plan to be able to reverse the situation and transform the ~penitentiary~ into a stronghold from where you can have the help of its evil tenants at will. Thus begins an adventure that sees the Bat Man immediately grappling with an overwhelming evil force, a collection of historical nightmares of the superhero who returns to threaten the order of Gotham so painstakingly conquered over time. In terms of gameplay, for the few who still don't know the series, the adventure is a hybrid between fighting game, stealth action, RPG and exploration game. Inside the island that houses Arkham, a vast game area that can be explored more or less freely with some sections that become reachable only at certain times, the user must hunt down the criminals one by one, eliminating them with beatings or with the ' help of the numerous instruments supplied to Batman. Progression in the game then determines the increase in experience and any leveling up, like in an RPG. In fact, the accumulated points can be spent on improving the character's abilities and equipment. Batman: Arkham City, as well as its predecessor, has a progression marked by a series of events, but contrary to it everything is set in a larger and freely explorable open area, full of optional side missions. It is not a huge space, at least when compared to truly free roaming products, but it still manages to give the feeling of being in a real city, on patrol, ready to intervene from above at any moment to help the police or citizens in difficulty. The story begins a few months after the events of Asylum, when the new mayor of Gotham, Quincy Sharp, decides to transfer the criminals of Blackgate Penitentiary and those of Arkham Asylum to a limited and supervised area within the city, which is renamed Arkham City. This area is entrusted to the direct control of Professor Hugo Strange, who seems to have devised a cure for the correction of mental illness. But the reality is very different from what it appears: chaos soon breaks out, and as always to try to remedy the situation, the Capuchin crusader has to think about it.hiatus. In terms of playability, the title maintains all those typical elements that characterized its predecessor, such as action, adventure, stealth and fighting game phases, but at the same time smoothing out the defects, and expanding the possibilities in terms of gameplay and content. So here are new features such as a series of new gadgets or moves used to stun enemies, to carry out counterattacks that damage three criminals at a time, to dodge stab wounds or to disarm enemies, and the possibility of being able to interact more with suspended elements , given that the city setting allows the title to also develop vertically, with dozens of buildings and holds on which to climb or glide. Playstation 4 trophies Nothing unique list for Batman: Return to Arkham, which brings back all the Trophies of the two games and the various DLCs, between normal and secret. Most of them can be obtained by completing certain primary and secondary missions of the campaign, or by fulfilling certain requests such as taking down a certain number of enemies with a particular counter, or using a specific gadget to solve a puzzle, and so on. Common mechanics The hybrid structure in both productions manages to amalgamate the various gameplay elements quite well, even if it works better in Arkham City, which, as mentioned above, smooths out the defects of the first chapter and adds new animations, moves, situations and gadgets to fights, and not only to those. In general, the user is called upon to investigate events, using the detective mode to scan the surrounding environment, where clues and objects worthy of particular attention stand out. From there and going around the areas of an area he can reconstruct the facts, find evidence and follow any traces that can lead him to the objectives, or see secret passages or find the numerous hidden objects and bonuses, many of which are hidden behind the riddles of the 'Riddler. Movements generally take place according to a typically stealth dynamic, except sometimes in Arkham City where, given also the open and larger spaces, there is a tendency to use the ~flight~ from one building to another and beyond. In any case, the numerical difference towards the enemies, who often do not shine for intelligence (by the way, it could have been improved for this edition), often imposes a more reasoned approach to combat, taking advantage of the vertical movement guaranteed by the famous grappling hook and the shelter offered by the shade. In this way it is possible both to reach apparently inaccessible places and to calmly observe the events from above, especially in the city, choosing the right moment to jump into the void (it is possible to glide by opening the cloak) and strike by surprise. Batman's equipment then expands during the game: in the first hours it includes the legendary Batarang for ranged attacks, the grappling hook and a particular explosive gel to create traps and open passages, as well as the instrumentation for detecting clues, but other items are added later. Obviously the hero doesn't limit himself to hiding in the shadows and investigating misdeeds: when the enemy comes within range and it's necessary, he doesn't disdain to kick and punch. The combat in these cases takes place according to the classic styles of the ~scrolling~ fighting game, but with particular attention to the rhythm: the furious exchanges of attacks, dodges, parries and counterattacks take place with a certain precision. In short, hitting at random is not very productive, and it is necessary to pay attention to the movements of the opponents, especially in Arkham City. Batman squirms in the midst of swarms of enemies by linking his movements in a fluid and sensible way, dodging, opposing, making holds by exploiting the opponent's attacks, all enhanced by effective slow motion in the climactic moments of the clashes. An explosion of special effects As for the technical part, let's immediately say that the work done by Virtuos on the two games is overall good from an aesthetic point of view, but unfortunately they still run at 30 frames per second, and we have even seen some micro-jerks appearing in certain moments of the game of Arkham Asylum. These don't affect the gameplay, but they clash in this context. In any case, thanks also to its particular setting, Asylum visually manages to maintain a fairly detailed aspect when compared to the original. Furthermore, thanks to the graphic restyling, the corridors of the Arkham asylum are more frightening, the play of light and shadow work better, and the feeling of being inside an unhealthy and dangerous place is perceived more than in the Xb editionox 360 and PlayStation 3. Different speech for the characters: already characterized in a masterful way in origin, on the one hand some ~stand out~ thanks to the new graphics, see for example Batman, on the other some seem to lose something: the ~hardness~ of their faces is in fact mitigated and made ~plasticky~, almost smooth, by the lighting of the moment or by certain effects applied on the model to blur its imperfections. As a result, characters like the Joker sometimes appear less menacing and ~different~ than he was remembered in the game. As for the cheesy enemies, in general they disappoint a bit for the lower level of detail and for the animations, identical to our memory to those seen in the past. Speech that also applies to Arkham City, which as we have seen instead moves the action directly to the streets of Gotham. The latter is well represented in its imposing buildings, in its dark and obscure alleys that wind through it and hide a thousand pitfalls. It's not 'new generation', but the image gains quite a bit in terms of sharpness, even if it loses that dark, almost dark aspect that characterized the original. In any case, the general glance when Batman is on top of some building observing the city leaves us satisfied overall. And then the chimneys from which sudden flames emerge, the beams of light projected into the sky by the enormous headlights placed on the roofs, the neon lights which are reflected on the ice of the road: the new particle, physical and luminous effects contribute to making the scene compared to what was seen in the original, giving each area a certain underlying dynamism. As for the main characters, we have here an excellent modeling for protagonists and antagonists, with Batman always represented in a massive way from the point of view of the physique, but as we have seen however in Arkham Knight. Similarly the various Joker, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, just to name a few, have been ~updated~, so to speak, in such a way as to be closer aesthetically to those seen in their last appearance in Arkham Knight, with good care for the details as can be seen in the close-ups and in the interlude scenes, shot and ~framed~ like in a film and for this reason able to contribute to making the gaming experience more captivating. Even here, however, the speech made for Arkham Asylum is valid: certain faces have been too ~smoothed~ giving some characters a ~smooth~ face. The audio sector is excellent as always, from the sound effects to the musical accompaniment, which can count in both games on a soundtrack that is at times imposing in its gait alongside the actions performed by the Dark Knight, and on a splendid dubbing in Italian, the quality of which can be easily compared to that of the localization of a cinematographic film. The acting in particular by Marco Balzarotti and Riccardo Peroni, voices of Batman and the Joker respectively, manages to give greater emotional strength to the personality of the two characters, and is absolutely convincing and spot on.", "date": "2016-10-19", "grade": "7.8"}
