It is therefore understandable that Gameloft wanted to use the most famous figures for its new mobile fighting game, Gods of Rome, which in fact has little to do with Rome (even the nomenclature is the Hellenic one), but evidently the title sounded better than ~Gods of Athens~. The formula is practically the same seen in Marvel Contest of Champions, Mortal Kombat X and WWE Immortals, so you already know perfectly well what to expect from the game if you have tried one of these products. Let's say that this is the latest trend for mobile beat'em ups, based on timing rather than strategy, with a very limited number of moves and a rich structure, but which winks at monetization at the first useful opportunity . The difference lies in when and how the balance of difficulty begins to tighten, forcing the user to resort to healing potions or to resurrect a warrior who fell in battle so as not to have to start the last sequence of battles all over again. In the case of Gods of Rome this happens more or less during the final part of the first of the three acts that make up the single player campaign, each consisting of four chapters. Of course, it must also be said that by playing your cards right and doing a little grind you can go ahead in any case, so we don't feel like condemning this production for too stringent a use of the freemium model: we've seen worse. Gods of Rome is a really nice game to see in action, but limited and repetitive in gameplay Baleful wrath The evil Tenebrosus, forgotten son of Hades, has found a way to bend some of the Olympians and a series of mythological warriors to his will, aligning them against anyone who wants to try to stop his plans for conquest. Our task will be precisely to try, after having drawn a character from those initially available from the perspective of three different categories, which differ in terms of growth capacity, resistance and effectiveness of attacks, as well as the possibility of performing a special move that charges to one, two, or three levels during battles. The visual aspect of Gods of Rome is probably the most successful, as the developers have done a great job of revisiting various mythological figures: Zeus, who of course can strike his enemies with a powerful bolt of lightning; Atlas, who fights holding a huge stone sphere that symbolizes the world; Achilles, wearing a mysterious mask before holding the spear; Hippolyta, the lethal Amazon who wields a two-handed greatsword; or Julius, a Roman soldier who plants the standard of the Empire on the ground with each victory. There are many characters, there is the traditional growth system that works based on the objects collected and, as mentioned, the structure is full-bodied, both as regards the campaign and the special events and multiplayer, unfortunately only of the asynchronous type and therefore spoiled by the same problems that afflict the single player: the repetitiveness of the action, the scarcity of maneuvers and, in this specific case, a control system that proves to be unreliable when we swipe for the medium power shot , as well as completely useless when we try to place charged attacks. In short, the experience is pleasant, supported by an excellent technical sector, with detailed and convincing polygonal models, as well as a sufficiently ~epic~ sound, but tires quickly enough due to the limitations of the gameplay.", "date": "2015-12-23", "grade": "6.8"}
