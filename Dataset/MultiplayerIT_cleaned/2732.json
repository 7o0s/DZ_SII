{"name": "Shady Part of Me", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shady-part-of-me-recensione.html", "text": "Puzzle platforming and emotional catharsis seem to work very well together: it will be the way they link a gameplay made of jumps, runs, climbs and intuitions to solve puzzles to the echoes of human psychology, captivating players with simple mechanics but whose purposes are not never clear until the end of the game. The fact is that from Limbo to Thomas Was Alone, passing through Braid and his sense of guilt up to the traumas of Contrast and the depression of Another Perspective, just to name a few, the union between the two parts has always proved to be very effective. Here Shady Part of Me fits in with incredible fluency, as you can imagine a puzzle platform developed by the independent studio Douze Diximes, which gives life to a world poised between dream and reality, born from the doubts, past experiences and hopes of a little girl looking for freedom. The same that, together with his shadow with its own will as in a new Peter Pan, we will control for the entire duration of the game. Find out about this little hidden gem in our Shady Part of Me review. Story and gameplay Shady Part of Me moves through established patterns over the years: players assume the role of a mysterious little girl on the run from what appears to be an asylum, followed by her shadow as an imaginary friend or (in this case) a psychological manifestation, another self to which he relies throughout the game but which in turn needs her to be able to continue - trapped as she is in the areas of light between two extremes of shadow. In this sense, the dualism between the parts is very curious: the little girl in flesh and blood shuns the light and can proceed only in dark areas, while the shadow needs light to exist. On their journey towards freedom, both will learn to rely on each other, developing a curious friendship (which in the end is the reflection of the reconciliation between two parts of themselves) and referring, during their dialogues, to therapeutic progress and tenacity as tools to resolve insecurity and perhaps even an unspecified trauma. Standing between them, beyond the obstacles that physically prevent progression, is the voice of a psychologist who will make their relationship waver several times but also seems like a push to break down the walls behind which they take refuge. It is always fascinating to note how in the puzzle platform developed with this precise purpose, that is to tell the emotions of the human mind with all its positive and negative sides, gameplay and story, or even better psychological narration, fit together with extreme elegance. The attempt to put the pieces of this story together, to balance the information in possession by trying to get to the bottom of the cognitive process of the character (by extension ours, assuming control of us) is reflected in the gameplay, which with its puzzles makes a metaphor of his long process of acceptance - of himself and/or of the surrounding reality. We only think of Madeline in Celeste and the difficulties involved as an expression of the arduous journey that she is experiencing in her head; Shady Part of Me does exactly that, narrating through a beautiful and refined script, combined with a series of situations and puzzles that reflect her inner torment, the path of the nameless girl. She, who around her fears has built an entire world to hide behind, without dangers except for the light that takes the place of reality from which she seeks refuge, will be forced to come to terms with the outside world and anything she can think of. she, facing prejudices and difficulties of the case thanks to the other self, stronger, more courageous but no less fragile. There is a truly captivating aesthetic in Shady Part of Me, ready to blossom every time the game gets going: each of the many sections that make up the game, defined as a ~session~ and thus emphasizing even more the psychological nature of the experience, is characterized by dotted shading and detailed architectures that put together make the inner world of the child a splendid watercolor graphic novel. To enhance the atmosphere is an exceptional soundtrack, a sort of moody dark jazz punctuated by occasional female vocals that helps to make the game even more immersive, especially when you realize that each track refers to a specific area and slowly builds up, so that the next section is fuller and more exciting. All the contrasts of Shady Part of Me live in this emotional roller coaster, from the alternation between the 3D and 2D world of the little girl and her shadow respectively (the latter much more dangerous) to the way the texts appear on the screen, adapting Lits shape in relation to the puzzle that is being faced: all for an incredible visual but above all playful result. Apart from some slight narrative smudges, the result of a lack of courage in daring a little more to offer greater clarity in the answers, Shady Part of Me is another little gem in which gameplay and story merge to shape an almost perfect psychological narrative. The play of shadows at the center of Shady Part of Me has already been explored in titles such as Lost in Shadow, while the protagonist in the flesh is somewhat reminiscent of the subjects of Inside, thus not hiding her inspirations; however the way in which the experience is built around the interchange between the two characters is fluid, studied in detail and clearly responsive on the controller. The sense of familiarity of its mechanics soon fades into the background in the face of the attention that has been paid to ensure that they work in complete synergy. Without revealing anything to you, as you progress the game shows its best in terms of quality, limping just when you have the feeling that some puzzles have been introduced to lengthen the experience a bit, returning a vague ~filler~ effect ~. Beyond that we are faced with a learning curve that couldn't be better. Occasionally there is a slight disconnect between story and gameplay, the homogeneity of which would have given even more added value, but overall we are faced with yet another hidden gem that will repay anyone who wants to spend the few hours spent in its company.", "date": "2020-12-14", "grade": "8.5"}
