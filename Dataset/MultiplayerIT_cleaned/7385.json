With the ~spin-off~ Time Travel, the developers of Zeptolab had begun to explore the various possibilities in this sense, choosing to double the protagonist of the game, the cute creature Om Nom, and to add new objects for problem solving to the gameplay riddles. From this point of view, Cut the Rope 2 therefore represents only the next step towards an evolution of the franchise, albeit remaining within a path from which it would be risky to exit due to the speech made just now. And so Om Nom goes back to chasing his candies, but he does so supported by a group of friends with special abilities: Roto, a flying creature that can transport the protagonist to different areas of the scenario; Lick, who uses his tongue to create bridges and slides to go down when necessary; Blue, capable of infinitely doubling and, therefore, of creating useful ~columns~; Toss, a spring-loaded creature that can launch us upwards; Boo, endowed with the ability to scare Om Nom and make him literally jump away. Each of these characters debuts in a different setting, with a view to a single player campaign that offers a good one hundred and twenty levels and which will be enriched, as usual, with the various updates. Cut the Rope 2 manages to introduce important innovations without revolutionizing the series The Om Nom is mobile The introduction of supporting characters in Cut the Rope 2 may seem like a simple gimmick, like adding new objects to the scenarios. In reality, it is precisely the basic philosophy that has changed, which until now saw Om Nom as a ~fixed~ presence, an arrival point to which the sweets can be sent through increasingly complex interactions, but which now leads him to undergo the same solicitations and to move in the locations, even with the risk of falling and causing us to run into a momentary game over. In this new chapter, the greedy little green creature does not stand still and wait, but is rather tied to balloons so that it can reach areas located in the upper part of the screen, launched thanks to the skills of Toss, grabbed and transported by the likeable Roto and ~scared~ by Boo, jumping and rolling to grab the three stars present in each location, the candy and a possible four-leaf clover, the latter object which is used to unlock the four extra levels of each ~world~. In short, at first it doesn't seem like it but the experience has actually changed, and it has changed for the better. This time the puzzles must be solved more often by calculating the timing of a launch well, cutting the threads at the right time, with a view to a single resolving maneuver or a series of precision operations. It is certainly possible to be content with making Om Nom swallow the candy and move on to the next stage, but the number of stars collected at a certain point becomes fundamental for accessing the subsequent missions, in a widely tested reward system that introduces the further substrate of four levels obtainable by collecting four-leaf clovers, a real challenge for experts. Graphically renewed, colorful and nice to look at, Cut the Rope 2 perhaps suffers from a single problem: those who already have experience with the series will be able to complete the new campaign in a relatively short time, thus waiting for the updates.", "date": "2013-12-26", "grade": "8.6"}
