It was 1990 when they started the profession and from the Nintendo Entertainment System viruses a lot of water has passed under the bridge, which if many things have remained almost unchanged. The game structure and the dynamics of the levels have remained completely similar to the original ones with the exception of some additions, a clear sign that the Kyoto house does not consider the series in need of particular innovations in its basic mechanics so dear to longtime fans . Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure available on the Nintendo 3DS eShop is the latest iteration of the franchise that introduces a couple of excellent side features and the introduction of a mode completely focused on Dr. Luigi, which after its debut on Wii U finally arrives on the portable console too. Dr. Mario: Miracle cure is a pleasant puzzle game that doesn't leave its mark Viruses and medicines There are no twists to Dr. Mario's formula, but a couple of interesting additions that increase its content and variety. The Special Cure Laboratory brings together a total of fifty levels divided into three categories by difficulty, starting with an explanatory tutorial of all the game's mechanics, to continue with Student levels and those of Primary, the most difficult obviously. Since the doctor's office saw the arrival of Dr. Luigi, the levels were designed in such a way as to alternate the classic mechanics based on Dr. Mario's pills that remained unchanged from the first NES chapter, to those of the Wii U title focused on Luigi with the L-shaped capsules. The aim is always the same in both cases, to eliminate all the viruses present in the bottle by aligning the capsules in such a way as to create a line of four equal colors. In fact, each virus is characterized by a different color and there are three types: red, blue and yellow. Playing strategy, in a way not entirely dissimilar to Tetris, we should orient and fit the capsules with the viruses on the screen in the best possible way, eliminating them before reaching the edge of the bottle, but to help us in the success of the enterprise, I am all a series of power ups available every time you fill up the sidebar. These have different functions and uses and are generated in a completely random way: there are the Anticapsules which are individual capsules to be used to complete the lines, the Antiviruses which, once eliminated, also make all the other viruses of the same color disappear, the Vaccines which they eliminate whole horizontal or vertical lines of capsules and viruses and the Bomb, the ultimate remedy that makes a clean sweep of everything lying in its vicinity. While in the single player mode we will have all these power ups available, in the challenges against other players or against the CPU some extra elements are added to the package specifically designed to sabotage the opponent. The Fixed Capsule prevents rotations, the Adrenaline increases the descent speed of the individual components in the bottle and the Confusional State reverses the directional arrows by sending the capsules to the right when you press left and vice versa. In both cases, all the power ups work wonderfully, have the right variety and allow you to ring in effective combos if used with the right timing and in the correct position. The 3D effect Not received. The sense of progression is well punctuated during all 50 levels of the game by increasing speed and viruses, positioned in increasingly complicated and difficult ways to eliminate considering that the bottle takes very little time and fills up once the final levels are reached. The mechanics underlying the gameplay are quite simple and intuitive, but as often happens in Nintendo titles, this does not detract from the title, highly replayable especially in multiplayer (online and local) and in the Without Recipe mode. Here it is possible to customize the duration, quantity of viruses and difficulty of the games, choosing which power-ups to insert and obviously whether to use the classic Mario capsules or Luigi's L-shaped capsules. Not bad then, except that after twenty-five years we are practically replaying the same NES game on a portable console and with a few more power ups. Don't get us wrong, Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure is an excellent title that offers pleasant hours in the company of various and fun puzzles, but it is yet another ~recycling~ of a gameplay that hasn't moved an iota from its origin. To this is added a soundtrack that repeats the usual two themes to the bitter end and an imperfect management of the monads, with the unusable analog in favorof directional arrows. There is no 3D and the Germ Buster mode to be played with the stylus on the touch screen is also forgettable, which is also much less practical and accurate than traditional commands.", "date": "2015-06-14", "grade": "7.0"}
