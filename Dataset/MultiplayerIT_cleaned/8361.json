{"name": "Missione possibile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107707-the-expendables-2-videogame-missione-possibile.html", "text": "Part of the famous mercenary team led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) is hired to rescue a billionaire kidnapped by a terrorist group. Four expert fighters therefore throw themselves into the fray to complete their mission, within four chapters each consisting of five stages. Will they be able to save the rich hostage? Obviously yes, because the word ~failure~ does not exist in their vocabulary. We are talking about some of the brightest action movie stars of the 80s and 90s, just a pity that for this videogame reduction the most resonant names (Schwarzenegger, Willis, Van Damme, Statham, Norris himself) have been cut, leaving the team only the aforementioned Stallone, Jet Li (as Yin Yang), Dolph Lundgren (Gunner Jensen) and Terry Crews (Hale Caesar). Whatever the formation, The Expendables 2 Videogame presents itself as the most classic of the twin analog shooters and, we say it immediately, it should be played preferably using the Xbox 360 controller, given that pointing via the mouse negatively affects an already limited gameplay of his own. The missions can be played alone, entrusting the control of our three companions to the AI but with the possibility of changing characters at any time by using the d-pad, or in cooperative multiplayer mode together with three other players. There are only two difficulty levels, ~easy~ and ~difficult~, which do precisely what they promise: if we select the first, the degree of challenge will actually be very low, so much so that we will be able to launch ourselves head-on against entire firing squads without any problems , while the other team members will rescue each other in case they get knocked down. The ~difficult~ level, on the other hand, implies a minimum of effort and, above all, the need to use the objects present in the scenario to take cover during the numerous shootings. A dynamic that does not actually belong to the genre of twin analog shooters, and which in fact ~out of tune~ with respect to the nature of the action. Fantastic Four Before leaving, you can select your character from Barney, Yin Yang, Gunner and Caesar. Each has a pair of different weapons: Barney uses a powerful Colt and a pair of Kimbers, Yin Yang throws knives and fires an MP-9 light machine gun, Gunner alternates between a shotgun and a sniper rifle, and finally Caesar uses a shotgun assault rifle and an HK-69 grenade launcher. By selecting one of the four, we will be able to earn experience points and make it ~grow~ thanks to the purchase of upgrades that make the weapons more effective, increase the capacity of the magazines, the shooting range and so on. At certain times we will be called upon to use the specific skills of individual mercenaries to resolve delicate situations, such as placing explosives or cutting networks. In the event that the enemies hurt us up close, we will be able to beat them with our bare hands by pressing the B button on the controller, or perform a spectacular ~fatality~ if we have filled the appropriate indicator. In this case the action slows down with a sort of bullet time and our character is framed in the foreground while he eliminates the opponent with a pistol shot in the leg and one in the head, or by stabbing him with a dagger, or whatever the ~ specialty~ of the mercenary we are controlling. For the rest, the gameplay is typical of twin analog shooters, with our team having to enter a location full of pitfalls and try each time to reach their final goal, which can be the destruction of an armored vehicle or a tower, or simply the arrival in a certain area. Shoot that you do not pass Unfortunately, a few minutes of play are enough to run into the problems of The Expendables 2 Videogame. The repetitiveness of the action is in fact deadly, we pass from one firefight to another without interruption, but this was actually reasonable to expect given the genre it belongs to. Instead, what we would have liked to find in the package was a better targeting system than the ~invisible~ one that many characters adopt, making the elimination of targets at least difficult since you cannot aim in any way. If the technical sector does not disappoint, presenting us exactly what we would expect from a twin analog shooter with a ~war~ background, with fairly detailed scenarios and a good degree of interaction, in the same way it is absurd that the types of enemies are always the same from 'beginning at the end of the story mode. Furthermore, the AI that moves the opponents is actually basic and gets lost in a teacup, so much so that we often find ourselvessurrounded by hostile soldiers while we healed a comrade on the ground, but without them paying attention to us. Furthermore, when we throw a grenade at a bunch of enemies, they remain stationary in place waiting for its detonation, making our job even easier. The standard missions are finally interspersed with ~shooter on rails~ style sessions, in which the characters are aboard a helicopter or a boat and can use a powerful machine gun or grenade launcher to eliminate targets. A variation on the theme was extremely welcome, but in this case it didn't excite us at all.", "date": "2012-08-27", "grade": "5.0"}
