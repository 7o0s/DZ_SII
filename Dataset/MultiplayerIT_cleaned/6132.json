Colored with autumnal hues it manages to arouse different emotions: the melancholy suggested by the pastel colors that blend well with the story of the prologue, then the joy arising from the two protagonist brothers, children who want to remain so. Despite the atmosphere, the world appears light-hearted and over the top, but don't be fooled. For the two, in fact, life proves to be hard from an early age. You will take your first steps after witnessing the loss of your mother, but that's not all. Added to the drama is the father's illness, which can be saved, despite being very serious, but only through the discovery of the Water of Life, the only medicine that can restore health to the oldest member of the family. It's hard not to be immediately enraptured by the splendid polygonal modeling work and the skilful use of the color palette. The player's task is to move the two brothers, coordinating their moves simultaneously. With the lever of the pad and the right commands you will act on the smaller brother and with the left ones on the bigger one. It may seem absurd but initially it is not that simple and sometimes your brain may go into a slight black-out stasis, but your hand-eye coordination increases rapidly not to mention that you will never be in a mad hurry, but you can take your time to calibrate well the best action. In fact, the checkpoints are numerous and the whole adventure runs smoothly. In the event of a departure, a situation that can occur frequently, you go back a little and in any case the solution to the various puzzles is never too bizarre. Thanks to ~Brothers~ the words of a storybook come to life in front of you Bart's soul The idea behind the game closely recalls the nightmare that Bart Simpson suffered in the episode where he chooses to sell his soul to Milhouse. In fact, at that juncture Bart realizes that he and his double, in the form of a soul, together are able to perform chained actions that otherwise, alone, it would not be possible for him to perform. The same goes for siblings as well. The synergy that unites their efforts is compact and cohesive to obtain a result that is always balanced. They are not twins and this implies that the age difference between the two makes the observer perceive two very distinct personalities. Where the youngest proves ready to play jokes with everyone - including loud pats on the backs of the inhabitants or spits in every well he meets - the other reveals a maturity that allows him to have more diplomatic relations. Their characterization will also make us perceive their qualities and aptitudes, such as the predisposition to music or the sensitivity with animals. A well-conceived and successful characterization work, which also proves to be one of the strong points of the entire production. Playstation 4 trophies There are 12 trophies in this adventure: all simple to take home if you have your eyes turned not only to the main mission, but also to some aspects that frame the central episode. A living world Although we would never want to leave the first village, precisely because stories and daily events lurk in every corner of which we would like to know something more, it is right to give space to the rest of the adventure, as in the over hard hours of play - less than however three overall - we will come into contact with a spectacular nature, very rich in detail, even among the rocky ruins or among the mountain ravines. Another reminder, which is difficult to miss, is that of the recent demo of The Last Guardian that we admired at E3 last June. In fact, the mechanics are very similar and even part of the setting recalls castles now in ruins and pleasant buildings, uprooted by the scourge of time and the neglect of men, in which it is nice to climb and jump at the last moment. You have to pay attention to missteps, which can catch you out, and it is essential to measure the movements, but more often you will choose to take a mental ~selfie~ of the moment, to keep that instant in a cruet. You will know every environmental condition in the journey of the two brothers, shaken by a violent rain, illuminated by the sun or wrapped in a leaden sky. However, the theater of events is the bucolic / mountainous one of little Heidi, you will have to dive into ~foamy~ streams and cross flooded caves. A wonderful interlude in the ice will also open and we will get to know other characters, of which we do not want to anticipate anything, which will givesenior year rises to the affair. An emotional fairy tale therefore, with life always hanging by a thin thread, a destiny hanging in the balance in situations bordering on the impossible. This never worries the two protagonists, whether they are on the edge of a precipice, hitched to an improvised aircraft - which seems to have come out of Leonardo's laboratory - or riding a bird of prey. Death is always present, like a shadow that stretches for the duration of the game, in a more or less veiled way, but the focus is still on the pleasant metaphor of life that drives men to seek light in darkness.", "date": "2015-08-17", "grade": "9.0"}
