{"name": "Skate - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skate-recensione.html", "text": "It is not common to find a situation of absolute monopoly in the world of video games: stratification into genres usually ends up favoring a small group of brands, which leads to an oligarchy, or at least a duopoly, with two brands that tend to dividing the audience more or less equally (just think of FIFA and PES, for example, or the American sports series shared between 2K and EA). The world of skateboarding, on the other hand, has been witnessing the undisputed dominance of a single title for years, with rare exceptions: the series based on Activision's Tony Hawk, which has now reached about ten years of honorable activity. When Electronic Arts proposed this Skate, in its new perspective of expansion towards new brands, few would probably have thought of a worthy rival for the Hawk Man series, especially considering that it is a completely new brand, and even more difficult one could have thought of an innovative approach to the world of skateboarding in a video game, which was thought by now to be directed towards the canons established by the Activision/Neversoft series. Instead, surprisingly, Skate turns out to be not only a valid rival, but a real alternative, a new conception of the board on wheels in a digital version. Revolutionary controls The images and videos probably don't do justice to the game in question, since they fail to give a glimpse of the real revolution that Skate entails: by making the necessary proportions, Skate transmits sensations similar to those experienced by playing Super Mario 64 for the first time, limiting ourselves to the scope of videogame skateboarding. Accustomed to an absolutely digital control of the skater, we are forced to revolutionize our point of view, thanks to an ingenious interface: the various ollies and flips are performed only through the right analog stick, executing fast movements in different directions you will get a huge amount of different movements. It is a new analog approach, which forcefully immerses the player in the action, giving the feeling of complete control of the movements of the board. Where Tony Hawk is to all intents and purposes an arcade, Skate fills the gap left in terms of simulations, with decidedly more technical dynamics: this not only as regards the new type of control, but also as a reproduction of the physical behavior of the board and skater movements. It is an exaltation of the moment, of experimentation and repeated rehearsal until the perfect execution is achieved Revolutionary controls For example, it is possible to move your feet back and forth on the skateboard: ollie (and derivatives) starting from different positions will have different effects, and learning to master all the variables involved is an exhilarating challenge, with the most difficult tricks resulting, as in reality, particularly difficult to carry out, but of great satisfaction. This new setting tends to focus attention on every single moment of the trick to be performed: rather than continuously pressing keys, stringing together impossible evolutions within a landscape made to be dominated with the board, Skate forces us to concentrate on each performance stage. The simple grind, for example, is no longer done just by pressing a specific key, but requires the right timing and direction at the moment of the ollie, and then the perfect alignment of the board on the surface to be ~scratched~. It is an exaltation of the moment, of experimentation and repeated testing until perfect execution is achieved: it is the essence of skateboarding, in short, brought back for the first time, in all its realism, within a video game . Skate living The general structure does not deviate excessively from the standard one: after a nice filmed introduction, with the usual luxury extras in the world of skate (although the setting is distinguished by a decidedly more original and amusing cut), we are faced with the classic character editor, actually not too complex. After creating our avatar we can launch into the various game modes, single or multiplayer: in any case we will find ourselves wandering inside the immense fictitious city created by EA as a game world, or San Vanelona, a metropolis of dimensions vast, which needs, to give an idea, about 10 minutes to be crossed from one end to the other. The difference with Tony Hawk, also as regards the setting, is evident: it is not easy to find halfpipes, gaps and walls to grind everywhere, as happens in the Activision game. San Vanelona has the appearance of a real city, which needs to be explored in depth to find its best pointsplaces where you can devote yourself to performances, populated by passers-by and cars in large numbers, without having that ~world made for skate~ aspect. Obviously, within the various areas that make up the city, there are many areas in which we will be able to try our hand at our personal shows: the game provides a self-mapping system that allows you to place markers (in addition to those already present in default) of ~hot spots~ in the places we deem appropriate, so that we can return to them at any time without having to cross the city. This structure pushes us to focus on research and exploration, giving greater weight to the discovery of interesting points to perform one's tricks, although the impossibility of getting off the board often makes such trips frustrating, with the skater blocked by minimal obstacles such as small steps , which make extensive climbing maneuvers necessary. The aim of the game obviously lies in trying to perform increasingly complex tricks, completing the various missions to which we will be subjected. The board under your feet With the left analog stick you control the direction of the skater (right-left) and his position on the board (up-down), while with the right stick you perform various ollies and flips, with related variations. The movements to be performed are exactly those that one would expect from a joypad reproduction of the real ones: by pressing the lever down you ~load~ on the board, then with a quick swipe up you jump. The variations given to the touch determine consequent different thrusts on the board, which according to the distribution of the weights will perform the different tricks of the repertoire. In the air, the movement of the sticks triggers a series of variations and twists, while the L and R triggers correspond to the movements of the hands, to execute the various grabs. Only the push with the foot on the ground is associated with the keys, except for the B which is used in some ~extreme~ figures in the air. A ~soft~ and sensitive touch on the right stick allows you to perform manuals, while grinds must be performed by perfectly calculating the trajectory of the jump on the surface concerned, and rotating the board exactly at the point on which we want to pivot. That's all, there aren't infinite key combos to remember, just these fundamental movements, of which we have to learn all the slightest variations and understand the best way to chain the various tricks together, which is far from easy but definitely rewarding. Impossible missions? The challenges to which we are subjected during the game are various, even if all based on the same structures: initially it is a question of mastering all the tricks present (in fact these are not unlocked by advancing in the game, they simply have to be learned all along the way), following the classic teachings of the various famous skaters reproduced inside San Vanelona, later things will get more complicated. There will be races to win, places to ~ownare~ by performing tricks in certain points on the map, or performances to be performed in front of photographers or cameras in order to end up on the covers of specialized magazines and increase one's reputation. Obviously, the more practical challenges can also be carried out in multiplayer, both offline, with party games, and online via Xbox Live. Skate places particular emphasis on the creation of an online community based on it, with the possibility, in addition to carrying out different types of games via Live, also being able to upload the videos produced in-game to the server and share them with others users, who will be able to see and comment on them. Although the game is generally enjoyable, one gets the impression that the excellent control system is not, at times, well integrated with the fabric of the gameplay itself: the challenges (in particular the ~S.K.A.T.E.~, in which we have to repeat the trick made by the adversary, so as not to make us gradually bind a new letter until the completion of the aforementioned word) are often based on the execution of moves in an excessively precise manner, for a control system with infinite, minimal possible variations such as the one devised for the game. You will often find yourself having to repeat the mission for having made a wrong movement by only a few millimeters, with an almost imperceptible difference. Eskatica While not achieving incredible results, the aesthetic aspect of Skate is convincing: the city of San Vanelona is vast and well structured, a good compromise between a realistic reproduction and a fictitious world created specifically for skateboarding. Wandering the streets, and noting the marked differences between the neighborhoods, the idea that derives is that San Vanelona can stand comparison well with other settings created pFor free roaming games, which have little to do with skateboarding, without looking like a clear jumble of structures designed to be exploited by the board. In addition to the polygonal mass present, we note the vast use of effects to embellish the environment: bumps, normal mapping and various light and refraction effects are often found on the different surfaces of the streets and squares of the city. The most convincing element of the game is the skater, however, who despite a perhaps not too complex model and customization, stands out for a repertoire of really well done and realistic animations, with measured and well coordinated movements even during more furious combos. The notes to be made to the technical sector above all concern the management of the camera, which with a single shot, very close and slightly off-centre, often hides part of the scenario and makes maneuvers that require greater precision, such as grinds, difficult. There are also sporadic cases of problems of interpenetration and false contacts between the polygons, or, more rarely, some ~dead zones~, in which the skater gets stuck with no possibility of exiting. The audio sector is strangely non-invasive, compared to what the competition has accustomed us to, emerging overbearing only in the moment of the most lively action and creating a good accompaniment. The soundtrack is made up of the usual plethora of licensed songs, very leaning towards hip hop, while a wider component of punk or melodic hardcore songs would have been welcome (but it's a subjective opinion). Xbox 360 goals Skate contains 44 achievements for the classic total of 1000 gamerpoints. The achievements are scattered both during the ~career~ and within the online game, and are obviously linked to the achievement of various results: they range from triumphantly concluding the various challenges proposed, to unlocking new game areas, or winning a certain number of online challenges. The possibilities are many, and if for some objectives it will be enough to simply continue calmly in the game, for others it will be necessary to commit oneself and become real celebrities of the online community. Comment Skate is not necessarily a replacement for Tony Hawk, as one might think. It is rather an alternative, which has revealed itself, surprisingly, to be decidedly valid. The new EA product satisfies the latent desire for a simulative approach to the world of skateboarding: it is an exaltation of the true experience of the board on wheels, no longer a videogame digression into its world. Skate is a deep, immersive, hard and highly technical experience that requires application and perseverance to master. However, the fundamental impression remains that, in the face of an innovative and exciting control system, a game up to par has not been built around it, which on the contrary often remains caged in boring and frustrating distance dynamics. In any case, overall it remains an extremely interesting title, which for fans of the genre can represent a real boon, and which will not fail to exalt anyone who approaches it with its new type of controls, at least initially. Undoubtedly a good start from EA, which bodes very well for the future. Pros: Fantastic controls New simulation approach Good technical sector Cons: Missions are often frustrating Online game sometimes a bit jerky Structure a bit dispersive Skate is available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The version tested is for Xbox 360.", "date": "2007-10-10", "grade": null}
