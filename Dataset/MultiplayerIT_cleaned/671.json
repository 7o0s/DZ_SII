Although initially it may seem like an arcade and immediate product, Jowood's game requires great concentration to balance speed, the need to turn, find the aerodynamic position when possible and better understand the different characteristics of each race on the various tracks faithfully reproduced from the world real. All this makes us promote Ski Racing 2006 with flying colours, with only one precise caveat: if you don't have even the slightest passion for poles, bindings and boots, the simulation perspective of Ski Racing 2006 could easily prove frustrating. If, on the other hand, you can't wait to follow the exploits of Albertone Tomba or Giorgio Rocca, then you will certainly go without fail. Pros Excellent ski simulation Lots of Game Possibilities High Customization Cons Frustrating for those who don't have a passion for skiing Good visual realization but not flashy Only suitable for those who have snow in their blood The greatness of Ski Racing is the incredible balance of all the elements that the player will have to take into consideration to obtain excellent performances. Let's start with speed: forget about putting yourself in an aerodynamic position always and in any case. This behavior produces big problems not only in special slalom, the most technical discipline, but also in other specialties, especially in those narrower passages. At the same time, exceeding in moderation will land you in the bottom places of the race leaderboard. The same can be said for gleaning and carving, both to be used at the right moments to get the best trajectories and not waste precious time. The availability of carving then, if we don't take breaks between one race and another, will tend to decrease to zero and this will have a very negative effect on our times. SR2006 is truly an excellent simulation, capable of best reproposing the skiing discipline in a videogame key (except for tiredness!): it should be noted, however, that its high difficulty (each slope and each race is a test in itself with of each competition) could still lead to frustration for those who do not have a great passion for the art of skiing. White Visions From a technical point of view, Ski Racing 2006 does not disappoint. In addition to not requiring expensive hardware specifications (on PC of course), Jowood's game, while not featuring a high number of polygons on the screen both for the settings and for the creation of the characters, still offers good textures, excellent animations for skiers and above all a fluidity never questioned, further enriched by motion blur (however selectable according to the player's will). As far as the sound is concerned, however, nothing particular to report except for the discreet environmental effects to which, however, the possibility of using your own MP3s as an accompaniment for our descents into the mountains must be added. From a technical point of view, Ski Racing 2006 does not disappoint world Cup We have just mentioned the World Cup which in practice turns out to be the very heart of the game itself and practically identical to the real counterpart: we will therefore be able to play, if we want, all the disciplines of alpine skiing (downhill, super G, giant slalom, slalom special and combined) or from the beginning we will be able to take part in only some of the specialties. But we will still have another possibility, that is to choose from race to race whether or not to participate in a competition. This element, in addition to giving the player ample freedom of action, is very important for the tiredness factor: in fact, if we don't even allow ourselves a break, our alter ego will start to wear out and have less convincing performances during the races. A managerial element of no small importance and which appropriately incorporates a real aspect of the discipline. Finally, the World Cup also allows you to unlock various more or less important equipment for the performance of our skier or boots, skis, helmets and even others, allowing us to then choose which ones we will find more suitable for competitions. Also noteworthy is the presence of some challenges sponsored by Atomic that allow you to have access to other special ~items~. In addition to the World Cup, Ski Racing 2006 also offers many other very interesting game modes, especially in multiplayer Editor, Online, Multiplayer and However, Ski Racing 2006 also offers other decidedly interesting game modes starting with multiplayer: with just one PC we will be able to play together with a friend by dividing the keyboard in two or using a joypad. The possibility of playing in the company si then expands to online where, in addition to an online World Cup (basically the best times made that can be viewed on the game's official website) we will be able to go head-to-head against a single opponent who will be visible as a sort of ~ghost~, or challenge up to 31 other players but in this case only the times and gaps will be displayed, since it would have been practically impossible to find a way to represent all the athletes on the screen. As if all this were not enough, in addition to the fast game (which can be tackled with our personalized athlete or with professional skiers including testimonial Herminator Maier and other real athletes but some with ~crippled~ names), SR 2006 also features an event editor in which, in addition to being able to choose one of the many peaks present in the world cup (the choice is really wide with the most important slopes on every continent), we will be able to place the flags and choose the climate. The nice thing is that we can also use our creations for online gaming if we adopt our PC as game server. And now it's time to tell you about the emotions on the track... From Tomb to Rock Anyone who was already a few years old at the end of the 1980s will certainly remember the great emotions that all of Italy experienced with the incredible sporting feats of that Gascon from Bologna called Alberto Tomba: tens of thousands of people on the slopes, TV audiences from football of the national team at the World Cup and a ski movement that reached its peak in our country in those years. As with any champion, even the National Albertone hung up his skis and all the movement of the snow has weakened considerably. Fortunately, in the last few months, the thirty-year-old Giorgio Rocca has begun to repeatedly win special slaloms and around skiing a certain interest has started to ignite again, also in view of the next Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006. So let's get ready too with Ski Racing 2006. The new edition of Ski Racing immediately presents itself very well in terms of customization and game modes From Tomb to Rock After the modest success of the 2005 version, Jowood returns to make us wear skis, bindings, boots and poles. The new 2006 edition is immediately very good in terms of customization and game modes. In fact, the peculiar characteristics of a sport such as skiing could not lend themselves to some types of gamers: therefore, for example, we will be able to choose whether jumping a door of the race will result in immediate disqualification or only a 3-second penalty in the overall time. This is just one of the many parameters that we will be able to modify as well as the possibility of creating our own digital alter ego (aesthetically customizable in a few aspects to be honest) which can be managed in a way similar to that of an RPG. In fact, initially we will have all the various parameters at zero (grit, speed, technique, jump) but as the world cup races go by, the experience points will allow us to increase our values as we see fit. On the top of the mountain It's true, not many ski games have come out over the years, especially in the last few, but Ski Racing 2006 is undoubtedly the best title ever released within the reference genre. At first glance, Jowood's title seems characterized by an ~arcade~ and immediate gameplay since 6 keys are enough to play: right and left, forward, special key (push yourself at the beginning and push forward at the end of the descent in addition to managing jumps), gleaning (to turn sharply and reduce speed, which we can only do with this operation) and carving, i.e. the possibility of turning with a very large radius without however losing much speed but whose use is limited and signaled by a bar that runs out with its use. The greatness of Ski Racing is the incredible balance of all the elements that the player will have to take into consideration to obtain excellent performances Cross-platform In addition to PC, we will be able to descend from the top of the mountain also on Xbox and PS2. In comparing the various versions, the one for Personal Computer comes out decisively the winner, so much so that the final vote for the consoles must be lowered by almost one point, not so much for the online technical sector of multiplatform productions (resolution and lower visual detail) but for the almost total lack of the online component, reduced on Microsoft and Sony machines to the insertion of the high scores of their descents. Moreover, the dear old keyboard turns out to be much more performing as regards the r control systemCompared to PS2 and Xbox gamepads. The Playstation 2 also lacks, of course, the possibility of using your own MP3s as musical accompaniment for our descents.", "date": "2005-12-27", "grade": null}
