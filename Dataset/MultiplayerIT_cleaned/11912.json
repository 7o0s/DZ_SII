{"name": "CSI: Miami - Il gioco mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-miami-il-gioco-mobile.html", "text": "The life of the science policeman as told in CSI sounds really exciting, doesn't it? In reality, there is much more work in the labs than on the street, and very often the evidence tells no story but merely provides fragments (sometimes important, sometimes not) of a story that may never be understood. It is certainly true that it is a job in which the method is fundamental, and only after carrying out the investigations in a rigorous way can one begin to formulate some hypotheses. Things go more or less like this in CSI: Miami: a crime occurs, the brave Horatio promptly reaches the crime scene, takes down his sunglasses and strikes his classic pose with his hands on his hips, firing a sentence to effect. And then it's off... The story of CSI: Miami - Mobile game begins with the discovery of a girl's body on the beach. The forensic science is already in place, so after a minimum tutorial you can already start with a preliminary analysis of the scene by scrolling with a lens on the screen to find important details, then collect the evidence with the various tools available. Once this first phase is completed, we move on to the analysis laboratory to examine the material taken from the scene of the crime, after which we check the autopsy to understand if the cause of death has been determined and if there are particular elements to take into consideration. Then we proceed with the interrogation of people who knew the victim, verifying their alibi and perhaps finding inconsistencies in their statements. As the investigation progresses, new tools for gathering and searching for evidence come into play, new suspects appear and the places where you have to look for clues multiply. The player is a little ~taken by the hand~ every time a new element is introduced, after which you have to explore the places by yourself and find all the evidence to collect quickly, or they will begin to ~shine~ making life easier but influencing the final score which at the end of each phase expresses the quality of our work. Just make some progress to understand how this mobile reduction of CSI: Miami works, which in practice is very similar to the games drawn from the various CSI series for all systems. As written at the beginning, the new Gameloft product respects the spirit of CSI: Miami from every point of view. First of all, the plot designed for the game is quite solid and plausible, much less obvious than it appears at the beginning and certainly in line with the average quality of the show. Everything is told through numerous textual dialogues, with the various characters digitized quite well and an excellent realization of the places to explore as well as the map (whose buildings scroll in perspective parallax: a welcome touch of class). More unique than rare, even the sound sector is up to the situation, thanks to some MIDIs that reproduce the theme song of the series and flank it with well-made themes in line with the atmosphere of the game. The control system sees the prevalent use of the joystick to move around the map but also and above all to explore the places where there is evidence to be collected. It is certainly a cumbersome solution, but it was the only possible one and has the advantage of being immediate and intuitive: everything can be done simply with three keys. PRO Solid and thick structure Technically excellent Very faithful to the show AGAINST It is a terribly ~static~ genre It can get repetitive", "date": "2007-10-22", "grade": "S.V."}
