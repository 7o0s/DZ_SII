{"name": "Lo Zuma umano", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/113506-tokyo-crash-mobs-lo-zuma-umano.html", "text": "We Italians, as we know, are masters in not respecting the queues that we face every day to take care of any business or to enter a club; among the peoples who, on the other hand, have the reputation of being extremely respectful of the rules, the Japanese are in the very first places. It must therefore be a sort of Freudian unconscious desire that prompted the designers of Mitchell, creators of the Puzz Loop concept in 1998 that you may know better due to one of the thousand incarnations of Zuma, to re-propose for the umpteenth time the formula however, drastically and decidedly surreally changing its appearance and presentation. We immediately anticipate that perhaps, compared to the aforementioned titles, Tokyo Crash Mobs suffers from a few too many problems, but we are certainly facing the weirdest title that has ever appeared on the Nintendo eShop. Grace's weed For those who, despite Zuma having raged for years on every electronic device, from consoles to washing machines, still don't know the concept, let's summarize briefly: a row of colored marbles, which can take on the most varied pattern and can stand still or advance with the arrival of new marbles appears in front of us, who have the task of reducing it to zero and/or stopping its advance by throwing other marbles at it; in fact, if a marble hits at least two others of the same color, they disappear, possibly giving life to the classic chains in the purest spirit of puzzle games like Puzzle Bobble. So far so normal: well, now imagine that instead of marbles there are people in line to enter a club or participate in a particular event, some dressed in red, some in blue, some in yellow, some in green, and that instead of an anonymous ~ball shooter~ there is one of the nice and cute protagonists, the Asian Grace or the blonde Savannah, who just can't stand queues and desperately try to eliminate them or at least reduce them. What better way than throwing other unfortunate people dressed in the same color at bystanders (which the game calls ~scenesters~)? In fact, we can't imagine any of them. Avoiding for now to dwell on the absurdity of the thing, we will have the opportunity to talk about it later, let's delve into the innovations that Tokyo Crash Mobs brings to the formula from the point of view of gameplay, all welcome as novelties, but not all perfectly successful. First of all, the two protagonists throw people on the row in different ways: Grace throws them in the air, thus being able to easily hit the more distant parts, Savannah instead prefers to make them roll on the ground, a more direct method but which however requires, to reach the more distant scenesters , that those who get in the way make a leap, which happens when you point them with the stylus for a few seconds. Yes, the nib, because Tokyo Crash Mobs is controlled exclusively via touch, with the lower screen representing a schematic map of the row: this makes everything very intuitive in principle, but the upper screen often and willingly frames only a small part of the 'action, action also made confused by the nice and demented animations of the people in line and by the ~three-quarter~ shot, probably chosen to take advantage of the 3D effect, which when the line turns makes it difficult to find two or more consecutive scenesters of the same color; all this, especially when game over is near and anxiety rises also thanks to the music that becomes more pressing, can lead to errors that with a more classic and schematic presentation it would have been easy to avoid. Obviously, as the internships go by, new elements are added, both disruptive (from people trying to enter the middle of the queue up to the presence of two files to manage at the same time) and of help, such as the barriers that prevent the queue from getting bigger or the 'umbrella which scenesters open during short bursts of rain and which causes them to change colour. The 3D effect Combined with the large number of elements on the screen and the particular ~mixed 2D/3D~ style used, stereoscopy produces quite spectacular results, but, unfortunately, which directly affect the gameplay, increasing confusion and the possibility of making mistakes. We therefore recommend activating it only in Team Battles, which are framed from behind and which therefore benefit from the increase in perspective, and absolutely in movies: 3D somehow makes these little nonsense masterpieces even more exhilarating. Throwing the Ninja All this will go on for a not very long series of levels, which however compensates for its brevity with a difficulty that rises even too steeply, to soon reach very high levels without disdaining a nice variation on the theme, the ~Team Battles ~, in which ourthree heroines will work together to foil the threat posed by some fearsome ninjas; once the Story Mode is completed, then, the title still has something to offer, from the Challenge Mode, the classic ~infinite challenge~ of any self-respecting puzzle, to the Movie Maze in which to review all the unlocked movies. It is precisely the videos (which are numerous, making Tokyo Crash Mobs a very full-bodied download) to introduce us to the presentation: absolutely nonsense, with an extremely surreal, extremely Japanese, often extremely incomprehensible humor. From the premise itself, to the digitized sprites equipped with absurd animations, to the various menus and loading screens, to the aforementioned FMVs (which involve UFOs, dimensional portals and the ubiquitous ninjas), up to the music and sound effects, everything contributes to making of the new Mitchell production by far the weirdest product so far available on the eShop, and perhaps in the entire 3DS soft library; so absurd that for those who no longer experience (or have never experienced) a particular fascination for the game formula it might be worth shelling out the 5 Euros and 99 required just to see how far the sick imagination of a Japanese can go . And in fact, some little things - the aforementioned control problems and confusion on the screen, or the sound effects such as the cries of the crowd and the verses of the protagonists, initially amusing but tiring in the long run - make us think of how perhaps during development priority has actually been given to innovation at all costs, both in terms of gameplay and aesthetics, rather than not an optimal balance. Two final notes: the first on the localization which stopped at the English language, irrelevant for understanding the movies (the characters don't speak and then, on closer inspection, there is nothing to understand) but which can create some problems when it comes to to read the tutorials of the various game elements; the second on how much Tokyo Crash Mobs proves to be a real leech for the 3DS battery, thanks to FMV and digitized sprites full of animations.", "date": "2013-01-17", "grade": "6.7"}
