This is certainly the case with Prince of Persia Classic, which hides the (almost) unaltered essence of the historic action game behind completely renewed graphics. This is Persiaaaa! In the name of the strictest respect for the original material, Ubisoft has not made any changes to the basis of the game, starting from a plot that has remained identical to that of 1989 with the only difference being narrated by some short - and rather mediocre - CG sequences: the user must therefore guide the protagonist through the dungeons of a palace to reach and rescue the princess held hostage by the evil Jaffar. Contextually, not even the play structure has been altered if not minimally, and anyone who has had the opportunity to play the original or one of the various ports or remakes will immediately find themselves on familiar ground. For all the others it is enough to know that Prince of Persia Classic is a two-dimensional action game strongly unbalanced on the platform component, in which the protagonist must overcome levels fraught with traps and pitfalls being able to rely practically only on his running and on his ability to jump and hang on ledges. No sci-fi acrobatics, slow-motion, power ups or upgrades to unlock along the way: the only objects that will be found in your path will be a sword to face enemies in a duel and ampoules useful for restoring your vital energy. Obviously, we are faced with a strongly old school title, which as such must be faced: the level of difficulty is decidedly higher than today's average of the genre and many sections rely on a ruthless trial and error, even if not some concessions to modernity are missing. There are therefore checkpoints that significantly limit the extent of frustration, and some visual devices that provide the user with clues on how to continue. Being a product developed over twenty years ago, some of its components can inevitably be anachronistic, an aspect that is however compensated by an exceptional level design that still shows off its brilliance today. On the graphic front, however, Prince of Persia Classic can count on a total makeover stylistically similar to that of the previous versions for XBLA and PSN: the definition of the iPhone screen enhances the excellent quality of the backdrops, while on the character models it could have been do much more, especially as regards animations that are a little too nervous and unrelated to each other. Unfortunately, the Ubisoft production puts the foot wrong in what is one of the fundamental aspects of the gameplay of Prince of Persia, or the precision of the control system, which here leaves a lot to be desired. Fault of the virtual slider placed in the left corner of the touchscreen which in theory should allow the speed of the protagonist's movements to be dosed fluidly, but which in reality proves to be very little suitable for the purpose, forcing the user to a progression in fits and starts for don't risk losing control of the on-screen character. On the longevity front, it is easy to say: the 60-minute time limit to reach the princess makes it clear that Prince of Persia Classic is not a particularly long adventure, and the two additional modes (one without the countdown and the other which forces to complete the game without dying) do not constitute a substantial incentive beyond the objectives of the Game Center.", "date": "2012-03-26", "grade": "7.2"}
