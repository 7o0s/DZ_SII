{"name": "In perfetto equilibrio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76399-art-of-balance-in-perfetto-equilibrio.html", "text": "The game is available for download on the WiiWareShin'en service, the software house responsible for that old shooter on Nintendo DS called Nanostray, makes a decisive leap in quality towards the famous Nintendo Difference by proposing a title that for care and refinement nothing has to envy to the titles of Nintendo itself and their always perfect gameplay. The ~Wii factor~ therefore seems to have infected them, given that after a shooter they come back with a game with decidedly softer and more reflective tones: Art of Balance is a puzzle game in which the goal is to stack as many objects vertically and reach ever higher heights without knocking them to the ground. Something similar had already been seen, especially on the iPhone in which titles of this genre abound thanks to its multi-touch screen, but on the Wii the idea makes it just as well using the ever-loved remote control. Don't be deceived by the few basic rules of Art of Balance, it is the classic ~easy to learn, difficult to manage~ game, that is within everyone's reach, but that everyone approaches based on their own coordination and evaluation skills. Just like Tetris, Puzzle Bubble or any other brilliant puzzle game of that genre. In Art of Balance you proceed with caution and precision, superimposing objects on top of other objects trying not to make them lose their center of gravity and balance. The goal is to reach a predetermined height or complete as many pieces in the shortest time possible. Added to all this is the fact that certain objects have ~rules~ that need to be managed; for example, some of them cannot bear too much weight, others have a timer which, if not positioned correctly, will cause it to collapse miserably on the under-built castle when it expires. To complete a level, we not only have to finish placing all the pieces, but once they run out, we also have to pass a three-second timer during which the general balance of one's creature is tested. Easy but deep Art of Balance can basically be played in two ways: alone or in company. In the first case you go from level to level through the classic ~Arcade~ mode, while the second allows a friend of ours to be able to join the game. There are two possibilities here: coop or versus. Co-op play is done by splitting the screen vertically. It is basically a question of retracing the same levels already seen in Arcade, so don't expect new puzzles or big differences other than being able to get angry with your friend next to you if the pile built together falls miserably to the ground. Companion that can also be used for frenetic and fun versus matches, in which we are given the possibility to select the number of rounds to play and challenge each other by trying to complete the levels as quickly as possible. In games of this kind, controls and precision are the most important element ever to be able to correctly perform the desired actions on the screen, especially when it comes to a title that makes balance its strength and fun. The implementation of the remote controls is almost perfect and excellently calibrated, the objects are grabbed by pressing A+B and delicately released by leaving the grip of the rear trigger, in an analogical and gradual way as each of us has learned to do in reality with the physics and weight of objects. The challenge offered by Art of Balance is almost infinite with a friend next to you and with the future possibility of expanding the levels, but above all it is within the reach of adults and children, making it enjoyable for a wide range of people also thanks to its immediate learning curve (everyone enjoyed making castles of cards as children and is trained to do it!). The graphics sector is at least as simple as the concept around which the game revolves. These are mostly flowers and figurative images that serve as backgrounds colored in pastel shades. The visual style is pleasant and not distracting to the eye but nothing graphically powerful, of course. Too bad for a few too many playlists, particularly visible using a component cable on a high definition TV, and an audio sector that is a little too repetitive and invasive compared to the general tone of the game, always very thoughtful and zen. Ultimately, however, it is a pearl of gameplay that cannot be missing in your Wii Ware game collection, as well as one of the best puzzle games around.", "date": "2010-04-16", "grade": "8.5"}
