{"name": "FIFA 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-09-recensione_d.html", "text": "It is curious to note how the latest editions of FIFA and PES have alternated in the spotlight depending on the reference platform: if therefore the EA product has shown that it has an edge on Xbox 360 and PS3, the Konami title has left more than just wowed with its innovative control system on Wii, where FIFA had taken a more classic and less exciting approach. Now that the confrontation between the two sacred video-ball monsters is upon us again, let's see what are the weapons of this new FIFA 09 for the Nintendo console... Quantity player Like any self-respecting FIFA, this 2009 edition for Wii also exploits the wealth of licenses held by EA as one of its greatest strengths: the game therefore has over 500 teams with squads updated as of August 29 (for example, Quaresma is among the ranks of Inter), taken from the beauty of 32 different championships. In order, national teams, Italian Serie A and B, Tippeligaen, Turkcell Super Lig, Ceska Liga, Allsvenskan, Austrian Bundesliga, Axpo Super League, Barclays Premier League, Belgium Pro League, Clydesdale Bank Premier League, Coca Cola Championship, Coca Cola League One and Two, Eredivisie, FAI Aircom League, German Bundesliga 1 and 2, Hyundai A-League, K-League, Liga Adelante, Liga BBVA, Liga do Brasil, Liga Portuguesa, Ligue 1 and 2, Major League Soccer, Mexican Premiera Division , Polska Liga, SAS Ligaen and Rest of the World. A kick to all Since setting up the play structure, it is evident how FIFA 09 for Wii has absolutely not thought of abandoning its casual orientation: while offering some more content than the previous edition, this new chapter of the EA football franchise still presses on the accelerator of immediacy, winking at that party game philosophy that is inherent in the Nintendo console. So let's start by talking about the playful offer of this FIFA 09: in addition to the canonical possibilities of facing friendlies, tournaments and various competitions, the title has a special section entirely dedicated to mini-games characterized by super-deformed graphics. Using your own Mii (or those created by EA based on famous footballers), you can therefore amuse yourself with table football, with a dribbling competition to be performed in rhythm game style, or with a series of penalties to be kicked by moving the Remote , in an attempt to hit the juiciest bonuses with the ball. However, all things already seen in the previous edition, to which is added the only real novelty, namely the possibility of trying your hand at eight-on-eight matches, always with the Miis as protagonists: the obvious aim is to provide even less expert users immediate access to the playing field, given the extremely simplified mechanics of this section. But it must be said that EA hasn't completely forgotten about hardcore gamers, enriching its product with an unexpectedly complex and profound management mode. Even without claiming to compete with real simulations, the Manager Mode is certainly able to satisfy at least the primary needs of fans of tactics, strategies and budgets: among other things, the user therefore has the freedom to choose your sponsors, manage player transfers and scouts' objectives, divide the available budget at your discretion and so on, as well as obviously organizing your team in the best possible way to aim for the championship win. Everything is controlled by pointing the Remote like a mouse on the various buttons of the menus made available, an optimal solution even if a bit of confusion - especially at the beginning - is in any case inevitable. The online component (already seen in the previous episode and which presents no substantial changes here) and a section entitled FIFA Store, in which to spend the points obtained as a result of the various matches in order to unlock various bonuses and extras, such as new uniforms for the various teams or balls with the most disparate looks. Slow motion on the pitch We have therefore seen what the structural innovations of FIFA 09 are, now let's take into consideration what actually changes once you step onto the playing field. If in the previous episode you could choose between a standard control system via Remote and Nunchuck and another that used only the remote control (intended for non-gamers) reducing the actions that can be performed to the bone, here the situation has undergone significant changes. Now the choice falls between two solutions, called respectively All-Play and Advanced Play, both requiring the use of both controllers. The former is closer to standa moderd of FIFA 08: you move with the Nunchuck stick, you shoot with Z, you perform tricks with C and you pass the ball using the A button, while B is used to make tackles and shaking the Remote allows you to shoot in possession phase and to launch a sliding attack while defending. All in all a functional system, but which has several obscure points: it is difficult to calibrate well the power of crosses and long passes and above all in the coverage phase you have to deal with a not excellent reactivity of the commands (something that is often paid for by conceding goals not so much for the opponent's skill, as for the inability to hold him back properly). In order to facilitate the less savvy players, then, the All-Play mode delegates to the CPU the task of passing the ball to the better positioned athlete, effectively limiting the user's decision-making power and nullifying the exploitation - for example - of the passes filtering. Some of these shortcomings are compensated for by the Advanced Play system, thanks to which it is possible to exploit the pointer of the Remote to select a teammate and throw the ball in his direction: thus increasing the feeling of mastery of the sphere (also because effective through balls simply aiming the area that is immediately in front of the desired athlete), even if the counterpart is that of a certain confusion in moving one's man and at the same time looking for the right partner to serve with the Remote. Slow motion on the pitch Another novelty of FIFA 09 is then a sort of evaluation system in real time: in essence, completing good passes or successfully recovering dangerous balls in defense, you give your team a temporary boost in terms of performance, with a corresponding decrease in those of the opponents. Unfortunately, one aspect that really does not convince the EA production is the artificial intelligence of the opponents: even at the highest difficulty levels, it is too easy to break through the opponent's defenses centrally, without racking your brain too much in elaborate actions which in any case - due to deficiencies accuracy of the control system - often prove dramatically inconclusive. Concerns that add up to those concerning the graphic aspect of FIFA 09 for Wii, cross and delight of substantially every multiplatform involving the Nintendo console. Flying over useless and merciless comparisons with the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, the EA title has a visual impact comparable to that of a PlayStation 2, but suffers particularly in terms of image definition and animation fluidity. The polygonal models of the athletes are still quite good and similar to the real counterparts, while the quality of the representation of the stadiums and the public leaves something to be desired. Finally, the absence of pre- and post-game sequences and the slightly cheesy look of the on-screen interface should be noted, really strange deficiencies considering EA's traditional attention to certain details. Comment FIFA 09 on Wii is undoubtedly an improved edition compared to 08, but still characterized by lights and shadows: certainly the EA product can boast more merits than defects, first of all with regard to the excellent quantity of games, the immediacy of gameplay and the good balance between modes dedicated to casual and hardcore gamers. However, it is sad to note that the developers have not paid more attention to important aspects such as the AI of the opponents, the precision of the control system and the refinement of the surrounding elements, giving FIFA 09 the appearance of a good but in some ways still incomplete product . Pros Lots of game modes Immediate and fun Over 500 teams to choose from Cons Inaccurate control system Overly permissive AI Graphics a bit dull", "date": "2008-09-29", "grade": null}
