The year is 2395 and we are close to the planet Mars, in the middle of a colonization work that has proved more complicated than expected due to the inevitable clashes between different factions. The protagonist of the game, Leon Barret, is a pilot in the service of Poseidon's Security Forces and his task is to defend the Earth's orbital stations, eliminating any threat in the context of a story that tries to deal with the theme of traditional subdivision between ~good~ and ~bad~ but it does so in a very uninteresting and engaging way, soon making us want to skip the dialogues and quickly move on to action. Well, it is precisely in the in-game action that Redout: Space Assault surprises, unfortunately not in a positive way. The idea that the game communicated was in fact that of a Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore-style shooter, with large freely explorable scenarios and a deep and multifaceted progression system, enriched by a multiplayer mode of which there is no longer a trace. What the main menu offers, once the application has been launched, is instead only a selection of seven chapters (one of which is not yet available) each divided into a variable number of strictly single player missions. Gameplay and technical realization The biggest problem of Redout: Space Assault lies in the setting of the gameplay, which works on tracks: it is possible to move the ship at will, but the path remains pre-set (apart from a few variations) and this substantially impoverishes the experience. showing however the side to a whole series of drawbacks. For example, it happens that we don't take the measurements of a movement well and the camera makes us end up against an asteroid, or that enemies shoot at us without being able to see the trajectory of the shots due to a change of course: situations that can become frustrating, especially when they give rise to an undeserved game over. The touch controls appear more responsive than those of the aforementioned Galaxy on Fire 3, but at the same time they have an inertia that takes some getting used to. The strange thing is that by connecting a Bluetooth controller, this inconvenience is eliminated, giving us much more precise and immediate commands, which also influence the degree of challenge of the experience, often trivializing it. Thanks to the credits earned in the field and the upgrades released at the end of each assignment, in fact, it is child's play to upgrade the ship to the point of not fearing comparisons, especially if from a certain point on you opt for the ~shotgun~ as a weapon principal. The balancing of the upgrades also ends up making the homing missiles very ineffective, where little attention is paid to the improvement: on the one hand it is an understandable situation, on the other it further highlights how this aspect of the progression could be better regulated. The technical realization of Redout: Space Assault is discreet. The risk with space shooters is that of proposing very poor and visually repetitive scenarios, something that the 34BigThings title tries to avoid by resorting to cel-shaded graphics and trying to differentiate the settings chromatically, which however are not distinguished by personality or wealth. The game runs very smoothly on the iPad Pro, which helps make the fights a pleasant pastime, net of the poor enhancement of the impacts: the implementation of very slight slowdowns could perhaps have increased the sense of satisfaction for each eliminated enemy. The soundtrack it changes dynamically according to what is happening on the screen, but the quality of the compositions fluctuates: we liked the more sustained and engaging ones, while the ~passing~ songs show a general lack of bite.", "date": "2019-10-16", "grade": "6.5"}
