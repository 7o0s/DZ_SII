{"name": "Warlander: la recensione dell'ibrido tra action e MOBA", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warlander-recensione.html", "text": "There is a niche of League of Legends lovers who are bothered by one thing above all: the view. The top-down perspective, a legacy of RTS origins, seems to be an obstacle for these people: now, however, there is a new game that seems to be made for them. It's called Warlander and is heavily inspired by the logic and fighting style of MOBAs, but adopts the classic third-person perspective typical of action games. You fight with a white weapon, complete with a guard and shields, or from a distance, with crossbows and spells, and the goal is only one: to sword the heart of the enemy base until it explodes. The game developed by Toylogic and published from Playon is the classic example of the ~but why hasn't anyone thought of this before?~ The gameplay works in its simplicity and, like almost all free to play multiplayer titles, Warlander is (relatively) simple to learn but a real challenge to perfect. It's as if the developers have taken a number of good ideas from different multiplayer titles and combined them into a product that works because it gives users room to find their style of play. In this Warlander review we will tell you how all the gears of this title fit together creating an experience that is beautiful to play, but a little too gray to see. How a character works Managing a character's inventory well is key in Warlander First impressions of Warlander are a little confusing, but its tutorial does a good job of explaining the flow of the game. On the battlefield (which we'll talk about in a moment) performing a variety of actions award Valor points: wounding an enemy, building a siege engine, resurrecting an ally, destroying a fortification, or damaging the heart of the enemy base. Thanks to these points it is possible to select a stronger character from your deck because, unlike League, in Warlander you don't end the game with the same character you start it with. Before starting a game, in fact, you will have to put together a team of up to 5 characters whose power is dictated by the Title they possess. There are 6 levels (0,1,2,3,4 or 5 stars) and in each team there must be at least one level 0 (i.e. untitled) character to be able to start the game or return to the game if you don't have enough points value to buy a more powerful character in your team. Titles, in addition to increasing a character's health points, increase the amount of weapons and skills that the latter can equip. Each object (a sword, a piece of armor or a passive ability) has a weight measured in CP with the most powerful weapons and magics that can occupy 1/5 of the carrying capacity of a single character. At first the options are very narrow, but as you gain experience and unlock new equipment, the possible combinations become more and more complex and malleable. Warriors, mages and clerics It doesn't matter what class you choose in Warlander, if you're on defense lend a hand with building defense weapons, they'll come in handy There are 3 classes: warrior, mage and cleric. The first is designed for hand-to-hand combat from the front line and is armed with a sword, shield and crossbow; the second is designed to stay at a distance and hit enemies with his spells and familiar while the third is the support class with abilities to heal his allies, but still armed with a maul and shield. Unfortunately, the gender of each class is blocked, because the developers have made the size of the characters a determining factor in their role: warriors, for example, are bigger and easier to hit while a cleric is much smaller. This is a great pity because it does nothing but further perpetrate gender stereotypes that are now old for today's way of making video games and above all unfair to ensure that those who play can represent themselves. Bonds have class-specific passive modifiers, and each rung adds new ways to optimize a character for the first few minutes of the game, where gaining ground is important, for the midgame, where the attacker has to break through the opponent's fortifications, or for the final assault in which it is essential to survive because dying would mean making up a large part of the map on foot. Team play and team play Going around alone is never a good idea in Warlander because an unequal fight is almost always won by the one with the numbers on their side Warlander is primarily a war between two armies, each made up of five squads of five players each. Before the start of each match each team can choose its style of play (defensive, offensive or mixed) and then volunteer for one of three roles: Defense of one's own fortress, attack of the opposing one or special operations, a kind of joker. Furthermore, within each team, it is always advisable to have a little variety in the choice of one's character: at the moment the ideal composition seems to be formed by two warriors, two wizards and a cleric. The idea is to have the two big warriors protect the mages and for everyone to be healed by the clerics. The flow of the game is very simple: towers are scattered around the map, whoever conquers one gains a respawn point closest to the enemy base. Along the lanes of the map each team can build fortifications and arm them with crossbows and cannons while to break down the doors of a base it is possible to mount a battering ram to drag up to the great door. The team that first destroys the heart of the opposing team's base wins, just like with the nexus in League of Legends. The flow of the game is very well balanced and we have rarely been overwhelmed by an enemy offensive, there is almost always time and space to regroup and mount a counter-offensive on the opposing side. Collaboration within a single team would be even better if, like in Battlefield, it was possible to be reborn alongside a teammate, but this feature is not currently available. Do you need a strong identity? Warlander is a brown-toned smoothie but maybe it doesn't need a strong visual identity Warlander is nice to play but rather flat in terms of graphics and visual characterization of characters and environments. The color of everything seems to be a different shade of brown and both the soldiers and their gear are pretty standard. Everything could change in the coming months, but it seems unlikely to us that the Warlander will change radically on this front, but the real question is: does it need it? Maybe not, because its gameplay is fresh, interesting, frenetic but also strategic and calculated if you decide to team up (or teams) with friends. From the point of view of monetization, then, you can expect the usual package of any free to title play. There is a free currency that is earned by playing the game and a premium one that you can buy with real money. In the shop there are various and eventual skins for the characters (also all brown) and various multipliers of the experience gained. The possibility of spending the game currency for Mercenary Contracts is interesting, which allow you to recruit a very strong character to add to your deck, but you can only deploy 3 times before having to renew the contract.", "date": "2023-01-23", "grade": "7.5"}
