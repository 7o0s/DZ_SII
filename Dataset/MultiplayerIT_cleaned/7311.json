Microsoft, after publishing a remake of the first chapter of the Master Chief's adventures on Xbox 360, also ensured that the first episode of the action-RPG arrived on the flagship and in conjunction with the 10 years since the first publication. In 2004 the scenario was completely different with Molyneux raging almost everywhere promising a game like never before, full of futuristic features that, inevitably, fell ruthlessly under the ax of the technical capabilities of the first Xbox, which could not bear the weight of such cumbersome ideas. This was bad first of all because so much press focused on what the game could have been, losing sight of what it actually was: a fun title, with a wonderful world and some ideas that were really innovative. Fortunately, the players trusted him and we reached the third chapter with a truly exceptional second episode. Fable Anniversary between the emotion and a re-release on Xbox 360 for all the nostalgics! Xbox 360 goals Fable Anniversary is as always with Microsoft titles quite generous in terms of goals. To get to 1000 points you need to spend some time with the interactions of the game and properly powering up the character. In short, it takes some time, but it is not an impossible undertaking. Albion and moral choices The story is that of a boy who, starting from a small village in Albion, sees his father killed and his mother and sister kidnapped without a trace. Welcomed by a member of the Guild of Heroes, O Govane begins a journey of growth and training that leads him to become a legendary warrior. Apart from the community's request for this reissue, the idea behind Anniversary is to let everyone who started loving Fable play, starting from the second episode on Xbox 360, that is when the saga exploded in terms of popularity, and that they hadn't even bought the first Xbox. Lionhead didn't limit itself to developing a port of the game, creating completely new assets with Unreal Engine 3 for polygonal models and environments, and maintaining, however, the same animations and adding the more complex and successful combat system of the second episode . Pressing X, Y or B uses melee weapons, the bow or magical shots, accumulating experience points proportional to the damage inflicted on enemies using each skill. Experience points can be spent on each of the three skills and on enhancing the character, which as he grows changes his appearance accordingly (expect blue energy streaks on the face in the case of wizards, for example) and which is also affected by moral alignment and type diet, gaining or losing weight. The marvel of Fable, at the time, was precisely that depending on how one behaved, helping or harming the inhabitants of the world, doing good or bad deeds, one obtained a different reputation and different reactions from the commoners to our passage: cries of jubilation and approval, words of contempt, ironic comments and real ovations. It is also possible to stimulate these reactions with social expressions, from flatulence to winks, up to real rude gestures or improvised ballets, all things that made the consequences that derive from all these choices fade into the background. they weren't exorbitant. Fable is still irreverent, alive and fresh precisely in this ability to put on track a light and stimulating action-RPG, afflicted by a somewhat convoluted menu system and by a target mechanism which, during the fights, makes a bit the nose and also hit the inhabitants who are helping each other during a mission. Apart from these little annoyances, however, playing Fable is still fun, considering that this re-release also incorporates all the additions of the Lost Chapters package, which came out later on PC. Curiosity Great attention has been paid to the integration of the Xbox Smartglass which allows, once a smartphone or tablet is connected to the console, to play Fable with the official Prima Games maps which highlight the position of the game, the quests of the and screenshots of secrets to unlock. The maps, even in the Italian edition, are in English, but this integration which here is little more than an experiment could be very interesting if taken up again in the future for more substantial and new games. Still worth a try, if you have what it takes. I would like to meet you in 10 years Fable: Anniversary is a game that takes between ten and twelve hours to complete and you can reach fifteen by trying to do any side missionia, which - in fact - are not very many. One of the major problems encountered in 2004 was precisely that the areas to explore were quite small and that the movement of the character was confined to the paths and streets of Albion with no possibility of exploring larger environments. From Molyneux's statements, a Morrowind in an action-RPG sauce was expected, while instead a game came out with the innovation of the social part, but without great subtleties in terms of level design, dungeons or puzzles. At the time, however, the personality and the mix of creativity behind the project made players from all over the world fall in love with them, launching the series towards the other two chapters, today, however, precisely in these aspects, Lionhead's game feels more the weight of the years given how many steps forward the genre has made. The charm, however, remains almost unchanged and the work done in adapting the graphics to the capabilities of the Unreal Engine pays off in visual terms, giving life to a title in step with the times from this point of view. There are a few frame-rate issues at first, but they disappear as soon as you leave the initial gameplay behind and set off on an adventure around the world. The high resolution, the textures and the lighting make the journey still pleasant today, limited precisely only by those characteristics that can now be considered defects. The sound commentary is always wonderful and still remains one of the most beautiful ever.", "date": "2014-02-17", "grade": "7.6"}
