On the contrary, those who have had more than 20 years of ~career~ can only remember with a touch of emotion one of the most important software houses of the Amiga and 16-bit era, with flagships such as Superfrog and Alien Breed capable of representing in the early 90s the pinnacle of gaming. Unable to maintain a market leading role even with the subsequent generations of consoles, the British software house has nevertheless managed to remain in good health even after all this time, basically thanks to the constant success of the aforementioned Worms brand. In an attempt to update and put one of its ~thoroughbreds~ back on track from the good old days, Team 17 has therefore recently relaunched its own Alien Breed through digital delivery channels; and so after the debut of the subtitled Evolution episode about a year ago, here is now this new Alien Breed 2: Assault. Aliens and Marines The structure of the game, a top-down twin stick shooter, recalls that of the original Alien Breed, although it is certainly not the 1991 title that comes to mind first; the solution adopted is in fact one of the most abused in the field of titles for XBLA, which is why Alien Breed 2: Assault certainly cannot be praised for its originality. In the same way the setting, thanks to the use of the Unreal Engine 3, aesthetically brings the product closer to many others; in this sense it certainly does not help the design of the protagonist, yet another Space Marine or something similar, nor the points of contact of the alien bestiary with those of the ~Alien~ film series. But in a historical period in which originality in video games is an increasingly rare commodity, this certainly does not constitute a particular problem for the effort of Team 17. Without a doubt Alien Breed 2: Assault is a competent game and made with discreet care; in summary, it is a question of tackling the various levels inside the spaceship by passing from one objective to another, pressing buttons, activating switches and interacting with various terminals, all seasoned with a little back tracking. A strategy tip that doesn't really matter at all, since each objective is more than clearly indicated within the radar on the map. What remains therefore is a pure and simple shooter, which pits the solitary player against waves of aliens of various sizes but always particularly aggressive. However, don't ask them to be intelligent: the attack patterns are very basic and there is no particular strategy in the clashes, and on the contrary the greater difficulty of some passages is solely linked to the number of enemies destined to attack the unfortunate protagonist at the same time. Despite this, the fights are fun, above all thanks to the now more than well-established game structure and the good variety of weapons available, ranging from the simple pistol to the flamethrower, passing through rifles, missile launchers and so on. The upgrade system of your arsenal is also a pleasant addition which, however, does not change the cards on the table too much, thus representing a marginal element. Alien Breed 2: Assault is a pleasant action game without particularly important defects, but at the same time unable to make a real leap in quality. In the face of a campaign that can be played but without sharp notes, the possibility of tackling it in multiplayer with a friend could have given a substantial hand, but the programmers have not included this mode, requiring that the 5 levels present be completed alone for a total about 5 hours of gameplay. Once this goal has been achieved, the alternatives are a Survival mode, in which to resist as long as possible against increasingly robust waves of enemies, and a co-op multiplayer linked however to different levels created ad hoc.", "date": "2010-10-28", "grade": "7.0"}
