Instead of making his way to the sound of bloody slashing, the character we control in the effort of Somnium Games in fact lives in a world made of paper and ink, where it is above all the laws of geometry and physics that put him to the test. An experience that proves to be interesting above all thanks to the artistic side of Inked, appreciating which one is willing to pass over some small defects related to the design of the game. Have we intrigued you enough? All you have to do is read on to find out more. Parallel lives Inked tells us the story of its nameless Hero, forced to face a thousand and more dangers to save his beloved Aiko from the evil being who kidnapped her. At the same time, the game also tells us about Adam, the designer who created the protagonist, telling us about aspects of his life that will soon intertwine with what happens to the Hero. We assure you that having to write it seems more complex than it is on balance, also because what really complicates things is the impossibility of talking about the plot of Inked without ending up revealing too much to those who want to play it after reading this review . All we can do is therefore tell you that the lives of the Hero and his creator have several points in common, linked above all to love, the one with a capital A that identifies the beloved of their life, and to suffering. We do not continue further and move on to the dynamics of the game, where geometry is the host, as we said. Not having a sword but a pen, the Hero is in fact able to make shapes such as cubes, ramps, spheres and other elements appear on the sheet in which he is, thanks to which he can activate mechanisms or reach otherwise unattainable platforms. The combined use of these elements is the basis of the experience proposed by Inked, in which most of the puzzles are linked to this type of dynamics. However, a good number of situations are exploited to make the experience as varied as possible, up to the final showdown in which we face what we could define as a real boss. Overall, the experience works and puts the player in a position to want to go to the end of the story of Adam and his Hero, however, occasionally putting a strain on the patience of those in front of the monitor. In fact, the challenges proposed by Inked do not give up a certain level of difficulty, leading in the most extreme cases even to try again several times to pass the same point without dying. Not that there is anything wrong with this in an absolute sense, mind you: what leaves us a bit dumbfounded is the non-linear curve of the difficulty of the situations, in which rather simple moments precede more complicated phases, and vice versa, thus disorienting player. Some moments risk being really frustrating, with the complicity of a pinch of imprecision in the controls that can be found especially when playing with the pad. However, abandoning it would be a shame, because Inked really has so much to say from an artistic point of view that it deserves to be lived to the fullest. Drawing in motion As you may have guessed from the name Aiko mentioned above, Inked is largely inspired by the Japanese tradition. The unnamed hero is a kind of samurai who moves among cherry blossom trees, also moving towards the western during his adventure. With the excuse of the long journey to find Aiko, Inked makes the gaming experience also varied in terms of setting, reaching quite important points of charm on some occasions. He succeeds both when he makes use of various colors and when the simple blue, red and black ink of the pens is used. In the specific case, they find a way to distinguish the parts of the world that make up Inked. In stylistic terms there is really nothing to complain about, on the contrary we must congratulate the guys from Somnium Games for having put together a work that in its simplicity is widely watched. The soundtrack deserves a special mention, perfectly integrated with what is shown on the screen to range from epic moments to others of suffering, embracing the context of the situation. The (little) spoken language is in English, but subtitles in Italian are immediately available for those wishing to use them. Before moving on to conclusions, let's say that about eight hours are needed to complete the story, with a rather low replayability index. There are in fact some items to collect during the Hero's journey, but it is really difficultthat alone can serve to move Inked to start over a second time.", "date": "2018-04-27", "grade": "8.0"}
