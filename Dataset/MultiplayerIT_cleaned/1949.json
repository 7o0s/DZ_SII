{"name": "Unreal Tournament 2003 - Day One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-tournament-2003-day-one.html", "text": "Phase one: the installation... and the sad notes begin. Let's say you have Windows XP in Italian and you want to install the ~English~ version of the game because you don't like speech in our local language. Well, the UT2003 setup ~forces~ you to install the Italian version, even if your preferences are different! If, on the other hand, you have WinXP in English, the problem does not arise: the setup lists all the available languages, including Italian. I managed to solve the problem, ~bypassing~ the stubbornness of WinXP: by entering the ~international and language~ options of the operating system, it is possible to choose the ~English (United States)~ language in the ~standards and formats~, repeating the same chosen in the ~advanced~, followed by a quick restart of the os, it is possible to ~setup~ UT in the various languages. Finally, after having installed everything, it is possible to return to the default configuration. After this first ~hurdle~ another one emerges: UT takes up a lot of space! Over two and a half gigabytes of material, so if you have little space on your hard disk, start making some space ... but believe it or not, my 24x/4x reader/recorder refused to recognize the cd (original!), resulting in UT2003 not starting! Arghh... there were two possibilities: change the player (temporarily) or fake the executable, with a ~no-cd~ version widespread on the net (already before UT was distributed for sale in shops!). Obviously I had to fall back on changing the CD-ROM, to test the original version with the holy trappings of reviewing duty. This is a bug, which will already be solved with the first patch (Editor's note: patch 2136, released in the previous days, completely solved the problem). Phase two: the configuration. No matter how powerful your computer, the case becomes ~a shack full of cobwebs~ when UT2003 demands it! After a very long optimization phase, I noticed that a GeForce4200 with an Athlon 1700+ and 256 MB of ram become the bare minimum to play smoothly at 800x600 with medium-high detail options (you can even get to very high and maximum, but I strongly advise against it, at least until the GeForce5 comes out or you are not already the happy owners of the Radeon 9700Pro). The mistake many make is to test UT2003 off-line and without bots. Upon first wandering through the maps, they notice a discrete fluidity, with the consequent - and alas, premature - exclamation [I]~Woow! It's beautiful fluid!~[/I]... The mournful notes come later, when the maps the ~computerized~ players are added. Apart from the fact that the latter occupy a lot of CPU clock cycles, which the game uses like a true greedy to be able to effectively manage ~artificial intelligence/deficiency~, the post-mortem phase is also added, with the effect ~rag doll~ that transforms the corpse into a fully articulated ~cicciobello~, which rolls and bends like a real ~human~ (well ... more or less.). Already with three bots the fluency drops a lot, then the ~exaggerated~ maps that instantly drain ram and graphics power are added! I've never seen anything more expensive, making the other most ~expensive~ FPS in history climb to second place in the rankings: ~Medal of Honor: Allied Assault~, which becomes, in comparison, a real trifle! Another huge drainer of resources is the activation of 3D EAX sound, for those who own a sound card from the ~SoundBlasterLive!~ (Basic, 1024 Player, Platinum, etc...). The framerate drops so much as to leave you stunned: it even varies between 30 and 50% less, depending on the map and the number of players / bots! It's however a known bug of SBLive (thanks Grem for the tip) that persists from the days of the old UT! And at the moment, even with the latest version of the related drivers, it still remains unresolved. Once these first ~big~ disappointments have been overcome, we pass with hope to the ~miraculous configuration~ phase, which is always the last trump card, before paying out a full salary (for those who own it) to grab a new video card. Obviously the game configuration setup doesn't include all the options, therefore you exit UT2003 and load the different .ini files (UT2003 and User) in your favorite text editor, after having made a backup copy of both, under penalty of complete reinstallation of the game (alas, this happened too.). The options are many, but fortunately they follow the same process as the old UT. Unfortunately, even activating the triplebuffer and increasing the minimum framerate to 85, followed by a whole series of innumerable mini-modifications and tests, was not enough to improve the fluidity, with the disheartening result that the purchase of a new video card (mat least a Radeon 9000 Pro) is mandatory. Unless you decide to play UT2003 with minimum detail, turning it into an eyesore. But we'll talk about this in depth with the special ~top secret~ under construction these days. ;) Phase three: a first partial comment. There is no doubt: the new Unreal Engine is currently unmatched in the current graphics engine market; it is the best and most advanced that can be found there. Obviously, we have noticed that this ~evolution~ is paid dearly, but as the months go by, the hardware requests will become more affordable and the UT2003 itself will automatically become more performing. For the moment, in a ~homemade~ lanparty that I organized a few weeks ago, out of fourteen players nobody was happy with the fluidity of the game which ran in a ~mediocre~ way on almost all the computers on the lan. Naturally, after a certain period of rehearsals and rehearsals (it was disheartening even to play in those conditions) we uninstalled ALL of it, to make room for the old FPS ever. If this isn't a clear sign of the bitter disappointment I've experienced, I don't see any better ones. However, in the next ~day two~, we will do the complete examination of the different game modes, with the relative maps dedicated to them. Don't miss the appointment! ;) Premise Amazement and disappointment: these are the two moods that Unreal Tournament 2003 aroused in me. It is difficult for me to start this review in a classic way. After having played, tested, optimized, minimized, maximized, dissected and ~peeled~ the game in a particle way, modifying countless times - and manually - the configuration files, I had to draw the most obvious conclusions: UT2003 is a game of the ~future ~. But let's try to proceed step by step, separating this apoplectic examination of the most awaited game by FPS fans by categories, after the release of SoF2 a few months ago. In ~day one~ we will analyze the initial stages of installation and configuration, with a quick look at the technical contents of the game. In ~day two~ we will examine in depth the different gameplay modes, combined with the numerous maps present. Finally, on ~day three~, it will be the turn of weapons and character models, with the inevitable final comment that will round off the review. A ~top secret~ special on UT2003 is already being prepared (I can only announce that it will be an article focused on the ~clash~ between two titans! ;)", "date": "2002-11-08", "grade": null}
