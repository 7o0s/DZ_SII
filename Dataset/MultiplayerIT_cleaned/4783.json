However, a Final Fantasy undoubtedly remains in the soul, faithful to the spirit of the legendary series, and the excellent evaluations testify to this. This is precisely the problem of Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, because beyond the result obtained by the developers, the major drawback of this mobile title is its being completely detached from the classic mythology of Final Fantasy and its characteristic spirit. We can imagine how things went: looking at the zillions raised by Game of War and Mobile Strike, constantly among the most profitable titles on the mobile scene, Square Enix must have thought that entrusting the MZ team with a spin-off would bring further visibility and gain to the Final Fantasy XV universe. If it is true that Game of War users spend over 500 dollars a year on the game, it is possible that the bet is also a winner, but it certainly does not appear as an elegant move on the part of the publisher and certainly will not have an impact positives on the hard core of enthusiasts of the series, assuming that this still has importance in the current market dynamics. In any case, the fact that a pay-to-win is able to extract large sums of money from users is not exactly an indication of an intrinsic quality of the product. There is nothing Final Fantasy about A New Empire, except for a profile of Noctis pasted over a game that looks every bit like a generic invasive banner ad strategy, and for the presence of the cursor in the shape of a gloved hand, perhaps the most direct reference to the series. There is no story, there is no dialogue and there is none of the typical characterization of Final Fantasy XV in this spin-off, there are only a few characters forced from the main game and inserted as an excuse to stay behind the construction and the upgrading of buildings in this phantom ~new empire~ of which it is honestly difficult to understand the meaning. The epic of loading bars As befits the genre, in Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire we find ourselves constructing and evolving various buildings in order to make our empire ever wider and more powerful, gathering resources, training units and creating armies capable of dealing with threats and expand the borders, fighting against other users in online battles. However, it is not easy to enter the epic story well since, in fact, there is no precise trace of the events that form the background to the game. Noctis tells us from time to time what to do, always without too much enthusiasm, but the actions are simply limited to ordering some new construction or expansion and waiting for it to be finished. Meanwhile, a myriad of notifications accumulate in the maze of the menus, leading us to activate quests, unlock rewards, equip the protagonist and carry on the empire in some way. All this flattens out in the simple waiting for the loading bars, which obviously require disbursements of money to be closed in advance, except in the early stages of the game, where everything seems much simpler. The creation of the army, the conduct of the (presumably) massive battles and the execution of the quests itself are also limited to a loading bar. It is probable that all this can still fascinate a good number of players, and the results achieved by the previous productions of the MZ team speak clearly in this sense, but it is really difficult to see a healthy connection with Final Fantasy, or simply a glimmer of genuine gameplay behind a perfect addiction machine for mobile users. Even the aesthetic aspect of Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire reflects this extraneousness towards the Square Enix series: although everything is made with a certain skill, the map and the structures appear anonymous while the interface is a chaos of writings, icons and buttons with continuous signals, messages and advertisements. The game gradually introduces us to the free-to-play mechanics but the consequences of this setting are not slow to reveal themselves, soon revealing themselves as a remarkable pay-to-win that inexorably rewards those who decide to spend good money in micro -transactions (consider that the cost can also reach 215 euros for an in-app purchase).", "date": "2017-07-07", "grade": "4.0"}
