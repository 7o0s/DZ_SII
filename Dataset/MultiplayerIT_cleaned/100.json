{"name": "Lost", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost.html", "text": "Shipwrecked! Even the sequences of passage from one level to another are not static but masterfully cinematic, with these assumptions you should move very cautiously with your thumb always ready on the telephone keypad because mysterious dangers are lurking. After landing in an unorthodox way on the beach of a tropical island, your first task, inside what appears to all intents and purposes a hell on earth, will be to recover the most seriously injured among flames and detonations at the risk of your own life taking them on your shoulders and carrying them to safety, not even a breather and you will have to find water in the forest, in short, survival on the island is far from obvious, those who followed him also know that they are really the mysteries and twists and turns are the hallmarks of this show and I wouldn't want to reveal too much when describing the advanced levels. Something is moving back there..... Armed with a pistol, a knife, dynamite but above all else with reflexes and logic, Lost also puts you in interactive contact with boulders to move, palm trees to cut down, bridges to cross, all miraculously manageable with the keys of the telephone and not the joypad of a PS2, this wasn't enough to give a film atmosphere, its authors have done much more than the assigned task, you can explore areas not necessarily useful for solving the game, superbly designed (if the shadow of two trees overlaps , the interstitial zone will be darker) and animated (the crackling of the bonfires on the beach, the rustling in the tall grass that bode nothing good), only the audio is anemic since there aren't even sound effects ingame, Sin! Can you hear me? Can you hear me damn? All roses and flowers up to the test of the radio transmitter (viewers will remember those cryptic messages intercepted by the castaways, those who have followed the entire series also know what they refer to) where the game designers had the obstinacy, perhaps to excess of zeal in bringing back all the details of the original, of inserting a frustrating and not at all funny or interesting test and which has nothing to do with the game as it had been played up to that moment.
