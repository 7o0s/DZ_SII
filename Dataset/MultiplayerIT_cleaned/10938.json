{"name": "Europa Universalis III Complete - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/europa-universalis-iii-complete-recensione.html", "text": "By now presumably in the final stages of its life cycle, Paradox celebrates the two years since the release of the third iteration of its most famous and appreciated title with the release of Europa Universalis III Complete, a collection at contains the basic title and the two expansions Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine. All this translates into a meticulous and complete historical reproduction of the European geopolitical situation (and beyond) between 1399 (the coronation of Henry IV of England) and 1820 - more or less the terminus of Napoleon's Europe. The player is tasked with choosing the preferred time frame and taking the reins of any of the 250 sovereign states available, stepping into the dirty and stinking shoes of a regent of the time and attempting to dominate the world, rather than simply trying not to be annihilated by the violent expansion of the new powers that have risen from the ashes of the Roman Empire or juggle intrigues and skilled maneuvers of the court to skilfully ride the waves of diplomacy. Or do all of these at the same time. One day, all of this will be yours Describing a title like Europa Universalis III with a few thousand characters is a difficult task - for whoever is writing - and thankless - for the game - especially in light of the multitude of small and large improvements that the two expansions have brought to the already complex playful heart of the basic title. However, a few hours of play are enough to appreciate above all the unprecedented system of Decisions and Missions introduced precisely with In Nomine. The Decisions, in particular, roughly replace what the Events previously represented (fixed or random) and allow the player to try to influence the civil, political and religious life of the entire nation or of single regions. Each Decision will be enforceable only after the occurrence of particular pre-conditions and, sporadically, some of them will be made available only for certain states. Playing with the Venice of the Doges, for example, among the wide range of Decisions available there will also be the one that provides for the unification of Italy, which obviously can only be activated after having conquered or annexed the rest of the Italian states. Playing as Spain, on the other hand, you could establish the Inquisition while commanding the Americas, at some point in the game, you can request Independence and so on. If the Decisions are however relegated to a passive role, simply left at the disposal of the player, the Missions instead are real challenges launched by the game towards the player. Also directly linked to the nation concerned, they consist of military, diplomatic or even simply commercial actions. The Americans, for example, may have to conquer Florida rather than defend it. While leading the Spaniards we happened to see ourselves asked to improve our relations with the Casillian neighbors and then make them become Christians. Completing each mission will bring special bonuses such as prestige or additional stability. Indirectly, especially the missions also help the already refined artificial intelligence of our enemies, giving the computer-controlled factions a certain personality and coherence of behavior. More generally, Missions and Decisions are a way as simple as it is intelligent to offer players more disoriented and less accustomed to this genre of games a sort of guideline, a series of small intermediate stages capable of accompanying and at the same time often stimulating the whole continuation of the game. All without affecting the open and somewhat ~anarchic~ nature that has always distinguished all the titles in the series. Unlike many other strategic games on the market, in Europa Universalis the concept of victory is always rather vague and ambiguous, as well as left to the player's free interpretation. After a few games you may find yourself getting more satisfaction from barely surviving leading the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, from marriage to marriage, rather than trying to conquer the world by setting it on fire with the mighty Spanish Empire. For the rest, the two expansions manage to undoubtedly increase the depth and charm of Europa Universalis III, enriching it with unprecedented and very welcome nuances, not forgetting to put some patches on the more lame aspects of the mechanics of the base game, such as the management of merchants (finally automated) and settlers (colonizing South America with Poland will be decidedly more difficult and likely). Looking forward to the fourth chapter The graphics engineof Europa Universalis III Complete does not bring any of the improvements that instead affected the spin-off Europa Universalis: Rome and therefore remains almost identical to that of two years ago. We are therefore talking about a graphic detail sacrificed in the name of tredd without however boasting any real advantage brought about by the introduction of the third dimension. On the contrary. At least from this point of view Civilization IV or even just the strategic section of the Total War series could - and should - teach Paradox designers a lot. The user interface, on the other hand, has been overhauled with the clear intention of making information even more accessible and actions intuitive. Unfortunately, the goal seems to be only half successful. In fact, if information about the state of our Empire appears easily accessible - at least after a certain period of learning - still too often apparently simple and harmless operations, such as the consolidation of troops or fleets, in practice become complex and sometimes even obscure . To make matters worse, the lack of the Italian language and the total absence of any paper manual. But for the few tens of euros for which the package is sold, we certainly couldn't ask for more. We will also be able to make up for it with a beautiful - and useless - full-color poster and with the commendable initiative of offering all buyers a second additional digital copy (backup) and completely free of charge, which can be downloaded via a Digital Delivery service. Comment For all those who still had the doubt whether or not to try their hand at the third chapter of the Europa Universalis series, the time has come: buy the game and ask for holidays at work. In the same way, whether you enjoyed the basic title or a bitter aftertaste of disappointment remained in your mouth, know that especially the contents introduced by the latest expansion - In Nomine - are able to enhance Europa Universalis III and to become an essential title for all lovers of the genre. Of course, the graphics remain what they are (ugly) and even the user interface, however further revised and redesigned, tends to remain sporadically difficult, if not cryptic. But it's a price we gladly pay, in the face of such a huge amount of playful content.
