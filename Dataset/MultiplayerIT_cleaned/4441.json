Over time, this reinterpretation has obviously also generally codified with its own reference canon and the 10tons team seems to have particularly specialized in this style of play. The authors of the excellent Neon Chrome therefore return to the charge on their workhorse with this JYDGE, a double stick shooter which represents a further stylistic refinement for the developers in question, as well as a nice tribute to certain atmospheres typical of the shooter of some time does. For those who lived through the 80s and 90s, this JYDGE can bring out memories of similar games by setting such as Alien Breed and The Chaos Engine (not to mention Smash TV given the futuristic-dystopian vision) or by setting and concept such as Syndicate, and it is not said that these references are not intended. On the other hand, JYDGE's cyberpunk vision of the future is the classic one of the 80s: in a world dominated by violence, the JYDGE is a sort of super-cop who is sent directly to very high risk areas to clean up bad guys and possibly save the innocents. How to do it is easy to say: our hero is a soldier with cybernetic implants that give him superhuman abilities, as well as a reliable upgradeable weapon called Gravel with which he is able to negotiate with lead and explosives with any criminal. If all this is not something classic, we don't know what else could be, also considering the reference to the traditional aesthetic in the Blade Runner / Syndicate style all colored neon and acid colors, pouring rain, darkness and violence. With a shot from above, we therefore find ourselves controlling our Jydge with a ~stick~ and aiming the automatic fire weapon with the other, obviously through virtual controls replicated on the touch screen, in this case. JYDGE Dredd The progression of the game divided into levels is also traditional, but with a certain importance assigned to the way in which these are completed. Basically, it is usually a question of cleaning up various areas from all the threats present and saving the hostages, with a certain freedom left to the player as regards the path to follow and the methods of destruction to adopt. This with regard to the main objective, but each level offers secondary goals that become of fundamental importance in order to obtain medals, conditions necessary to unlock levels and upgrades. The evolution of the protagonist assumes capital importance as the level of difficulty increases, therefore this search for secondary objectives is an integral part of the game and not a simple extra, leading us to retrace already completed levels even several times to obtain medals. in a mechanic that in a certain sense is somewhat reminiscent of the classic grinding. Just as in the latter case, the risk is that the obsessive repetition of the levels, also given the high level of challenge of some special requests, could soon lead to excessive repetitiveness or frustration, also because the levels are stable and not generated randomly. However, a certain study applied to level design and the possibility of tackling them in even significantly different ways partially mitigates this drift: an important element in this sense is also given by the possibility of modifying the Jydge and its Gravel weapon. The power-ups, in fact, not only increase the destructive power or the passive skills of the protagonist but can also offer alternative strategic solutions and therefore different approaches to the levels: some ammunition, for example, allows you to destroy walls, others bounce against walls, still others automatically avoid civilians, all of which allows for a variety of fighting styles and ways of approaching the same environment.", "date": "2018-01-29", "grade": "8.2"}
