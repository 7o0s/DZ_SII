But what is more incredible is the physics engine that calculates the damage. In fact, every single impact can cause more or less serious damage (be it visual or inside the car): windshields that shatter, bonnets that break and fly off after a jump, bumpers and doors that are destroyed, all in a totally realistic! Watch out for potholes Different speech for the settings: although it is possible to bump and move billboards and light barriers, the impact against any object causes only damage to the car (unlike the old V-Rally 3 in which trees could also be cut down); Havoc was not expected but something more could be done. However, the tracks appear with many details (for the most part always trees, it's a rally after all!), fairly well done but all equipped (together with the piste) with low resolution textures, which are a bit out of tune with the great car graphics. Overall the game is satisfying to watch, especially in the replays and proves to be well cared for in minor details such as the rain (with the drops that fall on the glass and are washed by the wipers) or particles such as sparks and smoke. Sore point: the car's headlights at sunset or in adverse weather conditions illuminate absolutely nothing and on certain tracks they would have been useful to better understand the route (one above all: the rally of Japan). ~Be careful, don't cut, stones!~ The sound makes use of Creative's EAX 4.0 ambient audio where available, with a phenomenal implementation of sound effects: the noises of the various cars are powerful and diversified and running on gravel will make you hear every single pebble slamming on the vehicle. For each terrain you will have a whole series of sounds that will serve to make the driving experience even more realistic. The co-pilot's voice is also good, never irritating and always generous with advice at the right moment. Well done! Realize the best times The evolution of the series also continues in multiplayer, where it is possible to face human opponents both on the Internet/LAN or by competing in turn with the same PC against a maximum of eight opponents. The races take place for entire events or in single stages, eliminating any clash at the counter thanks to the inclusion of ghost cars: while racing you will be able to see your competitors in transparent cars and there will be no risk of accidental or deliberate accidents. It follows that even owners of 56k modems will be able to play easily without latency problems in ~correct~ but no less fun challenges. There is no longer a trace of the old four-player ~door~ mode that was present in Colin 2, even if honestly some bumper car competitions could be afforded. But this is also realism, rallies run by themselves. Final comment Colin McRae 04 is the natural evolution of his lineage which, with this latest release, returns to dominate the throne of PC rally titles (at least until the release of Richard Burns Rally) by correcting the defects of the previous game and bringing a whole series of novelties that will make fans of this discipline happy. Unfortunately, Codemasters' search for realism does not make it an immediately accessible title, but in any case after a little apprenticeship you will have enormous satisfaction in knowing how to maneuver cars to the limit and in obtaining respectable times. The forty-eight courses and the possibility of unlocking bonus cars as the game progresses offer excellent longevity, which expands exponentially thanks to a solid multiplayer based on the purity of the races (no longer undermined by improprieties or annoying slowdowns). recommended for lovers of driving games as it should be, a little less for casual players. Pros Unique damage model Guaranteed longevity Good variety of vehicles and environments Cons Graphics not always up to par Difficult learning curve Not recommended for those who want to run without too many thoughts WORLD CHAMPION OF 2004 The race begins.. From the initial menu it is possible to choose whether to undertake a championship, run single rallies or jump into the game with random routes and cars. Each mode allows you to play with multiple human opponents in turn, so you can have championships where the computer won't be the only fearsome enemy. After creating a profile, you can choose the vehicles, divided into four categories: 2WD, 4WD, B (the most powerful in history) and bonus. At the beginning, a small fleet of cars will be available, which can be expanded by winning the various competitions around the globe. Once on the track, the resulting impression is that of riseeks realism: forget the first two games and their arcade setting, Codemasters has evolved the previous version to offer a driving model that does not compromise. The learning curve is quite difficult and before mastering the cars well you will have to sweat hard. The advice is to start playing using a 2WD category car (such as the Punto or Ford Puma), much more docile than the classic 4WDs, so you can gradually get used to the tracks, without going crazy with the grip. The championship already starts with courses of medium difficulty and mastery of the vehicle is essential to avoid delays of too many seconds compared to the opponents. In fact, rallies turn out to be full of obstacles such as boulders, trees and objects arranged on tracks that are anything but wide and every single mistake is paid for in terms of time and damage. The graphics of Colin 4 leave you stunned as regards the realization of the cars: reflections, environmental mapping, dirt that accumulates. The use of a steering wheel is strongly recommended to play better since the progressive demolition of the car (never so likely in any other title) becomes a further incentive to make as few mistakes as possible. Repairs can only be carried out every two stages and perhaps finding yourself with a punctured tire could definitively compromise the race. There are many possibilities of being penalized: loss of wheels, engine overheating (which leads to continuous switching off / on), damage due to bad blows that affect the internal components. We could say that Colin 4 is Crammond's Grand Prix in a rally version. The preparation of the car before each departure will also be fundamental; this allows various settings ranging from gear ratios through the choice of tyres, springs, axles, steering, set-up for a total of 8 parameters. Unfortunately the help captions and the menus in general are poorly translated into Italian! Incredible how there has been no attention in the texts, while the speech is more than good.
