It would be incorrect to judge Aion in its entirety: MMORPGs are games in the making, regularly updated with content, changes and improvements. Furthermore, the cap is not the end of the game, if anything it is the beginning of a new path for the user: an MMORPG must also be evaluated according to its endgame because it is what really keeps the player glued. So this review evaluates Aion in its first full-bodied hours of play, for its mechanics and for its technical realization. In the coming weeks we will return in more detail to the second part of the experience and we will update this review with the new ratings, possibly changing the grade if necessary. When there was talk of a western version of Aion: The Tower of Eternity, fans of the MMORPG genre were divided between skeptics and enthusiasts: the panorama, saturated with the supremacy of World of Warcraft, only offered niche alternative solutions and others as publicized as ultimately bankruptcy. NCsoft, parent of Lineage 2 and Guild Wars, is a Korean company that makes player combat, PvP, the main theme of its productions. But the purely Asian style of play is quite different from the Western one, which has always led to a sort of racism towards Korean productions, where quests and concessions are in a much lower percentage than a simple, unbridled and linear grinding. that is, the repeated elimination in a certain amount of time of enemy targets that yield experience points. In reality, the aforementioned concessions have become the order of the day during the evolution of World of Warcraft, the first MMORPG aimed also and above all at casual players. And if World of Warcraft has eleven million active accounts, there must be something good in the formula. This is why NCsoft has decided to offer Aion - the subtitle was lost during conversion - in the West one year after the eastern release, but not before having made the necessary changes to make the product much more attractive to this part of the globe : news that made waiting for this MMORPG agonizing to say the least and ended, finally, not without a touch of bitterness. Optimism confirmed The Open Beta client, updated to version 1.5, is if possible even more stable than the one proposed during the Closed Beta phases. The work done by the NCsoft programmers is truly amazing, as they have been able to exploit FarCry's CryEngine well: the client is very scalable and despite the excellent graphic rendering it is decidedly lighter than productions such as Warhammer Online or Age of Conan. Of its own, the Aion client rarely crashes or presents uncertainties of any kind: loading is fast and even on the most modest computers the fluidity of the action is remarkable. Against, the associated GameGuard system is a real lottery: in practice it is a mandatory anti-cheating program that monitors each process, preventing the use of software or hardware that violates the Aion EULA. This choice is one step ahead in the war on the dishonest but the GameGuard has also proved to be a thorn in the side for many users, subject to sudden crashes and unexpected blocks, even forced to disable firewalls and anti-viruses. Bypassing these boring random problems (for example, the writer has never encountered any problems despite using a Logitech G15 keyboard) you find yourself playing in a few seconds: the creation of your own alter ego, whether Elyos or Asmodean, is been enhanced with new options and is confirmed to be truly satisfactory. Finally, the game world is loaded in just a few moments: from a technical point of view, Aion is a really excellent product, starting with the well-detailed and animated polygonal models of characters and creatures. There are some graphic problems such as the low quality and resolution of some textures especially related to the ground, but they are defects that take a back seat to the skill of the NCsoft artists. The world of Atreya is absolutely stunning: the variety of settings is second only to the high detail that characterizes each area. It is impossible not to notice details such as flocks of birds flying over the area, electric discharges during storms, plays of light in industrial quantities. The mere fact that the passage from day to night changes the colors of the surrounding environment is a sign of the care with which the graphic sector has been packaged, yesmoreover, it also reflects on the variety of enemies that can be faced over the first thirty levels and on the baroque texturing of weapons and armor, enriched by splendid friezes and details. Much care has also been placed in the production of the soundtrack that accompanies our wanderings: a large number of songs and all of excellent quality, epic and enthralling tones when needed, harmonious or delicate on other occasions. Furthermore, the various locations are peppered with environmental sound effects of all kinds, from the crying of ghosts to chirping, to the sound of broken branches, the blowing wind, the pouring rain. It should also be emphasized that the promise of dubbing the entire game has been kept, starting with the numerous non-interactive cutscenes that open and close many quests, underlined and recited in excellent English. Even the launch of each spell is accompanied by an exclamation from the character involved, an intriguing detail but also a bit irritating during longer fights. Not bad: even from the sound point of view Aion is very configurable and it is possible to increase, decrease or exclude the various options. The beauty of flight During the week of the Open Beta NCsoft developers continued to work to fix the small and inevitable code problems. The support is excellent and fast, the client has also been updated with a massive patch, also fixing some discrepancies between the classes here and there. A truly commendable attention therefore, for a game with excellent gameplay: Aion is actually a very enjoyable MMORPG and the first thirty levels of the game are really fun. The responsiveness to our inputs is total, the lag is practically absent, the character responds precisely and it is possible to customize its control in various ways: for example, you can enable the click-to-move option as well as the automatic approach to the target . The combat system is mainly based on the Chains: some skills when used allow you to activate others that are individually inaccessible, creating real combos of attacks and spells. Consequently, the amount of skills available is only apparently limited and already around the fifteenth level you begin to obtain multiple ramifications, increasing the variety and unpredictability of the players. It is a simple and intuitive system, rich in depth, which must be assimilated quickly in order to survive the enemies we will encounter. Aion is not a simple game: the creatures are tough and dangerous, it is recommended to use potions and healing bandages at the cost of a few kinah, Atreya's monetary unit. There is no shortage of money in Aion, although you pay for everything: to travel from one point to another, to recover the few experience points lost by dying, you obviously pay for the tomes containing the new skills to learn and much more. In the western version of Aion, more money circulates thanks to the more generous rewards of quests and the higher value of useless items for resale. But managing your portfolio is not easy and to avoid unnecessary expenses you have to play wisely. Applying the correct Manastones to our equipment, for example, is a great start as these stones increase the stats of our items. The selection of Stigmas must also be carefully planned, they are usable glyphs from around level 20 that add previously inaccessible skills and spells to our repertoire. In short, it is clear that the growth of the character should not be underestimated. And we come to flying, the main feature of Aion, which offers the player a pair of wings at level 10, allowing 360-degree movement and combat. In reality it is not possible to fly everywhere: only some areas, including the Abyss, allow you to fly at will, while in all the others it is only possible to glide after a jump. Moreover, the flight is not unlimited, the activation of the wings starts a countdown at the end of which it falls inexorably into the void. It is possible to upgrade the wings by increasing the speed and duration of the flight, but they are advanced and expensive upgrades. Knowing when to use your wings and how to exploit them is a key element in Aion, but it is also not easy to learn to move in the air, especially in the chaos of a fight. So far, Aion proves to be a rewarding experience: fun, deep, intuitive and difficult enough. A seemingly successful Westernization...until you reach level 20. Perplexities and problems Our adventure in Atreya's world runs smoothly and quickly until we find ourselves inexorably stranded. Until then, the game offers even the most casual user the means to play how and when they want - a great crafting systemting that inflates experience and pockets, simple quests, Campaign-type missions that reward you with money and items by carrying on a sort of main plot. The problem is that you get around level 20 you simply remain without quests: the experience necessary to reach the next level increases more and more, while the rewards decrease in proportion, until the quests are practically useless. The last steps of the Campaigns oblige the player to join a group, which is not so simple if you are not part of a Legion, and they are not resolved quickly: the experience in a group is still satisfying and fun, multiplying by six both the technicality of the game than its visual spectacularity. In other words, from the twentieth level onwards the dreaded grinding that characterizes Asian games comes to the surface. The player is thus forced to kill monsters after monsters to reach the next level, which he would do even if a quest required it, but in this case it is the purpose that is missing and which makes the operation more cumbersome than fun. In particular, in areas of level 20 or higher there is also the possibility of Rifts appearing, portals that can lead players of the opposing faction to hunt PvP in our area. The idea actually helps to increase the feeling of war, but it certainly doesn't alleviate the annoyance of being interrupted during our activities and maybe sent back to our home-point, tens of minutes away. Some would say it's game design and PvP. Without a doubt, but the problem of grinding remains and creating groups of players to ~grind~ all together and defend themselves from possible enemies only masks a repetitive activity such as grinding as a social one. The situation does not change by accessing the Abyss, from level 25: the quests continue to disappear and the player without a Legion is easy prey for random opponents. World of Warcraft, Warhammer Online and The Lord of the Rings Online have accustomed us to a progression system, considered Western, where the quests are the purpose of the grind and the variety is greater. Aion had to take this path to become westernized, instead the intermediate phase of the game shows that there is still a long way to go to make it completely attractive to the local palate. The future of Aion Due to limitations of Beta and timing it was obviously not possible to test the endgame of Aion, which mainly consists of PvE and PvPvE. Patch 1.5 introduced several instances that filled the product's PvE gap: we are still far from the glories of The Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft: Aion lacks compelling scripts and designs especially for the instance bosses, far too simplistic and linear. On the other hand, the heart of Aion is PvPvE in the Abyss, that is, the clash with the opposing faction made up of human players and the unpredictable one of the Balaur controlled by artificial intelligence, who attack or defend one or the other faction at their discretion. In the Abyss it's time for Legions, player associations that grow with the successes of their members, thus becoming a key feature of Aion gameplay. How varied and long-lived this endgame will be even in the West is still too early to say.", "date": "2009-09-15", "grade": "8.5"}
