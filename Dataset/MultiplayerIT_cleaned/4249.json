It is in fact a real gem, an action game clearly inspired by Bayonetta which takes up its most characteristic mechanisms, succeeding in the not simple feat of implementing them in a truly effective way, in spite of the limitations imposed by the touch screen. The plot of the game, which sees us in command of a group of fighters called Valkyrie, rigorously lethal and scantily dressed, is just a pretext for staging the traditional struggle between good and evil, the latter represented by the troops of the Honkai empire, determined to conquer the earth. The anime-style opening cinematic, which you find below, portends a thick production; but it often happens that some mobile games turn out to be mediocre in spite of a spectacular introductory sequence. Well, this is not the case: the miHoYo title takes us by the hand and accompanies us in a series of stages that act as tutorials for the commands (very simple: a virtual stick on the left side of the screen and three buttons on the right for attack, dodge and special), the gameplay and the many facets of an outline that follows the classic elements of the freemium model, without however imposing any constraints. There are in fact many achievements to unlock that give coins and objects to be used for the enhancement of characters, weapons and perks, but the progression is so simple and natural that you do not notice the presence of an action energy indicator which in theory should limit our playing time, but in practice it does not in any way, leaving us to enjoy the experience for as long as we want. The interface in this sense is somewhat understood, it can be confusing and dispersive especially at the beginning, but you will have time to get used to it and in any case it will reveal new contents as you go on, completing the first campaign and then dedicating yourself to those to supplementary missions, to ~passive~ missions, and finally to co-op. Witches or Valkyries? As mentioned at the beginning, Honkai Impact 3rd is a title clearly inspired by Bayonetta. Beyond the exclusively female protagonists (basically three, equipped with different fighting styles: Kiana Kaslana with her double pistol, Raiden Mei with her high-tech sword and the young Bronya Zaychik, who attacks from a distance using the energy cannon of a sort of robotic avatar), the game uses a system of combos and dodges that refer to the mechanisms of the Platinum Games series, with dodges at the last moment that trigger a spectacular bullet time and allow us to sink several shots. There are visual indicators that quite faithfully reproduce some of the solutions seen in the two chapters of Bayonetta, but it is when Kiana activates her special that the quotes become clear, between gigantic punches and kicks that come out of instantly created portals. To make everything work properly, the developers have seen fit to use an automatic lock-on, allowing us to manage or not the view while we face multiple enemies at once, given that to carry on the fight we can also limit ourselves to pressing the attack button and dodging at the right time. To increase the thickness of the combat system, however, a traditional scheme has also been inserted which sees certain characters prove to be more or less effective against some enemies: an expedient that pushes you to make quick switches and move on to the next valkyrie through a devastating combined maneuver. In short, everything works beautifully and it is really surprising that Honaki Impact 3rd is a free title. The defects of the game are in truth very few, even if some weigh heavily: first of all the low difficulty, the excessive brevity of the stages due to the portable nature of the game, the less marked commitment as regards the creation of the scenarios and the bosses, which tend to recur. Beyond this, the technical sector showcases a successful and very pleasant anime style, with an effective design for all polygonal models, good animations, level effects and sixty frames per second stable on the iPhone X. Performance that unfortunately they are paid for with a fairly sudden overheating of the terminal, but not in excessive battery consumption.", "date": "2018-05-21", "grade": "8.5"}
