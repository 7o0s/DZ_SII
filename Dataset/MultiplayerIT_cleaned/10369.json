{"name": "Nel Paese delle Creature Selvagge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72260-nel-paese-delle-creature-selvagge-che-la-vita-selvaggia-abbia-inizio.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360Max is an introverted boy with a great imagination, who lives in the balance between fantasy and reality, dreaming of an enchanted place where he can settle down to escape from a gloomy and sad everyday life. After arguing with his mother and sister, he decides to escape aboard a boat and ends up reaching a mysterious island, inhabited by very strong creatures that nonetheless resemble large stuffed animals. Wearing his cat-eared pajamas, Max pretends to be a powerful king and tries to befriend these peculiar beings, even if it turns out to be anything but simple. Transposition of the film based on an illustrated book by Maurice Sendak, Where the Wild Things Are is an action game that is based on a slightly different story from the original one, completely devoid of the ~real~ parentheses that show Max's life on the mainland and indeed focused on the adventures that the boy lives once he arrives on the island inhabited by the Wild Creatures. Wild nature Our goal in the game is to investigate the dark force that threatens the island, trying if possible to eliminate its source. Under Max's command, armed with a scepter and a pinch of magic, we must therefore explore the territory in the company of our new furry friends, fighting against huge insects of various types and trying to understand where the black slime that for some time comes from pollutes rivers and mountains. Max can perform a large number of actions: jump, climb, balance on ledges and fight with the scepter, which can also be used to parry. He can charge a more powerful attack, capable of knocking some enemies away, perform a rather effective combination of blows and even engage in a flying assault. Furthermore, in certain situations, he can pick up objects and throw them using the classic viewfinder interface, equip himself with feathers that make him able to fly for short distances, collect large flowers that act as a ~parachute~ for descents from great heights, etc. . These actions are also accompanied by some purely ancillary ones, such as the ability to ~roar~ to scare enemies, to dance or to have one of the Wild Creatures restore one's vital energy. Neverland There are about ten stages that make up the game, and they also offer variations to the standard action made up of exploration and combat phases. In some cases, in fact, we have to ride Carol (one of the Creatures, the first who takes a liking to Max) in frantic runs inside the forest, jumping over obstacles or passing under them to avoid stopping. Similarly, in the second half of the story we find ourselves commanding a boat with the aim of reaching the sea before the currents send us against the rocks. Between one level and another, we can take care of the Wild Creatures village, collecting a certain number of objects or contributing to the creation of gardens, farms, etc. During the exploration phases it often happens that you have to solve puzzles involving some plants, for example there is one whose fruits contain a lot of water and can be used to instantly grow roots on which we can then climb to reach a otherwise inaccessible area. There are numerous and always well-made situations of this type, an indication of the fact that In the Wild Creatures Country is indeed a product designed for younger players, but also winks at a more elderly ~casual~ user. The combat phases, in particular, prove to be quite challenging and frenetic, with a good number of different opponents. Beautiful monsters Both in terms of graphics and in terms of sound, the developers have done a great job. The Creatures have a wacky and funny look, very faithful to that of the film, and enjoy excellent quality animations. The character we control, Max, is also well drawn and can perform a really large number of different actions. It is not possible to rotate the view during the game, but only move it sideways, however you can play without problems and the scenario is full of interactable elements and objects to collect to complete the various secondary objectives. The fast sequences, for example those in which we ride Carol, are truly spectacular and show us very thick and well represented vegetation. In short, apart from a general lack of fluidity, there is something to be satisfied with. Even as far as the sound is concerned: the excellent dubbing in Italian is accompanied by good effects and music with a great atmosphere. Comment Great atmosphere Varied and exciting Graphsexcellent ca and sound A few shots too many Not very long", "date": "2009-11-23", "grade": null}
