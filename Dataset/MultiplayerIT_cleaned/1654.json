We already don't know what to expect, diving into a game with these premises, but perhaps the biggest surprise comes after solving the first puzzles, when we begin to become familiar with the protagonist and we have the pleasure of discovering that, for once anyway, it is a scoundrel of the worst kind: Spendius, this is the name of our digital alter ego, does not stop at anything or anyone; you earn your freedom from slavery by stabbing people in the back, spying and lying; later, to save his fur, he doesn't hesitate to start a war, stealing, poisoning and committing sacrilegious acts, and in his spare time he even tries to cuckold the man who saved his life! What do Flaubert, Dvorak and a cartoonist have in common? In short, you will have understood by now that this Salammb is a somewhat original videogame experiment that deserves at least a look: Cryo has already accustomed us to somewhat bizarre graphic adventures, but it must be said that the historical-literary inspiration, the unusual narrative techniques adopted, Druillet's dark and visionary style and the effective puzzle cocktail proposed in the game make it a quite intriguing and unique experience of its kind. It has been said that Salammb is Cryo's latest graphic adventure, the latest not only in a chronological sense but also in a broader sense, given the recent takeover of the transalpine house by DreamCatcher. The development team is that of Atlantis III and the graphic team has been able to masterfully render the unmistakable trait of Druillet, who has been entrusted with the artistic direction (French cartoonists are selling like hot cakes lately!). The latter has already collaborated in the creation of Ring and Ring 2, adventures inspired by the saga of the Ring of the Nibelungs and Wagner's work, which went practically unnoticed in the Bel Paese. Carthage, 264 BC. The First Punic War has just ended, with the defeat of the Carthaginian army by Rome, and the mercenaries hired by Carthage are encamped around the city walls waiting to receive the compensation that is due to them. Meanwhile, in a damp underground prison, the slave Spendius is forced to do hard labor and the humiliation of merciless insults and whippings... but not for long: taking advantage of the propitious opportunity and building an ingenious bone bridge with the remains of former fellow prisoners less fortunate than him, manages to sneak out of his cell and knock out the guard with his femur. During his escape, he is helped by a beautiful and mysterious woman, who we will discover is the high priestess Salammb, daughter of the leader Hamilcare. Naturally his is not disinterested help: we will have to deliver a statuette to the mercenary chief Math, as a pledge of his love, and for the rest of the game we will continue to act as a third wheel or as intermediary between the two lovebirds (it's not the best, but still better than prison!). Carthage, 264 BC. As soon as we leave the walls of Carthage, however, we have an unpleasant surprise, or rather two: first of all, we wear the evident signs of slavery and not even the mercenaries are willing to let us escape and, moreover, the famous statuette slipped from our hands during escape and certainly does not make a very good impression on Math! One way or another, we will have to fix it... and what better diversion than a good war, which diverts the attention of mercenaries and Carthaginians from the fate of a humble slave? Indeed, while we're at it, we could even try to conquer a little fame and fortune: our Spendius thus organizes a diabolical plan to escape capture, take revenge on his enemies and profit basely from the critical situation of Carthage! Flaubert in digital version If it is true that Gustave Flaubert's original novel slightly transfigures ancient history, giving us back the image of a barbaric and mysterious Orient, it is also true that, in the hands of Philippe Druillet, Salammb comes to life and transforms into an epic tale, a dreamlike fantasy adventure made of livid and disturbing landscapes, of impenetrable fog, of perennial red and blue sunsets, of twisted and oppressive architectures, of Roman armor alongside futuristic armor, of warriors with alien features and fiery red eyes. The graphic impact is undoubtedly an essential component of this game: Druillet's style will be bizarre and unrealistic, but certainly effective. The reverse of the medal of this gloomy and very particular graphic is a certain sense of oppression and repetitiveness: the settings and the design are ghostgoric and initially intriguing but in the long run they can be monotonous, also because the story, as in the novel, takes place entirely within or around the walls of Carthage. Flaubert in digital version Salammb is a ~point and click~ adventure in a 360 subjective view, like Myst III or the more recent Post Mortem, but the panoramic engine is not the best: it tends to blur the images, undermining the richness of the graphics, and not at all facilitates navigation within the screens - the maps provided to the player are of little use and you get lost all the time: orienting yourself in a garden or in the winding streets of Carthage can become an unnerving undertaking. It cannot be denied, however, that several graphic and artistic details are a feast for the eyes: the settings are too rich, the armor meticulously decorated, the lights and colors always vivid and brilliant, the animations of the characters fluid and incredibly realistic ( while repeating the same movements to exasperation, during the dialogues, it seems that some characters are really breathing). Flaubert in digital version The few videos in the game are of excellent quality and their scarcity is due to the ingenious choice of illustrating this adventure through a series of comics: the interlude scenes in fact give way to colorful interactive tables accompanied by a narrative voice , which summarize the main events of the story and allow us to retrace our steps to find clues useful for the solution or to enjoy a summary of the adventure even after having completed it. Flaubert in digital version Nothing to complain about the interface: it is without infamy and without praise but fully fulfills its function. As in any self-respecting ~point and click~ adventure, the cursor icon changes shape according to the operations that can be performed on the various points of the screen and the left mouse button acts as a wildcard command. The menus and inventory, which can be accessed with the right click, adapt perfectly to the graphic style of the game, even if they are perhaps a little elaborate. The soundtrack, as mentioned, is taken from Dvorak's New World Symphony and, albeit used sparingly, helps to make the epic dimension of the adventure more vibrant. Sound effects and speech (in English) are also of good quality. It is a pity that it has not been dubbed, given the nature of the game and the intrusiveness of the narrative voice, but the localization itself is absolutely decent. Even the bad guys have their fish to fry... The most appreciable aspect of Salammb, for true fans of graphic adventures, will undoubtedly be the great variety and refinement of the puzzles, always logical and perfectly integrated into the story: most of them are based on inventory, exploration and conversations but there are all kinds of them, from puzzles to Memory to nice mini-games that you need to overcome in order to progress (helmet throwing, archery...). I confess that some unconventional puzzles left me pleasantly surprised, which rarely happens to those used to recognizing their typology and mechanics on the fly. Even the bad guys have their fish to fry... Also noteworthy is the presence of limited-time sequences, in which you must quickly find a way to survive a siege without starving or running away from an angry and hungry dragon. In other games I've learned to hate timed puzzles, but in Salammb they manage to give a more realistic rhythm to the story, as well as a certain satisfaction. Unconventional for this genre of game but absolutely enjoyable are also the strategic sequences: Spendius will not limit himself to unleashing a war and helplessly watch the battles that will take place during the game, but he will also have the opportunity to establish the strategy to adopt and the disposition of troops in the field. Even the bad guys have their fish to fry... Salammb is a linear adventure of medium length and there is always only one way to solve the puzzles. The level of difficulty is not very high, despite some puzzles being too cumbersome even when the solution is guessed, but death is always lurking: I have experienced the most atrocious ends, from the stake to the crucifixion which is the most popular, however the autosave system pIt allows you to resume the adventure from the exact point where we made the fatal mistake, without generating excessive frustration in the player. In conclusion, Salammb is a good graphic adventure and has all the essential ingredients: an original atmosphere, well thought out puzzles and a good technical realization. Unfortunately, apart from the ideas taken from Flaubert's work and the love story between Math and Salammb, which concerns us only incidentally, the plot is a bit thin and not always exciting: the character of Spendius is interesting for the his petty and profiteering nature but perhaps he is not investigated enough. Furthermore, the unmistakable feature of Druillet, which I personally find remarkable and which is undoubtedly one of the strong points of the adventure, paradoxically risks not being appreciated by any type of player and weighing down the already dispersive panoramic engine. I believe that Salammb is above all an interesting experiment in adapting a literary work, which those who have read the book could appreciate all the more. Without revealing anything about the ending, which is rather obvious, however, a consideration is in order: first of all, it is not clear why the developers preferred to depart from the outcome of the original novel, more faithful to historical reality, but above all I find that half a minute of final video be a shovel in the face for any adventurer! Pros: Original graphic style and atmosphere Varied and well-integrated puzzles Comic storytelling Cons: Cluttering and heavy panoramic engine Low involvement Disappointing ending What do Flaubert, Dvorak and a cartoonist have in common? It might seem like the beginning of a joke, but it's not: in fact, my first reaction to the idea of a marriage between Flaubert and video games was rather ~decomposed~, all the more so when I discovered that there were also the Symphony of the New World by Dvorak and the bizarre line by Philippe Druillet, who came to prominence in the 70s and is best known for a comic adaptation of the novel Salammb. The graphic adventure we are talking about is inspired by the latter and not exactly by the work of the famous French writer.", "date": "2003-05-22", "grade": null}
