The first Italian translation was so bad as to be ridiculously funny, the builds totally lacked balance (to the player's advantage) and it certainly wasn't an original work. We are talking about a metroidvania strongly inspired by Miyazaki's soulslike, which - in a way consistent with the narrative to be honest - took pieces from different worlds and merged them into a mix that was perhaps a little imprecise at times, but absolutely charismatic and clearly the result of passion of the authors. Adding the fact that it was a massive game, full of low-priced content, for many it was a quality, satisfying and fun indie experience. After many years, the salt road is back on track, with what in the eyes of many is a sort of continuation: Salt and Sacrifice. However, speaking below is profoundly incorrect from many points of view and, we tell you right away, thinking in these terms would probably lead to a big disappointment, regardless of the quality of the product. But let's go in order and see everything there is to know, in our review of Salt and Sacrifice. Inquisition Our character riding his steed Salt and Sacrifice is not set in the same spaces as the first game. We are probably in the same universe, but there are no direct and clear links. In this new adventure we will not be a savior, but a hunter, specifically of wizards. In this world, in fact, magic is a plague, which the Inquisition tries to put a stop to. We are precisely an Inquisitor (or Inquisitrix), or a person who has committed a serious crime, has been found guilty and has decided to serve his sentence at the front, after having been subjected to the rite of the Magivore, which in practice makes it impossible for the magic to kill us. Our aim is to explore a series of regions and consume the hearts of wizards. The plot doesn't go much beyond this premise, at least until the final minutes where a series of NPCs explain the context of the game in more detail, explaining the origin of the wizards. Previously, there are some hints of what forces are at play, but these are a few sentences scattered throughout the adventure. Sacrifice offers an even thinner and more indefinite narrative, most of the time, than Sanctuary. The consequence is that we are not particularly intrigued by the events in which we are involved, since all that most of the time the plot is ~go there and kill everything~. Monster Hunter but not really Salt and Sacrifice Salt and Sacrifice isn't a metroidvania-soulslike like the first chapter. The developers themselves explain that the game was born first of all as a sort of Monster Hunter and only later did they realize that it was necessary to return to the aforementioned genres. The end result, however, is a fusion that fails to bring out the beauty of either genre. Sacrifice is stuck in the middle, in an identity crisis that risks not satisfying any type of player. Let's see why. First of all, Salt and Sacrifice does not have a single world, but is divided into regions. Each region is a collection of dungeons, more or less related to each other, but quite independent in terms of exploration. These are medium-small areas, to be tackled with jumps: however, there will be no real platform sections, such as those that were occasionally offered in Sanctuary. Also, don't expect to explore these places like in the first chapter. Regions are not designed as a metrodivania, but as any area in Monster Hunter World. You enter, start a hunt and when you finish, you return to the hub to spend your salt and use the materials obtained to create new equipment and upgrade those already in our possession. In between, there will be just a few spawn points of common materials, to be used to restore our resources such as thrown weapons and healing. A scythe-wielding enemy in Salt and Sacrifice The problem is that Sacrifice doesn't have the courage (or the resources) to be a big Monster Hunter game and takes a few steps back, inserting itself into a fake metroidvania structure. To advance in the game, in an extremely linear way, in fact, it is necessary to recover a new tool and new runes in each region that unlock access to the next area, which you enter with a teleport from the central hub. The tools are things like the grappling hook, which allows you to launch towards hooks, but also a canvas that allows you to harness updrafts or a crystal that activates timed paths of light. These are classic Metroidvania ~power ups~, which normally allowtone to advance in new places and explore the old ones in depth, perhaps finding shortcuts to move from one area to another. In Salt and Sacrifice, however, there is no backtracking typical of the genre. Yes, you can go back to old regions to continue in a certain direction with a new tool, but it's usually just to find a dead-end corridor where a new hunting mission is positioned. In other words, that sense of adventure typical of metroidvanias and soulslikes is completely missing, which push you to check around every corner in search of something new, be it equipment, new resources or a new NPC with a quest. The regions are mostly empty, with no interesting rewards like new weapons or useful equipment (there's something here and there, but crafting with boss materials is the real focus) with a handful of enemies scattered around. Wizards In Salt and Sacrifice you must first hunt down wizards In fact, these areas are really populated by enemies only when a hunting mission is activated. As mentioned, our goal is to eliminate the wizards, who will appear in a specific point in the region. We will have to chase them, fight briefly on the spot and then see them teleport to the next point, continuing in this way until they arrive in the area designated for the final phase of the fight. In the various intermediate steps, the mage summons several minions, who will fight with the ~native~ creatures and enemies known as Arsi di Bruma (basically a reskin of the basic enemy of each region) that appear for the occasion. In addition, other secondary wizards will also appear during the mission's wizard hunts and, if two wizards cross paths, they will fight each other. It's a nice idea, as it is in a Monster Hunter. However, the visual spectacularity of Capcom's games is missing, but above all the rhythm of these phases is missing. In the intermediate steps, in fact, we won't really have to fight, we will simply be able to give the boss a couple of hits before he moves, while we will have to take care of his minions. The advantage of these sections is that if you manage to deal some damage to the boss, he will start the final part of the fight with a slice of life less, but mostly it is a tedious chase, often to be repeated over and over again. several times in the same way. However, the situation is different against those wizards who are not targets of the mission, but simply move around the world. These will not trigger a real final bossfight and can be tackled freely by fleeing the fight and going to the save points scattered around the map (which heal life and restore resources, such as health flasks or various types of alchemical bombs). It should also be known that non-target mages do not recover life if we heal ourselves or if we fall in battle and are sent back to the checkpoint. In one case, a wizard was in front of the respawn point and we could die and immediately respawn in front of him, without his life resetting. We finally won by just continuing to attack and dying. The problem is that magicians are on average really bad. These are big enemies who often press us with their attacks beyond any reasonable sense. Salt and Sacrifice then has a strange and perhaps morbid desire to launch us into the air. Many enemy attacks, even from common mobs, knock us over (even when wearing the heaviest armor in the game) and send us flying towards the stratosphere. When we get thrown, we mostly can't do anything to fight back, except wait to fall, get back up, and resume the fight, if given the chance to do so. While exploring, there is a great risk of falling off the platforms, as many areas are structured vertically with small zones to fight over, while also taking additional (sometimes fatal) fall damage. The player, if he survives, must go back up the area, to fight again, in a rather tedious back and forth. Once defeated, the mage's heart must be pierced in Salt and Sacrifice During boss fights, where walls of fog prevent us from being thrown into the void, we risk getting stuck in an enemy combo, with no chance. The odds depend on the type of wizard and his moves. Everyone throws us around, but some do it in a way that's just unfair. An easy example is the wizard-dragon, who with a laser beam can blow us up and then start hitting us with his greatsword, making us bounce like a basketball until we die. Then add the fact that on average wizards do very high damage. We played with armor thought thatthey are able to more than halve the damage we would take with light armor, but still the life points taken were still a lot. Light armor allows you to be more agile and dodge, but one mistake is enough to be eliminated in a couple of hits, especially in the advanced stages. Another problem is also related to the fact that enemies have enormous advantages, since they can react instantly to our every move. Most have both melee and ranged attacks and are not designed to give the user a single instant to heal. The boss never stops and, when he can hit us regardless of where we are, you understand that the battle seems rigged against us. Stamina and stats In Salt and Sacrifice we will have to explore using a number of tools In all of this there is also a very specific problem, namely the management of stamina and parries. In fact, Salt and Sacrifice wants us to block mage blows by parrying rather than dodging (or at least, we hope, since that's the only way to justify the design of the fights). Not only that, he wants us to parry perfectly, with a sort of parry (which is activated with the normal parry, if performed at the last second) which almost completely cancels the consumption of stamina for the parry. However, the parry is very difficult to use and in our experience practically impossible in case of multiple enemy attacks. As mentioned, then, many shots bump, so just parry too late and we are launched and stuck in the middle of the enemy combo. If we perform the first parry too early, all subsequent ones are practically impossible and the consumption of stamina is enormous. A boss combo cancels our stamina and its regen is very slow. By the way, literally every action blocks stamina regen completely, even using a healing flask - usually there is a slowdown, but a full block is a huge punishment. Even healing yourself at a checkpoint and even dying doesn't recover your stamina: you start again without it, if you were dry. Clearly this was not reasoned well. Also, the post parry recovery is long, so you often lose space to attack because your character is stuck. We played with a slow weapon and therefore the problem was accentuated, given that post-attack recovery is also slow and we were easily exposed to jolts, but it is undeniable that the design of these enemies should be reviewed. We finished the game, but several times we found ourselves faced with difficulty peaks conditioned solely by the absurd moveset of the enemy on duty and in one case we needed more than five hours to overcome a magician. Consider that in total we needed almost 20 hours to finish Salt and Sacrifice. The problem with wizards is obvious even when compared to the standard bosses of the game. In fact, Salt and Sacrifice also includes normal boss fights (fewer in number than wizards) which have a much more standard design. Some are powerful and take a bit of trying, but you can see that they have adequate space to react to their moves. Most encounters with wizards are won simply because we are stronger than them, but the encounters are never satisfying. Normal bosses are of mixed quality, but some have nice ideas with fun patterns to counter. A Salt and Sacrifice (tag) bossfight The problem with wizards is also linked, as mentioned, to their stats. Rather than being outrageously strong, they simply expect the player to have high defenses for the type of damage they deal. Salt and Sacrifice offers Physical, Fire, Ice, Poison, Light, and Dark damage. Each boss has one or two elements, and if one's defense isn't very high against the correct element, the damage taken is often high. The problem is that the best armor is the heavy one and some are obtained only after defeating the worst bosses (such as the aforementioned dragon-mage). Even assuming that a certain weapon or armor that we think can help us in a certain fight is actually already craftable, we will have to farm the right wizards to obtain the materials to create it and then the materials to upgrade it (upgrading is mandatory, the basic objects are too weak for late stages). This can take hours (the aforementioned five hours are related to just such a phase). Furthermore, it is also necessary to have unlocked the right skills to equip the weapons and armor that we want to use.
