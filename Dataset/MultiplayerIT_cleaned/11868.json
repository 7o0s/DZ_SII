The practice required that the rosters be updated every year, a sprinkling of the graphics sector and little else. The 2008 editions of many games coming out in this period have pleasantly reversed this custom and WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2008 is no exception. The guys at Yuke's haven't rested on the laurels of the excellent 2007 version, actually creating a title full of improvements and surprising us with some innovations that make the game appealing not only to fans of wrestlers in spandex underwear. The first novelty is the inclusion in the vast roster of athletes from ECW, the revolutionary federation that since 1992 has upset the golden world of WWE. ECW or a league with a generally more adult look, characterized by ~realistic~ matches, by less flashy characters and with the public personally involved, especially when on the occasion of some special events he is invited to throw ~ready-use~ objects and weapons into the ring for the wrestlers. Among them we find the healthy and nice guy CM Punk, Marcus Cor Von and Elijah Burke. The two queen federations SmackDown! and Raw are obviously worthily represented by a long list of athletes including Mark Henry, Gregory Helms, Chris Masters, Mr.Kennedy, Sandman, Snitsky as well as the classic and always appreciated Batista, Ray Mysterio, John Cena and The Undertaker. including the Divas, ex-playmates lethal as ninjas and several legends to unlock like The Rock, Bret ~Hitman~ Hart and Steve Austin, you get to almost 50 wrestlers. WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2008 will be available for Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii. The tested version is the one for PlayStation 3. The 8 styles give incredible depth to Yuke's title, here they are in detail: - Brawler. The wrestler charges headlong focusing on direct hits without too many frills - Powerful. The classic bison of the ring. Powerful and effective against pins and submissions - Technical. Good to look at and expert in counters - Volante. Unable to stay grounded. Agile and quick to avoid enemy attacks - Submission. Grabs and twists are his specialty - Unfair. Fingers in the eyes and referee's throw are the privileged techniques of this wrestler - Showman. Its mission is to captivate the public. - Hardcore. Expert in special matches without rules. Any item can be used in the ring. The completeness of 2008 The first big plus of WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2008 is represented by the huge choice of game modes available. The exhibition mode alone is an example of the excellent work done by the programmers. Seven types of matches, from one-on-one to the Royal Rumble with the possibility of applying an infinite number of rules to these to vary their performance. If this is not completeness! Even the tournament, obviously configurable at will, has been excellently implemented. Three modes of which the timed one, called Beat The Clock, is really well thought out. In addition to the 24/7 managerial mode, which deserves a separate paragraph, it is the editor that greatly elevates the longevity factor of the title. We can create wrestlers from scratch to use in all the game modes present, editing every possible feature, from the physical structure to inclusion in a team, passing through the fighting styles up to the choice of entry into the ring. As if that weren't enough, you can also play stylist by designing the belts to be raffled off. Even the aforementioned 24/7 mode benefits from this very powerful tool, being able to start a career with a fighter invented from scratch and taking him to the top of the world by seeing him grow in every parameter. It is therefore clear that if you combine the wrestlers invented by the players with the almost 50 available, an almost unlimited possibility of choice emerges. The news of 2008 More than the inclusion of the ECW the real change, indeed the real innovations of WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2008, all revolve around the renewed control method and the implementation of the so-called Superstar fighting styles. But first things first. The new grip system is all based on the use of the right stick. Depending on the position of the impersonated wrestler with respect to the opponent, a whole series of highly spectacular blows can be performed, from the back breaker / head breaker to the painful twisting of the limbs up to the figure 4 so dear to Ric Flair. Obviously those who are at the mercy of these submission holds can attempt counter-moves by rotating the right stick in the indicated direction whenever indications appear.screen. More generally all the counters can be done in the same way, just check the top of the screen and push the stick or the R2-L2 shoulder pads in time. In fact, every attack is potentially subject to a counter, not only the holds. Everything feels much more natural and intuitive, even if during the first few games it is quite easy to get confused, pushing the right stick incorrectly with the result of pinning an opponent too soon. The other big news of WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2008 are the 8 fighting styles that give Yuke's title an unprecedented tactical component. Styles represent all the ways of understanding wrestling. Each wrestler has two, one primary and one secondary, each characterized by offensive and defensive movements but above all by particular final blows. The choice of style strongly conditions the development of a match (or a career) as it affects the approach to match. As in a sort of bland role-playing game, the well-defined skills of the chosen character will have to collide with the equally clear skills of the opponent. Choosing one style over another becomes the key to adapting your fighter to the other, the bolt to unhinge the opposing defenses. Muscle mountains Cosmetically speaking WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2008 settles roughly on the levels seen in the previous edition. The wrestlers are all beautifully crafted and virtually indistinguishable from their real-life counterparts. More than an increase in the detail of the textures, there is a marked improvement in the animations thanks also to the inclusion of the finishing moves and the eight fighting styles. The faces of the athletes are realistically deformed in pain, in the same way the sneers and the search for public approval are recreated to perfection. Rarely in a sports title has so much attention been paid to the facial expressions of the athletes, not even in more advanced fighting games it had come to that. Although the animations of the wrestlers are at the highest levels, the speed and responsiveness of the same can leave you dumbfounded. One hundred kilos of muscles are quite a burden to carry around and especially in the more massive wrestlers one feels a certain heaviness and pachydermicity in movements, above all when after falls or hastily returns to the ring the wrestler turns his back to the opponent. A lot of graphic opulence has not been poured homogeneously on the whole title. If for the wrestlers you touch excellence for some secondary elements, the judgment is less positive. The arenas and the special effects during the wrestlers' entrance reveal a certainly less in-depth work and also the public, although completely three-dimensional and well animated, was obviously modeled with less care than the 50 athletes present. However, the feeling of being in a real sports hall among fireworks, deafening music, cheered by thousands of cheering spectators is incredible. These are marginal criticalities, but still verifiable. On the side of the sound sector, honorable mention for the excellent acting of the 24/7 mode, while the chosen music mixes bland hip hop with more or less angry rock. Comment WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2008 stands at the levels of the previous edition, making itself appreciated by everyone, both those who spend the night following the deeds of their favorites in spandex long johns and those who approach this sport - pardon show - for the first time. Furthermore, the eight fighting styles together with the renewed control system give the game an unexpected freshness and depth without compromising the immediacy and fun of the same. To complete a decidedly positive general picture, we find the inclusion of the ECW federation (absent last year), the powerful editor and the 24/7 mode, the latter well structured even if afflicted by some basic critical issues. Pros New functional and immediate control method 24/7 mode Fun, profound and long-lived Cons You always fight even with serious injuries Slowness in some situations of the movements of the wrestlers Small graphic flaws in the secondary elements 24/7 always in the ring 24/7 is a kind of simulation of the everyday life of a wrestler. Starting from the General Manager mode of the last edition, the developers have raised the bar, making us touch all aspects of a wrestler's career against the background of a well-defined narrative. In practice, chosen from the roster (not all Superstars are however available) or created from scratch our alter ego we have to make it grow up to arrise to the Olympus of the Hall of Fame. Essentially, to become number one you need to keep a handful of variables under control, among which the level of popularity, fatigue and injuries stand out. The careful management of our athlete's activities becomes fundamental. You have to train him well and make him recover so as not to arrive knackered at matches. We can work for example on strength, speed, endurance and technique but also on side skills such as telegeny, microphone test and celebration. So be careful to choose the right day for the toughest workouts and if you need a nice massage session it can be right for us. Injuries are then a sword of Damocles perpetually suspended over the athlete. In the event of an accident, forced rest is de rigueur, but if one has not fully recovered, one will arrive at the next match (which will always be played) debilitated and with the almost useless injured limb. This is a big problem if you have suffered a serious injury, in fact you are practically condemned to certain defeat, but if the injury is minor, you simply need to pay more attention during the match. In general, the more tired and fatigued you are, the more likely you are to get hurt. And if winning the matches weren't enough to increase our level of popularity, we can dedicate ourselves to a whole series of ancillary activities such as interviews, photo sessions, participation in films and meetings with less fortunate children. But be careful that some of these cost effort, therefore knowing how to balance the many activities becomes necessary. As if that were not enough we also have to keep friendship/enmity relationships with the other wrestlers under control and in this situation the phone calls from our manager come to our rescue . Sometimes we also have to answer multiple choice questions like in a graphic adventure that will change the subsequent development of the story. Another criticality of the 24/7 mode is a certain basic repetitiveness that affects the wrestler's activities season after season. Same events, same cutscenes, same date on the calendar. Fortunately, the large roster available mitigates the feeling of dejavu every time you start a season.", "date": "2007-11-02", "grade": null}
