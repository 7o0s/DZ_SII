An attempt, the one made by MachineGames, to enrich the alternate universe of the series with new characters to complement the well-known W.J. Blazkowicz, also in order to test the ground for the development of possible spin-offs. Successful experiment? Not really: if the DLCs had started discreetly with The Adventures of Pistolero Joe, things didn't go so well with the second package, The Diaries of Agent Silent Death, and the cycle ends sadly with this latest expansion, perhaps the shortest and most insubstantial of the three. Wolfenstein II: The Deeds of Captain Wilkins tells the story of Gerald Wilkins, an American soldier who never gave up, not even when the Nazis dropped the atomic bomb on New York, decreeing the end of the Second World War. Hidden in a safe place, he is called back into action when a former comrade of his reveals the location of a terrible secret weapon that is located in Alaska. No more words needed: Wilkins steals a German submarine and heads there, determined to stop Operation Black Sun. The Extendable Captain The common thread of the three DLCs of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus lies in the use of as many upgrades that in the original campaign it is possible to equip so that Blazkowicz can break through walls by running, compress his chest to the point of being able to cross small pipes or reach areas inaccessible thanks to two electronic stilts. It will be the latter, code-named Battlewalker, to support the action of Captain Wilkins in his mission in Alaska, divided as usual into three chapters which, however, can be completed in less than two hours: as mentioned, it is probably the less rich and significant expansion of the three made by MachineGames. The approach is the usual, with levels designed to present ~watertight compartments~ full of Nazi soldiers to be eliminated silently or through spectacular frontal clashes that enhance the very solid gameplay of the game, devoted to dynamism and run & gun, rather than waiting. Triggering an alarm will result in the arrival of many enemies ready to kill us, including armored units of various kinds, or soldiers equipped with armor that allows them to resist more than necessary to our volleys. To fix them quickly we will be able to use the grenade launcher pistol, already seen previously, or the new appendages to be applied to the machine guns, which emphasize their effectiveness and transform one of them into a sniper rifle. In the end, the result is an experience halfway between what we saw in the first and second DLC, even if Wilkins seems more devoted to action than reflection: he can take medical kits and food to reach a stable health of 200 % and use armor to get an extra 100% shield, these values are really useful in battle. Game overs, however, will not be lacking and you will often find yourself proceeding in a fragmentary way, between trials and errors: this is also a characterizing trait of The Freedom Chronicles. Playstation 4 trophies There are just ten Trophies included in Wolfenstein II: The exploits of Captain Wilkins. Obtaining them is relatively simple: just complete the various levels of the expansion, but also playing it at the highest degree of difficulty. On the exploration front, there is an achievement reserved for those who will search the scenarios to collect all the hidden gold. Short and generic There are just a couple of twists in the short campaign dedicated to Captain Wilkins, far from us wanting to reveal them in this review, but in general the narrative remains very far from the qualitative peaks that we were able to appreciate in The New Colossus. Certainly the fault of the lack of cutscenes, due to the need to contain costs, and the comic-style ~animated story~ which, however, is not striking for the goodness of the drawings, on the contrary. The problems, however, are others: although the setting of the expansion is theoretically new, you move within levels that are decidedly already seen, with many reused assets and very few novelties, in the form of a couple of enemies new. Little, too little to justify the purchase, unless you really have a mad desire to get back to playing with Wolfenstein II, perhaps taking advantage of the fact that in these days the Season Pass of the game is on offer on all platforms in the middle price. There's not much more to add: the Italian dubbing is discreet but this timenot exactly unforgettable, the duration is narrow and there are in fact no memorable moments in The Deeds of Captain Wilkins, nor boss fights, so much so that the very conclusion of the expansion is surprising for the simplicity of the final battle, if we want to call the mere pressure that way of a key. However, it is appropriate to think about the whole operation: trying to enrich the Wolfenstein universe is fine, but it is a goal to be pursued with commitment and inspiration, investing time and resources rather than offering sops that are qualitatively very distant from the game starting. We hope that the developers take note in view of a possible Wolfenstein III.", "date": "2018-03-17", "grade": null}
