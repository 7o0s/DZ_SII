Let's see how the developers have managed this particular feat and find out if Shadow Bug is worth the 3.99 required to download it from the App Store... Shadow Bug brings home the result thanks to a successful design and gameplay that works First I cut you and then I jump you The narrative element in Shadow Bug is non-existent, but to be honest, it is not even missing: the user just needs to know that his digital alter ego is an indefinable insect with extraordinary ninja skills that must be led to the end of all the levels that make up the adventure. As mentioned in the introduction, we are talking about a title that uses a platform language but deprives itself of its distinctive element, namely the jumping action: the control system is in fact extremely sparse and only allows you to move the protagonist left and right by exerting pressure on the sides of the display and to attack enemies by touching them with your finger. And it is thanks to the clashes with opponents that Shadow Bug manages to give an unexpected variety to its gameplay, thanks to really intelligent and well-studied mechanics: in fact, just tap on a monster to make our hero teleport automatically in its vicinity (not caring about any walls and obstacles that stand between him and his goal) to cut it in half with a rapid saber and then launch upwards. In this way, most of the platform and puzzle dynamics of the game are fulfilled in one go: attacking an enemy and possibly managing the direction of the rebound is the only way to reach distant or elevated portions of the level, and at the same time it proves necessary to access an area separated by otherwise impassable walls or ceilings. The developers of Muro Studios have been able to combine this particular playful structure with a design that is certainly inspired, a combination that makes progressing in Shadow Bug always stimulating and fun: also the wise insertion along the path of some small elements (pull levers that activate mechanisms , monsters with different patterns, and so on) that help spice things up just enough to ensure that the game never feels too boring or repetitive. Also noteworthy are the boss fights, capable of ingeniously exploiting the simple mechanics on which the gameplay is based. In a generally very positive picture, Shadow Bug only runs into some youthful sins, probably children of the inexperience of the team that created it. A rather bland level of difficulty makes it all too easy to get to the end of the adventure in a short time, with obvious consequences on a fairly reduced longevity which is not helped by the classic three-star evaluation system of the player's skill: to obtain them it is necessary complete the stage, respect a time limit and collect a certain number of luminous globes, but since there is no content to unlock with the accumulated stars, everything soon becomes absolutely superfluous and intended only for those wishing to compete in the inevitable online rankings. For a title sold in a medium / high price range by mobile standards, it would be reasonable to expect more, and at this point all that remains is to hope for future updates of the application that can at least increase the number of available scenarios. What, on the other hand, does not need any tweaking is the excellent technical and artistic component of Shadow Blade: as mentioned at the beginning, visually we are near Limbo (with characters and elements in the foreground represented by black silhouettes that rarely indulge in of color), but the always perfect look of the creatures, the remarkable quality of the animations and the well-finished and colorful backdrops contribute to giving the Muro Studios product an absolutely unique and personal feeling.", "date": "2016-04-12", "grade": "8.3"}
