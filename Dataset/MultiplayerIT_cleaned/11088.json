{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2009", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2009_a.html", "text": "Between unkept promises and far from avant-garde technical solutions, Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has disappointed more than one fan of the series. At the same time, for the 2009 edition, FIFA presented itself in dazzling form, with an online multiplayer full of potential and truly spectacular graphics (players aside...). The battle between the two series has never been so uncertain (and fought in a really strange way: shortcomings on one side, improvements on the other), so much so that it will also be played on the field of mobile games, where Konami and EA Sports products they will have to contend with a Real Football that has never been so refined and captivating, which for 2009 doubles between the standard and ~HD~ version (ie with polygonal graphics). A triangular match whose results could forever change the way we understand football simulations in the mobile arena... The game modes present in PES 2009 are numerous: quick match, friendly, competitions (ie cup, championship and ~super challenge~), multiplayer, training and challenges. The multiplayer can be played via bluetooth with a friend, training allows us to become familiar with the control system while the challenges represent the ~achievements~ of the case: fastest goal, record for penalties scored, goal from a free kick , etc. The fulcrum of the game certainly lies in the competitions, which represent the most substantial part of this mobile reduction: after choosing a team among national teams or clubs (belonging to the English league, the Spanish league, the French league, the Italian one and others) , we will have to face rounds and elimination stages to win a different trophy from time to time. Just like for the ~major~ version, we will also be able to participate in the original Champions League, which takes place as in reality but with the difference that we will be able to select the team we prefer, not just those who are really qualified for the competition. The control system is the one we are used to by now, and which seems to work better on mobile phones: we move the selected player using the d-pad, carry out the passes by pressing the 5 key and shoot by pressing the 0 key, whereas the * and # keys they are used for dribbling and evasive maneuvers, or for throwing a through ball. The selection of the players is automatic and depends on the proximity of the ball, just as the passes are made by giving the ball to the first free player who is indicated on the screen. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of work to be done regarding movement management and artificial intelligence: by holding down 5 our player tries to steal the ball, but when it rolls away he remains stunned and it becomes difficult to move him for make him anchor it. Similarly, it often happens that a member of the team is stationary near the ball, without the game allowing us to control him. These are marginal defects compared to the overall experience, but which can still be very annoying. We will also have the possibility to select an alternative control system, in which everything is done using the 5 key and the action is adjusted according to the situation. Unfortunately, however, at this juncture the problems just mentioned only end up getting magnified... Moving on to the technical aspect, the game hasn't made big steps forward compared to the 2008 edition, even though it's still very pleasant to look at: the construction of the stadiums is good, with an excellent use of colours, and the players have a decent animation level. The three-quarter view from above probably remains the best choice for such a product, given that in many cases the joysticks and d-pads of mobile phones leave something to be desired in terms of diagonals. On the sound it is better to spread a pitiful veil... PRO Excellent management of shots and passes Only 2D graphics, but well drawn and animated Lots of modes, even multiplayer AGAINST It pales in comparison to the 3D graphics of the competitors Some problems with movement and AI Pitiful sound", "date": "2008-11-03", "grade": "S.V."}
