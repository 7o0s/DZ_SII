Max Hoberman, founder of the company with 10 years of experience at Bungie behind him, also helped create Halo Way Point, the Blastacular Map Pack and the very first expansions of Halo 2. So we are not dealing with absolute rookies but rather , to a team made up of managers and programmers with a respectable curriculum. It is not clear why it prompted FPS experts to jump into a totally different genre such as the one that characterizes Crimson Alliance, but without prejudice we have found that their first work is a good game, even if full of clichs and poor in new ideas. The whole story revolves around the daughter of King Asturi, helped in the difficult task of governing Byzan by the wizard Zampara, who has always served the now perished King. The princess, attracted by his powers of black magic and blinded by the power, soon took possession of his magical arts, reducing him to slavery and extirpating the souls of anyone who opposed her. Guided by the dark powers of Black Magic, Asturi created the mighty Crimson Empire. The objective of the game is obviously to overthrow the Kingdom and depose the princess corrupted by Evil, starting the adventure with a choice: the three selectable characters offer the player all the clichs of the role-playing genre. the Gnox warrior bases everything on strength and the use of white weapons, and is equipped with a sword and shield; Moonshade is fast and silent like a ninja, capable of striking from a distance and using particular items dedicated to her; finally there is the very classic Wizard, Direwolf, obviously able to exploit spells, evocations and potions. Crimson Alliance, being playable entirely in cooperative on Xbox Live up to four players, allows a certain customization of the character allowing us to be able to decorate, dress and customize it in quite varied and heterogeneous ways. During the adventure it is obviously possible to buy upgrades, modify one's equipment and learn new spells and abilities, in perfect RPG style. It is also possible to change the colors of the clothes and give the character a new name. Having said that, it must also be added that the graphic style and the realization are decidedly anonymous, characterizing more the genre to which Crimson Alliance belongs rather than giving a note of personality to the title itself. In short, those who chew on rpg and hack'n slash will find absolutely nothing new to taste. The game consists of 13 levels, which can be completed in about 5/6 hours, which are also decidedly uninspired and varied. Most of the time it is a question of following very linear environments interspersed with dungeons that are also very linear and simple. Almost a sort of 3D scrolling game. The lack of a minimum of complexity could discourage many, or please those who want a fairly fluid and undemanding title. Xbox 360 goals Like any self-respecting downloadable game from Xbox Live Arcade, this Crimson Alliance also offers 200 points to unlock through 12 objectives. These are not objectives related to progress in the adventure, but they are all obtainable through specific actions such as performing an Ultimate Attack, killing 25 enemies in a single level with explosives, eliminating specific enemies or expare each character to the maximum. Quite demanding, they require a minimum of effort. Four is better than uan! The marked multiplayer component also translates into the presence of numerous environmental puzzles (also very basic) in which two or more players are needed to be unlocked. The dungeons are in fact full of secret areas where you can open chests and find particular items such as the Anchors of Souls, which when collected all manage to unlock an ~Ultimate Attack~ for each selectable character. Furthermore, with the directional cross, we can activate four ~specials~: the Healing Totem, the bait for enemies that distracts them while we can attack them from behind or run away, the Throwing Ax to attack multiple enemies and the automatic Turret that it gives us temporary help to attack. However, one of the real problems with Crimson Alliance is not the variety of weapons, spells and attacks, rather the lack of pleasure in comparing and leveling up everything we find, buy or learn. Just like any classic action game indeed (rather than RPG), most of the items or weapons we managefinding along the levels is inevitably more powerful or effective than the one already used, creating a sort of automated ~power-up~ effect rather than weighted by the change of the stats. This choice, which greatly simplifies the player's life, was obviously made in the context of speeding up the action in an attempt to create a very fluid and simple title. Lovers of pure and raw RPGs are warned: the statistical component of Crimson Alliance is rose water. Furthermore, the enemies and the missions are always very repetitive and quite boring, without bite and without particularly brilliant ideas that differ from the ~go there~, ~kill that~, ~recover object~. The environmental quests break the pace of the game well, but are also very fast and quick to solve. It is essentially a good action played in multiplayer, but a bad rpg played alone. The technical realization of Crimson Alliance is certainly valuable, in spite of the decidedly anonymous and uninspired artistic work. The environments are very colorful and full of details, even if they all look a little too much alike and once again never deviate from the classic clichs of the genre. Some nice effects frame a respectable but not transcendental polygonal mass, with some sporadic drop in frame rate which does not however affect the game action. Negative note for the accompanying music which is really not very incisive and endowed with verve, repeating uninspired jingles endlessly. Ultimately Crimson Alliance is an excellent idea but developed without too much imagination or personality, too simple for action RPG veterans and too linear and repetitive in many situations. Its greatest strength is saved, the 4-player multiplayer, a real reason why the Certain Affinity game should at least be tried.", "date": "2011-09-20", "grade": "6.0"}
