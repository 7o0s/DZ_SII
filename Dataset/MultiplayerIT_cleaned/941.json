{"name": "Meteos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/meteos.html", "text": "Little desire to dance What set Lumines apart, making it according to many the best game currently available for the Sony laptop, was the wonderful mix of simple but challenging game mechanics and music. Playing Lumines meant entering a sort of hypnotic trance, with the bass pounding your ears and your eyes crazed in search of the best solution in which to fit the pieces that descend from above. An exceptional title, without beating about the bush. Based on such a premise, it was clear that curiosity about Meteos on Nintendo DS was particularly high, however not without some fears: Mizuguchi would really have been able to conceive, create and develop two different puzzle games, guaranteeing both a level of quality worthy of its name? The answer, we anticipate it right away, is yes, even if Meteos has a totally different impact than its ~brother~ available for Psp. The latter, it is useless to deny it, was a faithful representation of the technical potential of the Sony console: brilliant image, remarkable graphic effects, exceptional sound, wide screen. On the contrary, Meteos is certainly more sober, with a rather minimalist and no-frills graphic design, albeit with a very intriguing style. So don't expect to use the Bandai production as a game to show to friends to highlight the technical potential of Nintendo DS... Certainly, instead, you can show them Meteos to share all the brilliance of the gameplay infused by master Mizuguchi, but be careful! The risk is to see them glued to the screen for hours and hours. Permanent center of gravity The concept behind the mechanics proposed by the game is quite simple: in summary, as in the best tradition of the genre, there are colored blocks that descend from above, and then settle on the bottom of the screen one on top of the other, forming columns. Using the stylus on the touch screen it is possible to move the blocks, but only vertically by changing their position within the aforementioned columns. Through this operation, by horizontally aligning three blocks of the same color, they will become rockets, moving towards the top of the screen and taking all the other squares above with them. Exceeding the upper limit of the touch screen causes the blocks to disappear, which move into your opponent's game grid. Yes, because in Meteos you always play against one or more challengers, human or controlled by the CPU, all engaged at the same time and with the aim of sending as many blocks as possible to the other side, to force the opponent to reach the famous game over. But sending your squares over the top of the screen isn't as easy as you might imagine; the fundamental concept of Mizuguchi's fatigue is in fact gravity, which modifies the game pattern at each level. Each stage is in fact a planet, with a different gravitational pull that affects the weight of the blocks themselves: and the more these weigh - or the more blocks they have on them -, the more rockets are needed to send them into orbit. And since the basic concept of Meteos is to create rockets to move as many blocks as possible, the need to create combos comes into play, that is to align other rows of blocks above the rockets themselves to thus give the necessary propulsive potential and sufficient for its purpose. A rocket for a friend The goodness of Meteos' gameplay is discovered gradually, progressing through the games in search of the hand-eye coordination necessary to come out on top. Yes, because Q Entertainment's work requires more than a few sessions to start being mastered, and even once the mechanics have been understood, it is not uncommon to lose several games, especially at higher difficulty levels. The syncopated rhythm that Mizuguchi wanted to instill in his creature is in fact such as to make Meteos a game that is not particularly user friendly, despite the fact that the stylus interface is very intuitive and practically does not require pressing any additional keys. Precisely this interface, however, has lent its side to a not insignificant defect, deriving from its use in an inappropriate manner but capable of allowing even better results than those deriving from ~correct~ conduct. In summary, swiping the stylus up and down quickly in a ~random~ manner on the screen actually leads to the creation of precisely those combos that would otherwise require more time to be processed by the brain and then executed. Although we do not feel like considering this ~defect~, if we want to call it that, fundamental for the overall evaluationa of the game, willy-nilly remains an aspect that really exists and that compromises the balance of the game mechanics envisaged. As for longevity, beyond the desire to improve one's records, Bandai production offers a large dose of extras, such as music, special objects or entire planets to be purchased through a special menu, at the cost of a few hundred ~elements~ collected during game sessions. Obviously there is also a full-bodied wireless multiplayer mode, which also benefits from the possibility of challenges with a single cartridge by downloading the game to the guest consoles. The process is certainly not short, about 2 minutes, but the result amply repays the wait. Comment If Meteos was looking for a kind of Lumines on DS, you will be disappointed. In fact, Mizuguchi wanted to create two extremely different products on Nintendo and Sony portable consoles, although they share the puzzle game genre. Meteos in all honesty has more difficulty than the ~half-brother~ to enter the heart, due to a less intriguing graphic impact and a slightly more complex and not totally brilliant mechanics as that of Lumines. But the overall result remains without a doubt one of the best puzzle games of recent years, as well as a must-buy for any lover of the genre who owns the two-screen laptop from Nintendo. Pros: Extremely good game mechanics Stylistically excellent graphics Excellent use of the touch screen Cons: Too bad about the ~bug~ of the control system Not as brilliant as Lumines Sonoro not at the levels of Mizuguchi The new portable consoles have awakened the inspiration of Tetsuya Mizuguchi, that's for sure. The brilliant Japanese game designer, author  among many others  of that authentic masterpiece called Rez, has in fact wanted to have his say both on Psp and on Nintendo DS by creating, coincidentally, two puzzle games.
