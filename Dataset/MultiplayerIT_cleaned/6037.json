Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is the elaborate title of a small indie gem that will put us in command of a spaceship launched into space with the task of recovering pink bunnies, opening heart-shaped portals and defeating the forces of evil. But maybe we're going too fast, better take a step back. Imagine a world in which scientists have managed to harness the power of love to transform it into a more powerful energy source than oil, the sun or the desire to win an argument on the internet. In this world everything revolves around Ardor, a special universal engine made obviously in the shape of a heart, which is managed, of course, by cute bunnies and kind little frogs. But since not everyone likes love, the forces of hate and evil attack Ardor, splitting it in half and kidnapping its staff. We are part of the Lovers, a chosen body of pilots who have the task of protecting Ardor, but since the omelette is now done and the worst has already materialized, we will have to wander around the constellations to recover the scientists. The problem is, we can't do it alone. Lovers in a Sangerous Spacetime: game that will test your ability to work as a team! Two hearts and a spaceship Yes, because the most interesting part of Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is its being an atypical shoot 'em up. In fact, we will not simply have to drive a ship against hordes of enemies shooting at us, but we will have to control its pilot, who will have to get by to manage every aspect of it: the engine, shields, cannons and special weapons. It is self-evident that not even Goddess Kali could keep all these aspects under control at the same time. In fact, the game shows a view in which the spaceship is at the center of the screen, we can admire its interior as if it were a sectioned anthill, with its tangle of stairs and small rooms, we can also see our alter ego and decide from time to time whether command the rudder, fire one of the four turrets or move the shield. Fortunately war, like love, is best done with someone, and it is for this reason that the title is one of the most interesting cooperative games of the last period. Finding someone available to join us at home to play is now rare, but if you can count on us, know that Lovers will repay you with one of the funniest couple gameplays of the moment. In fact, to face the more difficult levels the game requires total harmony and, after an initial bewilderment, we will soon realize that we have become one with our friend, now we no longer even have to ask him to move the shield to protect the rear. from an asteroid as we use the top gun to get rid of a wave of ships, just like he doesn't have to tell us to move the ship in order to give him the right angle to fire; it all happens naturally and it's damned fun. What if we can't count on anyone? Fortunately, the developers have also thought about this eventuality, allowing us to play in single player by exploiting the artificial intelligence of a bot (played by a cat or a space dog) to which we can assign a task from time to time, even if the guide will always remain our exclusive. Our virtual friend will prove to be particularly good and diligent in moving the shields or shooting with the turrets and all in all he will allow us to face the game even alone. Only that, without necessarily having to go into low-level comparisons between the virtual and the real, the gaming experience will not be absolutely comparable to what we will be able to experience with a companion in the flesh. In some ways playing with the computer guarantees a much lower margin of error, but the unforeseen events that will inevitably occur while playing with a friend will be absolutely more fun than the success guaranteed by a robot. This is undoubtedly an important lesson that Lovers imparts to its players: not bad for a small indie game. A world of bunnies As if the heart of the gameplay weren't enough to make Lovers a title to try, everything that revolves around it is also absolutely top quality. From a graphic point of view, the developers have made extensive use of a fluorescent color palette and a very defined cartoonish design, which in some moments recall the paintings of Keith Aring and the Geomety Wars-style twin stick shooters. The same goes for the soundtrack which makes heavy use of obs beatsexives that alternate traces with more cartoonish sounds to slightly more acid rhythmic pieces. Although classifiable as a shooter, we are not dealing with the classic horizontal or vertical scrolling title, each level is an environment to explore far and wide, full of secrets, threats and power-ups. The purpose of the mission will almost always be to recover a sufficient number of bunnies to allow us to open a heart-shaped portal that will take us to the next section, which obviously will present a higher level of challenge. Occasionally we will encounter levels where all we have to do is stand still and resist wave after wave of spaceships aiming to destroy the ship's hull or engine to end our crusade in the name of love. To make things easier, there will be an ingenious system of power ups based on power, lasers or the strength of metal. These upgrades will come to us from time to time in the form of a gift, we will decide where to place them and the choice will radically change our gameplay. For example, if we decide to use power to increase shields, they will protect a larger space of spaceship, if instead we choose to use it on cannons it will increase firepower. A metal upgrade on the cannons will turn them into wrecking balls, if instead we use it on the engines we will be able to shoot small mines as we move. In doing so, each spaceship will be different from the other and over time we will be able to combine multiple upgrades on the same location to make things more interesting. Another thing that will be unlocked going forward will be the possibility of using new spaceships, with a different allocation of the various elements, so as to further multiply the possibilities of creating the vessel of our dreams... provided that the co-pilot agrees!", "date": "2015-09-15", "grade": "9.0"}
