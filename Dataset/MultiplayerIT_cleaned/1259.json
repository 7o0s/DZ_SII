It's a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling arcade where you take control of a skater exploring three iconic cities for this discipline: Los Angeles, Barcelona and Oslo. At the beginning only the first is available: in order to unlock the other two it is necessary to accumulate credits. These are obtainable both by completing challenges (21 for each location), and by reaching the 30 objectives present in the infinite mode, which basically becomes interesting precisely because of the request for increasingly evolved tricks. The credits are also used to modify the avatar, both on an aesthetic level (by buying new clothes or modifying the parts of the skateboard), and to improve its characteristics such as speed or balance and to unlock new moves. Evolutions are completed by holding down one or both mouse keys and moving the cursor in the direction indicated on the screen; all this becomes more difficult as the speed increases and obstacles such as flower beds or handrails arise which must be exploited to show off ever more spectacular moves. Technical realization. Although video games for mobile platforms (Apple's, in this case) can enjoy good success in their natural habitat, they often show all their limits in the transition to home systems, such as the PC (the title is present both on Steam and on the Epic Game Store) and consoles (a soon-to-be-released port is planned for all new and old-generation consoles, including the Nintendo Switch). Unfortunately, Skate City does not escape this rule: a pleasant game to while away the classic five minutes of the coffee break or waiting for the subway, but hardly attractive for longer sessions sitting in an armchair in front of the monitor. The transition to the Windows environment hasn't brought those dutiful improvements it would have needed to exploit the greater potential of computers: apart from some more detailed textures and the presence of massive anti-aliasing, there is nothing that allows us to distinguish, at first glance, the two versions. The graphic style is still pleasant and goes well with the ~two-dimensional~ nature of the title. Paradoxically, the control system, designed for the touchscreen, was negatively affected. As Fabio already wrote in his test, switching to the physical controller (be it a gamepad or the mouse/keyboard combination) causes the Agens game to lose responsiveness and immediacy. Also in terms of longevity there would be some notes to raise: in one hour we managed to finish all the challenges in Los Angeles, most of which with the maximum score. The soundtrack, on the other hand, has remained unchanged since the iPhone release.", "date": "2021-05-03", "grade": "5.0"}
