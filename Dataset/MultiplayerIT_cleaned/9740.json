Although this statement is objectively quite acceptable, there is the particular case of a title, developed by the Chillingo software house, whose success with the public and critics has made far more high-sounding names pale and which, if it probably cannot still be defined as a killer application, certainly we are close: we are obviously talking about the legendary Angry Birds. Continuing in the wake of the ingenious concept that underlies that masterpiece of vengeful ornithology, the thinking minds of Chillingo have churned out a new catchphrase game, Cut the Rope, whose nice protagonist will need our help again to achieve his sweet goal . Surprise package The paradoxical premise that opens the game sees the arrival at any house of an anonymous package, equipped with an air hole, indicating the presence of something alive inside: and in fact, once the package is opened with a cutter, Om Nom will appear, a little monster of indefinite species and genus, small and green, absolutely harmless, whose only purpose is to feed on all the candies in the box. Just like in the famous Angry Birds, the funny and absurd context of the game represents the unlikely background on which to develop the numerous environmental puzzles present: Cut the Rope is in fact essentially a physics-based puzzle game. The candies, for obscure (and probably sadistic) reasons, will find themselves blocked by ropes along the walls of the box, in an increasingly complex way; armed with a cutter, the only help available at the beginning, the player's task will be to free all the sweets from the strings, swiping his finger transversely, so that the sweet bon bon reaches the wide open mouth of the funny little creature. The sweets dangling from the strings will respond to every physical reaction in a completely credible way, so it will be necessary to choose well which thread to cut, predicting the subsequent movement of the pendulum-candy. Naturally, the task will not always be so easy: in the 100 mini-stages available at launch (but future updates are expected), divided into 4 sections of 25, freeing the candy will require ever greater commitment and attention, even if not with a precise and linear increase in difficulty (some higher-level puzzles will in fact be more immediate than the previous ones). As you progress through the levels, the strings will be joined by bonuses or maluses capable of modifying the movements of the little sweet, also increasing the degree of user interaction: you will thus have the possibility to hook the candy to retractable strings, which will activate as you pass in the event of a fall, or to incorporate it into a soap bubble, useful for upward movements and for making it propel by the amusing air pumps, whose typical sound turns out to be as ungraceful as it is a generator of goliardic hilarity... There will also be elastic cords, pulleys, electric fields, spikes, rails and even greedy spiders trying to prevent the right snack for Om Nom: a huge (but above all very amusing) variety of obstacles, in short, unpredictable and meaningless, so ingenious in their simplicity to make them seem almost wasted for this slightly sadistic purpose. However, if feeding the little monster is the main objective to be achieved, the collection of stars present in all the scenarios is no less important, which can be conquered by passing over them with the candy: it will in fact be necessary to grab at least one star to consider acquired a mini-stage, while to unlock the next series of 25, a precise number must be added each time. As expected, some stars will be in very difficult positions to reach, while others will have a limited time duration, after which they will disappear definitively; the calculation of the final score will therefore also depend on the time taken to feed On Nom as well as on the number of stars acquired. As per Chillingo tradition, the graphic impact of Cut the Rope is perfect, with bright colors and well-made drawings, even if inevitably less varied than that of Angry Birds (after all, the game is set in a box) ; worth mentioning is the full support for the brilliant quality of the Retina Display, as well as the impeccable precision of the touchscreen controls.
