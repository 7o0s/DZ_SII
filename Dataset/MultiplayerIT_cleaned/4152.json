The title, created in collaboration by Outright Games and Bandai Namco, makes its debut these days on the main consoles in circulation, also on Nintendo Switch, anticipating the arrival in cinemas of the third film in the series Hotel Transylvania: A monstrous holiday by a few weeks. It is not the first time that the franchise has had its own dedicated game, clearly launched on the market also to ride the wave of cinematic success: WayForward, at the time of the first film, had already created a very valid metroidvania, albeit simplified and also designed for The smallest. Similarly, Hotel Transylvania 3: Monsters Overboard is ideally a title designed to offer fun for the whole family, while in practice something has gone decidedly wrong. A really scary Gameplay Hotel Transylvania 3: Monsters in the Sea tells an unpublished adventure connected to the events of the third film arriving in theaters: without anticipating anything, the film has as its narrative the summer holidays of Dracula, Mavis and family. All the monsters most loved by children get ready for the hot tropical climate by wearing rather unusual clothes than usual, because horror literature and cinema have certainly not accustomed us to Frankenstein's monster wearing flip flops. However, the thematic choice is spot on and in line with the new film, of which it perfectly follows the atmosphere. The problem comes when evaluating the game itself, which immediately presents itself as the disfigured and trivialized copy of the Pikmin series. The player is required to control a character of his choice between Drac and Mavis, in search of travel companions missing after the shipwreck of the cruise ship: there are three islands, which will have to be explored in every nook and cranny until the confrontation with a final enemy and the rescue your friends. Neither Drac nor Mavis fight in first person: instead they have the task of managing their ~troops~ in battle, like Olimar in Pikmin. Instead of the funny Nintendo creatures, our Transylvania tourists can count on the support of equally nice monstrous creatures, the Impa, little monsters possessing certain abilities. The heart of Hotel Transylvania 3: Monsters in the Sea lies in the use of the Impa to complete the game levels, gradually reaching slightly more complex objectives. Drac and Mavis can bring a certain number of creatures with them, trying to balance their presence according to the objectives to be achieved and the tasks to be performed. Vampirimpas, for example, are perfect for simple tasks like collecting gems, moving pieces of a destroyed bridge, and hand-to-hand combat against enemies, but Wolfimpas and Frankeninmpas are also capable of performing actions their similar, such as digging and bouncing. Since there are just three islands to explore and that the Impa are divided into no more than four different specimens, we can consider the title a simplified version suitable for children of normally much more complex management systems: the problem is that already at of gameplay many problems arise, which make Hotel Transylvania 3: Monsters Overboard a title that is not only confusing, but more often than not frustrating. There is no map to understand where you are at a given moment, there is no management worthy of the name of the Impa, who are simply thrown away to do something at points of interest, and eventually called back with the irritating whistle of Drac; a checkpoint system is missing, a linear progression of the game levels (which are divided into ~nights~), and also a decent balance of the resources available to the player, now excessive, now too scarce. Once the Impas are lost in battle, by the way, they are restored somewhat randomly between game sessions. The shipwreck of the technical sector If the protagonists of Hotel Transylvania 3 are shipwrecked twice, once in the film and once in the video game, the same can also be said for most aspects of the second. Once the most serious shortcomings of the gameplay have been highlighted, which always turns out to be rather superficial and poorly cared for, other problems arise taking into consideration the technical, artistic and visual sector. For example, the complete absence of game footage is questionable, replaced with cheaper photographs that scroll one after the other, not even in a too neat way. Polygonal models and texturesand they are more reminiscent of the PlayStation 2 era than the current one: the glance on Nintendo Switch, in particular, is extremely poor and disappointing, especially considering that despite the technical limitations of the console, more could certainly have been done with little effort, as evidenced by other third-party titles. Of course, one might think that the production of Outright Games is enough for children to have fun in the company of their favorite heroes, but the matter leaves the time it finds: today's children are constantly bombarded by multimedia productions (including videogames) much more refined than the one in question, and the clear but not very effective game mechanics do not offer a great stimulus. After a few hours, they will probably have already put the game back on the shelf. Unless they have already completed it, given that its duration is particularly short, even if you want to dedicate yourself to backtracking the hidden treasures on the various islands.", "date": "2018-07-15", "grade": "5.0"}
