It is that old pastime based on cards (started with the ~Top Trumps~ series, then evolved in various ways), on which cars were printed with the different characteristics reported: the aim was to focus on a particularly strong trait for each auto and try to defeat the opponent's card on that field. The diffusion of the game was such as to have given rise to an infinite number of variations including every possible type of vehicle, and in the elementary and middle schools of those years there was no recreation in the world without at least a couple of boys dedicating themselves to this game. Retrieving cards from the Dal Negro or Pelikan series in Italy today can also be quite expensive, as well as difficult to find a playmate willing to play a game, but if this recollection of the good old days has rekindled your desire for cards on cars, Top Drives may be for you. In fact, the basic idea is the same: also in this case we have to collect a deck of cards representing various cars, each with references to the main characteristics such as top speed, acceleration, road holding and more, on the basis of which we have to choose which pit yourself against those of your opponent in one-on-one fights. Once the five cards of the hand have been placed, we see an elementary 3D reproduction of the race which is limited to symbolizing the collision which essentially takes place only through the mathematical calculation of the probabilities based on the values that characterize each car. Contrary to what happened in the card game, however, in Top Drives several other variables come into play which make the approach to the game more complex and strategic, as well as involving the progression through the ranks of the pilots/card players. Pilot strategy There are several parameters to take into consideration when choosing the cars to pit against your opponent, which also include the characteristics of the tracks on which the clashes take place. The type of road surface, the weather conditions, the type of race (simple, gymkhana, acceleration and so on) make it necessary to choose cars that have characteristics and strengths that are best expressed within the context, therefore it is simply a matter of finding a stroke superior to that of the opponent and winning by a simple mathematical subtraction. To further deepen the management of the cars there is also the possibility of enhancing them, modifying their characteristics with the purchase of components or by merging several cards together. Being a free-to-play, obviously all card management is part of a complex economic mechanism that should tend, sooner or later, to micro-transactions, but Top Drives also allows a minimum of room for maneuver for those who prove themselves skilled enough at planning their own moves that they don't have to resort to spending money. Unfortunately, the grind becomes necessary to advance to the highest levels, with the need to often repeat the same races to improve one's performance (wins are evaluated from one to three stars, also based on the gaps that are imposed on the opponent and therefore become important strategic elements to take into account) or collect extra bonuses. The gold and money earned (or purchased) are indispensable elements for progression because they allow the purchase of new packs and upgrades, and considering that the cards/cars always arrive based on a random mechanism, as the contents of the packs are not known that are purchased, the expenses can become huge in the long run and the micro-transaction can become a convenient solution for those who have little patience. The simplicity with which the clashes are represented in the game does not help: in the face of particularly detailed cards, the races follow a few standard models that repeat themselves continuously. It is true that it is a simple symbolic representation of a confrontation between two cards, but given the collecting and pro-automotive spirit that animates the whole game, a more captivating presentation, at least as regards the car models, certainly would not have hurt. as well as a greater variety and quantity of brands present, even if 700 cars and more still represent an excellent catalogue.", "date": "2017-09-07", "grade": "7.5"}
