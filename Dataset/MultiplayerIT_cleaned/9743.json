The critical and commercial success was such that Earthworm Jim passed through practically every console on the market, both portable and home, even enjoying an even better sequel than the original. All in all, it was a simple platform/shooter, but so full of surreal ideas and situations that it was entertaining even if only for the crazy and well-kept animations of the protagonist, an earthworm equipped with a super-space suit and a laser gun, grappling with cows , killer goldfish and mutant slime lumps. How to resist all this? groovy! Gameloft took care of developing Earthworm Jim HD, creating a high resolution remake practically frame by frame: the impact with Jim's colorful universe is excellent and all the antics that peppered the original '94 game are back with great fanfare, embellished with even more fluid animations, new backdrops and new sound effects. The levels maintain the same structure and the positioning of the enemies in the various schemes is substantially identical: this is undoubtedly both a pro, for the nostalgic, and a con for the newbies, as Earthworm Jim HD is a game that is far from simple if compared to today's standard. In particular, the complexity and peculiarity of some stages and of the graphic elements inside, such as the very platforms on which to climb, can leave you a little lost and sometimes it is not easy to guess which direction to take to reach the end of the level, in the absence of directions. Earthworm Jim HD maintains the same and inconsistent structure of the original: in one level you will be busy escorting a harmless little dog (actually a deadly mutant mastiff) between alien tentacles and meteor showers, in another you will have to face a lump of mucus in a challenge to bungie-jumping right after you brave the bowels of hell to defeat the infernal cat Evil all without a real break in continuity. The madness of the situations and the hilarious character design are the greatest merits of Earthworm Jim HD, which narratively is really disconnected and incoherent, unified in the various levels by the hilarious animations of Jim and his absurd supporting actors. All this is topped off with a good rearrangement of the original soundtrack which incorporates more or less famous themes and tunes, almost making fun of what happens on the screen. Playstation 3 trophies Earthworm Jim HD offers twelve Trophies: seven Bronze, four Silver and one Gold. The difficulty varies, for example for some Trophies it will be enough to defeat certain enemies or collect a certain number of power-ups, for others it will be necessary to complete the game within a certain time limit or win several games in Multiplayer mode. The earthworm who could shoot Earthworm Jim HD proposes the exact same mechanics of the original and in certain moments there is a certain vintage aftertaste, cross and delight of this remake. Jim is armed with a pulse gun that can be aimed in any direction, however its use forces the protagonist to remain motionless and it is not even possible to shoot while jumping. Jim can also use his real body as a whip, also striking upwards when he's on the ground but only head-on if he's jumping. These limitations age the gameplay a little more than necessary and make some passages quite frustrating until you get the hang of it. Gameloft has added practically a single new feature, that is the possibility of switching between normal and enhanced pistol shots by pressing a button. For the rest, Earthworm Jim HD is played exactly as it was in '94, identifying the platforms or handholds necessary to progress, defeating the enemies on the way and any bosses that will block the way: it's all quite essential but sixteen years later still works damn well. For the occasion, Gameloft has also added two difficulty levels and a multiplayer mode that allows you to tackle some stages in the company of three friends: it's actually a rather naive but decidedly pleasant mode.", "date": "2010-10-11", "grade": "7.4"}
