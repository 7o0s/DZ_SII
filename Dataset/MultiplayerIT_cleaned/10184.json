These are scenes that are presented to us in the form of home movies, and which in fact constitute the introduction of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. What is not seen in the video is the continuation of the story: Harry and Cheryl are returning home, it is dark outside and the asphalt is frozen. Suddenly the car loses traction and goes off the road with a terrible impact. When he wakes up, Harry is slumped over the wheel, dazed but still in one piece; only Cheryl is gone. Evidently she got out of the car to get help, but how could such a small child manage in the dark, with the city deserted and immobilized by the blizzard? It is at this point that we enter the game, playing the role of a father desperately looking for his daughter in a place that should be familiar to him but which instead evokes only confused memories. When Konami announced Shattered Memories in June, it was safe to assume that it might be the usual remake with the controls modified to fit the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combo. Well, it's not like that. After creating the excellent Silent Hill: Origins, the English developers of the Climax team evidently stopped to reflect on the concept of ~survival horror~, on the mechanisms that have always characterized this particular videogame genre and on the possibility of modifying its foundations to obtain a different experience, somehow more realistic and less oriented towards the action component. And now let us give you a big revelation There's no fighting in Shattered Memories! There, we said it. Archived the excellent combat system seen in Origins, the new Silent Hill tries to offer players an experience in many ways closer to reality, in which panic dominates our decisions when the air suddenly stops, the buildings are covered with an unnatural patina of ice and a series of filthy creatures try to grab us. During these phases, rightly called ~nightmares~, the good Harry can only run, hide and possibly shake off the monsters once they have grabbed him. This kind of situation on Wii takes advantage of a physical component that shouldn't be underestimated: when a creature grabs us, we have to move it away by moving the controllers as shown on the screen: the character will react accordingly, pushing towards the sides or backwards in an attempt to gain some space to escape. We must therefore act promptly and ~real~ with respect to what occurs on the screen, identifying ourselves more than ever with the protagonist of the story as he runs towards the ~blue door~ that will lead him out of the nightmare. A door that is not always easy to identify, given that the map is of no help to us at this juncture, and that we have to earn by paying close attention to soliciting the controllers in the right way: unfortunately the motion detection necessary to keep the creatures away is not activated with a minimum shaking, as we are used to doing on Wii, but it requires large and controlled gestures, the correct execution of which must be assimilated, especially at the beginning. Having archived the frenzy of these moments, the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo console are instead used to perfection. Harry wanders around the city brandishing a flashlight that we control directly, since it identifies itself with the Wii-mote, and which can be directed completely independently of the movement, clearly entrusted to the Nunchuck's analog stick. Likewise, the infrared pointing system plays a leading role during interaction with the scenario: at the right moment, we can control a virtual hand on the screen and grab objects by holding down the A and B buttons, then move or rotate them according to of necessity. The first ~puzzle~ in the game (and we take the liberty of talking about it precisely because it is the one you will come across at the very beginning), for example, sees us looking for a key hidden in one of the empty cans left on a cart. To figure out where the key is, we have to grab the cans one by one and shake them, then overturn the one containing the object and collect it. An atypical adventure We talked about ~puzzles~, in quotation marks, because from this point of view Shattered Memories actually presents itself as an atypical adventure, in which you interact with the environment but there are no puzzles to solve. Is there a closed door? Well, the key is always around. The intentionne of the developers is clearly to continue along the lines of ~realism~, as well as to spare the player an exploration spoiled by backtracking where the ~wandering aimlessly~ component is already present and is likely to be one of the main limitations of the Climax title . The game oozes atmosphere from every pore, there's no doubt about that, but shooting in very large scenarios without a precise direction, moreover aware that there won't be some action hidden around the corner to liven up things, sometimes it can get boring. However, these are largely forgivable defects in the face of the extraordinary directorial work, which tells the story of Harry Mason in a deliberately confusing mix of live sequences, flashbacks and so-called ~alternative~ visions, in which we find ourselves sitting in the studio of a psychotherapist to work on our memories and our emotions. When starting, the game warns us that the experience will be modified according to our psychological profile, and it is precisely in this way that the sequences with the doctor arise, who will ask us questions whose answers will affect the appearance and role of places and characters during the adventure. Agent Cybil, who Silent Hill fans will surely remember, can present herself as a normal girl or as a busty cop who loves cleavage depending on what we declare. The whole story therefore has a ~replayability~ factor that should not be underestimated, which pushes us to restart the game after completing it to see the protagonist's story from another angle, enriched by the awareness of how things really are. The PS2 and PSP versions Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is available not only for Nintendo Wii, but also for PlayStation 2 and PSP. The three versions appear identical in terms of plot and structure, but clearly on the Sony consoles the interaction with the scenario and the control of the torch take place through the use of the analog sticks. The portable reduction proves to be technically excellent and tries to hide the inevitable simplicity of the polygonal models in the best possible way, while also behaving very well with textures (notoriously one of the weak points of the PSP). The graphics of the game on PS2 appear less detailed than that seen on the Wii, unfortunately, and in general there is a lack of physicality that characterizes the experience on the Nintendo console thanks to the controllers with motion sensing, especially during ~nightmares~. SCORE: 8.2 The importance of having a cell phone with GPS One of the most interesting found in Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is the presence of a mobile phone that Harry needs not only to receive text messages and voice messages (often from deceased people...), but also to take pictures and, above all, to view a map of the city using GPS. Silent Hill is a dark place, in which many horrible and reprehensible episodes have taken place, and the protagonist of the game often finds himself reluctantly witnessing it. The phone's camera, in such situations, can capture the image of what at first glance seem simple shadows but who are actually restless spirits, left to watch over their mortal remains waiting for someone to find out what happened to them. From these ~discoveries~ emerge testimonies and clues that act as pieces of a puzzle, for a story that at first seems really difficult to compose, but which ultimately takes about six hours to complete. After Silent Hill: Origins, therefore, Climax confirms its preference for short adventures. The representation of the map using the GPS system appears realistic as long as it is displayed on the mobile phone display, even if for better orientation you need to access the full screen view. In this case it is also possible to ~take notes~ and draw signs to indicate places or roads. Similar to the flashlight, the mobile phone is identified with the Wii-mote and you need to use the d-pad to move through its menus, which include the ability to save the game. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, it must be said that we are dealing with a very well-finished product, which in particular boasts really well-made and rather detailed polygonal models. The quality of the animations is good, even with regard to the creatures we have to flee from during nightmares; it's just a pity that in this case the ~bestiary~ is much reduced compared to the ~standard~ episodes of Silent Hill. The famous ~fog~ that characterized the first original episode on PSone (and which was actually more of a ploy to prevent the console from rendering the scenery beyond a certain distance) has been replaced by a mix of darkness and snow in fronttruly convincing, able to give the adventure the right atmosphere. The lighting system works very well, the movement of the flashlight is fluid and it takes very little to become familiar with the controls. Too bad only for the frame rate, which suffers from frequent drops which could perhaps have been remedied with a more accurate work of optimization of the graphics engine. The direction of the scenes, as already mentioned, is extraordinary and paired with a musical accompaniment of rare beauty, signed by Akira Yamaoka. The speech is also excellent, which in the local version is subtitled in Italian. Of course, having the dubbing in our language would have been better, but you have to know how to be satisfied...", "date": "2010-02-22", "grade": "8.7"}
