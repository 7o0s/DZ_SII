Well, dear friends, we love you, feel free to skip this introductory paragraph and head boldly and full of nicotine to the heart of the article. Are you not? Ouch ouch ouch, then you are out of the loop: this article, as well as the DS non-game to which it refers, is not for you, so stay away, we don't want you with your clear voice, your youthful energies intact, your teeth spotless, and your chances by who knows what percent lower than getting cancer. Tze! With the first step you are already on your way Here we are again, dear smoker friends, those others are gone, don't worry! Well, do you know Allen Carr? Definitely yes, given that he is, as he defines himself on the back of this Ubisoft production, the ~world's greatest expert on how to quit smoking~. To which, at the dawn of this all in all surprising experience, we came up with the easy and obvious joke that maybe he really was because he had done it dozens of times. And instead, after a quick round of documentation, it turns out that Mr. Carr is the inventor of a rather successful method that finds among its beneficiaries and testimonials none other than Anthony Hopkins, and don't worry, it's just the well-known actor to give up smoking should have started eating people, that was just a movie. At most he will have become a chewing gum eater. This method, simply called ~Easyway~, is also the basis of a book, an international best seller published in 50 countries and which has sold nine million copies, which we, of course, had never heard of before setting about testing this method. last non-game of the ~My Wellness Coach~ series: actually, let's reflect, since Ubi is at stake with this very little playful series, making one about smoking is not a bad idea at all, and from here to turn to the world's leading expert the step is short. In short, in fact the premises are the best: a serious software house, a recognized expert... The problem is that we don't have the slightest intention of giving up smoking, they have imposed it on us editorially: therefore, with a mocking and skeptical nature, we turn on the DS defiantly as if to say: ~Well, dear Allen, show me what you can do!~ The road to freedom In reality, we would have realized shortly thereafter, it was not us who challenged Allen Carr, but the little ~monster of nicotine~ that resides in every smoker, a small, voracious creature that needs cigarettes to live, and that pushes us to do the craziest things just to satisfy her bulimia. In fact, it can only be defined as crazy, the Easyway pushes us to think, spending a lot of money on something that hurts us, doesn't taste good, takes away our energy and nowadays also excludes us from the social assembly; turning on the DS, the title seems to do everything to welcome us with open arms, it asks us our names, it allows us to choose our tutor from a list of six (really existing people who work in some Easyway center around the world) , reassures us that the experience of quitting smoking will be anything but painful, indeed, even funny: in fact, while we stop smoking we can safely continue smoking. Where is the catch? Simply in the fact that the ~game~, as well as the method, is divided into two large parts, the first of which, the ~Road to freedom~, is a sort of psychological indoctrination equal but opposite to what the little monster: he convinced us, at the time, that smoking was nice, that cigarettes tasted good, that it was an excellent thing to overcome moments of boredom, that it made us attractive and interesting for others, that it would relax us and help yourself to concentrate... Allen Carr instead, step by step, convinces us exactly the opposite, point by point to what are all the positive clichs about cigarettes. And while we are quite sure that the textual parts of this phase of the game are neither more nor less than summaries of the salient parts of the book, the video game medium has a possibility that the printed paper does not have: for each ~section~, each concerning one specific reason for which you smoke, a mini-game is associated, which reiterates the concept in an interactive form. And so we find ourselves exploring a cave collecting diamonds which, however, take us lower and lower until we can no longer go back up, cleaning increasingly dirtier teeth, doing our daily job which, however, will be increasingly difficult after each cigarette break ... An excellent idea, even if rather obligatory, which ultimately proves to be spot on and effective, also thanks to the very simple but pleasant graphic style; once a minigame in fashion is unlockedmain problem we will be able to face it again individually to obtain higher scores: unfortunately, however, in this way, detached from the context, we realize the not exactly valuable play value of many of the 12 minigames present, often boring, frustrating, not very playable or a combination of the three . But leave me on the most beautiful? After demolishing our beliefs about smoking in a kind and friendly way (which can also be done in half a day), our tutor presents us with a fait accompli: the cigarette that almost orders us to smoke at this point will be the last! It is a sort of verification, to test how much the things he has told us up to that moment have really been assimilated by our psyche. Then a series of tips to tackle the last and definitive part of our journey, which unlocks at the same time: the ~Calendar of Benefits~. One expects who knows what, a certain level of support in what, as we know, is the most difficult part when one quits smoking, and yet this is precisely the most disappointing, scarce, poorest phase of the whole ~game~. limited to a couple of phrases to unlock one a day for the first week, then one a week for the next three, which inform us, for example, when the nicotine circulating in our body has run out, when we should start realizing that we have brighter skin, when we begin to feel flavors and smells in a more defined way... All true things, please, that we have been able to find firsthand, the fact remains that dear Allen seems to abandon us right in the moment most needed: after having done a splendid job of creating, or awakening, even in those who had no intention of giving up smoking, the belief that smoking only hurts without giving anything in return, when it comes to really having to start resisting the temptation Easyway seems practically useless, leaving us at the mercy of willpower alone. Which, perhaps, from the point of view of psychology and the effectiveness of the whole can also be positive, but having to judge the product from the point of view of a video game magazine...", "date": "2009-02-12", "grade": "S.V."}
