Twin Blades is channeled into a genre that is more than furrowed on the Apple platform and does so starting from an equally abused premise: the zombie apocalypse has unleashed on Earth and only a damsel equipped with a scythe and a gun (?) can get on top of the situation. More than an incipit, the above is an excuse to ask the user to physically eliminate a number of different enemies, enough to be able to reach the end of the four short levels created, buy some upgrades and then start over. Damn price The structure is therefore particular because rather than playing a series of different environments, the same ones are retraced over and over again, with enhanced opponents and new skills with which to eliminate them but always returning to the beginning and leaving the counter of one's score the task of give a longer-term goal, which can keep playing. The reasons for this choice are evidently to be found in the price, of 79 cents: Twin Blades is worth exactly what it costs, a pity that, at least for the writer, it would have been far preferable to have a more sensible and traditional progression perhaps by spending triple or quadruple but being able to enjoy an experience with all the trappings of the case. A pity, also because setting aside the infinite loop of the same four mini-settings - among other things annoyingly flat, lacking verticality and debasing the possibility of jumping - we find ourselves in front of a fairly well-made product, with the directional cross virtual well implemented and the two opposing keys useful for drawing the scythe and shooting the pistol, with the latter exploitable until the appropriate energy is emptied, then rechargeable using shots with a white weapon; cute the idea of shaking the phone to free yourself from the grip of the zombies intent on sucking the blood of the protagonist. Only two attacks to start, therefore, to which are added those that can be purchased in the appropriate shop after each repetition of the stages, acquiring, among other things, machine guns, flamethrowers, an aerial slash, additional life and energy, which in turn can be upgraded so as to be more performing . Nothing revolutionary, mind you, but enough to give the right amount of customization and curiosity to play a few more games. Visually the manga-medieval style chosen is very colorful and equipped with a truly remarkable cure, especially for the backdrops, with few moving elements but many details and a rather abused style but here able to exalt itself thanks to the visual close to the action . Nothing special about the music, which at least doesn't annoy, and the effects that do their job without surprising. The chosen structure does not facilitate a judgment on longevity, however let's say that to get an idea of all the upgrades and get tired, a couple of hours can be spent without too many problems.
