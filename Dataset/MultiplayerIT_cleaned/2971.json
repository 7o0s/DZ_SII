{"name": "Guardian Tales", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guardian-tales-la-recensione.html", "text": "It's hard to think that a free-to-play mobile RPG with gacha mechanics could present anything new and interesting, but there are rare exceptions where the unlikely happens, as we see in the Guardian Tales review. When you see those terms written, we already know exactly what we're running into: a game that usually incorporates the classic styles of the JRPG, which offers various game modes including story, missions and multiplayer and which focuses heavily on micro-transactions through summoning systems and character management. Mind you, they are all elements that we find quite precisely in this case as well, but Guardian Tales manages to put them in a rather different light, crafting a game with a strong personality that puts the classic darker and more predatory drifts of in-game purchases into the background. app. First of all, the 2D-style graphic characterization recalls the more classic tradition of the JRPG, but enriched by a remarkable definition and attention to detail and animations which, beyond the simplicity and general cleanliness, highlights a production of a certain caliber, endowed with an artistic direction that goes beyond the simple imitation of the usual well-known models of the past. This is also evident in the humor that permeates the story and setting and makes everything a sort of parody of the typical clichs of the genre, complete with playful references to pop culture between anime and video games. Then there's the gameplay, which in the heat of the action has some very interesting features and can strongly differentiate Guardian Tales from other similar games, bringing it even closer to Zelda, with due proportions. All this puts all the usual superstructure typical of free-to-play RPGs with gacha in the background, which is in any case very present: many menus and sub-menus, various secondary modes which however fail to be as incisive as the story , a system of summoning characters and weapons through the spending of gems and a certain insistence on the management of fighters that triggers the classic mechanisms capable of pushing those who are more inclined to such practices to in-app purchases. Something different The story is not particularly elaborate but is illustrated through a continuous series of twists and anecdotes that seem to want to make fun of the traditions of the JRPG genre: the protagonist is a new Kanterbury guard (probable reference to the famous Canterbury Tales) , unbeknownst to him destined for great things, as often happens to young and unsuspecting heroes. The premise seems to lay the foundations for the classic hero's training story, but what happens in the short introductory minutes already makes it clear that Guardian Tales doesn't really go to parry on the more classic dynamics of the genre: a sort of alien invasion disrupts the capital , the princess ends up under attack and, trying to protect her, in the escape you are faced with a sort of side-scrolling shooter until you end up in a mysterious forest populated by bandits, goblins, mysterious animals and other bizarre figures . Note that all texts are well translated into Italian. The situations are varied and quite far from those typical of mobile RPGs of this type, but this peculiarity is also underlined by the gameplay itself, which continuously alternates combat phases with puzzles to be solved, in a remarkable structural continuity that makes the levels real own dungeons to explore. We are far from the typical mission mechanism composed of progressive automatic clashes, with maps that instead present sub-quests to undertake, secondary roads to explore and secrets to discover, also solving real Zelda-style puzzles. These are not particularly complex puzzles and the level design remains quite simple, requiring you to play with switches, move elements of the scenery and even act on logical elements such as flammable objects and the like, but it is still something completely different and very refreshing compared to the semi-automated mechanism that we are used to seeing with RPG gachas. The combat system is action and not exactly tactical, but relies on the use of various special abilities (with the usual dedicated button and relative cooldown to be calculated) and on a considerable variety of weapons including melee and ranged weapons, including pistols, rifles and firearms that substantially change the approach to enemies, while the variety of the latter and the presence of bosses with diversified attack patterns determine rather varied game situations. Progression and gacha The game tries to introduceand the summoning system and the management of the characters calmly, so much so that the entire section is practically blocked before having concluded at least one first part of the story and this can be a positive thing. To be honest, the main story mode works so well that it seems that it could very well have managed on its own and one wonders if it were not the case to publish Guardian Tales as a simple premium mobile RPG eliminating all the cumbersome free-to structure -play with microtransactions, but we can do very little about this now. The various management and gacha elements are introduced gradually but this does not make them any less complicated: these are two parallel systems for summoning, one dedicated to the characters and one to the weapons, with numerous different in-game currencies to take into consideration. The drop rate for SSR units and weapons is very low, as often happens, but the elements with lower rarity have a good chance of emerging also thanks to the daily rewards, so the system still works quite well unless you want to aim for complete collection, which necessarily requires a few steps from the shop for the purchase of gems and the like. Similarly, if you want to be very competitive in PvP it is clear that the game pushes towards pay to win, as well as with regard to the need to level up to carry out the more advanced missions: in general, the use of grinding forces the micro -transaction also due to the energy that is consumed for each activated quest. However, also with regard to the gacha, Guardian Tales is distinguished by a very special spirit: when a hero or a weapon is summoned, for example, these are delivered by a ~Kamazon~ drone inside a package and packaged inside a typical collectible action figure box. Advancing in level opens up further game modes that always fall within the standards of the genre, such as the ability to build and manage your own village. These are elements that are now part of the canon of the free-to-play mobile RPG and are intended to keep the attention fixed on the game, spending a large amount of time in the menus even when you do not progress through the quests, but the feeling, with these so disparate characteristics, is always that of being faced with a kind of Frankenstein a little meaningless.", "date": "2020-08-08", "grade": "8.0"}
