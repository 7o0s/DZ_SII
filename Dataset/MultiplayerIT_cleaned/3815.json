In fact, more than a year has passed since the title signed by Leonard Menchiari and IV Productions arrived on Steam in Early Access, after previously made to wait for a few years following the crowdfunding campaign successfully supported on Indiegogo. It was in fact 2014 when RIOT - Civil Unrest appeared on the Internet, inevitably causing discussion for its issues capable of also attracting the attention of Coisp, the police force union which accused the game of being a way to clear violence from part of those who protest in the street. A superficial vision of the project linked to RIOT - Civil Unrest, born from the first-person experience of Menchiari himself on the occasion of some NO-TAV demonstrations in Val di Susa, which led the creator of this game to reflect on the clashes between citizens and the police. Without the will to take sides on one side or the other, the real goal of RIOT - Civil Unrest is to bring out protest issues that very often do not cross the border of the television screen from which they are reported to us. Facing the uprising from both sides of the fence, RIOT - Civil Unrest wants to take us inside its dynamics, where feelings like fear, anger and tension belong to both rebels and cops. A very specific purpose, almost didactic, which as we are about to see must be kept in mind to approach the mechanics of this title. Mode: Battles around the world Even if in terms of modality the RIOT - Civil Unrest proposal offers some alternatives, at the basis of the dynamics there is always the clash between protesters and the police forces of the place where the events take place. Documented by riots that actually happened around the world, the ~missions~ of RIOT - Civil Unrest take place between Italy (NO-TAV), Greece (Battle of Keratea), Spain (Indignados) and Egypt (Arab Spring), but the goal is to extend the settings available to other clashes that have taken place in recent times, such as the revolt of the yellow vests in France. Version 1.0 of the game has in fact brought with it new levels, intended on the one hand to expand the offer of RIOT - Civil Unrest and on the other to show the potential of the game editor. Each protest is played through a short series of key confrontations, unlockable in order after selecting which of the two sides to be on. To complete the entire mode, you must therefore successfully support each mission at least twice, obviously aiming for different objectives. For example, rioters may have the task of protecting a gathering of tents or breaking through a barrier to occupy a specific area, while the police must try to disperse the opposing forces or protect an area or a series of objects. A situation of attack and defense that can be tackled as we will see in a different way, focusing on the number of demonstrators on the one hand and on the discipline of the police force on the other. Returning to the modes available in RIOT - Civil Unrest, we find the one called Global which leads us to tackle all the game's missions in succession. In this case, however, the outcome of one clash can have repercussions on the next one, favoring or not our alignment depending on what public opinion thinks. In fact, even in the Campaign mode, each clash has a double military and political evaluation, linked yes to the objectives of the two sides but also to the violence implemented. Achieving what we set out to do by making dead and wounded on the other side of the fence will turn public opinion against us, thus encouraging a peaceful approach on both sides. Continuing the list of modes, the Versus allows us to start a fight together with our friends locally for up to four players, and the Custom allows us to mix the cards of the various missions a little. As we said, the presence of the game editor should not be underestimated, thanks to which Menchiari and the group of developers intend to give everyone the possibility of adding further material to RIOT - Civil Unrest: the support for Steam Workshop guarantees simple downloading in this sense of maps and missions. Gameplay: Control is an illusion To evaluate the dynamics of RIOT - Civil Unrest we must keep in mind the intentions we talked about at the beginning. In strictly videogame terms, the game is presented as a cross between a management and a real-time strategy, in which each mission begins from the preparatory phase: on the side of the rioters, the choices influence the number of people present in the mission, then selecting their endowment consisting of weapons such as Molotov cocktails, maalox to be used to reduce the effects of tear gas or use of social networks to call for reinforcements. The police forces instead present themselves with real classes, thanks to which it is possible to field defense, assault or ballistic units equipped with professional equipment. From the choice of the type of shells to the type of auxiliary item, everything contributes to determining a score that influences the presence of rioters in the mission. Both sides therefore provide for cause and effect relationships between choices and mission difficulties, to be kept in mind before facing the clash. The player has only a few minutes to reach his goal: a choice that helps to give the game that sense of tension that belongs to the clashes even in reality, because of which a simple spark can ignite an uncontrollable fire. In this perspective, artificial intelligence plays a very important role in each mission, making the claim to always have all units under control not always valid in RIOT - Civil Unrest. A situation of peace can in fact get out of hand when someone uses violence, making it difficult for both sides to maintain the pre-established order. The downside in videogame terms is that despite your efforts you don't always have the opportunity to put the situation back on the right track, thus making the player a helpless spectator in front of what is happening. At this point we must understand that the will of the designer is also to make those in front of the screen reflect on the complexity of the situations shown, even through a gameplay that can be difficult to digest. The main aspect where something more could have been done is that linked to the variety of objectives, which in the long run prove to be similar even between the various settings. Graphics and Controls: Great pixel art, with some woodiness From an artistic point of view RIOT - Civil Unrest makes excellent use of pixel art, especially in terms of animations and variety of the proposed environments. Each mission is anticipated by a short filmed introduction which gives a context to the battle we are about to witness, followed by a small report in the form of a newspaper article in which the events are summarized. Considering the desire to reflect on what you see on the screen, however, we would have expected to see a slightly more in-depth narrative aspect. The sound is very good, in particular as regards the audio effects: in some cases it is in fact possible to hear chants and slogans sampled from real protests, together with explosions and other noises typical of the most agitated street demonstrations. The soundtrack is a little less memorable, destined to tire in the long run. As for the controls, despite the double choice between joypad and mouse plus keyboard we were unable to find a way that gave us full satisfaction. In the case of the controller, in fact, a greater general reactivity is contrasted by the absence of the precision guaranteed by the mouse pointer, while the use of the keyboard to issue commands is a little less intuitive than the buttons on the pad.", "date": "2019-02-13", "grade": "6.0"}
