They typically serve as a visual representation of awards and accolades, but there is no shortage of different interpretations. In 1995, even a platformer was released for the SEGA Mega Drive starring one of them, equipped for the occasion with arms and legs (the excellent Ristar, developed by the Sonic Team). Well, the Tumbledrop star boasts no appendages of any kind, however. It's just a star: fuchsia in color, the classic five points and a stupid smile that turns into an expression of mad terror when we make a mistake and cause it to fall into the water. Developed by Starfruit Games, this nice puzzle game takes up the tradition of ~single button~ video games and bases its appeal on the presence of a physical environment in which to make one's moves, characterized by an incidence of gravity that is in many ways more forgiving than to reality but not to be taken lightly. Shooting star Tumbledrop offers us the beauty of sixty stages, divided into three different levels of difficulty that are unlocked as we progress through the game. The goal is the same every time: to get the smiling star to land but not fall into the water. To do this, we have to make the various ~bricks~ that make up the ever-changing structures on which the star sits disappear, simply by touching them with our fingers. For example, if we have a construction that bases its solidity on the blocks placed at its base, we can make one of them disappear and see the rest of the bricks that obey the force of gravity and begin to fall. The star will roll accordingly, at a speed that allows us to implement rapid ~countermoves~ to balance its trajectory and make it touch the ground without ending up in the water. The physics of the scenario, as mentioned above, is therefore the real protagonist of this puzzle game. We can also complete the stages using a million moves, with the only limitation of having to wait for a visual indicator to restore after each touch. It is not possible to make two blocks disappear in rapid succession, therefore, and the strategy for the best resolution of each puzzle will often present itself to our eyes after a series of trials and errors. Fortunately, there is a special button on the screen that allows us to ~reset~ the level at any time and start it over. There are rewards for all tastes: if we complete a stage using a maximum of three moves we will earn a star, while using the maximum possible moves will earn us a heart. The unlocking of the new difficulty levels, however, will take place anyway, whatever our performance: a flaw that sacrifices the player's precision in favor of a completely frustration-free mechanism, which keeps us going in any case but which for this reason it cannot guarantee who knows what longevity. Not bad: although intended as a short experience, Tumbledrop maintains the indisputable charm of colorful, fun and stylish graphics, while our actions are accompanied by the catchy motifs of a tender music box.
