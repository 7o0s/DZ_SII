Phoenix Online Studios is a new name in the indie market, and one to watch. They cut their teeth with The Silver Lining, the unofficial sequel to King's Quest, distributed for free and the result of years of hard work and not yet finished. Now, however, they are ready to make the commercial leap with the Cognition series: An Erica Reed Thriller, of which we offer you the review of the first two episodes at once: Hangman and The Wise Monkey. The whole series develops around its protagonist, Erica Reed, an FBI agent on duty in Boston who hunts down the serial killer who killed David, his younger brother. Soon the investigation takes a supernatural turn. In fact, Erica discovers that she can see the past by touching objects. It is the first manifestation of his mental abilities, to which others are added in the first and second episodes. An idea already seen but stimulating, which adds a tinge of mystery to this new murky and complex series written under the supervision of Jane Jensen. Unfortunately on two occasions the spell is broken in a gross way, but overall the structure is solid. We'll get there: we've only just begun to put the pieces together. Follow us and you will discover the truth with us. Episode 1: Hangman The first episode begins with a high-voltage prologue that makes us experience the triggering event from which the story kicks off. In these few scenes we get to know Erica and her sidekick, McCoy, and we discover some interesting elements for a point and click adventure, such as the possibility of dying or failing to solve a timed puzzle. Nothing to worry about anyway, because the result you get in case of success or failure is always the same, only the methods change. It won't be a revolution, but any variation on the classic structure is always welcome in a genre so faithful to the patterns that defined it fifteen years ago. After this initial phase the game loses its rhythm and keeps at the same speed until the last scene, again a dynamic event with flying bullets. Between the beginning and the end, however, we enjoy the real strength of Cognition: making us feel like FBI agents immersed in our work. We have a computer on which we can cross-reference cases in the database, print evidence-request forms, study clues, and send e-mails. Not to mention the smartphone to take pictures and connect to the Internet. It may seem laborious to you but it's all stylized, it's certainly not a simulation. When it comes time to use a technical device or do research, we quickly know where to look and the options are limited. What matters is the sensation of really carrying out our work following a plausible practice, up to the moment of the interrogation complete with a transparent glass beyond which one of our colleagues watches the scene and with whom we can interact by leaving the room. Unfortunately this is where the fiction slips: leaving an unsuspected person in that little room to go around collecting clues in the other settings sinks the realism and dampens the tension. In any case, the story is articulated and, between visits to the morgue, complete with a victim on the coroner's table, and the gradual discovery of our powers, weaves an exciting canvas, from which the protagonist emerges as the winner in terms of character and depth. The ending is worthy of the prologue and leaves everything pending, so that the desire to start immediately with the following episode is high. The beauty is that you just keep reading to know if Cognition lives up to the premises. Episode 2: The Wise Monkey The second episode takes a decisive step forward. Many settings are imported from the first, such as the FBI headquarters and the morgue. So the developers were able to focus more on the new environments and the story. The mystery thickens and the twists increase. The investigation now follows two strands and until the end everything changes and certainties are shattered. Unfortunately, Hangman's high-voltage incipit is missing, but it all starts once again with a dramatic event. And here the series makes its second slip. An agent was kidnapped and his ear delivered to Reed. All this is terrible, and the investigation is immediately triggered. It's a pity that if we go out and return to the office we find blood on the floor with a lot of ears and everyone working as if nothing had happened. Needless to say, fiction takes a hit. Apart from that the game does a great job of giving us the feel of building our investigation into a trialsee you after another. Pulling out your FBI ID or finally accusing a suspect is very satisfying and Agent Reed plays his part masterfully, thanks to heartfelt voice acting and a script that delves into his psychology. Another positive aspect of The Wise Monkey is the setting, which includes Berklee College of Music, with its students, loans, envies and slimy blackmail. The information to be collected during the adventure is many and is distributed between the dialogues and the investigation files. Pay attention because in the end the game gives us one of the most beautiful puzzles of recent years. Suddenly the situation escalates, just like it happened in the prologue of Hangman and we are faced with those sadistic trials that we have seen in so many Hollywood films. Only this time the player is asked to actually remember many details that we bet he has already forgotten, on pain of death. And, in this case, starting over each time and trying an alternative to the previous answer is useless. The combinations are too many. Besides, didn't you want to be FBI agents? The case is solved Cognition doesn't immediately make a good impression and at first we thought we were in front of a botched adventure, with the clich of the female FBI agent (she even has the abused red hair) chasing the madman on duty. But then the depth of the protagonist and the emotions that the game is not afraid to stage, together with the feeling of conducting a real investigation, won us over. Not to mention that in some situations you can choose different approaches that influence the development of the story. Don't expect alternative endings though, because the results will always be the same, but the sense of freedom helps the player step into the shoes of a special agent with a lot of doubts and decisions to make. Finishing the two episodes is easy, every seasoned adventurer will have no problems in this sense and after two hours he will have reached the finale. In this case, however, it is the journey that counts, and in any case there are a couple of complex puzzles that will leave a good memory. But above all, each puzzle is consistent with the context of the story. Of course the cast is superficial. Apart from Erica Reed and Cordelia, the supporting actors are uninspired and only sketchy. The developers still have to work on this. The more dynamic scenes such as the prologue and the ending of the first episode are excellent, even if we understand each other: it is always a question of moving the little hand and pressing the finger, but the situation makes us forget that we are faced with a classic point and click. On this the game performs well, above all thanks to the use of powers, stimulating and skillfully inserted into the game structure. Only the technique is not up to the narration: the characters drawn in comics are appreciable but the animations just enough, as well as the backgrounds. It goes a little better in the second episode but the result is still below today's standards. This won't bother fans too much, while microloads, especially when moving around using the map or starting a dialogue, are a thorn in the side. Whatever action you take, expect to see the pointer turn into a circle for a few seconds. Pure hate. Smudges of a studio with few funds that redeems itself in a big way thanks to good ideas and the ability to implement them. Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller will make you feel something, we're sure. How many other video games can we say the same about? Erica speaks Italian on Zodiac If English isn't your thing, as always the edition on sale on Zodiac has Italian subtitles, even if you'll have to wait until March for them to be available. In the meantime, you can still buy the game and then download the Italian version as soon as it is released on the digital store.", "date": "2013-01-31", "grade": "7.5"}
