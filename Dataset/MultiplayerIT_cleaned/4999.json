Originating as a co-star in the underrated role-playing game Of Orcs and Men, in which he shared the scene with a large ogre, he landed his first ever starring role with the third-person action stealth Styx: Master of Shadows, initially scoring a failure. Over time, however, the game has recovered in sales, has gathered around it a good circle of fans of stealth titles and has become a cult object, celebrated as one of the few pure stealth games still left on the market. Obviously a sequel could not be missing: Styx: Shards of Darkness restarts from its predecessor and tells a new story starring the goblin Styx, a very skilled thief capable of infiltrating any place by exploiting the shadows and his innate abilities. Hired for a simple theft, Styx finds himself embroiled once again in a story bigger than him, together with a group of dissidents from the anti-goblin special force S.T.R.A.G.E., whose motivations are initially mysterious. We won't reveal anything else about the plot, apart from that it gets very tangled in the advanced levels and that, as in Master of Shdaows, it turned out to be more interesting than we thought. We have reviewed Styx: Shards of Darkness, the new stealth starring the cunning and poisonous goblin The stealth system As we said, Styx: Shards of Darkness is a pure stealth game, which shuns contamination with other genres, especially shooters. There are actually some role-playing elements, like the skill trees where you can spend the experience points you've accumulated by beating levels and reaching some secondary objectives, but in any case these are upgrades to Styx's stealth skills, or the his ability to prepare useful gadgets to get out of trouble. Crashing after such a spectacular jump can be a satisfaction The levels are scenically spectacular Of course, the first two levels (out of four) of selectable difficulty also provide for the possibility of facing enemies, but the combat system is clearly a patch, not even particularly successful (so much so that to test the game as it was designed, we deactivated it immediately by raising the difficulty). Styx is very comfortable moving in the shadows and taking advantage of the ravines of the levels to achieve his goals. The wily goblin has at his disposal a series of incredible abilities, many of which have already been seen in the first chapter: he can silently sneak after enemies, whistle to attract them, slip under tables, inside crates or wardrobes; he can use roof beams as platforms, extinguish torches to create dark areas, jump on someone to kill them. If necessary, he can become invisible, clone himself, melt corpses with acid, plant mines, poison food with his saliva, use darts for quick and silent kills from a distance and much more. The game system actually rewards the most skilled players, i.e. those who manage to pass the levels without killing anyone or leaving behind as few corpses as possible. It's not easy, but it can be done, even if the urge to kill someone from behind to slit their throat is really strong, especially at the beginning (you know, for the love of experimentation). Styx has various ways to eliminate his victims in a stealthy way: he can deliver a rapid blow that lands them immediately, with the risk, however, that the screams will attract someone; or he can take your time and shut up the bad guy's mouth, to eliminate him faster and cleaner. Obviously it's important not to leave the corpses lying around, otherwise you'll end up setting off some alarms and warning the whole level. There are several ways to clean up the crime scene: throw the bodies into the sea, from the sky or from any height under a vacuum; use chests and cabinets to cram them or dissolve them in acid. The best way does not exist and the possibilities vary according to the situation. In case of need, you can also decide to place them in some dark corner without worrying too much. But what would a stealth system be without a dark/light detector? Don't worry, in honor of the Thief progenitor, Styx is equipped with all the gadgets necessary to survive, including a special power called ~Amber Vision~, which allows him to highlight opponents, interactive objects and others that, when touched, produce noise. The crime scene The whole system of the game is magnified by the excellent construction of the maps. The levels are closed, but they are also small masterpieces of design and allow the player very different approaches: there is always a main road innice view, but turning around you find niches to hide in, side passages, ropes to climb on the roofs, ducts that connect critical areas and so on. Studying the levels is very important, especially if you want to achieve all the secondary objectives. Styx's dead jokes are hilarious The levels are very intricate and full of passages In fact, each mission assigns Styx main objectives (for example to falsify a flight plan or obtain a permit for a certain area) and other optional ones, such as tearing up a certain number of posters, collecting gems, or finishing the level within a certain time. . It is in particular the latter that favor exploration and force the player to work harder. Exploring also allows you to find more materials useful for the construction of Styx's gadgets (to make them he must take advantage of the work tables scattered around the levels or those of his shelter), the use of which is necessary if you want to survive. Normally a production like that of Styx: Shards of Darkness does not stand out for its graphic richness. The previous episode had a functional technical side and nothing more, but here Cyanide has taken a big step forward in terms of awareness of the means at his disposal, building a series of architecturally fascinating and scenically spectacular scenarios. Yet looking at the individual objects it is noted that the general quality is not so far from that of Master of Shadows, despite the use of the Unreal Engine 4. What is excellent is in particular the visual construction of the levels, much more open in spatial terms (it's not an open world, let's clarify): they range from cities built on stilts erected in bays surrounded by large rocky outcrops that stand out against the light on a flat and livid sea, where we crawl illuminated by the moon and by the light of torches, passing elven cities carved into towering mountain tops, reachable only by airships or balloons. An airship itself is transformed into a level that is played completely suspended in the sky, where there is no shortage of extreme passages in which you find yourself hanging in the void attached to some rope or in which you have to jump and risk falling below. Mind you that we are not talking about actual level design, which we have already dealt with, but only about their scenic impact. The 3D models, apart from those of the main characters and some creatures encountered in the advanced levels, are of decent workmanship and nothing more. Styx of his own, however, is really well done and particularly amusing, especially from the past. In what sense? Well, every time you die, and it often happens, the goblin appears on the screen and addresses the player, addressing him with some jokes, such as an invitation to swap roles, given the demonstrated incapacity. In short, it's worth dying just to feel offended by the green creature! Artificial intelligence The biggest problems come, needless to say, when you start to carefully observe the behavior of the enemies. Unfortunately the artificial intelligence of guards and the like has some problems. On the one hand it is true that everyone seems to have very good eyesight and notice changes in the scenery (going out torches, opening doors and so on), but on the other hand they react in an often limited way, probably so as not to make it too difficult to continue . To kill or not to kill, that is the question Suspended in the void We tried the game on the third of four difficulty levels, which has the only simplification, compared to the hardest level, to guarantee free saves. This is to tell you that we tested the maximum intelligence expressed by the CPU. The direct approach is always, rightly, penalized and, when we were singled out, the enemies left us no way out. To be honest Cyanide has also introduced some nice touches that deserve to be mentioned, such as the AI technique of spreading out to look around a corner from which we booed, so that it cannot be taken by surprise, or the reactivation of the extinguished torches, which in some cases can also be used as decoys. On the other hand, however, some behaviors are not particularly realistic. On the contrary: on some occasions the enemies behave like real idiots. For example, on one occasion we tried to lure an enemy by briefly flashing Styx. We made ourselves followed by slipping into a door and then behind the jamb. Arrived at the door, the guard looked around, did not enter and, after a few seconds, left declaring that there was nothing. To which we booed. It came back doing exactly the same thing and forcing us to change tactics. In an altOn this occasion, two guards found the body of one of their buddies and set out on our trail. We managed to get around them and killed one on the sly. The other, instead of continuing to look for us, declared us fugitives and, after saying that she would watch every move, returned to her post. Fortunately, the positioning and number of enemies compensate for the defects of the artificial intelligence: often the defense forces are impressive and are placed in such a way as to control each other. In advanced missions it becomes very difficult to continue without being discovered, especially when you don't know the map. Of course, the ingenuities remain, but the challenge is raised to the right point: Styx: Shards of Darkness is a difficult game. The inevitable bugs Unfortunately, on the sidelines of the examination of artificial intelligence, we are forced to report that of the bugs that plague it, some of which have literally made us furious. The most common is characters getting stuck (we've posted a short clip in the review to show this). The ways to achieve the goals are different In some situations it is convenient because they become very easy to overcome; in others, however, they greatly complicate life, sometimes making it impossible to achieve goals. In what sense? Well, imagine you don't want to kill anyone and find an enemy stuck in front of you, impossible to overcome without knocking him down, perhaps with a dart. Sure, getting completely stalled is rare, also because it's often possible to go around blocked enemies, but the annoyance of having to change your path because of bugs remains, especially in complex maps like those of Styx: Shards of Darkness. There is also the possibility of reloading the game, but with the risk of not having saved for a few minutes and having to redo long pieces of the level... moreover, sometimes reloading doesn't even solve it, given that for inscrutable reasons the bug can re-occur identically. Then it should be considered who plays at the highest difficulty level, where he cannot save: what does he do, every time he starts over? Or give up some goals? Surely the developers will fix these bugs, which, it must be said, do not prevent you from moving forward in the game, but in the meantime, know that they exist and what effects they have on the gameplay, which is dirtied. For the rest we didn't have major problems with other bugs, glitches and the like: some bodies that fell in absurd positions, corpses that didn't want to be hidden in the boxes and little else. However, nothing compromising on the overall experience.", "date": "2017-03-14", "grade": "8.0"}
