{"name": "Eroi a cubetti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96644-3d-dot-games-heroes-eroi-a-cubetti.html", "text": "3D Dot Game Heroes is a very particular and decidedly atypical action role-playing game in the current market, with a gameplay that recalls, among the many citations contained within it, above all The Legend of Zelda by Nintendo. Developed by Silicon Studio and produced by From Software, this action role-playing game is characterized by an ~ancient~ style but at the same time paradoxically fresh and appreciable in its classicism, with a game structure that presents the old, dear freely explorable map, the sub quests, the characters that populate the kingdom with whom to interact for a joke or to start a secondary mission, the right dose of irony and several quotes starting from the plot. This tells of a two-dimensional kingdom called Dotnia, which after a great period of splendor due to the large influx of tourists who visited the country attracted by the legendary figure of the great Hero, the one who defeated the evil King Onyx who had brought tragedy and darkness to the area by stealing six magic globes, he finds himself in dire economic straits. Worried, aged King Tezro decides it's time to switch registers and upgrade everything to 3D. In the dimensional passage, however, it happens that the evil Fuelle steals a crystal ball inside which the Dark King of the legend is imprisoned, threatening to free him from his eternal condemnation. Only a new Hero of Dotnia, destined to retrace and repeat the deeds of his illustrious predecessor in the fight against evil, can save the kingdom. As can be seen, the plot of 3D Dot Game Heroes is not at all serious and indeed, as further confirmation that it is rich in ironic content within the adventure there are, during the dialogues, many good-natured teases, not only old classics, but also new ones or real characters that revolve around the varied world of video games. From programmers to producers, up to the player himself, often targeted even by the goers of an inn, who enjoy teasing him by emphasizing his errors or other aspects related to his actions. Heroes, schoolchildren, princes and princesses... The protagonist of the adventure is the one who is simply called ~the Hero~, but if you want you can also use another of the available characters, with more or less magic/health points than the first, depending on the characteristics, such as the Prince or the Princess, the Scholar, the Ancient Hero or one of the many that the player can create by himself with the appropriate editor. The latter is quite rich in content and allows you to reconstruct its shapes by choosing colors, appearance, poses and so on. When loading the saved game, among other things, you can resume the adventure each time with a different character if you want. Since 3D Dot Game Heroes is a two-dimensional RPG seen in three dimensions, its game system does not differ at all from the genre titles that inspire it: by ~guiding~ the character, the user then moves around a map with a pseudo visual -isometric, exploring fairly large areas which, however, given the very structure of the gameplay, do not compromise too much the degree of general interaction, in search of objects, quests to complete and puzzles to solve. Furthermore, as in the old action role-playing games, there are characters to talk to and locations to revisit several times since these perhaps require new abilities previously not possessed in order to be fully explored, and which in many cases then allow you to reach areas initially inaccessible. In these situations, minute after minute, new opportunities continue to open up in front of the player and images of situations and levels similarly savored with the ubiquitous The Legend of Zelda flow indirectly in one's unconscious. Especially in dungeons, the exploration of which always offers new reasons to wander inside them, despite showing some slight dips in tone in a handful of occasions in terms of design. In search of some hidden object or particular enemy, however, one must pay attention to the soft floors, traps, defense mechanisms and obstacles, before then reaching the inevitable boss, when present. Playstation 3 trophies 3D Dot Game Heroes offers the player 51 Trophies to unlock. They are divided into 13 Bronze, 1 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum, plus 34 Secrets. To obtain them you have to satisfy the product's requests during the campaign, such as killing a certain number of enemies, perhaps using a specific weapon, or leveling up a sword. And still maximizing the magic, unlocking some secrets and completing the story. Heroes cubed Clashes with the latter, howeverDespite the limits imposed by the very structure of the title which causes enemies to attack according to predefined patterns, they are characterized by a degree of difficulty that should not be underestimated. Huge in size, each equipped with a set of customized moves, to be defeated the monster bosses need a certain attention not only in discovering what their offensive tactics are but also in understanding what their weak points are to hit to knock them down. The weapons available for the enterprise are several: ranging from the boomerang to stun enemies to arrows up to various types of swords that can be upgraded in length, size and strength. The latter then have a peculiarity: when the character controlled by the user uses some power-ups or has the energy bar at maximum, they become decidedly larger and more devastating in power. Weapons, objects and all the rest, when not recovered around, can be purchased as tradition imposes for the genre in the various shops of the kingdom, usually spending the gold recovered from the chests scattered around the world or from killed enemies. Speaking of the latter, which are quite varied in number and type, they can be ~registered~ in a special game bestiary as new ones are discovered. At the end of the adventure you can finally start the game again with part of the equipment obtained in the previous play. If you have had the patience to read the article up to here, you will certainly have understood by now that the charm, degree of involvement and fun inherent in 3D Dot Game Heroes is useless to look for in the folds of the technical specifications. This means that it is better to forget the polygonal complexity and the quality of the textures of the new generation consoles, between edges and three-dimensional pixelated shapes that make up objects and settings that permeate the play areas, similar to many compositions created with Lego. But frankly thinking otherwise would have been absurd, given the type of product. However, anyone who is able to make the effort to observe the graphics from a broader point of view, contextualized to the project and therefore, why not, from the artistic side, will be able to enjoy an authentic small show capable of truly captivating in its own way. If the settings offer a good variety, even in their cube-like simplicity and without frills, it is undoubtedly in the representation of the characters that the graphics have in some ways surpassed themselves by managing to give an aesthetic sense to each of them, and even a soul, despite the limitations of the squared style above. As far as the sound is concerned, in addition to the typical noises that underline the various actions performed by the characters and by the enemies encountered along their path, taken by ear from the classics of the 80s genre, we have a sequence of pleasant midi that make up the musical accompaniment and which in many cases seem to be clearly inspired by old RPGs like the first Final Fantasy.", "date": "2011-12-15", "grade": "8.5"}
