{"name": "Assassin's Creed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed_a.html", "text": "Assassin's Creed is without a shadow of a doubt one of the flagship titles of this end of 2007 on consoles. But as we are now more than accustomed to seeing, video game manufacturers often tend to add editions for mobile phones to the ~major~ versions of their products, within a market that is obviously in sensational expansion from every point of view. In the specific case of the Ubisoft product, the wireless edition was entrusted to Gameloft, now more than used to this type of effort. Anyone who has followed the development of Assassin's Creed even from afar will certainly have understood the basic characteristics of the game; in a nutshell, it is a question of impersonating Altair, a mysterious assassin, crossing levels in search of his objectives, only to then be able to escape from the scene of the crime without being captured by guards and enemies of various types. Among the strengths of the home console editions, the lion's share undoubtedly goes to the graphic component, sumptuous and capable of reproducing the cities of adventure in an exhilarating and immersive way within the medieval setting of the times of the crusades. Obviously this is not possible on mobile phones, and Gameloft has chosen to adopt the now classic action/platform ~mold~ that it has used so often in recent times. And so Assassin's Creed in this edition loses much of its peculiar characteristics thus becoming a fairly banal game, even if it was made with the usual care of the transalpine team. Basically, therefore, it is a question of crossing levels by working in numerous stunts and evolutions, like the Prince of Persia to understand each other, trying to avoid the many traps scattered along the way. The control system on such occasions proves to be well studied, and while using several keys it is rarely confusing; this also thanks to contextual keys, i.e. that modify their function based on the action required at a given moment. The combat system is also good, especially for the variations linked to special actions that can be performed which increase the variety and dynamism otherwise degraded by a rather mediocre artificial intelligence. In this sense, the situation is slightly better during the clashes with the bosses to be assassinated, which require some more effort; however, after having had the upper hand, one certainly cannot relax since it will be necessary to escape by exploiting the architecture of the buildings or relying on one's trusty horse, in the latter case through a mini-game with a top view, to tell the truth, not particularly exciting. From a technical point of view, however, there is very little to complain about, and even in this case Gameloft confirms its great ability and ease in the use of 2D on mobile phones. Excellent animations, levels with good variety and well structured are enriched by a high detail and a more than convincing use of color. The sound accompaniment is also good. PRO Fun Technically excellent AGAINST The usual Gameloft action/platformer Modest artificial intelligence Long repetitive", "date": "2007-11-06", "grade": "S.V."}
