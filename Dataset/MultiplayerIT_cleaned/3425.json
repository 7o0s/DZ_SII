{"name": "INMOST", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/inmost-recensione.html", "text": "The Apple Arcade catalog continues to expand, and INMOST's review demonstrates how the growth of the digital platform dedicated to iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV appears varied, unconstrained compared to a mainstream interpretation of videogame experiences. A convoluted tour of words simply to tell you how the new adventure developed by Hidden Layer Games is a different product than usual; starting with the introduction, where the difficult theme covered in the game is revealed and users are invited to enjoy the experience using a pair of headphones and a Bluetooth controller. This last suggestion soon turns out to be particularly apt, because if INMOST has a defect it must certainly be identified in the touch controls, which appear unresponsive, slow and imprecise, preventing the characters from performing the most trivial actions in the times and in the required ways from the game to avoid annoying (albeit harmless) game over. This is not a small problem, in fact, because it cuts out an important element such as portability: if you don't have the necessary setup, it's better to wait for any updates that can fix things before downloading. Story, characters and gameplay INMOST puts us in command of three different protagonists, whose bond is revealed only by progressing in a campaign made up of thirty levels. We have a little girl who has to use tables and stools to reach the platforms, a man who can jump and roll when necessary, and finally a knight armed with a sword and grappling hook, the only one of the three characters who can face the mysterious shadow creatures that roam the scenarios. In a persistent darkness, illuminated only by the light of some lamps, we will find ourselves solving increasingly multifaceted environmental puzzles, which involve the activation of switches, the discovery of objects and tools, the demolition of walls and doors. It's not always crystal clear how to proceed, but you just need to stop and think for a while to arrive at a solution and find out what the narrative has in store for us. In many ways INMOST's gameplay is reminiscent of classics like Flashback and Another World : the management of the jumps and the use of the platforms is very similar, as is the subdivision of the locations into separate and independent frameworks. Some dead times end up dilating the duration of a story which in any case does not go beyond two and a half hours, thus betraying a mobile connotation that we imagine will not marry particularly well with platforms such as PC and Nintendo Switch, where the game will arrive by the end of the year. Brevity aside, the new Hidden Layer Games project manages to involve you right from the start, creating a very particular atmosphere, sometimes disturbing, but without renouncing to lighten the situations by introducing supporting actors or touches of class capable of snatching a smile. One of the first examples is the cat in front of the closed grate: we will engineer ourselves to open it, only to see him however undecided whether to go out or not. The graphic style used by the developers is a pixel art in shades of grey, blue, green depending on the moment: a visually captivating solution, which manages to decisively characterize this adventure, hand in hand with an essential but effective audio sector, embellished by a very well interpreted narrative voice.", "date": "2019-10-19", "grade": "7.9"}
