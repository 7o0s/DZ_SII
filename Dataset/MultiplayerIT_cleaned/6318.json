The epic of Cecil, Rosa, Kain and the others possesses all the best qualities normally associated with the series: the fantasy setting, a great love story, a charismatic antagonist, a world crisis, magic, evocations and characters well distinct both in characterization and in battle capabilities. It is therefore not surprising that it was one of the first Final Fantasy to have a real sequel. Released in Japan for mobile systems in the now distant 2008, Final Fantasy IV: The After Years was later brought, via WiiWare, also to the rest of the world. The sequel to the jRPG that made history in 1991 was received lukewarmly: in fact, it recycled many assets, proposing an episodic story that left fans of the saga with a bitter taste. Subsequently, the two games were collected in a revised and corrected compilation for PSP, considered by fans to be the best edition of the ~bilogy~. Now that both Final Fantasy IVs have landed on Steam, let's take a look at how best to play them. Final Fantasy IV: The After Years deserved more than a lackluster iOS conversion Generational transitions In 2007, shortly before the release of The After Years, Final Fantasy IV had also landed on Nintendo DS with a real remake that further divided audiences and critics: some did not appreciate the three-dimensional revamp that clung so much to Yoshitaka's ethereal style Amano, but objectively that version of the fourth Final Fantasy was a little gem thanks to the addition of voice acting, dynamic cutscenes and the implementation of small and welcome changes in the gameplay. The same version was then brought to iOS and Android in 2012, enjoying some success despite the heaviness of an engine that is now more than ancient. A year later, Square Enix also decided to remake The After Years using the same graphics engine of the Nintendo DS prequel, developing it directly for mobile systems. That is precisely the version also released for PC these days, and the weight of the years is felt all the way: just like the very first two-dimensional edition recycled the sprites and assets of the original Final Fantasy IV (or rather, of its conversion for Game Boy Advance) also this The After Years heavily reproduces the same polygonal models and the same textures of the prequel for Nintendo DS and mobile operating systems. Unfortunately, it's also a bit of the story's fault: set seventeen years after the epilogue of Final Fantasy IV, the new story focuses on a new generation of heroes who will join the old to thwart a supernatural threat that threatens to destroy the world . The central pillar of the new cast is Ceodore, the son of Cecil and Rosa who begins his adventure as a cadet in the Red Wings of Baron, eager to prove his worth in order to emerge from the prestigious shadow of his parents. His initiation rite will coincide, however, with an attack on the kingdom of Baron, brought by mysterious and lethal enemies. This version of The After Years is also divided into a dozen episodes that each focus on a different group of characters, until they are brought together in the last chapters of the adventure. Unfortunately, this is a questionable decision that breaks the pace and the feeling of progress: every time a new chapter begins we find ourselves controlling characters who practically start from scratch, temporarily devaluing all the time dedicated to leveling and grinding in the next chapter to improve our combat skills. To reunite the cast it will be necessary to wait several hours, and this ups and downs in terms of progression makes itself felt a lot, above all because the combat system, an old-fashioned Active Time Battle, is initially rather dull. I do not want the moon The mechanics introduced from the first minutes of the game are, in fact, quite irritating. In essence, The After Years forces us to take the phases of the moon into account, as they affect our effectiveness in combat, but also that of the monsters. During a full moon, for example, black magic becomes more powerful, while the effects of white magic remain unchanged, but physical attacks do half damage. Therefore, every time you face a fight, you have to keep these variables in mind, fortunately illustrated in the interface, but in some cases, especially in the more demanding dungeons, it is necessary to manipulate the passage of time, even by sleeping in inns, if you want to survive up to the boss on duty. Consequently, the alternance of the lunar cycles soon becomes more artificial than strategic. On the other hand, a pleasant addition is the group attack system, which involves multiple characters with special and sometimes spectacular animations. Unfortunately, however, the fights are very slow even by changing the speed in the options screen, and the inconstant frame rate soon becomes very annoying, also because The After Years certainly doesn't move who knows what graphics: indeed, we were forced to play it in a small window, because in full screen and at maximum resolution the ancient cosmetics of the game are a real eyesore. From this point of view, the conversion of Square Enix really leaves something to be desired. The absence of dubbing, for example, is a real tragedy: some narrative sequences fall into absolute silence, and it is not possible to skip them, forcing us to watch the crude polygonal models who gesticulate or open and close their mouths until the end of what should be a joke and maybe we finished reading several seconds ago. Fortunately, when the music is there, it's a delight but Nobuo Uematsu fans will immediately recognize the recycled tracks and the qualitative and stylistic difference with those of his replacement composer, Junya Nakano. Dulcis in fundo, so to speak, this version of The After Years lacks the chapter entitled Interlude, present in the PSP compilation, which served as a bridge between the two Final Fantasy IV, and all the content extras, such as some bosses exclusive.", "date": "2015-05-22", "grade": "5.5"}
