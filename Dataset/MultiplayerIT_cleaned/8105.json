Millions of gamers buy ARMA2: Combined Ops on Steam and not just to play it. The success is resounding, all the more so if we link it to the fact that the Bohemia game had had limited success and was previously appreciated by a very small community of simulation military shooter enthusiasts. When the unknown Hammerpoint Interactive announced the development of The War Z, the assonance immediately aroused some suspicion. But when they explained that it would be a zombie-based MMO survivor, all doubts were dispelled: it was a blatant attempt to exploit the success of DayZ by making a commercial title. We speak in the past tense because the present has turned out to be much worse than anyone might have suspected. After all, there is no shortage of clones in the gaming industry, but a nice mold is certainly not enough to cook a good cake. Now, let's try to clarify some other points. In the world of game development, words have a pretty precise meaning. When we talk about an Alpha version of a game, we mean a build that is playable from start to finish, with the entire game system implemented, which however needs to be tested and which does not have all the assets. After the Alpha comes the Beta, i.e. a complete and tested version of the game, which still needs various bugfixes and some modifications. We specify it to make the discussion clearer and because we are now talking about Alpha and Beta versions a bit at random. For example, following this general rule of The War Z not even the Alpha was made available, because starting it it is clear that the game system is incomplete in its fundamental elements, the most advertised ones to sell it. The problem is that the developers themselves talked about a public Beta when they opened the servers in October, while now, after all the controversy due to miscommunication of what they were actually selling, they say they released an Alpha and that they want to use a similar selling method to the one Notch pioneered with Minecraft. Starting the game, however, it is clear that there is still talk of open beta. Obviously there is someone here who doesn't quite understand how certain words work, also because the version of the game is 0.9.9, which is almost 1.0, a number that should indicate the first release considered complete. At this stage The Waz Z should be considered finished or almost finished, with only a few bugs to fix. Instead it is a disaster of colossal proportions. In short, we seem to find ourselves in front of a new Orion: Dino Beatdown, of which a paid pre-alpha version was released, passing it off as finished, then converted by the developers into Alpha to justify themselves in front of the users' anger. Undead joke But let's try to play, come on. Will it be that bad? At the beginning, a fateful question immediately arises: what to do? To survive? Go hunting for the dead? Looking for a bush to hang out in? The truth is that the purpose of the game is not clear and neither will it be moving forward. There simply weren't any goals implemented. Instead of the promised persistent world there are servers for up to a hundred players. The map is large, but, as we shall see, to no avail. FOUR HOURS!?! At the beginning we have a flashlight and some supplies. No weapon. We soon find out that the weapon is the flashlight. Alright, we think, the map is vast, there will be something to collect around. After several hours of play we can tell you that we have not been able to find anything useful in the various locations visited, except on very rare occasions, if not zombies to avoid or beat up. The only way to get items without too much effort is to steal them from the corpses of other players, perhaps by attacking them from behind after making them believe that we are collaborating with them, or to buy them by spending in-game money or real money. Here, let's remove the tooth: The War Z is a money-sucking machine. Each object costs a lot in terms of game currency, represented by experience points, to the point that to make purchases you have to kill real armies of zombies, an activity which, as we will see, is neither simple nor practical. All that remains is to spend money. The paradox is that there are free2play titles, i.e. freely accessible, that are much more honest from this point of view. It's true that everyone requires spending sooner or later if you want to remain competitive, but here we went too far, especially by virtue of the fact that the game costs money and paying doesn't really offer anything in terms of equipment. But maybe it's worth it, that is, we can buy a weapon and have fun going around the map to slaughter the undead. The problem is that you killkilling zombies is a frustrating activity. There are many of them and they seem to be placed at random. With the flashlight it can take a minute to slay one on the head, but it doesn't get much better with weapons like maces and the like. Firearms fare best, but are also the hardest to obtain. The problem is, there's no point in asking to kill the dead if there isn't a single reason to do so. The accumulated experience, as already mentioned, can be used to buy items... and that's it. The promised skill system hasn't been implemented, so even if you carry out a massacre, you don't level up or improve anything. I zombie, you zombie But let's talk about the poor zombies: they are all the same, they are very badly animated and continuously fit into the scenario to the point that the best tactic to kill them is to look for a narrow and steep staircase to obtain the funnel effect. Poor souls, they are almost pitiful in their uselessness. Luckily they have bugs on their side that help them eliminate characters. For example, they often manage to score shots even if the player is at a certain distance, while their random location creates areas that are impossible to overcome without being overwhelmed. Theoretically there should be a stealth system to go unnoticed, but there are no precise references of how it works and from our tests we have verified that crawling or running produces the same result in terms of attracted attention. In short, it is likely that the ~stealth system~ does not actually exist and the two bars at the top right that represent our visibility and noise are just decorative tinsel. Luckily there are player killers to spice up life and make the game expire completely. The developers came up with a brilliant idea - everyone can kill everyone. Translated into gameplay it resolves to: ~player with shotgun kills all players with flashlight~. In short, some go around and enjoy massacring newcomers, who are completely defenseless against this form of cyber-bullying. Unfortunately we are talking about a very frequent phenomenon that ruins many games, to the point that more times you are killed by other players than by zombies. It often feels like playing a nasty zombie deathmatch! What about the developers? So far they have done nothing to stem the problem. The respawn time to wait after each death must also be added to the penalty: four hours. Yes, you read right. Previously, you could go back to the game after an hour, but we see that few immediate respawns were sold in the shop and then the times were lengthened. So now every time you end up at the creator you have to wait a sixth of a day to reuse the same character. It is true that up to five can be created, but it is equally true that often you find yourself with your favorite character out of the game and if you don't have enough time, each death becomes an incalculable disaster! The war is up to you Graphically The War Z is really bad. To many it seemed like a reskin of War Inc., another free2play title from the same company, but at least the game system is there. Basically we are not against the recycling of models, but here it has really gone too far! In reality, looking at the graphic elements created specifically for The War Z, one can say that it would have been better if they had recycled everything: very washed-out textures, three-dimensional models poor in detail and frankly ugly, glitches everywhere and animations that make you put your hands in your hair (if do you still have). Hey hi, I'm a bug! Even the sound is of a rare ugliness, with often uncoordinated effects and audio that skips for mysterious reasons. Not even the style is saved, since we don't believe there is anything more generic and since the map is a jumble of different places put together just to make a scene. Mountains, lakes, military bases, cities: everything looks alike and nothing can be saved. Especially when you enter the interior, bare beyond belief, you understand that they were built in a hurry on standard models. We honestly don't understand how some can claim that The War Z captures the atmosphere of the zombie apocalypse well. The truth is that there is no tension wandering around the maps, as the zombies come as no surprise in their suffocating slowness and general uselessness (not for nothing do PKs ignore them completely focusing only on killing other players) . Hey hi, I'm an interpenetration of two identical zombies! If desired, it is possible to group up with the other players and face the dangers together (theoretically we are talking about a cooperative game), but it is not clear why and to achieve what. In short, in our opinion we are offacing a complete disaster, but we'll talk about that in the comment... ah no, wait. We were almost forgetting: the cheaters! Never seen a title with more cheaters than The War Z! Someone is surely thinking that the cheaters are not the fault of the developers. True, but it is the developers who should prepare anti-cheater systems to limit the phenomenon and practice mass bans where necessary. Instead all this is not happening with The War Z, where the only ones banned are users who try to complain about the pitiful state of the game they paid for.", "date": "2012-12-20", "grade": "2.5"}
