A puzzle game doesn't actually need a big story as a premise for the action, indeed mystery usually reigns supreme in games of this genre. The important thing is to follow the great basic rule of puzzles of this type: with the association of shapes and colors, the elements must disappear from the screen. The physical law underlying this procedure will always remain a question mark, but what we are interested in knowing is whether this mechanic is implemented well in this Tumblestone as well. It is a structure that has always remained on the crest of a wave but has recently received a big relaunch thanks above all to the global success of Candy Crush and derivatives, therefore it is a sort of established standard for the puzzle game, a mechanic that triggers a response almost innate in any type of gamer. Tumblestone is obviously based on this ~cultural baggage~ but it cannot be said that it does not put something truly original on the plate, starting from a basic story mode but still able to characterize the game world to a minimum to get to the significant differences in gameplay that emerge as you progress through the levels, when modifiers come into play that can significantly vary the trite dynamics of color association. Such a title would probably find its maximum expression on mobile platforms, but it is not difficult to get caught up in long sessions even in front of the TV and the free diffusion through the Games with Gold in July 2016 obviously represents an irresistible attraction to include Tumblestone in your game collection on xbox one. Tumblestone is another match-3 puzzle game, but it offers something new Iridescent structure Basically, Tumblestone works like a sort of reverse Tetris, with the need to free the areas of the game from the presence of colored bricks by making them disappear through color associations in groups of three. The blocks are fired from the bottom up, which actually suggests an upside down version of the famous classic by Alexei Pazhitnov, even if the basic mechanics are basically the same, being focused on clearing the space through the association of compatible blocks. Only in this case it's about colors instead of shapes. The developers have presented this game as the first original action puzzle for 15 years now: it is certainly hyperbole, which probably should also be understood in an ironic sense, because it is a rather heavy statement considering the amount of titles of the kind that are on the market. On the other hand, one can expect this type of communication from a team called The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild. Yet there is something true, because the way Tumblestone plays with its own rules, continuously disassembling and rebuilding its structure according to new variations that are imposed at regular intervals throughout the Campaign, is something that is not easily seen in a puzzle of this type. The developers have elevated the use of modifiers to a real art of gameplay in this game, removing too fixed reference points and thus preventing the risk of monotonous drift, classic match-three puzzle game, forcing the player to rework his strategies to get through the levels, especially as he progresses through the story mode. This feature is probably the greatest strength of the game, thanks to which it manages to stand out against an otherwise too thick competition. A real brain teaser The first levels may seem too simple and the control system, which simply requires you to select a column and launch the block with a keystroke, helps create this impression, but it's really only an initial suggestion because the game soon proves to be particularly challenging. To complicate everything there are the modifiers, which act in various ways, for example by blocking the launch of bricks, changing their arrangement on the grid or the color, making some of them invisible and so on for an enormous amount of different possibilities, which may arise even simultaneously in more than one within the same scheme. Each level has its own particular procedure to be followed in order to be solvedor and until the solution is found, it is possible to find oneself trying it several times. Considering that the same is repeated every time, it is clear how the player is stimulated to treasure previous experiences and understand in this way how to avoid mistakes and get to the bottom, but this is not always valid. Within the route there are occasionally particularly challenging and multiple tests, which function as bosses at the end of the area, which require you to solve several puzzles in succession, which are proposed at each attempt in a random way, which prevents you from preparing a strategy preventive and forces each time to adapt on the spot. This, coupled with some inconsistencies in difficulty balancing, can often lead to crashing on some levels with the obvious frustration that can easily emerge from the situation. It is possible to free oneself using tokens that allow you to skip the levels sharply, but these are present in very limited quantities during the game, therefore the need to repeat some moments for a long time is practically a certainty. Xbox One goals 28 achievements for the classic total of 1000 Gamerpoints is the loot offered by Tumblestone. A large part of the achievements is linked to the progression in history and to certain performances to be completed, therefore the complete collection is long, considering the generous dimensions of the game's Campaign. Angel Face Considering that the Story consists of over 300 levels spread across 11 worlds, getting to the end is a remarkable feat. Fortunately, there are various game modes that can further vary the action, even if the organization of these has some obscure points. The online multiplayer allows you to try your hand at various modes against three other players, human or managed by artificial intelligence, trying to solve the levels before the others or complicating the plans of others while solving the puzzles within our level. In an unshareable move, these modes prevent the use of modifiers that have not yet been unlocked in the Campaign, and considering the length of the latter it can take quite some time to get to be able to take advantage of the full tools in multiplayer. The problem can be circumvented with the Party Mode which makes all the elements of the game available, but in this case the online experience, the accumulation of experience and the possibility of completing quests and objectives are cut off. Another questionable choice is the fact of having put the Arcade mode, containing three other interesting game modes, in a DLC to be purchased separately. Considering that Tumblestone itself already costs 19.99 euros (apart from the free Games with Gold offer, of course), which are quite a lot for a puzzle game of this kind, the fact of having to shell out another 5 euros to be able to modes that look like they've clearly been pulled from the full game don't seem like a very good idea. On the technical front, Tumblestone is obviously a title without too many pretensions, as befits a puzzle game set entirely on gameplay. It's a title that would fit perfectly on mobile platforms but its extreme simplicity and clarity make an excellent impression even on the largest screens, where if nothing else the coherence with which the bizarre and humorous world is represented, populated by strange characters and blocks colored, it is pleasant, enhancing the game action without the graphic elements being too intrusive.", "date": "2016-07-20", "grade": "6.8"}
