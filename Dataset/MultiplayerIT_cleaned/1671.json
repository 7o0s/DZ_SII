{"name": "Warrior Kings: Battles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warrior-kings-battles-2.html", "text": "The sign of the years In short, at the first start of WKB everything seems to be absolutely identical to what the Black Cactus showed us a year ago. The graphics engine looks identical, the voiceovers in Italian are identical, the units are identical, the pitch is identical after a year any barely sentient being would expect at least a small cosmetic improvement, which goes beyond a tweak of the textures . Everything is damn same, you have to do the same things, you have to make farms to feed the armies and you have to protect settlements, villages and so on. In the face of the Ministry of the Environment you will cut down forests, you will drill the ground to look for gold and you will break every single stone, because if you break a stone you get more wood (?? Don't look at me, I didn't design it Warrior Kings ). Now you have made your impressive army: 6 cross-eyed archers, 12 spearmen armed with pointed bamboo poles and 3 horsemen riding crippled nags... Your Brancaleone army is ready, the only option you will have is to seek out your enemy to do so leap from its fetid den and for the purpose you decide to move your men using the beautiful WKB formation system and what happens? The 6 magnificent archers begin to go round in circles, the 3 knights get lost in a ditch from which they can no longer get out, the infantry decides to take a shortcut, through which they end up in the middle of the enemy camp and the opposing soldiers start play squash with the heads of your heroes. Thirty seconds later this sad massacre, a screaming horde of Bedouins unaware of any formation or marching order described in the game manual (and then they speak ill of the AI), tramples every single blade of grass on your elegant lawn at the English, which you had built with so much love by your trusted subjects, right in front of your noble residence, which is now ruining miserably in flames. Game mechanics I'm not really an RTS veteran I admit it, but despite this I often had the impression of being faced with very simplistic and monotonous patterns of behavior (of the enemy AI I mean). The much-vaunted 70 different personalities, against which you should measure yourself, limit themselves to varying the units they send at you and the frequency. Everything else has already been seen: while you build and build the computer it torments you with a multitude of never-resolving attacks, with the sole purpose of making you lose your patience. He ignores formations and generally never feels the need to leave his castle except to annoy you. In short, you will never see him building garrisons around the map or anything like that, he will not lure you into sophisticated traps and during sieges he will never close the gate of his castle, making siege towers a superfluous tool. Basically everything you saw in Warrior Kings you will also see here apart from one thing maybe the plot. In an era in which even the soft-core industry tries to give its films a shred of appeal by hooking a plot to it and the films of Michael Par and Steven Seagal no longer sell as they once did, because they completely lack the aforementioned, essential, raw material, the sequel to a title like Warrior King should have had one, perhaps small and almost insignificant, but still a common thread to justify the action. The consequence of this gap translates into the total absence of dialogues, cutscenes and final sequence (oops! Maybe I shouldn't have told you...). The consequence of the consequence is a sensation of superficiality, of total lack of depth, of being faced with a ~data-disk~ rather than a real sequel. Good news from the front But Warrior Kings: Battles also has merits: all those who were thrilled with the first release of the Black Cactus title will now find 22 more missions to try their hand at, with the extreme convenience of not having to learn a new command interface since that of Warrior Kings worked quite well and was kept the same in WKB. Furthermore, for all those who wish to submit their computer to Freudian tests and examinations of conscience, the game provides an AI editor, so that you can build customized enemy personalities and then beat them with a stick (Dr. Freud would already have the white hair for the implications that this could entail in terms of transference, but here I digress), but leave out the level editor that everyone has been waiting for (even if Empire promises that it will beavailable soon). The other innovation of WKB lies in the introduction of the game mode called Valhalla. In practice it is a revised and corrected skirmish mode, where you will remove every management component from the game and fight exclusively with armies pre-packaged by you in a preparation phase, where each unit is purchased with points that are made available, cute. New warriors In short, I hope I have given you the picture of the situation, WKB is a title for Warrior Kings fans and for those who have never tried Warrior Kings. Apart from a slight refresh of the textures, there's not much here that points to a real sequel. In the second analysis, we understand the reason for the title ~Battles~: in fact, here we just lead ourselves, no story, no glue, nothing at all. The main element is the battle, and the choice was to focus all attention on the essentials, leaving very little room for details. We could have expected a little more after all this time, at least a renewed graphics engine and not the usual tweaking of textures. Even the audio sector doesn't come out very well: the music is beautiful and engaging but they are the same as those of the first title, even the dubbing of the units is the same as in the old Warrior Kings, a sign of a very heavy use of the material already 'in the studio'. Well, I'll stop here for now, but to understand this title even better in the coming weeks you will find specials (or ~focus~ if you prefer) dedicated to individual features of Warrior Kings Battles, so if you want to know more you are warned, keep an eye out watch the network. Pros: It's still Warrior Kings One of the few fantasy RTS out there Cons: Lacks depth No level editor Some Warrior King bugs recur in this version Where the story begins After a century of dynastic contrasts and various popular uprisings, the fantasy world of Orbis, deprived of a throne for the second time, plunges back into the nightmare of war. After this very original incipit you will realize that this time the chaos is total, with no one to guide it, the world of Orbis has fragmented into 22 independent provinces and you will have to conquer them all and place them under your control. The day of a future king is not as rosy as you might imagine, no concubines in scanty clothes ready to dive into a tub full of milk to wash, no monumental castle with dungeons full of screaming political prisoners, no throne rooms crammed of treasures with which you can amuse yourself during the long and somewhat boring afternoons of royal idleness. Things don't quite go like that in Orbis and you find yourself with provinces to conquer, about seventy other pretenders eager to kill you, a building that looks like a stable and a population of ragged peasants who always, always and always repeat the same things. Do you seem to feel a feeling of deja vu? As you will see, you are not wrong at all. The first sensation you will feel as soon as you start the executable is that you have made the wrong cd, inserting by mistake the one from the first Warrior Kings.", "date": "2003-04-29", "grade": null}
