The problem with the Rising Sun games, however, is that however well done they may be, they always take (at least) a few months before arriving in the rest of the world, and when they do get there they are mostly translated into English only in the texts. Furthermore, they are niche titles, both for the topics covered and for the game design choices, very often not very similar to the tastes of western palates. Among these there is certainly Dungeon Travelers 2: The Royal Library & the Monster Seal, produced halfway between the dungeon crowler and the JRPG developed by Sting Entertainment. This is the second release of the To Heart 2 series, released in Japan in March 2013 on PSP and in September of the following year on PlayStation Vita. More than a year later, the new version also arrives here, thanks to the English translation and some censorship that has lightened the sexual references. Yes, because as often happens, also in this case from the land of the Rising Sun we have received a title with a rather anonymous gameplay, but overflowing with properly undressed, busty girls and situations between erotic allusion and total senselessness. The sexy monsters of Dungeon Travelers 2 also come to the West on PlayStation Vita Fights between damsels Dungeon Travelers 2: The Royal Library & the Monster Seal takes us to the kingdom of Romulea, threatened by an invasion of monsters that are seriously jeopardizing the lives of its citizens. To repel the invading army, however, it is not enough to defeat them, but their essence must be imprisoned to prevent them from returning to office again thanks to the powers of the Demon God. In this regard, an alchemist has created a book that acts as a seal, entrusted to the hands of Fried Einhard who from the shelves full of the Royal Library found himself traveling throughout the kingdom in the role of monster hunter. To put it this way, the monster hunter seems a rather unpleasant and dangerous task, especially if faced alone, but in a short time it turns out that the truth is quite different. First of all, our Fried will find himself facing sensual girls with ever-increasing powers scattered in the various dungeons of the game world, and secondly he will not be the one to fight in first person but will make use of the support of equally undressed traveling companions, ready to go down to front line to face the enemy head on. In short, as you may have easily guessed, the fan service is the master and the only constant to accompany us along the dozens of hours of play, will be beautiful scantily clad girls often portrayed in spicy situations, also because the plot itself is really negligible and little intriguing. The recruitment of a large cast of heroines represents the keystone on which all the gameplay is based and allows you to give a minimum of depth to party management, thanks to the use of varied mechanics to be exploited to the fullest during the clashes. These work in a rather traditional way, with turns alternating between the two sides and the possibility of using an attack, a spell or an object for the benefit of oneself or of the companions. In perfect JRPG style, while exploring the dungeons we would suddenly be attacked by new creatures, with clashes that could see us outnumbered and force us to develop new strategies. As per tradition, farming and the improvement of our party will play a fundamental role, especially in light of the articulated growth system of the various characters. PSVita trophies Dungeon Travelers 2: The Royal Library & the Monster Seal is giving away 31 trophies of which 15 Bronze, 10 Silver and 5 Gold to which the inevitable Platinum is added. Many are related to the unfolding of the main story and the achievement of specific objectives of the campaign, while others require you to take down a certain number of monsters, level up your party members and improve your equipment. Problem dungeons At level 15 there is the possibility of assigning a second class to each character, effectively enhancing a characteristic of the main one: for example, if we have a Fighter hero, this can become a Paladin if we increase the defense and buffs for protect your companions, or a Berserker by betting everything on physical strength. In this way each character can play a specific role in the composition of the team, even if by playing and experimenting it has emerged that some classes are preferable to others, giving a substantial advantagetial in clashes. Magic, for example, has an advantage over physical strength in Dungeon Travelers 2 and this applies to attack but above all to defense; there are bosses who with a single spell have managed to kill half of the party members, but by developing the skills to silence them, the damage has become manageable. In addition to leveling, equipment and gold are also very important, which you get from killed enemies or by selling useless items. In fact, the dungeons are littered with chests, but there are very few interesting things to collect and the loot system is quite repetitive. The Sealbook instead collects the seals of defeated monsters that can be used to obtain upgrades or be sold to obtain large amounts of money. Among these the seals of the bosses are worth much more, but they can also be equipped directly on Fried to buff all party members. If the combat remains pleasant without inventing anything new, exploration is the least well-finished part of the Sting Entertainment title, accomplices repetitive and badly balanced dungeons with extremely easy areas followed by sometimes frustrating difficulty peaks, and a general game pace that is too slow which forces you to spend a lot of time before unlocking the complete team and starting to feel effective. On the technical front, the title has two faces: on the one hand there are the static screens regarding the history and the interface of the fights, made in two dimensions that cleverly exploit the quality of the PlayStation Vita display with colorful and well-defined manga-style drawings ; on the other hand there are the dungeons, to be explored with the first person view which highlights low resolution textures and a general paucity of the game environments, problems resulting from the previous development on the PSP. It should also be noted that the game is entirely in English in the menu texts and subtitles, while the dubbing is only in Japanese, and that some scenes in the original version have been censored in the Western conversion for too explicit allusions to sexual acts and practices.", "date": "2015-10-19", "grade": "7.0"}
