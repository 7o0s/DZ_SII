{"name": "Crimesight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crimesight-recensione.html", "text": "The figure of Sherlock Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty is one of the greatest sources of inspiration within all media. Between films, TV series and video games, we have seen countless versions of the London detective, whether they are ~faithful~ reproductions of the character created by Arthur Conan Doyle, or more or less original alterations. However, there is one characteristic that certainly cannot be omitted, in creating a ~new~ Sherlock Holmes: he is a detective and loves solving murder cases. Whether he does it to defeat boredom or because he is driven by a moral imperative, it matters little, the important thing is that he doesn't let a criminal slip away. It's the same thing in Crimesight too, even if in this case we don't have to talk about a real detective in the flesh, since the protagonists of this PC game are artificial intelligences who collide even before the crime has been accomplished. To find out all the details, just continue reading our Crimesight review. AI vs. AI The Crimesight mansion is a chessboard Crimesight, unlike the typical Sherlock Holmes game, is an online PvP detective game. Each player (from two to four) takes on the role of a detective who takes the part of the Artificial Intelligence Holmes or the Artificial Intelligence Moriarty, within a game that takes place in a villa, divided into a considerable number of rooms . In this mansion, a group of people got trapped by a storm. Help is on the way within a few days, but there's a problem: one of the characters is a murderer and has decided to kill one of his companions. The Holmes have the objective of finding out who these two people are, while Moriarty must be able to put a weapon into the hands of the culprit and must make sure that he is alone with the victim in a room, without witnesses. The entire game takes place in turns, with a limited number of moves. Holmes have one more way to act than Moriarty, but Moriarty has one advantage: if he forces a movement on a character controlled by a Holmes, he gains priority and cancels the opponent's move. At the same time, however, this confirms that this character is not the target of the murder, given that Moriarty cannot control the victim (it would be too easy in this case to move the victim into the same room as the murderer). So why not keep all the characters nearby and in groups at all times? The main problem is related to the fact that the characters need to search the rooms (by selecting pre-positioned glowing dots) for food, to feed themselves at the end of each day. Without food, the PCs become fatigued and eventually stunned, and their ability to prevent a murder is minimal. Indeed, every non-victim and non-murderer is our greatest defense and must be kept healthy. However, most of the bright spots do not provide food and, on the contrary, often assign a weapon, so even the Holmes could involuntarily put the tool in the hands of the assassin that will lead him to victory. Will you stop the killer of Crimesight? Or will you help her? There are various ways to find out who is the murderer and who is the intended victim, but the most effective is Sherlock's analysis, activated automatically at the end of each day (ie every three shifts). The detective tells us if the criminal and the target are within three squares of each other and, in this way, rules out a whole series of combinations. From phase to phase, therefore, we have the opportunity to discover some additional information and reach a conclusion, provided that Moriarty does not feel safe and activates the ~aggression~ command of the assassin, who then tries to approach the victim to eliminate it, moving automatically depending on the movement of the latter. If in this case he fails (for example the victim has moved too much and the criminal does not have enough movement to keep up with her), automatically only one turn remains, during which the identities of the two characters are revealed and Moriarty has only one attempt to win the match. We know that reading these words it is a bit complex to understand how Crimesight works. The best way to imagine it is like a sort of strange chess game, where in each turn we can move only part of the characters a few squares and our aim is to ensure that the villa is explored in search of resources to survive, but at the same time without the PCs being too far apart, as this risks giving Moriarty an opportunity to attack. Of course, the whole thing goes completely reversed if the player is the bad guy in the situation. Strategy, not deduction In the rooms there are points with which to interact to obtain resources Crimesight does not require real deduction skills, since the game takes care of the logical connections and always signals for each character which are his possible victims and which are his possible aggressors. What he wants is attention and planning. The way to play also changes a lot according to the number of players: if it's three against one, each Holmes has only one move, while the single Moriarty has two. In the end, it's still a three moves versus two moves game, but it's clear that three allied masterminds won't follow the same plan every turn and could get in the way. Basically, it is possible to communicate through a series of stickers: we can indicate who we want to control, where we want to move it and we can also suggest that, in our opinion, a certain character is the aggressor or the victim. However, this ping system is also visible to Moriarty, who hides among the detectives. If we think we know which player is the intruder, we can deny communications so that he doesn't see our stickers. We can also block communications to our allies, send a sticker only to our suspect indicating that we will perform a certain action (lying of course), to then reactivate communications only with the other players and indicate to them the real move we planned. If we have seen correctly, we can therefore confuse the opponent's ideas. In 1vs1 this problem does not exist, of course, and this mode is probably the most interesting, since we have more control over the strategy from start to finish, if you don't have the opportunity to play with a group of friends to chat with vocal (which guarantees a little more organization and forces the intruder to try to confuse ideas in a more direct way). Quality vs Quantity Crimesight is translated into Italian Crimesight, in a nutshell, is an interesting and well-executed idea. The main problem right now is that the content is very limited. There is the 3vs1, the 2vs2, the 2vs1 and the 1vs1, which slightly change the way in which one has to think about the movements, but on balance it is always the same modality. The maps are few, but above all they are practically all the same: the specific layout of the rooms changes, but the way in which you have to play is identical. There isn't a real PvE, if not some tutorials that fortunately explain well how to play and prepare us for online. Our doubt is how long it will be able to entertain its community. We have the impression that a small group of expert fans will be created who will play Crimesight for a long time, but a good portion of players will enjoy themselves for a handful of hours and then realize that each game is more or less identical to the previous one. If there is a strong and intense post-launch support (unconfirmed for now), Crimesight could flourish, but otherwise it could shut down in a few months. Finally, we specify that the game is translated into Italian.", "date": "2022-04-22", "grade": "7.8"}
