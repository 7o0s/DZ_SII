A title that is also a suggestion, and an invitation, to what awaits us in the psychological horror developed by We Create Stuff. Horror, but also thriller, as we will discover tape after tape, patient after patient, reconstructing a story that has the flavor of conspiracies and at the same time creates scope for a potential sequel. An idea that, we do not deny it, teases us because the game in question is made up of various souls, overall amalgamated with each other enough to offer a pleasant adventure and only in rare parts drawn out for long. In the shoes of the psychologist Desmond Wales we will have to look for the truth in the most fascinating and dangerous place of all: the human mind. To do this we will need above all our ingenuity, because the fundamental component of the game is the step-by-step resolution of puzzles so that we can get to the bottom of each box, as well as the general picture of the events, however there is no shortage of action sequences that soften the horror experience - making it less scary than it might lead to believe. In Sound Mind is undoubtedly a particular horror, which is not really scary and often cancels the sense of tension with the firefights, reminding us in this sense of Get Even, also with a strong psychological imprint. Nonetheless, there is no shortage of elements and situations that can at least leave us on edge, precisely because we don't know when they will recur and, when they do, they hit the mark, bursting our bubble of presumed tranquillity. Let's find out in the In Sound Mind review how the game runs, tested on PS5. Story of a psychologist and his unfortunate patients In Sound Mind, Desmond's office is the point from which to revisit patient sessions In Sound Mind puts us in the shoes of psychologist Desmond Wales, who suddenly wakes up in the junk room of his apartment building with no idea what's going on or how he got there. To make the situation even more disturbing is the fact that the building appears totally uninhabited: the more we explore, the more it becomes clear that we are the only ones in there but, at the same time, we are not really. A mysterious figure, whose presence we occasionally catch in the corridors, persecutes us as a professional stalker, sometimes sabotaging us and more often using one of the numerous telephones scattered around to make fun of us or threaten us. We have no idea who he is, yet we know for sure that he blames us for the tragic fate of some of our patients: in fact they were treated by Desmond, only to meet their fate, and it is by listening to the sessions with them again that we will try to make light both on the trauma that took them to the extreme, and on our involvement in the events. If it were simply this, however, In Sound Mind wouldn't have too much reason to be a horror: instead reliving each patient's sessions takes us to a parallel reality where we will be constantly tormented by their shadows (understood as the Jungian concept of all those tendencies, characteristics, desires, attitudes that are not accepted by the ego). Shadows that have taken on distorted traits and will try in every way to eliminate us, tormented to the point of not hearing any reason. And yet, the more we examine the cases, the more we realize that something is not right, that despite obvious psychological discomforts, our patients were not reduced to the point of doing what they did; this is where In Sound Mind takes on more thriller connotations, throwing us into an investigation that takes shape cassette after cassette, collecting clues until we have the general picture of the matter - the red thread that ties together seemingly unrelated cases. To these two traits is also added the action component, both against common enemies and against bosses, which will see us use the most varied weapons: from the classic pistol to pills and even a device to alter frequencies. How these things succeed to make sense in the gameplay, it is discovered by progressing with the adventure. The We Create Stuff game is not afraid of overlapping multiple genres and at times this makes itself felt a little too much, although overall it manages to weave a plot with the right potential to push us to the conclusion and a playful development that follows hand in hand with the evolution of the narrative. A gameplay divided between horror, thriller and action In Sound Mind, the shadow of a patient who is not too happy to see us Our main task is to figure out the reasons why our patients have met their fate, whatever it may be, while making sense of the inexplicable situation in which we find ourselves. Access individual sessionsni requires several steps: first of all, locate the apartment where the people in question lived, recover the audio cassette (it feels strange to write it but the game is set in 1997) and bring it to our studio to physically enter the recovered session. The progression, in this sense, is such that we cannot choose the order of patients to be examined since each level will provide us with a specific object to move on to the next apartment. In Sound Mind therefore follows a specific path, leaving us a minimum degree of freedom when it comes to exploring the condominium in search of objects and enhancements of any kind; even in this case, however, several areas will only be unlocked if we are in possession of the right equipment, prompting a discreet backtracking if you want to collect all the appropriate objects - specifically, these are mostly pills that enhance statistics of Desmond if accumulated in quantity. Beyond exploration, In Sound Mind is one of those horror games that does not leave the protagonist at the mercy of his unfortunate situation but, on the contrary, provides us with various means to counter the constant threats. From the most common shadowy creatures, which emit curious metallic noises and have a light instead of a face which indicates their various states (unaware, suspicious, aggressive), to Shadows with a capital O, those who represent our patients and are in fact the bosses of each level. We must admit that, after the first and partly also the second cassette, the game takes on a slightly too marked action drift, eliminating the sense of tension and at times fear that especially the meeting with the first patient had accumulated. For scenario construction in general, the first level is certainly the best while the following ones, although ingenious in some respects, gradually give way to an overpowering, even frustrating, action. The developers certainly wanted to enliven the resolutions of the puzzles, which make up most of the experience, so as not to end everything in a long section of walking interspersed only by encounters with the bosses. However, the feeling is that they got too carried away and, thanks to the fact that the enemies are of only one type with very slight variations on the theme, in some moments it transforms into a small shooter by canceling the tension. In Sound Mind, using the mirror as a weapon and support ensemble is a great implementation From the point of view of the puzzles, nothing to say, they are well thought out and varied enough not to fall into redundancy. We especially appreciated the introduction of key objects in each level, which represent the main element to solve it and subsequently prove to be useful also in the rest of the game. Let's take the example of the mirror fragment, recovered during the first session: not only does it allow us to keep an eye on the boss, reflecting its shape even through walls and solid objects in general, but it also highlights all the other objects and reveals itself often essential for finding solutions to puzzles throughout the adventure. The same thing can be said for the following ones, which we will not reveal to you. Once they have served their purpose of the reference level, they prove invaluable for continuing and also in backtracking, allowing us to access more areas of the apartment building - consisting of three floors in total, including the basement. They are ingenious ideas that convey the sense of progression in the game well. If less emphasis had been placed on the shooting phases, instead going to fall back more on these special objects also to face enemies, In Sound Mind would have benefited. Once a level is completed, it is possible to return to it to recover any objects left behind but , and it's a choice we didn't appreciate, you have to do it all over again. We will be deprived of the key object of that session (for example, the mirror fragment) and we will have to go through the same ordeal as the first one again, including the boss, only better equipped. While it makes sense enough, since we're rewinding the tape to relive it again, it also becomes unnecessarily cumbersome to replay the session just because we missed a pill or two. Especially since we have given peace to the individual Shadows, it makes little sense (even in the distorted game world where very few things make sense) for them to be around again. Replaying a couple of them has, if nothing else, served to make us realize that not all of Desmond's improveable stats are so necessary: lives and resistance are the most useful ones, while stealth is quite negligible considering that with common enemies you always go face to face to face and with ibosses often reward more escaping than trying to sneak past them. Artistic and technical sector In Sound Mind, the mannequins are creepy but deep down they have hearts of gold Artistically, In Sound Mind offers good scenarios that are enhanced above all by the level design and the often ingenious passages to access the different areas. The graphics are decent, nothing more, while the sound is very good both from the point of view of the music tracks and the individual environmental sounds, which try to build tension where the action phases tend to dismantle it. On a technical level we have noticed some uncertainty, with occasional moments of stuttering, minor bugs and one quite felt (which has gone to our advantage but is still a bug) and above all frequent crashes in the second and third levels. Considering that the game relies on autosave, redoing the same area over and over again isn't exactly ideal. In Sound Mind is certainly an experience that stands out for the ingenuity of some situations, and for the constant importance it gives to every single object without letting it end up in oblivion, while from a technical and artistic point of view it doesn't particularly stand out. Finally, there is no trace of DualSense: its functions are not exploited.", "date": "2021-09-27", "grade": "7.0"}
