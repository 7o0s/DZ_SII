In fact, it is the first time, at least in recent years, that the life cycle of an old COD continues in parallel with the most recent chapter, a symptom that Treyarch has really become the prodigal son of the American giant. On the other hand, it is the Black Ops that have kept the name of the series high and this new DLC is a fitting tribute to one of the funniest extra modes ever. Zombie Chronicles brings eight remastered zombie maps, but at a price that is not exactly competitive. Will there be enough irons in the fire to justify it? New lights, new polygonal models and HD textures: what more could you want? A competitive price! Stand alone The first thing that one wonders when looking at this commercial operation with a critical eye is how much the choice of proposing a DLC after almost two years from the launch of a Call of Duty can be interesting and satisfying for players. The community has already moved on to the new chapter (the sales speak for themselves) and many may even have sold Black Ops III in favor of one of the giants released in recent months. It sounds strange then that Treyarch comes to offer these new eight maps as additional DLC and not as stand-alone content, a choice that perhaps could have attracted a few more enthusiasts and which perhaps would have also guaranteed greater freedom in development. Zombie Chronicles. in fact, it limits itself to doing the homework, proposing the old locations without altering the design, proposing the same spawns of the enemies, the thousand shortcuts available or the easter eggs. The gaming experience is exactly the same as a few years ago, albeit with slight variations on the theme. The package opens Nacht der Untoten, where it all began, a map that presents an effective structure, almost elementary in its construction, but which reveals the backbone of a brilliant idea. It is patient zero, that simple and no-frills map from which the virus has spread, infecting every other single iteration but which represents the true beating heart of the whole experience. It's wonderful to rediscover a map of a few square meters, where we will be constantly besieged by zombies in a context that brings back many memories for veterans. Everything is as we remembered it and this feeling, this pleasant sensation also occurs on the other maps present, aesthetically improved with new textures and effects, embellished by a new lighting system as well as enhanced by more refined polygonal models. Not having had to work on new features, Treyarch was thus able to dedicate itself to reinvigorating the technical sector and the progress made is evident, especially in older maps such as Shi no Numa or Verrukt or the aforementioned Nacht der Untotenma but also Black's Kino Der Toten Ops and Origins of Black Ops II shine in a new light. There is only one thing that is out of place in all this amarcord and it is Treyarch's will to keep the Black Ops III arsenal also for the maps set in the Second World War. We will thus find ourselves handling the guns of this last chapter rather than the usual weapons, which slightly lowers the difficulty curve and will force you to revise, albeit slightly, your plans for completing the adventures. Then of course also the Gobblegum, the Wonderfizz vending machine and all the other bells and whistles added with the latest iterations of Zombie (including micro-transactions) for a result that is perhaps too loud and confusing. Not easy this zombie However, the fact of arriving on the servers after more than a year also has some advantages. There is no doubt that the zombie mode is complex, intricate and difficult to complete so much that you often have to rely on guides and tutorials to find all the hidden secrets but on the servers currently there are mainly veterans and we have noticed that finding valid companions, having a good familiarity with the mode and the ~new~ maps is much easier than in the past. Our advice remains to approach the production in voice chat with three other friends, so as to fully enjoy this DLC which also comes embellished with a reinterpretation of artificial intelligence, aligned with the aggressiveness seen with the Black Ops III zombies. The package is therefore clear and the contents crystal clear, it remains to be seen if you will have the desire to shell out the beauty of 29 euros to take home eight remastered zombie maps, a price in our opinion reallyro too much for the work done. We're not saying that the experience has failed but we are still talking about a content that is almost ten years old at worst, now being revived on the new generation of consoles. Of course, Activision has now accustomed us to the standard of 15 euros for four maps plus a new zombie map, but we continue to think that the market has evolved a lot in recent years and that publishers must necessarily try to adapt to titles that offer the same content at much lower prices and triple A productions that now cost practically as much as this DLC after a few months of launch (let's take Titanfall 2 as an example). Our advice is therefore to recover this package later if you are a nostalgic super fan, perhaps waiting for a 50% balance or a promotion to get more Zombie Chronicles codes at the same time to share with your fellow adventurers.", "date": "2017-05-22", "grade": null}
