We tried it several years ago, in a guise that could already be considered almost complete, only to end up in a whirlwind of alterations and delays that even made us fear for its existence. Funcom continues to exploit Conan the Barbarian's license as best it can and the choice to produce a coop roguelite, which loudly recalls the structure of titles such as The Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon, derives from the awareness of having to differentiate as much as possible the offer to maximize the barbarian's presence on the colorful public. We finally had the opportunity to review Conan Chop Chop albeit with a big lack that makes it really difficult to give a complete judgment on the work: the cooperative mode. The game is almost entirely based on the idea of being able and having to play in groups, up to four, both locally and online, but the search for matches has practically never worked and for this we find ourselves giving you our considerations having tested the title mostly solo. The power of irony Conan Chop Chop: 4 player coop is the real must The narrative premise of Conan Chop Chop is nice and suitable for the title in question. He takes full advantage of the barbarian's lore and throws us into a tournament organized by Thoth-Amon with the excuse of giving eternal glory to the warriors who will take part and who will survive. As it is easy to expect, it is all a hoax and the only will behind the creation of the initiative is to get rid of Conan and his faithful travel companions. Whatever the motivation, what matters is that we are ready to launch in the fray in search of the four guardians who keep the main door sealed which leads to the conclusion of the challenge. Nothing simpler. A sketchy, but nice premise, played on irony and light-heartedness that goes hand in hand with an artistic style and a comedy staging. On the other hand, Conan has always been a saga that takes itself seriously while remaining punctually close to the absurd, without wanting to set itself up as a great moral and historical reflection. On the other hand, it is true that the purists of the barbarian could turn up their noses at to the total desecration of the universe of Conan and Hyperborea, the historical setting that is the background to all the lore of the barbarian. A fun roguelite, without blowing your mind Conan Chop Chop: Boss fights are exciting It's when you pick up the pad and dive into the fray that Conan Chop Chop really shines with how fun it can be. The base is the one we know well from years of raids in this genre. You start a game by choosing your hero among the four available, you face procedurally generated room after room, trying to advance as far as possible to reach the bosses and related rewards. Once you are inevitably killed - especially when you start with little more than nothing at first - you start over with the same or another character, keeping only the currency useful for unlocking new equipment. If in recent years you have dealt with titles such as Hades, currently the greatest exponent of this idea of roguelite, then you will certainly have understood what we are talking about. Exactly like the Supergiant title, Conan Chop Chop also focuses on immediacy, without however neglecting the depth of a progression which remains a fundamental element of the player's perception of progress. It is probably on this aspect that the team has worked most carefully. Mind you: everything remains simple, intuitive and designed not to require the use of a massive percentage of gray matter; but this does not exclude an interesting depth in the builds and situations that we will be able to experience. Already the division of the four heroes plays an important role. Everyone tends to push in a specific situation and if it is true that with Conan you could find yourself faced with a very malleable character and ready for almost any bad weather, Pallantide is instead more addressed to brute force, even at the cost of his own mobility. During each run you will acquire gold - with which you can buy items from various vendors in special rooms discovered during the progression - as well as the metal which you will keep even after your death and which it will be possible to spend to unlock new weapons, armor, and perks. Once one of these has been unlocked, it will be possible to see it delivered almost everywhere both before the start of the game and during the game itself. Conan Chop Chop: Vendors can help build your build Also orEach game will give you experience points - in this case linked directly to your account - which when you level up will give you a point to spend on the branches of the four heroes. Again, nothing particularly original, but everything in the name of immediacy and intuitiveness. You can choose to enhance a single character first by adding new special abilities, new resistances or simply increasing life points, as well as distributing everything among the various alter egos. The fulcrum of the adventure remains the progression in the various areas, which we would have liked see better differentiated, while instead the algorithm of procedurality often tends to be conservative and to repeat similar rooms too often within the same locations. The choice probably derives from the desire to risk creating progress problems with a varied but careless level design. The fact remains that the repetitiveness in this sense risks hitting a little too early. On the other hand, the amount of enemies present is moderate, with a good variety in terms of attack patterns and aggression. In fact, parrying with the right timing and stunning the enemies becomes fundamental, especially in the most agitated situations, which we assure you will not fail to present before you. This detail becomes even more fundamental when it comes to the real bosses. Clashes in large arenas and against really fierce enemies, which will require dexterity, several attempts and, often, also having been smart and lucky enough to put up the most useful build to get you out of trouble. A barbaric cartoon Conan Chop Chop: There is no shortage of traps lying around here and there Conan Chop Chop isn't just fun, it's also an aesthetic gem. Obviously the style must still please and it is not said that the ~afterthought~ of Conan in this cartoonish guise meets everyone's favor. Nonetheless, the work done was commendable. We have not noticed any type of technical problem or lag in the PS5 version that we have reviewed and, in this sense, the refinement and cleaning work carried out by the team in this very long delay that has afflicted the release of the game suggests the attention paid to arrive on the market with the most complete version possible, both in terms of content and design.", "date": "2022-03-01", "grade": "7.5"}
