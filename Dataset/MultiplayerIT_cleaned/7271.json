The truth, as always, lies in the middle, because Teyon's puzzle game is one of the most ingenious and well-finished that we have ever played in recent times. Not that it shines with originality, mind you: after all, it's the umpteenth interpretation of the concept behind the legendary Lemmings. Obviously there isn't even a real story to justify our tribulations: from this point of view Robot Rescue Revolution is quite direct and explains in a few steps how to play, gradually accustoming the player to the various mechanics present in the levels. The basic idea is very simple: you have to bring a series of robots to safety, leading them from one point to another on the map. And so far, nothing new or particularly interesting. Everything changes when you put your hand on the joypad and realize that all the robots on the stage perform exactly the same movements. You move one robot one square to the right, and all others move one square to the right. This connection is the heart of the gameplay and the backbone of each stage: it is clear that to lead all the robots to safety it will be necessary to think across the board, focusing not only on one robot at a time but also on its mechanical companions, especially if they are present obstacles or mechanisms to be activated in the right order. If a little robot is blocked on the right by a boulder and we are moving in the same direction, it will happen that the other little robots will continue to move while that one will remain stationary and will start moving again only when we have chosen a direction free of obstacles. As you may have understood, this is a much easier mechanic to play than to explain, also because it relies heavily on the layout of the various maps and on visual cues. Which, at a certain point, causes quite a few first problems... Playstation 3 trophies Ten in total, divided into five bronze, four silver and a single gilded trophy. Most are quite simple and you'll unlock them almost without realizing it, but the silver ones and the gold one will take some work. Suicidal robots Robot Rescue Revolution is a graphically very pleasant title: despite its simplicity in terms of gameplay, Teyon has committed herself to designing very colorful maps full of animated and non-animated details. In a sense it was exactly the zeal of the Polish developer that caused us quite a few problems: leaving aside the heavy aliasing that makes the image rather messy since the camera is kept at maximum distance most of the time, just the abundance of visual elements, details and colors blends with the obstacles and traps that are increasingly common from stage to stage, making life particularly difficult for us when we think about the paths to take and we don't immediately notice that bomb or that laser barrier while the countdown flows inexorably towards game over. If the developers' goal was to put the player under pressure, then they succeeded perfectly, but mostly bordering on frustration. We can't help but notice the nonsense of the subdued and relaxing sound accompaniment, the perfect counterpoint to the anxiety it takes on some levels. It's a pity, because as the stages are completed - a hundred in total - the puzzles concocted by Teyon become increasingly complex and diabolical, arousing a mixture of esteem and hatred for the difficulty which, at certain moments, reaches considerable peaks . To accompany the single-player mode and its one hundred levels divided into various ~worlds~ there is also a nice editor, which allows you to share your creations with the community, and a multiplayer mode that could have been developed better, despite a whole series of new stages: in fact, it offers two types of gameplay, cooperative and competitive, but neither of them has particularly satisfied us. The competitive one, needless to say, challenges a player to save his robots before the opponent. The cooperative mode, on the other hand, divides the screen in two and forces the players to collaborate to save their robots: the problem is that the error of one of the two is enough to close the game and it often happens that you have to restart the stage and start over boss because there's no way around an obstacle if you haven't followed the solution scheme thought up by the developers. Robot Rescue Revolution is a colorful and ingenious puzzle game but not without its flaws", "date": "2014-03-06", "grade": "7.0"}
