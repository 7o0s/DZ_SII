And finally the fateful day has arrived: Grand Theft Auto V is finally available on the market in two versions for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. We played the first of the two for as long as possible, literally getting lost in the thousand streets of Los Santos and being enraptured by landscapes of incredible detail and a vastness that has very few comparisons in the videogame field. And we want to tell you immediately, so as not to waste any more time if you are not interested in reading and listening to our impressions: GTA V is a masterpiece of indisputable value for all that it is able to offer the player from the first moment on. which it is launched, until well after completing the main campaign. Obviously there are some small flaws that we will try to analyze in the course of this review, but it must be very clear from these first lines that every single flaw in the game becomes small to the point of disappearing in front of the incredible amount of content included in the package. And now let's get to the heart of Grand Theft Auto V. Every flaw in the gameplay disappears in front of the amount of content included in the immense GTA V The dog, this stranger After a handful of missions with Franklin, we will finally be able to get our hands on Chop, the trusty fighting hound that has been so publicized since the first announcements of GTA V. In reality, the big dog is a minimal accessory to the gameplay, since it will be possible to wear it go for a walk and perform some small pastime with him such as throwing him a ball to have it brought back. In fact, outside of the missions specifically designed for its use (such as those based on its nose), it will not be possible to use it freely in the course of other activities since at the beginning of the quests we will see it run away home. Chop can also be slightly buffed by teaching him new tricks, such as being able to sit or give us his paw using the free app for iOS and Android, iFruit, which will be released in conjunction with the game's release. With this we will not only be able to increase the happiness of Franklin's best friend but also customize the vehicles owned by purchasing the various upgrades without necessarily having to reach an in-game workshop. We will simply see the purchases delivered to us at home or we will find them already mounted on our cars. Those who do it themselves make for three Undoubtedly the most important novelty of the sequel is the presence of three protagonists, whose narrated events continuously intersect within the plot. Without wanting to risk excessive spoilers, it is enough to know that the three figures will move according to very specific stimuli, without worrying too much about stepping on each other's toes, when necessary to pursue their goals, but always well aware of the strange and strong bond that keep them glued to each other. Michael and Trevor in particular have a long history and an extremely troubled past in common. Franklin, on the other hand, will find himself in the middle, very often acting as a peacemaker between the two and trying to understand every single piece of information and trick known by his two friends, sometimes antagonistic. He is the youngest of the three, he comes from the ghetto and the color of his skin forces him to remain anchored to very specific life stereotypes but which he wants to undermine at all costs. As with CJ, the never-forgotten San Andreas character, Franklin almost wants to redeem himself, seek the rise in the criminal field to prove that he can move away from the horrific and ruthless gang wars to aim much higher and be recognized as someone who has succeeded to make itself. But where Rockstar has certainly been able to shine in the script is with the other two supporting actors. Trevor is the mentally ill, out of his mind, violent and ruthless, but with a strange respect for his family, not necessarily his own. Perhaps, in the long game path, it turns into a ~speck~ a little too soon since the player almost immediately realizes that every time he decides to control it he will go on simply crazy missions, governed by absurd tantrums of the character that lead him to slip even further into situations on the edge of reality. But narrative perfection is reached with Michael, the one who best personifies the anti-hero by definition of Rockstar: a small portion of Niko Bellic, a pinch of Tommy Vercettiand lots of inspiration from the latest cinematography. Former robber, saved from death and jail thanks to a shady deal with an FIB agent (it's not a mistake, it's the FBI in GTA version) eager to make a career, Michael will find himself forced to return to action even just to escape a family that is suffocating him, made up of a wife who cheats on him with sportsmen of dubious morality, a daughter who is even ready to become a porn star in order to find her fifteen minutes of notoriety and a son who apes that nerd figure eager to get out of the box that each of us, at least once, has thought of. In our opinion, Michael is the character that works best, the deepest and best told throughout the long main campaign. Franklin and Trevor sometimes appeared to us a bit forced in their behavior, especially at the beginning when the trio is being formed and a certain levity is perceived on the part of Rockstar in making them communicate in search of a common goal. But how do they work in terms of gameplay? In a rather simple way even if a little too guided as we expected with concern from the day of the announcement of this peculiarity of the sequel. Almost at any time we will be able to switch from one to the other protagonists, simply by holding down the down button on the directional cross and selecting the supporting actor to control. We will step into his shoes after a transition of a few seconds, finding ourselves in the middle of what he was doing. There are some exceptions: sometimes it will not be possible to select other characters for plot reasons, while during the missions we will be forced to remain at the controls of the character with whom the mission started, unless this also includes the presence of the other protagonists . In the latter case it will always be the game itself, in a very scripted way, that will allow us to switch from one to the other based on the situation, in some cases in an obligatory way (to carry out activities that allow the mission to go on) and in others leaving the player free to choose who to control. These are precisely the moments that work best, allowing us, for example, to control the driver of a vehicle during a chase and leaving the task of shooting at the targets to the computer, or vice versa we can choose to be the one to pull the trigger while it is the artificial intelligence running around the city. Out of the total of the game, this is a certainly lower percentage of cases than when we find ourselves at the controls of a single character for the entire duration of the mission and this is perhaps the only real missed opportunity of GTA V. We would have liked to be able to choose to face any mission with any of the protagonists, or even just the secondary ones by choosing to be accompanied perhaps by one or the other. It is also true that this possibility would probably have forced the developer to offer a more superficial and less precise plot in the narrative. They are details, it is true, but we are convinced that many GTA V players expected total freedom in the management of the three protagonists. However, that is missing here. The missions We know how much you love cold numbers, and here we are to give you an idea of the vastness of the game offer of this GTA V. The title contains 69 main missions, 42 activities related to sports and pastimes, 20 unknown and crazy characters, each with its own line of quests, 57 random events that can happen while you're wandering around Los Santos and 16 different activities that you can do within the game world, like going to the movies or paying a prostitute. GTA V also offers three different endings based on how you tackle the last, long mission and, for information, in our test we took 38 hours of gameplay to complete the campaign and reach 64% of total completion. And where does all this goodness come from? What is not lacking, however, is the possibility of dedicating yourself to a sea of activities that go far beyond the ~simple~ main campaign. Alongside the swarm of main and secondary missions that it is possible to tackle (we refer you to the box dedicated to the matter) there is obviously all that layer of extra possibilities that GTA V is able to offer while perfectly respecting the tradition of the series. It all starts from Los Santos, the huge playing area that the player will learn to discover slowly, during his long journeys by car or some other means of transport. But it is not only the urban agglomeration built with great fidelity on the basis of the main districts of Los Angeles that amazes, but also and abovethroughout the many areas surrounding the main city. We will find coniferous forests where it is even possible to go hunting, an international airport, a huge military base, even a scientific research center complete with satellite dishes and a plot of land dedicated to the collection of electricity through huge wind turbines. And then a vast rural area, an industrial center and the port, not counting rivers, sewer drains, mountains, lakes and a huge sea that surrounds the map and which can be crossed far and wide both above and below of its surface since in GTA V it is possible to swim and explore the depths of the sea both in apnea and perhaps after stealing a small single-seater submarine. But what really amazes is the attention to detail, Rockstar's incredible care in bringing all this ~geography~ to the screen in a credible way. Each area has its pedestrians, its cars, a precise architectural style, even the road surface changes and obviously the flora and fauna encountered change. Everything blends perfectly with an excellent artistic result that allows you to understand at a glance which area of Los Santos or the neighboring areas we have ended up in, even just by admiring the color palette used. You can literally get lost in the game map just because you want to wander around for an hour, constantly changing cars or motorbikes, jumping on a bicycle along the pedestrian walkway of a similar Venice Beach, or boarding a small plane single-seaters ready to jump with a parachute once they reach a considerable height to perhaps land on a beach and here steal a jet ski to jump on the waves of a sea that has just rippled due to bad weather. In fact, there are variable weather conditions and the complete day-night cycle in real time. Do you think that's all? Of course not since we've only just scratched the surface. As already seen in GTA IV, this fifth chapter also brings a smartphone that the three protagonists can access (with the gem of the three different models that represent the three alternatives that we really find on the modern market). And with this we will not only be able to exchange messages and emails with the other characters in the game but access the Rockstar version of the Internet complete with personalized Facebook and Twitter (LifeInvader and Bleeter), the financial markets where it is possible to carry out stock market operations and a number huge number of sites where you can shop online to have this or that model of plane, helicopter, sports car and weapon delivered to your home. With the inevitable developer's touch represented by a trendy tank or an exorbitantly priced limited edition exotic machine. Nothing is missing, and within the game world we even find billboards, television and radio broadcasts that often refer to each other, increasing the realism and credibility of the media universe set up by Rockstar to make Los Santos and the citizens who inhabit it. Playstation 3 trophies Grand Theft Auto V offers 50 trophies including three gold, six silver, 40 bronze and the ever-present platinum. As many as eleven of these trophies are invisible and related to some special actions that can be performed in a handful of single player campaign missions while there are already a considerable number of trophies related to the multiplayer of the game not yet available. During our session we managed to unlock about 30% of the total. Ok it's GTA, so you have to drive? Obviously yes, given that the basic gameplay is typical of the series: you wander around the city with the character you prefer, having total freedom to carry out one of the many accessory activities and when you are ready, you head towards a ~letter ~ on the map that corresponds to one of the main interlocutors of the story or to one of the many characters ready to entrust secondary missions to the protagonists. We witness the interlude sequence and in the majority of cases we find ourselves aboard some means, ready to head towards the point where the mission is carried out. The driving model is also quite faithful to tradition with vehicles that offer a minimum of variety in the management of physics based on their size and on how much they can be considered sports vehicles, with the exceptions in the case of aircraft and vehicles more ~strange~ ones such as submarines or jet skis which sometimes also offer peculiar controls. Having the previous fourth chapter as a reference, we probably notice an even more arcade nature of the vehicles, especially in the collisions", "date": "2013-09-16", "grade": "9.7"}
