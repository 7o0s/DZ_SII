{"name": "NHL Hitz 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-hitz-2002_a.html", "text": "The gameplay All those who like to make attack strategies, refined passes and the defensive bolt to block the opponent's strategies, must know that this is not a suitable title for them, in fact the normal strategy that was adopted in previous hockey titles is completely distorted, the matches will be played in a smaller than normal field, and the contenders will be only 3+goalkeepers, a lower number than the real ones, and which you will find in the HNL 2002 game. Understanding how to play this game is really simple, in fact it will be enough to pick up the XBox joypad to begin to feel inside the action of a game whose main keys are passing, shooting, and there will also be a key that will also allow you to punch your opponent, and in some cases you will also find yourself colliding with him in a boxing match on the ice (The developers have created a new sport :-)) During the matches as soon as your player's power reaches the maximum level, he will transform into a kind of demon (the form of the body does not change, but will be enveloped in flames and shocks) on fire with a hockey stick in hand, capable of transforming the puck into a very powerful globe of fire, which will allow you to make unstoppable passes and practically unstoppable shots. We will have at our disposal a vast number of teams, fields, players, and game modes, among which we will find the classic championship in which we will have to face 30 opponent NHL Teams, a mode in which we will have to take our team to the cup finals , and a modality that will be useful for us to gain experience and to develop our skills. The icing on the cake is the possibility of creating a personal team, in which you can create 11 players, of which you can choose all the details, in a very detailed and accurate way. The graphics and sound NHL Hitz is characterized by very detailed graphics with attention to the smallest details. There will be many types of players with different physical appearances and faces, and this is one of the first games where the audience is fully polygonal, like in EA's NFL 2002, and will react positively or negatively as the game unfolds; in fact, if we have to perform a spectacular action, or score a fantastic goal, they will stand up to applaud and cheer. Even the internships and protections are done very well, not to mention the effect made by the ice. It will also be spectacular to see the effects of the players and the puck when they reach their maximum power. The commentary that will be there during the games is not exactly the best, but it is compensated by the wonderful sounds of classic hockey games. Conclusions NHL Hitz is a game that has all it takes to become part of your collection, and if you are a hockey lover you will have one more reason to buy it, even if it will depend on the type of style you choose to play, in fact if you prefer a simulation game of this sport I strongly recommend you to buy NHL 2002, but if a touch of arcade and adrenaline amuses you and excites you, then you cannot do without NHL Hitz 20-02. Materials Cheats Pros: Great graphics The audience it is entirely polygonal The arcade style gives liveliness to the title Possibility to create a personalized team Cons: Not suitable for those who like simulation Hitz makes the difference Hockey lovers who will buy XBox will be able to choose between 2 titles of this sports genre, one of these is the perfect simulation produced by EA sports which Jokerit is dealing with, however we will deal with the second of these titles or that of Midway : NHL hitz 20-02, which differs from Di casa Ea due to its ~light~ Arcade tendency, which makes it more suitable for an audience that loves immediate and reckless entertainment. Let's go deeper into the subject with the following chapters of this review.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
