{"name": "WWE Smackdown! Vs RAW", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw.html", "text": "In the late 80s and early 90s, Japanese Catch and American Wrestling had become a fixture for viewers on Italian screens. By now almost everything was known about these two sports. In particular of today's WWE (WWF at the time) dozens of matches were broadcast on TV and words such as ~line up~, ~double flying kick~, had now become part of the common jargon of many boys. Then, for a whole series of reasons, including a generational change and a reorganization within the American federation, interest in this sport began to slowly wane, until the Italian public lost interest in the various Hulk Hogans or Macho Man. After a few years of absolute anonymity, things seem to have changed, and never as in this 2004 has wrestling gone through a period of such splendor and interest all over the globe, especially here in Italy. The success of the various satellite and TV broadcasts dedicated to it, as well as that found by the excellent sales figures for themed merchandising, sold out in live events in Italian arenas last year, are just some of the evidence of how wrestling is now returned to fascinate millions of Italians and especially our own teenagers. Not for nothing have the WWE managers decided to return to Italy this spring for another ~live~ appointment with their tour. With a similar premise, it was therefore easy to expect great interest also in those video games inspired by this ~sport-show~, just as it was understandable that in Italy there was a great deal of expectation for the umpteenth chapter of the THQ series dedicated to the ~fight free American, this WWE Smackdown Vs Raw, which promises to repeat the success of its illustrious predecessor, Here Comes To Pain. Summer Slam The game structure refers in a very marked way to that of its predecessor, Here Comes the Pain, and the genre could not possibly be otherwise seen, even if some technical additions make the latest THQ effort more complete than the aforementioned title. The wrestlers present are more than forty, equally or almost divided between the stars of the two WWE categories. We therefore go from Kane, Triple H, Randy Orton, Shelton Benjamin (the colored Intercontinental Champion) for RAW, to the various Undertakers, Eddie and Chavo Guerriero, Rey Misterio for Smackdown, to which are added a dozen unlockable legends of the past (among including The Rock, now almost permanently on film sets, to Bret Hart and Jimmy Snuka). Unfortunately, it should be noted the serious, in our opinion, absence of wrestlers loved by the public, even homegrown, such as the new champion of the World Team Tag Champions, Eugene, who won the title paired with William Regal, or that obnoxious Carlito. But wrestling is not a sport reserved only for men, and therefore the very famous WWE Diva's are also present in this product. Among them stand out some of the beauties of the WWE such as the splendid Canadian and busty Trish Stratus or the ~playmate~ Stacy Keibler. Note how game modes have been implemented that exploit the sensuality of these wrestlers, such as the one that involves matches where the opponent's defeat will be determined by the subtraction of her bra or shorts! Leaving the protagonists in fact in underwear. In the ring Although the control system is rather intuitive and the average level of difficulty is not very high, the possibility of performing an infinite number of moves with just a few Joypad commands (each wrestler has fifty types of moves, absolutely faithful to those used in reality by the athlete he represents) also makes the execution of the most spectacular movements easier, making the THQ title immediate and pleasant even to newbies of the genre. From this point of view, Smackdown vs Raw manages to excite and entertain from the very first matches, allowing anyone to try their hand at high-level technical matches. However, this should not deceive you that everything is simple. The AI of the opponents is quite good, and, in principle, it will always be quite difficult to pin an opponent athlete. As happens in real matches, it will be possible to repeat all the typical actions of a wrestling match, such as throwing the opponent against the ring ropes, throwing oneself from the support poles of the aforementioned, performing flying kicks, ~walls~ or asphyxiating holds and using objects of various types as a weapon, perhaps after knocking down the referee in order to avoid the countdown, subject to disqualification for impropriety. The game modes are several and intended to give the game an excellent longevity. Among these therepress to point out the brawl in the parking lot, the Battle Royal (everyone in the ring) and the excellent Career Mode which will allow you to experience, in the role of an athlete of your choice, all the backstories, events and power games typical of a season of wrestling. What about online mode? Fortunately, it is also present in the Pal version, but unfortunately it is limited to a series of single matches. Mind you, it is certainly one of the most interesting aspects of the game, as it is extremely fun to challenge friends on the net, but we think that perhaps something better could have been done. Fact or fiction? As far as the graphics sector is concerned, here too we are witnessing a general improvement compared to the previous title, which in itself was not bad in this regard. The athletes are as always represented in an identical way to their real counterparts, the polygonal models are covered with some of the best textures ever used on Ps2, so beautiful to the point of giving the enthusiast the visual sensation of being in front of their favorite wrestler . This THQ production once again denotes the obsessive care that the graphics have reserved for the technical realization of every detail, even the most insignificant ones such as, for example, the tattoos and accessories that aesthetically characterize some wrestlers. Not to mention the beautiful Smackdown and RAW arenas recreated to perfection. All without weighing down the CPU and in any way affecting the frame-rate which, after all, remains constant, on every occasion. The animations are also excellent, perfectly recreated in every detail, including spectacular moves. Final space reserved for judgment on the sound sector in line with the excellent general quality of the game, with music, audio effects and dubbing, by the real wrestlers themselves, of sure impact. The much-vaunted commentary, on the other hand, is reduced to some sporadic and uninvolving comments on the most salient phases of the match by the dynamic duo of official WWE commentators, Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler. Conclusions With a very varied and fun gameplay, and with a high-level technical realization, Smackdown vs Raw can be defined, without a shadow of a doubt, as the best wrestling game ever conceived, and probably, at least for this generation of consoles, the highest level of quality. Despite the lack of a greater number of athletes, who, objectively, could find space in the rosters of your wrestling categories, the THQ title remains a must-buy for all fans of WWE and fighting games in general. Pros: Great longevity, guaranteed by the many game modes. Well-kept graphics. Online games. Cons: Forty wrestlers all in all may be small. Online mode is limited to 1vs1 matches. Here we go All the various characters are identical to their real counterparts, and their best diversification compared to previous titles can also be found in the attitudes themselves, in the fighting style they will adopt once they enter the ring. Each of them, in fact, is characterized by a whole series of parameters (strength, charisma, speed, power and resistance) which effectively influence the wrestler's way of fighting. Furthermore, an absolute novelty, each of them has a very personal style of struggle associated with it by default. For example, the very bad Triple H uses dirty tactics, while the more ~candid~ John Cena uses strategies that do not break the rules. It is however possible, during the selection of the character, to freely choose which tactic to adopt between Neutral (neutral), Clean (clean) and Dirty (dirty). In terms of playability, all this translates into greater realism and greater involvement for the gamer. It is extremely funny and realistic, precisely because of this addition, to see a struggling Triple H call to his rescue the faithful (albeit slightly given the tense relations of recent times) Batista to give him a hand, or the very clever Eddie ~ La Raza Guerrero using one of his tricks (including a few forbidden shots) to win an otherwise difficult bout. It should be highlighted that by virtue of this novelty a new bar has been introduced placed under the rectory which represents the physical energy of our alter-ego. This bar has a particular function: when actions are performed in line with the ~character~ of your character, it will begin to fill up. When the Clean meter or the Dirty meter fill up completely, the character will be able to perform a series of spectacular and devastating attacks in the first case, while in the second case, due to a ~dirty~ fighting style, the specific Dirty bar will allow him to make mistakes vairs, and above all it will allow him to give more power to his attacks. In both cases, in the space of time in which he is under this sort of technical influence, on average about fifteen seconds, the wrestler is unassailable by the opponent.", "date": "2005-01-18", "grade": null}
