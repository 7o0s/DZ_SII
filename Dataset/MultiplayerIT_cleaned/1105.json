{"name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2: Recensione Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-2-recensione-xbox.html", "text": "Living online is my job, baby The offline campaign is certainly engaging but ghost recon was born for the game on the internet, it was born for the fratricidal challenges on Xbox Live and it is there, only there, that it acquires its real value in all respects. If in single player mode it sometimes seems dangerously close to a less tactical and more frenetic game like Rainbow six 3, online the story is different, and what a story. Obviously we are not referring to a new plot, but to the possibilities offered by being able to challenge, in the eight maps present, shrewd players through many methods. In this regard, we recall that those present in the two prequels have all been reconfirmed: from ~hamburger hill~ to ~last man~, while others have been added such as the new ~Search and destroy~, in which the target player scores points by killing the others . The tactic in the online game is the master and involves the need to adapt to a slower and more staid style of play than the other fps, paying attention to every single movement of our soldier. It is truly a unique game of its kind, focusing precisely on the ability of the players to give it an exclusively strategic connotation; forget the furious shootings of Halo 2, this is another way to play and running around the game map without paying attention will lead to a bad and premature end. Ghost Recon 2 manages to fix all the problems present in the prequels Living online is my job, baby Ghost Recon 2 manages to solve all the problems present in the prequels and, apart from some inexplicable delays in searching for the game and a few problems with the friends list, which can be consulted with difficulty, we have not encountered any. The Ubisoft game is not affected by lag, allowing an always precise aim even in the case of 16-player games, it is also compatible with Live 3.0 thus allowing the creation of clans and the display of top shooters. As already mentioned, there are eight maps, but other locations will soon be available to download via the Xbox Live download service, and in addition to being very well-finished in every detail, they are truly enormous, which if on the one hand galvanizes the competitors of eight challenges against eight, it could discourage the use of modes such as ~last man~ precisely because the last remaining players may never find each other... but ours is only a small criticism, we certainly don't want to complain. Compared to the first two episodes, the graphics engine has changed and, finally, is capable of inspiring: the cities are excellent and no less are the forests with polygonal blades of grass and bushes capable of hiding the player from possible rivals. The realization of the atmospheric agents is good even if perhaps for the fog, which prevents us from seeing clearly in the distance, something more could have been done, while as regards the marshy areas and the bodies of water there are no objections whatsoever. The polygonal models of the soldiers are very good as well as the animations which are fluid except in very rare cases. As for the framerate we must say that it is not always stable but also that the slowdowns do not affect the game itself too much. The smell of napalm in the morning In previous titles we were used to commanding two different teams by indicating the meeting points on the map and how the soldiers had to move, all of which, let's face it, turned out to be cumbersome and not always effective. In Ghost Recon 2 the mechanism has been made simpler and the player commands only one group of men, but his work will be concentrated above all on his own soldier, while he can give orders to the others by simply pressing the Y key. For example, by pointing to a point in front of the team and pressing the key in question, the soldiers move forward to the objective, selecting a fixed fire position, such as a machine gun, after pressing Y the soldier takes possession of it and starts using it against the enemies. By prolonging the pressure of the Y key, you can choose between four selectable commands, simply indicating what interests us with the d-pad: forward, stop, bypass from the right and bypass from the left. Furthermore, by pressing the black button you can give the group the order to reunite, while the white button is used to cease fire. Few commands but very useful and able to make it simple and effective to lead our team. the ~boys~ behave like perfect war machines, protecting each other and filling the enemy with lead without exposing themselves excessively to danger. The smell of napalm in the morning Rightly so, at this point of our article we cannot avoid addressing the analysis of the A.I. of the game, given how fundamental the reactions of our tea arem but also those of our enemies to make the war simulator credible. Unfortunately, the enemies are always ~born~ in the same points, and therefore in the event of premature death it is easy to overcome the obstacle by remembering the positions of the opponents. Their reactions are instead quite plausible and rapid, except for the rare cases in which by killing one of the soldiers the others will not seek cover, but rather will remain motionless, even if it does not happen so often as to be a problem. Likewise the vehicles react very well and it becomes difficult to fight them. As for the team, we can only praise what the programmers have done, given that the ~boys~ behave like perfect war machines, protecting each other and filling the enemy with lead without exposing themselves excessively to danger. Only rarely have we seen the ~ghosts~ make illogical movements such as standing in front of the player's line of fire. The Ghost Recon saga was born on a Personal Computer, and then moved on to Xbox, resulting in one of the cult titles of crusader-green gamers by virtue of its compatibility with Xbox Live. Thanks to the Ubisoft title, we realized what the potential of online gaming on consoles could be and, in fact, riding on its success, the French house decided to put on the market a 1.5 version called Island Thunder after a short time which put the accent right on the network game but without being able to be, given the short time between the two versions, a completely new title. Finally the wait is over and in these days it is possible to find in shops Ghost Recon 2, a real sequel with many new features, follow us in our review to discover them all. A sequel and what a sequel The ghosts are back and with them a new enemy to fight, in this case a mad North Korean general who has decided to take control of some nuclear weapons. The only unit capable of resolving the crisis can only be the ghost team used to operating in the shadows in situations that are always at the height of tension. We don't reveal more about the plot of Ghost Recon 2 but you can rest assured, as usual, when Tom Clancy is involved, it never expires in the banal and the geopolitical references of the story are always fitting and very current. The single game is articulated through a tutorial, necessary to approach the game and to learn the new commands introduced, and 15 levels in turn interspersed with videos that seem to be taken from a television documentary so accurate are they, with interviews with the men of the team and insights into the mission to be tackled that make the plot ever clearer and increase the player's emotional involvement in the Ubisoft title. The missions are varied and well done, they require approximately 10-15 hours to be completed and the game is never frustrating also because it is possible to save at any time. In addition to the canonical scheme ~move the team from one point to another and destroy everything in your path~, there are intriguing and different situations such as defending a bridge and not letting any enemy pass or infiltrating the team into the territory, take control of a helicopter and then secure the building. The first change that immediately catches the eye is the different view that is set by default by the game: a third person with a camera over the player's shoulder A sequel and what a sequel We can certainly say that the developers of Red Storm Entertainment have racked their brains to try to make the levels of their game always different, in this regard it is fair to remember that the Lone Wolf mode has been introduced which we will discuss later. The Campaign is playable not only alone but also in split screen for up to 4 players, in system link and cooperatively on Xbox Live. Ghost Recon 2 presents several new features that we will illustrate in the course of the article, but a peculiarity not to be overlooked is that the plot of the Xbox version differs from that envisaged for the PlayStation 2 version, to increasingly diversify the product and not make it a mere multiplatform production . The first change that immediately catches the eye is the different view that is set by default by the game: a third person with a camera over the player's shoulder that frames his whole body as well as obviously everything around him. This change is not merely aesthetic but rather was desired by the developers, and this is noticeable during the campaign, to make the player's action much more effective, guaranteeing him the possibility of carefully examining the area around the soldier himself in order to understand in a fraction of a second the porigin of any dangers and therefore also of possible shelters. We can only confirm how much good this view offers which, moreover, passes into first person every time we use the zoom of the rifle, almost to satisfy the more conservative players, while also providing an excellent gimmick in terms of gameplay. It is however possible, by choosing in the options menu, to always play with the traditional fps shot, except in the Lone Wolf mode. This possibility is completely new for Ghost Recon and allows you to use a team member to carry out some high-risk missions. It will be armed with the new M29 rifle, equipped with a video camera, which allows the player, sheltered behind any obstacle, to aim at enemies simply by protruding the weapon, without taking excessive risks and the result is a very precise instrument, capable of delivering devastating attacks thanks also to the built-in grenade launcher. Comment Here in the editorial office we have always been fans of the Ghost Recon series and this latest product surprised us positively, managing to improve the many small defects that weighed on the previous chapters. The offline mode is certainly good and capable of entertaining for several hours but, only if you have an Xbox Live subscription, you can get the real gist of the Ubisoft title. We guarantee that, once you try it on the net, you won't be detached from it for a long time, so much so that for us the new GR has almost become a drug. At this point we can only recommend the purchase of the game, which rightfully ranks among the best exponents of the genre, but also a nice subscription to Microsoft's online service, given that playing GR2 offline would be like buying a Ferrari to go at 50 km/h on a freeway. Pros Technically well done Offline ~Campaign~ capable of entertaining but online is devastating Cons Some small gaps in the A.I. Low replayability of the offline ~campaign~ If you don't have Live", "date": "2004-12-03", "grade": null}
