{"name": "Virtua Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-tennis_b.html", "text": "Grand Slam What decreed the fortune of the Hitmaker sports series, first in the arcade and then on the Dreamcast, is the alchemical balance of immediacy and depth, its dribbling of both pure arcade and exaggerated simulation to found its own highly original playability, singular: an approach perfectly returned in this conversion for GBA. The boys of the Altron team, under the supervision of the Hitmakers, have managed to perform a small miracle: what the player holds in his hands is the most faithful and exciting re-proposition of Virtua Tennis imaginable in pocket form. Abandoning the 3D graphics, a more functional two-dimensional look was chosen for this conversion: the cosmetic added value of deadlifts and close-ups on the athletes was renounced for greater immediacy and a better rendering of the frenetic gameplay ~ la Virtua Tennis~. The commands remain unchanged and with two keys you can bring into play an impressive depth and variety of game. With the lats, on the other hand, the computerized partner is controlled during the doubles, indicating whether to play more under the lines or more on the base. Around the world The options available range from a single quick match to a tournament to perhaps the heart of the game, the World Tour. Ingenious implementation capable, by itself, of transforming the Sega cartridge into a drug. After having created two athletes, a man and a woman, and customized them according to our preferences, we will have to accompany them in the long and difficult climb up the world rankings. Obviously, in order to worry the number one in the world, it will be necessary to win an increasing number of tournaments: at the beginning there will be few selectable ones but as we start to win we will unlock more and more numerous and challenging ones. The genius is the introduction of numerous small stages which, similar to training, serve to improve the statistics of our character to make him grow and make him more competitive in tournaments. These mini-games are the most extravagant and fun you have ever seen in a sports title: from knocking down cans, destroying dinosaur eggs, hitting targets, assembling sandwiches and hamburgers, destroying alien robots or collecting fruit: anything can serve to improve our characters. Only in this way will we be able to win races, climb the world rankings and earn money. The latter can be used to buy bonuses or clothing, rackets or contracts from other athletes to be able to face doubles. As if that weren't enough, consider the added value of multiplayer: up to four human players (each with a cartridge, unfortunately) can create matches that are as grueling as they are exciting. Comment After some disappointing, or decidedly botched, conversions of old Sega glories for the Nintendo portable, the house of the blue hedgehog finally manages to score a heavy point. Virtua Tennis is the most faithful conversion of the historic arcade that could be expected for the little one from Nintendo. A textbook for Playability courses, a perfect learning curve, a longevity  also thanks to the World Tour  tending towards Infinity and beyond: all in a single cartridge. In the second set you play, you will already see Virtua Tennis transfigured from a tennis game to a recreational drug: it can be addictive. You'll find yourself playing in the most unexpected places, stealing every scrap of time for a quick game: if you then have a couple of friends at your disposal and a link cable, you'll have the most addictive title since Mario Kart in your hands. Pros: Longevity... ...playability... ...infinite multiplayer Cons: Colorless music Improved animations Do you hate tennis? It's Virtua Tennis. It's portable. Point, Set, Game: End. These two basic statements would be enough to make the Sega/Thq cartridge an obligatory purchase for every pocket video game lover. It will only be the duty of criticism to make us continue in this very academic and accessory review: Virtua Tennis for GBA is a videogame grammar supplement, the portable declination of a ludic paradigm that from Pong onwards has undergone numerous mutations but which in the original creation of the Hitmakers has found a new home, an unmistakable declination so much so that it is almost a ~genre in itself~: the Virtua Tennis genre.", "date": "2003-06-12", "grade": null}
