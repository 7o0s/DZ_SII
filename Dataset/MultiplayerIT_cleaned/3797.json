{"name": "Yakuza Kiwami per PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-kiwami-pc-recensione.html", "text": "Yakuza Kiwami represents the consolidation of a wish that PC users had expressed on several occasions and which was finally fulfilled in August last year, when the prequel to the SEGA series, Yakuza 0, made its debut on Steam. Windows it is therefore possible to enjoy the engaging adventures of Kazuma Kiryu, a rising star of the Japanese mafia who one day sees his path of ascent in the Tojo Clan brutally interrupted due to an unexpected event: his best friend, Akira ~Nishiki~ Nishikiyama, kills the head of the Dojima family to defend a girl Kazuma cares about a lot, and he decides to take the blame for what happened, serving ten years in prison. Expelled from the Yakuza, on his return he finds a completely different scenario: his Yumi has disappeared, Nishiki has climbed the hierarchies and has turned into an unscrupulous person, the third president of the clan has been assassinated and someone has stolen ten billion yen from the headquarters coffers. Who is behind all this? And what does little Haruka, a girl who ends up by chance on Kazuma's road, have to do with what happened? To find out, all that remains is to get involved in the splendid plot of Yakuza Kiwami, told through cutscenes full of intensity, revelations and twists, which form the glue in a sandbox structure that alternates furious fights in the streets of Kamurocho, numerous side missions and pleasant extra activity. Gameplay If you've played Yakuza 0, you'll know exactly what to expect from the structure of Yakuza Kiwami, which adopts the traditional formula of the series to push us to explore the streets of the Kabukicho-inspired Tokyo district, bumping into thugs who want to fight, petty pickpockets, people in search of help and the inevitable Goro Majima, anti-hero par excellence in the franchise created by Toshihiro Nagoshi, who will keep an eye on us throughout the campaign to challenge us when he wants to test our newfound abilities. The growth path provides for the unlocking of experience points and money through the completion of fights, with the possibility of enhancing various characteristics of the protagonist. We will thus be able to improve health and attack, obtain extra maneuvers that enrich the repertoire and brutal specials to be activated when the fury bar is full. The latter are undoubtedly the most spectacular moves in the game, and see Kazuma crushing the opponents' heads against a wall, finishing them while they are still on the ground with a powerful punch, grabbing any object in the scenario and crushing it on the enemy, and so on. Street. The same fighting styles seen in Yakuza 0 are present, all equipped with specific upgrades, with the addition of a further approach closely linked to encounters with Goro: it is a solution that significantly increases the variety of clashes, allowing us to choose the technique we prefer depending on the opponent, especially the tough bosses. We may perhaps be able to focus on the speed of the Rush style or on the unstoppability of the Beast style, or still remain faithful to the basic movements of the Brawler style. We are talking about elements that succeed in the not simple task of giving depth and character even to brawls that recur continuously, assisted by an excellent impact rendering and by an entire audiovisual context that enhances the blows, the dodges, the grabs and above all the finishers . ~Real Yakuza use a gamepad~, clarifies the game immediately after starting, and we can only agree with him: the Xbox controller is perfectly supported and is absolutely preferred to controls via mouse and keyboard, unable to convey the same feeling of immediacy and involvement. Structure Yakuza Kiwami manages to intelligently mask the limits of a structure that in the end is extremely simple, and which involves moving from point A to point B of the map because the plot takes a further step and its events continue to unfold . The story and the way it is told, the excellent characters and even the interpretation of the Japanese voice actors (the game is subtitled only in English, as usual) therefore represent the foundations of an experience that without these elements would be quite weakened. However, the combat system is very solid, as already mentioned, and the structure is absolutely not lacking in numbers: to complete the twelve chapters of the campaign you need at least seventeen hours, which however become even thirty if you are committed to completing the various secondary quests . Among their folds we find an extreme ~Japaneseness~, on this not c'is doubtful: Kazuma gets involved in absurd situations and has to make the best of a bad situation, there are sequences in which we are asked to remember certain details to provide the correct answers but, in general, the epilogue is always the same and we he sees his hands being beaten to close the accounts and provide the necessary help to those in need. These are clearly not the best subquests of the series, indeed we often speak of very short and insignificant missions, but which in any case contribute to enriching the experience. The same can be said of the collateral activities located within Kamurocho: Karaoke bar where you can sing Japanese pop songs in rhythm game style, darts, billiards, shogi, card and roulette games, baseball bat workouts, bowling, fun races with toy cars to build and upgrade (Pocket Circuit Racing), the ever-present Mahjong and the hostess clubs. In this case the iconic SEGA Clubs are unfortunately weakened: it is not possible to play with classics such as Out Run, Super Hang-On or Space Harrier, but only with the usual UFO Catcher and with Insect Queen, a curious mix between fighting game and strategy based of trading cards. The PC version Net of an annoying bug that mutes the audio of cutscenes and sound effects, fortunately found only when the game is first launched, the PC version of Yakuza Kiwami is exactly as we expected after appreciating the work done by the developers SEGA with Yakuza 0. As a good remake, the title uses completely redesigned assets, precisely the same as the prequel, to replace the original graphics of the 2005 episode with modern, detailed, sophisticated and well-animated polygonal models, especially during the rendered cutscenes in real time. However, the great protagonist is the setting of Kamurocho, which especially in the evening offers an extraordinary show and atmospheres extremely close to the reality of a night walk through the streets of Kabukicho, unfortunately losing much of its charm in the daytime sequences. In terms of performance, we found a very similar situation to that of the prequel, with the possibility therefore of running the game at 4K and a rocky 60 frames per second using a GTX 1080 Ti and setting all effects to maximum with v-sync activated. The Ultra preset activates SSAA at 2X, which means that the resolution is doubled, but this value can be raised further if your hardware can handle it, switching to 4X or even 8X. At the same time, less performing configurations can count on a scaler that reduces the native resolution while leaving the selected output intact, possibly tweaking aspects such as the texture filter or the quality of the shadows to gain additional frames. Also in this case the feature that unlocks the frame rate during the cutscenes is definitely appreciable, keeping the fluidity of the experience constant and giving us a higher visual impact than what was seen on PlayStation 4 Pro. There is also an interesting bonus for PC users , in this case a small mod that restores the original music cut in the western version of Yakuza Kiwami, capable of further enhancing a sound sector of great value.", "date": "2019-02-22", "grade": "8.2"}
