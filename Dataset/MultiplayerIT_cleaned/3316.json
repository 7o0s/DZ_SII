{"name": "Phoenix Point", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phoenix-point-recensione.html", "text": "Julian Gollop was able to make Phoenix Point thanks to the success of XCOM by Fireaxis, who in turn started from his XCOM to found his excellent series. In reality, Gollop thought of continuing that fruitful experience, which we remember dating back to the mid-90s, before Fireaxis took it over, but history tells us that he was held back precisely by the success of XCOM: how could he compete ? Chaos Reborn, his previous game, has been working his way up and down with update after update. Snapshot Games, his current studio, is full of talent but very small. A flea compared to Sid Meier's battleship, which not only has excellent resources, but also the coat of arms of being one of the best software houses in the world. Phoenix Point was born only thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign, it grows as much as it can and reaches the point of being a good game, with some mechanics even deeper than its rival. Unfortunately, as we will see in the course of the review, it also has many limitations that hold it back. Gameplay - Fighting The starting point of Phoenix Point is certainly the original XCOM series, from which it inherits a vision of the genre that is at times uncompromising and less prone to simplification, compared to that of Firaxis' XCOM, while mixing it with more modern mechanics. The combat system always provides for a certain number of action points to be spent to carry out the various actions, but mixes the cards a bit, binding them to willpower, a determining element for the yield of our soldiers on the battlefield, which decreases when is affected, when the soldiers are too tired or when someone is killed, and various other factors that emerge as the game progresses. The cover system is instead very similar to that of XCOM: some objects offer complete cover (example: walls) and others leave them partially uncovered (example: guardrails). However, Phoenix Point's touch of genius is all in the attack system, with the player having the possibility not only to attack an opponent generically, with the single projectiles fired by the weapons that all have their own ballistics and their own effect, but also to activate an aiming system that allows you to target limbs or enemy equipment by doing localized damage, in order to maximize certain effects. The usefulness of this novelty emerges immediately with some generic enemies equipped with shields, but if it is not vital in the first missions, with the continuation of the campaign it becomes increasingly essential to use, such as against some bosses for example. The dynamics of the battlefield are therefore similar, but at the same time different from those of XCOM, so as to give it its own precise identity, although the combinations are inevitable. Game mechanics Phoenix Point provides a series of missions with fairly obvious objectives: eliminate all enemies in a certain area, protect some resources, sabotage infrastructure and so on. To make the most of the game system, it is advisable to immediately select one of the two higher difficulty levels, because the standard and the easy one show a really deficient artificial intelligence in some situations. Unfortunately here the game pays a lot for its production, because the maps are all very similar to each other, despite being procedurally generated. The problems of artificial intelligence emerge above all in defense missions, with opponents who have too many difficulties in developing effective attack strategies and sometimes remain stunned, caught up in some existential doubts about how to move. Don't assume from this that Phoenix Point is an easy game, because it isn't. Indeed, it is decidedly more ruthless than XCOM, especially at the beginning, when you have few men available, the recruits are not yet seen, the technologies are scarce and the factions do not trust us. Let's also include the management of friendly fire, not exactly intuitive during the first few hours, and that of ammunition, which forces us to build the magazines by hand and assign them to the troops, and you will understand that we are dealing with a much more complex title than how much do you think. The interface also weighs everything down, very similar to that of XCOM, but decidedly less clear in certain aspects. Management stage As you may have understood, Phoenix Point also includes a management section. The game tells of our fight against the Pandoravirus, a terrible mephitic mist of alien origin that transforms all living creatures into monsters. The Earth is now on its knees, many states no longer exist and the only chance left to save themselves is to bring together the small communities that were formed after the catastrophes, however divided by their ideologies. To do this, the Phoenix Project has been restored, an emergency plan on a global scale which, starting from limited resources, will have to reconnect the forces of the entire planet (but without carrying parcels). This translates into traveling the globe aboard an air base, in pure XCOM style, exploring the points of interest found by radars and carrying out missions. Between one mission and another, we also need to improve our bases with ever more modern infrastructures, acquire new equipment for the operators, heal the wounded, research new technologies and talk to the different factions discovered (three in total) to gain their trust. Only by managing everything properly will you get the tools you need to continue in the game and face the greatest dangers. It is essential to know that during the campaign you have to choose which side you are on and that this translates into fully embracing a certain line of technological progression, which has very strong effects on gameplay. If you like, this makes Phoenix Point replayable at least three times, which is not bad since it takes about thirty hours to finish a game. The factions have already been discussed several times in the preview phase, but we report for convenience: one is made up of militarists who believe they can solve everything with missiles, another is a religious sect with transhumanist tendencies that wants to go beyond the old humanity to the sound of genetic mutations, while the third is a fundamentally anarchist faction, which resents the other two. Graphics From a graphic point of view, Phoenix Point looks like a dark version of XCOM, with some missions with a Lovecraftian atmosphere, between enemies full of tentacles and situations that seem to come more from a horror book than a turn-based strategy. Obviously the level of detail is lower. After all, it is the entire game that shows choices made on savings. For example, the entire narrative side is entrusted to texts and very few movies are seen. Without a doubt, Gollop and his cohorts cannot be blamed, given that certain 'decorations' cost money, but it is inevitable that coming from the sumptuousness of, for example, War of the Chosen, or even just from the Mutant Year Zero variety, there it can be noticed. The soundtrack is also much more oppressive than that of the rival, so as to create a much heavier and more oppressive atmosphere. Not bad, despite some smudging.", "date": "2019-12-17", "grade": "7.5"}
