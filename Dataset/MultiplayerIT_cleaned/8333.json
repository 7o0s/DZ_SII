On the strength of the positive opinions received on the Nintendo laptop, the small Texan developer has decided to offer his title to an even wider audience, publishing a PC version already available on some digital platforms. But how does the game perform on the bigger computer screen? Pad in hand, we wanted to find out. A throwback to the old days With raw 8-bit graphics, Mutand Mudds is one of the most traditional and least original 2D platformers we've played in a while now. As the bespectacled protagonist you move through a series of levels full of platforms to jump on and enemies to eliminate with your squirt gun. Between spikes and rivers of lava, predictably each scenario is full of traps that can blow the player one of the three hearts available to him, while the more advanced levels introduce a series of obstacles and challenges that require enormous precision and timing in jumping and moving : for this reason the developer has added support to the pad, which has given us a big hand in the most difficult situations. The jetpack available to the protagonist allows him to double jump and float for an instant, but the time in flight is so tight that it is necessary to continuously calculate the jumps and landing points to avoid unexpected surprises in mid-air; however, with a little skill and practice, the jetpack can also be used as a very fast evasive maneuver, especially in the usual icy levels with slippery ground. In all likelihood, the only less traditional element is given by the possibility of using special platforms to jump from one floor to another of the level, moving in the background or approaching the foreground. In addition to not representing anything new in the platform genre (just think of Rayman Origins or Little Big Planet, just to name a few recently) it is clear that it is a gimmick originally conceived to take advantage of the Nintendo 3DS hardware and create a pleasant of depth, although it also performs well on PC thanks to a fog and focus system. One of the rare cases in which this peculiarity has more or less evident repercussions in the gameplay sees some enemies attacking from one floor to another to displace the player, but except for some sporadic moments, it is really difficult to be taken by surprise. However, this does not mean that Mutant Mudds is a simple game, and indeed the absence of checkpoints and the need to have to start the level over with each death leads to many moments of frustration. However, barring a series of characterless chiptune tunes and lackluster 8-bit graphics, Mutant Mudds has very few shortcomings, and if you look at it from the perspective of a digital game for a handheld system like the Nintendo 3DS, then here's that the enthusiastic comments of users and journalists find a justification. However, without the allure of portability on 3DS or the depth effect typical of the console version, Renegade Kid's game has very few strengths on PC. What about 3DS? If our opinion on the PC version is rather fluctuating, Mutant Mudds on Nintendo 3DS remains a more sensible purchase, despite still being sold at a price of around 9. The 3D support adds a lot to the depth effect of the various levels, while the short duration of each scenario goes well with the portability of the console, making Mutant Mudds an enjoyable hit and run game, suitable for quick games while on the tram or at the post office. Finally, the 20 additional levels featured in the PC version will soon be available for free on 3DS as well.", "date": "2012-09-10", "grade": "7.5"}
