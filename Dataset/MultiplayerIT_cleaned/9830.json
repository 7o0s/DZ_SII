Except for some more or less memorable flops, the community of players always remembers with pleasure the raids for the seven digital seas, with the supply of rum always ready in the hold and the fearsome Jolly Roger hanging from the mast. The spirit of adventure and exploration, epic galleon battles and sword fights, boarding and haggling - the life of a freebooter seems made to be replicated behind a pad. Yet it is strange that the history of modern piracy has never really been abused in video games, to the point that each new title about buccaneers and sea dogs always ends up attracting the attention of fans. And it is precisely to the latter that the brothers Joshua and Maxwell Scott-Slade, known mainly for their previous Flash games, wanted to aim by creating Plunderland, a lively action game for iPhone and iPod Touch in which a handful of pirates must overcome storms , face enemy fleets and collide with terrible curses, in an attempt to pillage villages and collect gold like crazy. However, don't be fooled by the excessive simplicity of the mechanics and the apparently minimalist graphics, as the developers have managed to create something truly original. Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum! In Plunderland the action basically takes place from left to right, moving the sailing ship forward or backward thanks to a simple inclination of the device. The more you tilt it, the faster you go, while dragging a finger on the cannon and letting it go, in a way reminiscent of Angry Birds, you can fire shots in any direction. The arsenal of your galleon is mainly used to sink the ships of the British navy, increasingly numerous and resistant as you progress through the more than twenty levels that make up the three game campaigns. But destroying enemy ships is not the only pastime of the protagonist pirates, and from time to time it will happen to meet small islets occupied by indigenous villages that are waiting to be raided and plundered down to the last treasure. Digging in the sand you can find gold or some collectibles, but attacking a native means unleashing the wrath of the entire village. Not that it's too dangerous, mind you: the stones and arrows thrown by the inhabitants will almost tickle the pirate galleon, while a well-aimed cannonball is capable of throwing the entire population to the sharks. And, speaking of sharks, the sea is really full of them; gigantic sharks lurk in the depths of the ocean, waiting to suddenly emerge and drag their entire crew into the water. When the sky darkens and a storm approaches, it is then a warning that a huge water dragon is about to tear the player's vessel to shreds, thus starting an epic sea battle. The guys at JohnnyTwoShoes have put a lot of meat on the fire: the Blackbeard apprentices can help themselves by collecting various power-ups that can make them momentarily invulnerable, launch explosive cannonballs or, and this is really fun, split the ships in two enemies with a flick of your fingers. Pirates who have fallen into the water must be fished out and brought back on board, while sharks, natives and enemy soldiers can be sent flying with a single touch. The player's main objective is to collect enough gold and treasure before passing the level, thus making any attempt to rush to the end of the scenario useless; fortunately, the loot collected can be spent to upgrade your galleon, buying new cannons or special figureheads, statues attached to the bow that are able to give particular abilities to the ship. Plunderland is outrageously simple, bordering on the banal, yet there are very few flaws that can be attributed to it, such as the lack of unlockable achievements or a multiplayer mode. All things that do not weigh too much on the final experience and which, after all, can be corrected with one of the next updates.
