While being able to count on an important series of games dedicated to him in numerical terms, Spider-Man has in fact never received the ~Arkham treatment~ like his colleague Batman: among the many titles we have seen there have certainly been some pretty good, but none that could get everyone to agree like Rocksteady Studios did. The hopes of the fans in this sense have for months now been directed to Marvel's Spider-Man for PS4, a video game on which the time has finally come to spill the beans in the review you are reading. As far as Insomniac Games is concerned, this development team can also count on a long history, which has its roots in the late 90s: thanks to a last period that was not exactly exciting, despite having made games such as Spyro, Ratchet & Clank and Resistance, the Burbank-based team is perceived to be second in line to other historical developers in the PlayStation world, such as Naughty Dog and Sony Santa Monica. Marvel's Spider-Man can therefore represent the definitive leap in quality for Insomniac Games, and vice versa: to find out, we wore the costume and launched ourselves headlong into the new adventure of the friendly neighborhood wall climber. The plot: beyond adolescence We already talked about the multitude of universes present in the imagination of Marvel characters a few days ago, when we rediscovered Peter Parker and his alter ego together. The time has finally come to talk about Marvel's Spider-Man, we can find out a little more about what Insomniac Games has prepared for us in terms of story, with the collaboration of Dan Slott and Christos Gage. For those who don't know them, these are two screenwriters who are also involved in the comic books dedicated to Spider-Man: above all Dan Slott, linked since 2008 for about ten years to the adventures on paper of Spidey, for which he also created the character of Mister Negativo that we find now in the video game. But let's go in order and start from the beginning, being very careful not to go beyond the spoiler threshold. The birth of Insomniac Games' Spider-Man is the one we all know: from this point of view, therefore, the sting by the spider, the death of Ben Parker and all the rest remain as they are proposed by the classic imagination. However, Marvel's Spider-Man skips all of Peter Parker's adolescent phase, presenting the protagonist as a twenty-three-year-old young man now accustomed to the double role he is forced to play in life after becoming Spider-Man about eight years earlier. However, the balance between the two lives remains a distant goal: the homeowner who orders Peter to pay the rent is joined by the employer who calls him to find out where he has gone and forgets an important meeting, all while they fly slaps with the enemies on duty. As Spider-Man, Peter has already clashed with several notorious villains, bringing them to justice in the maximum security prison called The Raft. The initial sequence shows us the return of the Kingpin with a consequent showdown with the protagonist, following which the same enemy foresees chaos in the city of New York after his new capture. The boss's prophecy obviously turns into reality: new and old villains appear on the horizon and Spider-Man is forced to work overtime to restore order to all of Manhattan. Meanwhile, Peter Parker tries to help Aunt May as much as he can with his volunteer activity at the F.E.A.S.T. by Martin Li, trying to establish a relationship with Mary Jane Watson, introduced us as we know in an unusual guise. Abandoned the role of supermodel, MJ is a girl water and soap at work as a journalist for the Daily Bugle: a real assault reporter, made an integral part of a story where Spider-Man's private and public life will inevitably collide. Overall, the story of Marvel's Spider-Man slips away very well, starting with a spectacular introduction that perfectly succeeds in its task of putting the player in the role of the iconic hero. During the adventure there is no shortage of particularly exciting and cinematic moments, accompanied by other phases in which the strings of feelings are touched. In between we naturally find the game phases studied by the developers, which as we are about to see have the merit of keeping the pace of Marvel's Spider-Man high. As for the duration, in our first attempt on medium difficulty completing the story took about sixteen hours, after which the percentage of completement scored 77%. A sign that there were still several secondary activities to complete. The gameplay: Out and about in style Just spend a few minutes playing Marvel's Spider-Man to realize the affection that the boys of Insomniac Games first have towards this character. It obviously starts from the phases of movement between the buildings, where the developers have developed a system of use of the cobwebs clearly derived from Spider-Man 2, one of the most inspired titles of the past from this point of view. Being able to twirl like a real spider-man may seem trivial at first, but fully mastering the use of the R2 key in combination with all the other commands takes some time and in the long run it can give a lot of satisfaction. In addition to swinging between one web and another, Spider-Man can in fact perform leaps forward and aim for protrusions to be reached quickly, making movements that always remain fluid and without inaccuracies. When there is no way to avoid a building, Peter quickly switches from using the web to gripping the structure with hands and feet, with the ability to move quickly on it entering parkour mode: the moments of real block there are, but they are very few. There are also some stunts, to be performed not only for your own personal satisfaction but also to increase Peter's experience points. But we will talk about this later, for the moment remember this paragraph when for the first time you go to dive down to gain speed, throwing the web just before contact with the ground to return up and perform the leap that will allow you to jump the building in front of you with a somersault: at that moment a smile will be printed on your face, and you will undoubtedly understand what we are talking about. In the meantime we can assure you that we've spent plenty of time flitting up and down the most famous places in New York, continuing even after completing the story - a good starting point, considering that so far we've only scratched the surface of Marvel's Spider- Man and its gameplay. The fights: gadgets and cobwebs The introductory phase dedicated to Kingpin proves to be a good way to learn what the game will bring before us in the following hours, especially as regards enemies. As we have already noted in the past, Insomniac Games has taken the fighting style from the Arkham series, enriching it to give Marvel's Spider-Man its own identity also dictated by the greater agility possessed by Spider-Man compared to the Bat. Entering an area full of enemies, you can try to eliminate a part of them without being seen or jumping straight into the action, but being careful in this case not to be overwhelmed numerically. Even at the medium difficulty level, the opponents are in fact able to offer challenging battles, relying on the presence of different types of henchmen. In addition to the normal enemies, in fact, we find others equipped with a shield, to be attacked therefore from behind, together with thugs to be blocked with the cobweb before being hit successfully. There is no shortage of those who possess special weapons, up to the use of grenades and rocket launchers. By increasing the level of difficulty, the artificial intelligence of the enemies seemed roughly the same, while the protagonist suffered greater damage: a further incentive to be careful and use all one's means to counter the enemies. From this point of view, there is no shortage of alternatives: Spider-Man can in fact count on a series of gadgets that can be unlocked gradually, such as a bomb that temporarily blocks opponents, cobwebs that attack those hit by them on the wall and drones that help him in fight. However, ammunition is limited, so one must also rely on continuous movement to avoid being caught in the middle. When you just can't stop this from happening, spider-sense offers a good indicator to perform a dodge, so you're ready to counterattack without taking damage. A useful alternative in case you are surrounded is represented by the use of the elements present in the environment: by pressing R1+L1, Spider-Man can in fact pull down shelves with his web, or rotate around him packages of cement , manhole covers and other objects to throw at enemies. Even in the combat phases, everything happens in a fluid and harmonious way, giving moments of pure satisfaction when you manage to hit a long combo without being touched. The clashes with the bosses take place above all in the second part of the adventure and derive in their mechanics from the skills that the various villains possess. Because of thisreason they are sufficiently different from each other, but the feeling remains that something more could have been done in terms of complexity: once the weak point to be exploited has been identified, the difficulty is not excessively high. Secondary activities: passed with full marks If the previous meetings with Marvel's Spider-Man had allowed us to get a taste of the topics touched upon in the previous paragraphs, for obvious reasons it had never been possible to push us into secondary activities. Now that we have done it, we can tell you without delay that these drive away the ghost of repetitiveness that hovered over the game, offering more than valid alternatives to the main missions. In some cases the side missions are actually part of the primary ones, thanks to the work done by Insomniac Games to make sure that the player knows them and feels compelled to complete them. An example in this sense is represented by the mini-games concerning Peter Parker: leveraging on the scientist skills of the protagonist, from time to time Marvel's Spider-Man puts us in front of a series of puzzles to be completed in order to continue the story, but also to get some bonuses. In fact, we must not forget that it is precisely the secondary activities that give Spider-Man some types of special currency, thanks to which he can enhance his equipment: if you want to increase the number of ammunition of the web shooter, for example, you could have the need to complete a particular secondary activity before you can do it by obtaining the related tokens. As for the variety of missions outside the main line, we really find all kinds of them: no pizzas to deliver ad nauseam then, but a good range to alternate with progress in the story to really feel in the shoes of the best Spider- Man that has ever been seen circulating in videogame New York. At the beginning we will be asked to repair the communication towers located throughout the map, in order to unlock the various areas, but soon the activities will multiply: Marvel's Spider-Man does not invent anything new, mind you, but also when it comes to simply recovering the backpacks left around by Peter himself it allows you to learn something more about the character and the plot, thus making a mundane activity interesting. Then there are strands dedicated to secondary characters and enemies, on which we will not say anything else so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovery. The important thing is to know that there are so many alternatives and they are perfectly integrated into the game, through the right balance between the effort required and the reward offered. For the rest, it's up to the player to choose how to behave: we are headed towards the next objective but our spider senses tell us that the police are chasing a car full of criminals nearby? Throwing yourself into the thick of the action becomes too tempting. Similarly, it may be necessary to clear a nest of enemies, who will arrive in waves to gradually increase the difficulty level of the operation. The experience points earned between the various missions allow Spider-Man to level up, spending the acquired skill points to improve his powers in a tree divided into three different branches called innovator, defender and web-shooter. Without going into too much detail, they enrich the repertoire of moves available to Spider-Man with new attacks, defensive skills and movements in the air. Finally, it is right to dedicate space to the parts in which MJ is controlled, as we said, an integral part of the story: the phases dedicated to Spider-Man more marked by action are interspersed with sequences where instead the girl must not be seen by the enemies, also resorting to some tricks to be able to sneak out. These are pleasant interludes, which also reserve some surprises in alternating with the protagonist. Graphics and sound: a New York never seen Recommending the vision of Peppa Pig to those who look at the puddles, we can say that the graphics of Marvel's Spider-Man manages to impress even on a purely technical level. The Manhattan created by Insomniac Games strikes above all for the way in which it is alive in the eyes of those who have the controller in hand, giving them the possibility of glimpsing the interiors of the buildings on which our Spider-Man climbs but above all showing him a busy city in its everyday activity. By hovering along the streets, you can see how many people and cars are moving below us, with passers-by who don't fail to notice Spider-Man exchanging a joke with him or asking him to take a selfie.
