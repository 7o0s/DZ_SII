{"name": "F1 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2006.html", "text": "The game As the most classic of titles of this genre, F1 2002 allows you to select one of eleven F1 teams and a driver, to try your hand at single races, in a ~custom~ championship or in an exact reproduction of the 2002 season. on the track, you will have the possibility to choose the number of laps to do, the weather situation, the tank capacity, the type of gearbox (manual or automatic), the type of tyres, etc. The technical details will have effective feedback while you race, especially the state and quality of the tires will put you in completely different situations. As a good title for a laptop, F1 2002 tries to simplify what can be simplified, so as not to waste too much time: the warm-up has not been included, and qualifying is rather quick to carry out. The control of the car is a compromise between arcade and simulation, but at this point I would have preferred the first choice. If it is true that the many variables directly affect driving, it is also true that with worn tires it is not possible to make even a slight bend without spinning out, and that any collision will always lead to the same result: off-piste and wasted time. . It is undoubtedly true that all F1 games require a patient approach and a cool head to be able to keep your opponents behind and complete the race without errors, but for this reason I wonder if the GBA needed such a product. Graphics, sound, longevity As mentioned at the beginning, the graphics of F1 2002 are a 2D/3D hybrid. There is nothing to say about the flow of the track, while some doubts remain about the choice of making such large single-seaters, which have very few animation frames to represent the position in the corners. The elements of the scenery appear suddenly, but unfortunately this is an inherent flaw of this type of setup. On balance, however, one cannot complain: a more convincing graphic, for an F1 game, could not be had. Not on this console. The sound surprises positively for the quality of the effects: the atmosphere that is created will surprise you, and you will almost feel really involved in a Formula 1 grand prix. Finally, longevity is closely linked to your feeling with the game: the circuits are all there and have been designed in an absolutely faithful way to the originals, the modes are the usual ones and there are all the options necessary to transform the gaming experience from simple to demanding. Concluding... F1 2002 is certainly one of the best racing games for the GameBoy Advance, even if it doesn't face particularly fierce competition. I personally believe that Mario Kart Super Circuit offers better solutions, but it is a completely different product. If you want Formula 1 on your laptop, the new EA title is a must. Pros: Good graphics, fast Real circuits, teams and drivers Great sound effects Cons: Lax driving model Only for F1 enthusiasts GBA: 2D consoles? After seeing the Driver 2 port, very few people still have hopes of seeing a 3D game of any caliber on the GameBoy Advance. After all, the hardware of this powerful laptop was not designed for three-dimensional applications, and the spectacle to which Mode 7 of the Super Nintendo has accustomed us cannot stand comparison with the simulations designed for today's systems. So, wanting to make a Formula 1 game for GBA, the solution lies in the hybrid: Mode 7 to move the track, standard bitmaps for the cars and background elements. A combination that works? F1 2002 seems to have proved that.", "date": "2003-02-17", "grade": null}
