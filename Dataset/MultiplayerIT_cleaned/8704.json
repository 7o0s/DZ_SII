The development of ModNation Racers: Road Trip has been entrusted to an internal team, San Diego Studio, which has been able to transpose in the best way the simple, immediate but solid gameplay of the original episode on the new hardware, thanks to a control system that on the track it relies on traditional but effective solutions (the double analog stick, the back and main buttons) while using the touch screen and the rear touch pad for navigating through the menus and, above all, the editors. The game interface is traditional in style, and instead of ~guiding~ from one section to another we will find ourselves moving (using the d-pad or making a large slide with our fingers) between seven different screens: ~Favorites~, where the character and the kart currently in use are displayed, with the possibility of taking photos in a sort of augmented reality and creating nice postcards that portray us together with our creatures; ~Studio Mod~, i.e. the editor for creating and modifying characters; ~Studio kart~, the kart editor; ~Study tracks~, to create or modify tracks based on seven possible environments (metropolis, far east, ice world, seafront, jungle, desert and mountain); ~Shopping Station~, where you can spend the tokens earned on the track to unlock new items; ~Share~, which allows us to share our creations with the community as well as download the works of other users, whether they are characters, karts or tracks; and finally ~Race station~, where we will be able to access single races, time attack and career, which represents the core of the experience. One run at a time Let's start right from the career, which presents a total of thirty races in six tournaments, the last of which must be unlocked by completing a series of rather articulated objectives and will not therefore be immediately accessible. Compared to the PlayStation 3 episode, you immediately notice the presence of a greater number of obstacles and traps on the track, which makes the experience potentially frustrating (it's never nice to print yourself against a wall a few meters from the finish line, in a race up to impeccable at that moment) but at the same time he pushes the accelerator even further on the need to memorize the tracks to exploit all the possibilities and thus overtake even the fastest opponents. There is no lack of acceleration ramps, and at the same time it is possible to collect weapons (this time well differentiated thanks to the color) to throw them against the other karts or convert them into energy for the boost. The latter constitutes the most important element once on the track: without pushing ourselves to breakneck speeds every time it will be impossible to cross the finish line first already in the middle of his career, let alone in the final stages. The boost bar is filled by drifting (X button when cornering), ramming opponents (thanks to the right analog stick) and performing spectacular stunts during jumps. It is possible to expend some energy to raise shields and nullify the action of a hostile weapon, which makes the execution of tricks even more important. The track design is good, in some ways better than the PS3 original, and there's no shortage of shortcuts and fun gimmicks. Of course, the narrative element between one race and another has been completely eliminated, but it is not missed that much. Playstation 3 trophies There are forty-seven trophies up for grabs from ModNation Racers: Road Trip. Getting the first turns out to be a trivial operation: just win a race, try your hand at the editor, share content and so on. Things get complicated soon though, and to get the most advanced awards you have to perform stunts to the limit of possible, score huge amounts of points and complete all tournaments. Let yourself be touched The peculiarity of the ModNation Racers series, however, lies in the features relating to customization, and it is clear that this aspect was particularly taken care of on PlayStation Vita, considering the presence of the touch screen and therefore, of a potentially more immediate, intuitive and fun interface. In this sense, unfortunately, the developers have not been able to maximize the resources available, creating menus that require a bit too many taps to switch from one option to another and, above all, putting on the plate a poor responsiveness of the editor to our input: from when we touch an object to when it is actually rendered on the losthalf a second goes by on the car or kart, which makes the editing operations much less fluid than one might have expected. The touch proves to be important in certain situations, for example when you need to draw a track from scratch or modify its elements, but the differences in terms of practicality compared to the Dual Shock of the PS3 version, in the end, are not such as to make the miracle. What is there and what is missing If you have already tried the original ModNation Racers, a few games with Road Trip will be enough to get a precise picture of the merits of this reduction for PlayStation Vita, as well as its (many, unfortunately) defects. Beyond a graphical interface that could have been simpler and required fewer touches to project us into the various operations, once seen the editor's responsiveness to touch commands but above all the behavior of the game on the track, it is a technically poorly optimized product, which ~struggles~ where instead it was necessary to deliver to the players a solid, fluid experience, without too many compromises, capable of enhancing the peculiarities of the new controls and confirming the good things done on PS3. It's not so much a problem of loading times (although the thirty-forty seconds needed to load each track may seem excessive, since it's a memory card), but more of a noticeable drop in frame rate as soon as the track situation gets worse. least crowded, as well as the aforementioned ~uncertainties~ when it comes to loading objects in the editor, which instead had to respond instantly to our touches. Finally, perhaps more seriously, the developers have not included an online multiplayer mode, a decision that in many ways disavows the philosophy behind the series (for example, online multiplayer was also in the PSP version!). There is a sort of surrogate in the time attack, given that by playing under Wi-Fi we can challenge the ~ghost~ of other players around the world, but it is certainly not the same thing. On the other hand, a really good move to make the game compatible with the creations made with the PlayStation 3 version (even if the opposite is not true, i.e. you won't be able to download the creations of PSVita users on PS3), which makes immediately a huge amount of characters, karts and, above all, tracks. Too bad having to enjoy them in solitude...", "date": "2012-03-02", "grade": "7.0"}
