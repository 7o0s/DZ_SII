Against the backdrop of a truly gloomy and fascinating Prague, controlled by military troops in the central area and inhabited by civilians basically unaware of what is happening, a battle takes place between vampires belonging to different factions for control of the territory. At the command of one of these bloodsuckers will we be able to remain the only ones still in... non-life at the end of the match? After testing a few days ago, here is our review of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Structure Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, a look at the setting Let's start with some good news: the game's range of modes has already been enriched with the introduction of two new stipulations that bring a total of four experiences (tutorial excluded) that can be accessed from the main Bloodhunt hub: the all -against-all of Blood Hunt, the Battle Royale in duo or trio and Ascent, in which you earn points by eliminating enemies to climb the ranks. Unfortunately, and this is where the problems already begin, some of these modes are often deserted and matchmaking therefore forces rather long waits to be able to access a game, with Blood Hunting which at the moment seems to be the only option still in vogue among users. Let's not talk about the cross-play functionality, a double-edged sword which, however, is currently the only thing that keeps the game afloat at the most atypical times, for example in the morning. By keeping it activated, PC and PS5 users can participate in the same games, but at the clear disadvantage of the latter: mouse controls make things much easier when it comes to aiming and opening fire, and so on consoles you end up bumping into situations really frustrating, which quickly lead to game over and make you want to throw everything away. With cross-play disabled, however, it becomes difficult to find a match unless you make an agreement with friends or play in the most populated times: a significant inconvenience for a product of this kind. Still no news, however, as regards the Archetypes, i.e. the seven classes currently available which however have more than one limit in terms of balancing: some are quite effective, others struggle a lot: we described them in the trial of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Gameplay Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, a long-range rooftop fight As we have already had the opportunity to say, the mechanics that regulate the gameplay of the Sharkmob battle royale are those typical of battle royale, albeit with some interesting variations on the theme. Forty-five players are placed within the map of the center of Prague, which however progressively shrinks due to a poisonous red fog for vampires, as happens in the various Fortnite and Apex Legends. Using a third person view, we will be able to explore the scenario in an extremely free way, taking advantage of the characters' ability to climb quickly on any surface and take large leaps to go from one roof to another. Using our superhuman senses we will be able to identify weapons and equipment to fill the three slots available to us (two guns and a melee tool) as well as the wheel relating to blood bags, syringes, armor and the substance that allows us to resist in the red fog. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, a civilian to feed on It is no coincidence that we were talking about variations on the theme: in addition to weapons and powers, in the Blood Hunt mode we will be able to count on an extra life that can be restored, which will allow us to survive even up to the final stages of the match and to have a chance in more than ticking it. To obtain this bonus and others, all we have to do is identify civilians with powerful blood and bite them, being careful not to let us see, otherwise a curse will highlight our position on the map for several seconds. This mix of elements contributes to creating an experience quite dynamic and fun, characterized by a gunplay that may not be perfect, but capable of having its say, albeit net of melee attacks that are confirmed to be effective, but confusing and slippery. The offer in terms of modes, as mentioned, begins to grow, but at the expense of the number of people present on the servers, an aspect that could actually cause you some trouble if you play on PlayStatio#5. Graphics and sound Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, our character lurking above Sadly the glitches in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt are still in place, from shader pop-ups (see for example the statues in Elysium, the main hub, moving towards and away from them) to issues causing civilians sink into the wine-to-life terrain, but we trust that the developers will fix them with the next updates. Little to say about the two graphics modes available on PS5, which allow you to play at 4K and 30 fps, with a pleasant motion blur that increases the sensation of fluidity, or at 1440p and 60 fps, an option certainly preferable due to the greater responsiveness and precision of the controls. The latter support the adaptive triggers of the DualSense to vary the pressure resistance, but in a somewhat generic way. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt uses screen space reflection sparingly The final result, from a visual point of view, is a game that moves between ups and downs, certainly boasts a fascinating setting and a massive use of screen space reflection to enhance puddles and reflective surfaces, but at the same time shows the side of some too much simplification when it comes to polygonal models, effects and animations, all things with an old-gen flavor. The sound, as mentioned, boasts an essential dubbing in Italian but otherwise it does not break up much, accompanying the action in a very discreet way and suffering from dynamics often busted as regards the level of the effects, sometimes annoyingly noisy.", "date": "2022-05-11", "grade": "7.5"}
