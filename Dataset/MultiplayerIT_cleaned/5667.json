It is a sensation that today appears less strange than in the past, to which we have become accustomed thanks to an amazing console which, exactly like Nier: Automata, rightfully belongs to the club of excellence of the global gaming market. Over the years you will have come to know PlatinumGames and it is no coincidence that Automata, like Okami before him, is one of the best works created by the multifaceted producer Atsushi Inaba. This time the port is made by Dying Light, the team behind the Switch port of Dark Souls Remastered which, let's face it, also did a decent job at the time. Also in the case of Nier: Automata The End of YoRHa we are faced with a very valid product that finally arrives in portability, it is the first Nier on Nintendo consoles and the first Yoko Taro game to be enjoyed anywhere, yet another ported product by Square Enix on its new, in some ways, console of choice for Japanese products with a flavor of the past. So let's see in this review of Nier: Automata The End of YoRHa for Nintendo Switch how fulfilling it is to bring the universe of Nier around the world. True gameplay The environments of Nier: Automata The End of YoRHa are one of the strong points of the game The most incredible feature of Nier: Automata The End of YoRHa is what gamepad in hand offers: a riot of purity, frenzy, intelligence of construction of the gameplay flow. There is speed of execution, beauty in the aesthetic proposal, quantity and quality of bestiary, interesting and stylistically inspired bosses, an ethereal background atmosphere typical of prestigious Japanese products. We tested all of this, as we said, on the bed: our hands grabbed the integrity of Switch, forefinger straddling the lats and triggers, the desire to go back and forth with 2B without thinking about where we were. The thing you may want knowing is if it works, if you play it well: the answer is yes, with conviction. We are not dealing with a miraculous port, nor an anomaly born by chance from phenomena: the conversion for Nintendo Switch of Nier: Automata The End of YoRHa is made with the right balance between competence and respect for the original, without arrogance or desire to show more talent than necessary. Exactly like Dark Souls Remastered, this is a port that smells of other consoles and other performances, but which nevertheless wishes to assert its right of existence - scaled - on Switch. Apart from the technical parenthesis, 2B's journey remains perfectly enjoyable in portability, each key can be reached well therefore even the frenetic approach of Platinum can be transferred with serenity by holding a console like Switch for one or two hours of continuous play. Lower here and there Nier: Automata The End of YoRHa is a fast-paced, charismatic, almost old-fashioned action RPG To help the ergonomics of Switch, excellent but not ideal for prolonged sessions, is the extreme versatility and variety of the gameplay offer: the continuous alternation of playful approaches helps the experience a lot, resulting in a timeless freshness and fun, who do not accuse even one day of age despite the fact that almost six years have passed by now. The sign of time can only be seen - and voluntarily - in the technical part: if already at the time PlatinumGames gave a clear emphasis on the flow of frames, in 2022 Nier: Automata on Switch offers all its polygonal modesty at a clear and simple performance price : resolution and frames. The choice of Dying Light is understandable: Automata is a product that needs frame stability, therefore if the target of 60 was not reachable due to obvious technical (or budget) limitations, the obligatory choice was to set the game at 30 frames per second. For those coming from other consoles - for decency we do not mention the havoc carried out on PC - the halving is felt, but in any case, fortunately, it impoverishes the experience less than we feared. Nier: Automata, even at 30 frames, is played with discrete decency thanks to a stability of frames that gives a constant sense of balance to the playful flow, in every situation. To pay the pledge, as anticipated, is the resolution, visibly lowered, and the technical richness not so much of the protagonists or supporting actors, but of the game environment, more bare and less vivid than the other counterparts. Once you get used to it, you digest everything thanks to the beauty of a Nier in portability, but it is difficult to deny how, at times, all the desire for more performing hardware, capable of giving extreme dignity to a legendary title like this, is felt . Thankfully, everything else isleft intact to shine: plot and sound are untied by technical constraints, free to soar in their richness and variety, capable of hooking from the very first moments and not giving up until the end.", "date": "2022-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
