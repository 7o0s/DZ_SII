Who knows what he would have said in front of AereA, a game inspired by the tradition of Diablo or Torchlight-style action RPGs in which axes, swords, stirrups and shields are replaced by harps, cellos, lutes and trumpets that will be used not as the Clash would but to launch powerful notes capable of pulverizing enemies. As disciples of the Grand Master Guido (because music, as you know, is Italian stuff) we will have to discover the mysteries of the flying island of Aezir, visiting its various environments and eliminating dozens and dozens of creatures, up to the clashes with the inevitable boss, so that good prevails and evil succumbs. If this sounds familiar to you, everything is normal. The first choice we will have to make is to choose between the harpist Wolff, who takes the place of an archer, Jacques and his cello who acts as a tank, Jules the lute wizard and Claude the machine gun trumpeter. The fact of being four characters suggests the possibility of setting up a fun co-op with three other companions in local mode. Out of tune notes Aerial starts off much like all action RPGs, one tutorial mission, simple enemies, and lots of chatter to read. The problem lies in the fact that, while explaining in detail what a lever is for and how to open a door, the game forgets one of the most important things for titles of this kind: a pop-up that explains what type of potion we are collecting and what its effects will be. This turns out to be a blunder in the later stages of the game, when the inventory is full and each slot must be used for items that are always useful. For the rest, walking through the AereA dungeons it is really very difficult to see any glimmer of originality. Ok, weapons are instruments, coins are notes and the drop is replaced by scores with which we unlock new weapons to buy, but the music is always the same. Each character has two different attacks, to which a third is added after the third boss, but this doesn't add much to a rhythm and a game mechanic that after a while becomes quite boring and overwrought. equipped with sprints or any form of fast movement, excluding some teleporters between the central hub and the various dungeons, and this makes exploration even less pleasant. Furthermore, by the standards of the genre, in AereA it often happens that we have to go back and find that the enemies have reappeared from behind us or come out of nowhere, so if we have to go back to a section we have already visited or come back to life after being killed we will have to put up with the same trann of enemies again that offer no challenge, other than continuously pressing the area attack button. In the first level we are supported by the desire to discover, in the second there is the curiosity of the new setting, but already from the third level onwards the situation becomes dramatically repetitive, especially for those who know the genre and its clichs well. Playstation 4 trophies AereA's trophies reflect its low level of challenge, since to obtain them you will basically need to complete the game, use an ability a certain number of times or collect enough notes. The biggest problem will be finding three other friends to play it with to also get the co-op trophies. Synesthesia, take me away Visually there isn't much to say about AereA: yes, the environments are colorful, but the average quality is pretty standard and the level design won't go down in history. For heaven's sake, there's nothing out of place and the frame rate is stable, but honestly there are even a few years old games that are decidedly more pleasant to watch, obviously without bothering Blizzard. More than a new single, AereA looks like a cover played without too much conviction. Fortunately, since we are talking about a game based on music, the sound sector is one of its best aspects. The soundtrack is relaxing, never boring and manages not to get boring after a few minutes. The sound effects of the weapons are nice and have the advantage of giving a certain comic effect. Being surrounded by enemies and taking them out with a lute strumming doesn't happen every day, so much so that one wonders if the game wouldn't have worked better with a rock setting (probably yes, everything works better with rock). Even the bosses, which obviously are a mix between animals and instruments, have unique sounds, so fighting a bagpipe beetle won't be like colliding against a piano snake. This will turn the end of each level into a kind of cacophony which, however, at certain moments, you absorbhe will attend an improv session. So yes, without a doubt we are faced with the cutest part of the game. What's sad about AereA is that after all the idea wasn't that bad, even if bizarre, but completely out of time: the world is full of interesting action RPGs, perhaps there won't be many on consoles, but on PC we have spoiled for choice. Perhaps it could give you some joy if you have children or played with three friends, but honestly even in this case we can recommend something more fun.", "date": "2017-07-05", "grade": "5.0"}
