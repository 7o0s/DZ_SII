{"name": "Evil Lands", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-lands-recensione.html", "text": "Evil Lands is a multiplayer-based action RPG rather than an MMORPG, as we will clarify in this review: each server hosts just six participants, who can move in groups and collaborate or mind their own business, with a view to progression based on completion of increasingly complex quests and yet focused solely on the elimination of certain targets. The first thing the game asks you to do is choose your character's class between warrior, assassin and magician, then you are projected into a fairly large setting, Campi Fiorenti, with two other scenarios that can be unlocked once complete all available missions, namely Shady Isle and Frozen Peaks. Within the map we move freely and it is possible to orient ourselves using the classic radar or view the entire location, but there are no indicators that can facilitate the task during the assignments: we will have to explore the surroundings and find our objectives by ourselves, possibly highlighted with an orange sign. The combat system works in a semi-automatic way, in the sense that it is enough to press the attack button for our character to start slashing against the opponent on duty until one of the two dies, but the extra maneuvers must be activated manually and add without more variety and depth to the experience. In fact, it is possible to perform a powerful sweep, hit the enemy with poison or arrows, or even create a defense turret that launches darts against anyone who crosses its borders. Mechanics that unfortunately are declined with difficulty in the still present PvP mode, inevitably tainted by pay-to-win dynamics. Gameplay and structure Speaking of fights, collisions in Evil Lands appear rather slippery and the impact rendering is frankly ridiculous: this is certainly one of the aspects that the developers should work on for the next updates. The system highlights a simplistic vocation, from a traditional MMORPG, in which each duel is systematically won by the strongest fighter and not by the most skilled one, even if the quick shot (to be used only at the right time, since it is subject to reloading) it allows you to wriggle out in case of difficulty, move away and catch your breath. However, the progression system is the element that gives the most satisfaction in the Rage Quit Games title: killing enemies and completing missions allows you to level up and use points to improve the various characteristics of the character, while collecting loot goes to enrich the equipment with more powerful and effective weapons and armor, which can be upgraded by spending a little virtual and/or real currency (coins and crystals, both dispensed with relative generosity) when you have several copies of the same object that you can fuse Together. It is precisely the aspect of growth that stimulates us to continue despite the systematic repetitiveness of situations and the lack of ideas that add a pinch of variety to the experience, in concert with a sometimes sumptuous technical realization, capable of representing broad and detailed scenarios , convincing characters and decent animations while keeping the frame rate high on iPhone X. There are moments when Evil Lands actually looks like a console RPG, and there is no doubt that from this point of view the authors have made a great effort, convinced that a compelling visual impact would propel their title up the charts. guess what? They were right. However, the game currently stands as an open construction site and it will be interesting to understand how many and which improvements will be made in the coming weeks, with the hope that something can be done to improve the fights and add substance to a slightly too limited structure.", "date": "2019-07-20", "grade": "7.0"}
