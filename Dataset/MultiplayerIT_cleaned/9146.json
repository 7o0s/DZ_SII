Unfortunately, the great legendary hero without a name left no indication of where he had locked up his prey, and building speculation had no mercy on a strange and ancient circle of stones full of skulls and danger signs, protected by powerful spells and with a couple of guard golems. But deep down the builders are at ease with the lords of evil, because they destroy entire villages and cities just by lifting an armpit, allowing them to do a tidy business to get them back on their feet, perhaps by charging a beholder's eye for the tavern in the shape of werewolf pubis, designed by the famous architect Renzo Forte. Obviously those who have already paid for the house are not so happy to have such an annoying and cumbersome neighbor in the sewage system (the armies of evil take up space). The only solution is to hire an unblemished hero to restore order and justice to the world, otherwise you know what a mess at the next condominium meeting? Unfortunately, spotless heroes cost money, and the condominiums all work for a certain MacMammara, a very irascible guy who pays them in rubber chickens with a pulley, so they can't afford to spend large sums. Someone even proposed to pirate one, but modern DHRM (Digital Heroes Rights Management) causes sudden blocking of fake heroes, so the risk is too big. The choice fell on a second-hand hero, one of those who always start from the first level and enter the dungeons armed with bright plastic swords and flannel sweaters sewn by their grandmother. Will he make it to the bottom? Skills and deaths Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike-style role-playing game, evidently indie, which certainly does not focus on particular technical virtues to involve the player. At the beginning you have to create your own hero, giving him a name and selecting seven skills from a shortlist of thirty-six. Each skill unlocks a series of powers on which the points accumulated by leveling up can be spent and which, obviously, produce different effects on the gameplay. The skills are divided into three macro categories: warrior, wizard and thief. In reality, the idea of classes is quite fictitious, because the player is allowed to choose the skills he wants and to use them as he sees fit. Unlike other games, in Dungeons of Dredmor choices greatly influence the gameplay. A game played with a half-thief, half-warrior character is completely different from a game played with a pure warrior or a wizard. Each choice opens up possibilities but closes others, resulting in different approaches to dangers. Having decided on the character and entered the dungeon, we immediately experienced the bastardy of the random level creation system. Once we opened the first room we found ourselves fighting against six bats who swept us away like dust. What could we do armed with a wooden sword and dressed in an appetizer sweater against all those ravenous monsters? This terrified us a little: is the game that difficult? Fortunately, in the following games we weren't so unlucky and everything went quite smoothly, even if we died several times before deciding to deselect the hardcore mode which erases saves in case of premature death (randomness opens the door to many unexpected events) . Research and development Having become familiar with the controls and taking into account the possibility of finding anything behind every door, we began to enjoy the game system that allows you to do many things. As warriors specialized in the manufacture of weapons (to create objects of any kind, just select a recipe for which you have all the ingredients and confirm your choice), we went to scour every corner of the dungeon in search of good material to upgrade our equipment . Well supplied with weapons, armor and healing items (food and potions), we faced hundreds of monsters (bats, slimes, zombies, robots and so on), attacking them by pressing the left mouse button, or using special abilities and throwing weapons with the right button. We've done dozens of quests given to us by the goddess of quests (it looks like something out of Pollon) and cursed at the cumbersome interface, which makes it a pain to make selections or sell items in shops run by clowns (very friends of the goddess of quests), scattered for levels. Finally, we come to fight against Lord Dredmor. The beauty is that we have accumulated several hours of play without almost realizing it, we were so taken by the depth of this little gem, which moreover has dimostrato replayable several times, without ever getting tired. In short, it's worth all the four euros it costs and lasts much longer than the vast majority of triple A titles. What more could you want?", "date": "2011-08-01", "grade": "8.0"}
