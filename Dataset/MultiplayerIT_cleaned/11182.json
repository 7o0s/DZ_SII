{"name": "Dogz 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dogz-2_a.html", "text": "After having conquered a generous slice of the market for consoles, the ~casual~ genre also seems to be in great shape on mobile phones: the continuous emergence of products in which you have to take care of various types of animals testifies to it. In the case of Dogz 2, we are faced with the second episode of a Gameloft series that is clearly inspired by that Nintendogs that brought so much luck to the Nintendo DS. One could say, without fear of contradiction, that it all started with the Tamagotchi: a virtual puppy that had to be fed, pampered and followed in its growth. Today's ~casual games~ are nothing more than an evolution of this concept, and this sequel in particular will allow us to adopt a dog, give it a name, educate it to live in our apartment, feed it and finally take it to compete in competitions that will translate into an economic return for us. The first thing we have to do in Dogz 2 is to choose one of the puppies in the kennel, paying attention to their characteristics: there are the liveliest ones and the calmest ones, the most obedient ones and the most affectionate ones. Once the choice has been made, we will be able to give the dog a name (or leave the default one) and take it home, where it will get to know the new environment not without some minor inconvenience (it will be simple, but not painless, to make it understand where to do its business ). Every day we will have a notebook on which the objectives to be achieved are noted: at the beginning we will only have to feed and drink the dog, and then send him to bed, while later we will be asked to take him around and introduce him to new places, where will be able to run and improve their physical abilities. If there is one thing that Dogz 2 does not lack, in fact, it is the ~sport~ minigames, in which we will have to guide our puppy directly or give him orders, perhaps to overcome obstacle courses or to find objects. As in the various episodes of The Sims, we will have to pay attention to the physiological needs of the dog, represented graphically by some bars: hunger, thirst and the desire to cuddle, with the latter which must be ~satisfied~ by cuddling the puppy using the pointer, which turns into a hand and that we can move using the d-pad. The same method is applied when we have to wash the dog, while for the skill tests the developers have resorted to a control system strongly inspired by rhythm games, in which the right key sequence must be entered when indicated on the screen. At any moment we can access the game map and move to various places (the beach, the park, the stadium, the shop...), each of which has small missions to complete. When we earn money thanks to skill competitions, we will then be able to spend it in a shop to buy food (even of higher quality), toys, kennels and so on. As we progress, our apartment will fill up with puppies and we will have to try to follow them all in the same way. The technical realization of the game is excellent, in particular big steps forward have been made compared to the first episode. The graphics appear much cleaner and more detailed, the drawing style has improved and even the ~close-ups~ of the puppy when we want to cuddle him have improved. The use of colors is excellent, with well-differentiated settings based on the shades and an always lively and cheerful appearance. An excellent job has also been done with regard to the interface, which is always readable and intuitive. As often happens, the sound sector acts as a mere accompaniment and does not stand out too much, while the control system responds promptly and accurately to inputs. PRO Technically well done Readable and intuitive interface A large number of things to do AGAINST Very similar to the previous episode Challenge almost completely absent Sometimes repetitive", "date": "2008-09-22", "grade": "S.V."}
