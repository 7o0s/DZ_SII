{"name": "Fairy Tail", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fairy-tail-recensione.html", "text": "Written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima, Fairy Tail is a manga that has ended its run for some time now, after 63 volumes and over 300 animated episodes: it launched an author who was little known until then - he had only arrived in Italy a few years first with RAVE - and accompanied lovers of fantasy and the shonen genre for many years. Fairy Tail has never been a particularly revolutionary manga, and indeed it has pressed its hand on a healthy dose of Japanese clichs, but it has fascinated many fans who will probably have been happy to know that Gust was working on a video game tie-in, and a JRPG no less, rather than a musou or one of those arena fighting games that are so fashionable. Will this choice have saved Fairy Tail from the abyss of mediocrity in which these licenses usually sink? The story of a guild We'd like to start from the beginning, but unfortunately we can't because Fairy Tail begins in medias res with a titanic battle between a group of wizards and a very powerful sorcerer called Hades. It looks like a final battle, and in a certain sense it is, but it is clear that if you have never read a Fairy Tail volume you will understand little since the game begins around the two hundred and fiftieth chapter of the manga, practically when the protagonists are saved thanks to a spell that suspends them in time for seven years. The choice to start the game with the Grand Palio of Magic saga makes sense, because at this point in the story the Fairy Tail guild is practically starting from scratch, starting a sort of vertical progression that is reflected in the gameplay. In fact, in the world of Fairy Tail, magic is so common that many wizards form guilds in which to socialize and undertake lucrative missions, hunting down criminals or arcane artifacts. The story of Fairy Tail revolves around the members of the guild of the same name, in particular Natsu and Lucy, but it must be admitted that Hiro Mashima has a real talent in giving enough space to an avalanche of supporting actors who make this guild look like a sort of dysfunctional family . Unfortunately, however, the game loses a lot in terms of introspection and characterization. Developer Gust assumes that the player already knows the various members of the guild, relegating the essential information to a sort of encyclopedia, some superficial dialogue and side missions that deepen the links between some characters. The problem with the game, in fact, lies above all in the narration, which traces the history of the manga and the anime up to the saga of Tartaros, however resorting to a rigid and awkward direction which, in some cases, even cuts entire passages of the original plot, awkwardly summarizing some events. This is not only a disservice to the fans, who will at least be able to fill these holes with their knowledge of the series, but above all to those who don't know Fairy Tail and perhaps will have to retrieve the manga or anime to find out how the story ends in the unfortunate event that a sequel to the game does not come out. Old inside and out? Excluding some slightly more accurate cinematics, most of the time is spent between cloying dialogues - not that Fairy Tail has ever shone from this point of view, mind you - written in English and dubbed (often only partially) in Japanese, which the characters act accompanied by a handful of circumstantial animations. It is a setting that demonstrates the technical backwardness of a title which, moreover, had been postponed for a few months precisely so that Gust could finish it. And instead Fairy Tail, more often than not, seems to belong to the last generation. We tested it on PlayStation 4 Pro, noting some drops in frame rate in bare and poorly detailed scenarios, a slightly too obvious aliasing that dirty the polygonal models, sometimes unnatural animations, generally poor and obsolete effects. The cel shading effectively recalls Mashima's animated counterpart and artistic style, but we are far from the visual quality of titles like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. CyberConnect2 is certainly not an extraordinary developer, yet we have always admired the passion with which it draws on sources, trying to trace them as much as possible in respect of the fans for whom certain games are designed. With Fairy Tail, on the other hand, Gust limited himself to carrying out his homework, perhaps dedicating too much attention to a combat system that also works quite well, but which is not enough to revive the fortunes of a title that runs out in a matter of hours . Grow up and fight As we said, Fairy Tail has sunk in the Earthland guild ranking, represented in the game by a graph pRather eloquent: our goal will therefore be to bring the guild back to its former glory, undertaking missions after missions that raise it in the rankings. The progression in the storyline is therefore linked to the notoriety of the guild, a mechanism that forces the player to undertake repeatable side missions to reach the threshold necessary to unlock the following chapters. Sometimes you also have to complete a certain number of secondary objectives, improving the relationships between the characters or the services offered by the guild, for example the shop inside it or the alchemy corner. It's a repetitive loop that shows the flank right from the start: the side quests are very trivial and almost always boil down to reaching a certain map, exploring it for items or enemies to defeat, then automatically or manually returning to the guild to complete the mission . Exploration is marginal. The cities and external maps are few and restricted, with no particular interaction points, except for some inhabitants who will ask us for collectible items in exchange for a reward, mere fetch quests without dialogue or motivation. It is a pity to note such poverty of details, because all in all the strategic component concerning the growth of the characters and their management also appears interesting. The player can distribute the points earned by completing missions to upgrade the unlocked characters, so that they get new bonuses, costumes or specific skills that often attract a nice fanservice. Furthermore, the various characters cannot equip weapons or armor, but in their place there are Tears, artifacts that passively increase some parameters and which guarantee a minimal possibility of customization, especially once you learn how to synthesize them through alchemy. The combat system is quite intuitive, and guarantees a good variety in building the party thanks to the fifteen different playable characters. The clashes take place in turns and deploy our heroes, for a maximum of five, against a variable number of enemies, arranged on a kind of chessboard. Unlike many other JRPGs, Fairy Tail focuses the clashes above all on spells and special techniques that consume the canonical Magic Points: in short, melee attacks are the last resort, since they inflict very little damage. In fact, defeating enemies using the appropriate elemental spells partially restores the Magic Points consumed, and for this reason it is important to economize them by choosing the spells that will hit more spaces on the board, so as to damage or eliminate a greater number of targets. Some spells deal damage to two adjacent spaces, others to L-shaped or T-shaped spaces, and so on. Furthermore, each spell cast charges an indicator which, once the maximum level is reached, allows you to unload several chained attacks in a single turn, ending the combo with a very powerful and spectacular Finisher. A good strategy is to charge this indicator and keep it aside for when we have to face some boss or more insidious enemy than normal, or to wipe out a large number of enemies in a moment of difficulty. In short, the combat system is not revolutionary, but it does its duty and relies heavily on the fanservice: each spell is actually a small cinematic in which the magician on duty launches his attack by shouting it at the top of his lungs just like in the manga or anime . It's certainly a rewarding show for a fan, but it can get a little boring in the long run, especially when you repeat the same attacks over and over in longer fights and realize that, in the end, everyone looks a bit alike. terms of effectiveness.", "date": "2020-07-30", "grade": "6.0"}
