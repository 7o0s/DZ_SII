{"name": "Sega Superstars Tennis - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-superstars-tennis-recensione_a.html", "text": "Zombies, graffiti and samba There are several game modes and among all the Multiplayer one certainly stands out, both ~on~ and ~offline~, where up to four players can challenge each other in a personalized tournament and in ranked and non-ranked matches, and, for the single player, those called ~Superstar~ and ~Games~. The first is the heart of SST: the gamer selects his favorite character and makes him play a sort of championship divided into mini-tournaments, making him play within the sixteen arenas that make up the basic structure of this mode, with eight different tests for each terrain to be overcome to perhaps access new challenges, or unlock secret arenas and characters. The second, very entertaining, offers an interesting variant to the gameplay of the product. Zombies, graffiti and samba Show of colors In this ~mode~ there are in fact fourteen mini-games, each of which inspired by a SEGA game (Super Monkey Ball, Samba De Amigo, OutRun, etc) and in which each one has to face about ten levels of difficulty different. For example, in the mini-game inspired by House of the Dead (Curien Mansion) you have to hit the zombies that would otherwise advance against our characters with balls, while in the one dedicated to Jet Set Radio you have to collect cans of paint and throw a ball dye within small areas to be dyed to create graffiti. Returning to the discussion related to the online part, it is interesting to point out the possibility offered by the game of being able to watch other matches live on the web or the most spectacular exchanges of the day via TV mode. Graphically, the product offers a nice glance, even if upon careful analysis we realize that the game shows some gaps in this sense. For example, it doesn't feature new-generation, complex textures. They're simple enough, flat in places, though cleverly masked by the authentic burst of color that permeates the title visually. In fact, SST offers arenas, beautiful scenarios to the eye precisely because of the quality of the color palette chosen by the SEGA graphics. The latter is enhanced by the well-crafted lighting effects and the camera management system. The sound is also up to par with the production. It doesn't shock but it doesn't disappoint either, it does its ~duty~ well by giving the user excellent in-game samples and catchy songs perfectly themed with the game's settings. A playable title From what has been said, you can therefore deduce that the gameplay of SST is obviously more focused on the cartoonish component than on the simulation one, with a particular eye for everything concerning the spectacularity and fantasy of the individual moves of the characters. So much so that the buttons used to perform the various shots are reduced to the bone (two for normal shots, and one for the special one) for greater simplification of the controls. In these phases the only flaw found was in the AI of the teammates, in the event of a double challenge with one of the two members of our team controlled by the CPU or of certain opponents, sometimes bordering on stupidity, and in the clumsiness of some ~athletes~, which makes them useless for the purposes of the game, reducing them to the role of secondary characters to be selected from time to time just to see them at work. Playstation 2 The PlayStation 2 version of Sega Superstars Tennis features, compared to the Next-Gen counterpart, a lower quality graphics engine, with less bright colors and limited definition. However we are dealing with a product which, compatibly with the hardware on which it runs, is quite valid, and which, apart from the online mode, is practically structurally similar to the counterpart on PlayStation 3. Comment SEGA Superstar Tennis is the classic sports spin-off of different series, a title that is not very innovative and which certainly does not bring a breath of freshness to the sector. But that doesn't mean it's not a good product. After all, it was certainly not designed to upset the world of video games or to be elected ~game of the year~, but rather to offer users normal, healthy entertainment. And it is precisely here that the strength of SST lies, in its not wanting to take itself too seriously, in its wanting to simply be cheerful, carefree, colorful, offering many noteworthy aspects, such as mini-games and bonuses to unlock. Perhaps by approaching the game to those who usually avoid this form of entertainment because it is considered complex or not suitable for their age. Perfect, therefore, as a party game. Pros: Simple and fun Very colorful and lively graphics Well done minigames Cons: The level of challenge is limited Artificial intelligence to be reviewed Some characters are practically unusableili Nintendo Wii There are three different ways to control on-screen characters available on the Nintendo console. It is possible to use a standard configuration borrowed from the other console versions, where the Wiimote is used in a horizontal position as if it were a normal joypad and thus leaving the movement detection completely deactivated, or it is possible to exploit the peculiarities of the Wii controller. The Wiimote can in fact be used alone to simulate the movement of the racket and, in this case, the character is moved automatically by the AI in a style completely identical to that seen with Wii Tennis, or you can also use the Nunchuck to move manually the tennis player on the court. In both cases, the A and B buttons, if pressed individually during the racket stroke, allow you to respectively execute a lob or a short shot at the net, while used simultaneously they allow you to activate the character's secret move. In the two modes that exploit the peculiarities of the Wiimote, the control is very intuitive but at the same time extremely accurate since not only will it be necessary to be extremely precise with the times to mimic the racket stroke without going empty, but it will also be necessary to hit properly forehand or backhand with a correct angle to give power to the ball and direct it according to one's will.", "date": "2008-04-23", "grade": null}
