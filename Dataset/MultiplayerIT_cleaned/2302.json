{"name": "Age of Empires II: Gold Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-ii-gold-edition.html", "text": "RTS TO THE NEXT POWER Since that day I think I have played and finished every RTS (which for the less informed stands for Real Time Strategy) that has appeared on the face of the Earth, but my enthusiasm was immediately captured by one in particular, a slightly different from the mass and produced by a house that at the time meant only operating systems and applications to me: Microsoft. This game was Age of Empires. THAT SOMETHING MORE... I don't know what captured me so much about that game. Perhaps the realistic setting, in which warriors armed with clubs took the place of the futuristic Sonic Tanks of Dune 2, perhaps the diversification of the resources to be collected, which introduced completely different tactical scenarios. Or maybe because it was the first game I tried on the internet with friends, whose ~real~ intelligence was much harder to beat than the computer's artificial one. The fact is that over the years many CD-ROMs have passed over my desk, but those of Age of Empires and its successors (which we will see shortly) always have their fixed and guaranteed place next to the monitor. THAT SOMETHING MORE... Imagine my excitement when Age of Kings was released, the first official sequel excluding the ~Rise of Rome~ expansion. New civilizations to choose from, new military units, new single player campaigns... a must for anyone like me who adored its predecessor. And the same goes for ~The Conquerors~, the first expansion for Age of Kings. Still more civilizations and units, vastly improved artificial intelligence, substantial upgrades to the user interface. As often happens with the games that have made the history of a genre, today Microsoft offers in a single package (even at the PRICE of a package!) these last 2 masterpieces, under the name of ~Age of Empires II: Gold Edition~ . THE BIRTH OF AN EMPIRE: FOOD, GOLD, WOOD, STONE For the few who don't know the series, let's briefly see how the game is structured. The basis is the classic RTS one, so we should collect resources such as gold, food, stone and wood with our ~villagers~ to be able to build other buildings and units. A novelty compared to other rts is the structuring of the game in ~epochs~. The game is divided into 4 successive epochs, from the high Middle Ages to the Imperial age, and it will be necessary to accumulate many resources before being able to move from one epoch to another. The passage allows the construction of more powerful units than the previous ones, and the research of new technologies to improve units and buildings. Once a university has been built in the age of castles, we could research technologies such as ballistics, chemistry, loopholes for castles, and many other more or less necessary things depending on the tactics we intend to use in the continuation of the battle. As I said before, the diversification of the resources to be collected places the player in front of important choices right from the early stages of the game. Do we want to try to overwhelm the enemy immediately? Under with gold and food to be able to create warriors of various types (including elite infantry, pikemen, armored camels, war elephants and horse archers, to name a few). Do we want to disturb its economy by killing its villagers? Wood and food will do for us to be able to build various types of archers and attack from a distance. Are we convinced pacifists? A good amount of stone will be needed to build defensive turrets to protect us from enemy attacks. Obviously these are just examples of possible strategies to follow, the choice is substantially limited only by the player's imagination and tactical ability. THE BIRTH OF AN EMPIRE: FOOD, GOLD, WOOD, STONE Another fundamental thing to take into consideration is that the same unit does not always have the same attack strength. A pikeman, for example, is quite poor at attacking infantry, but is lethal against any type of cavalry. Archers are very strong against warriors of various types, but become very vulnerable to attacks by light infantry equipped with shields and spears. Basically, each unit is very strong against one type of unit and very weak against another. This means that we can forget the old tactic of amassing the most powerful units available and overwhelm the enemy, as is the case in all other games of the genre. We can also create a vast army of paladins, the most powerful non-siege unit in the game, but our opponent will just need to create an equally numerous army of halberdiers (enhanced version of pikemen), among other things less expensive, and our dreams of glory will break very quickly... MODE OFGAME FOR ALL TASTES Although the multiplayer mode is undoubtedly the most captivating, there are numerous game modes even for those who do not have an internet connection (few...) or a small LAN at home (many...). The most classic mode is that of the military campaign, which is a series of missions one after the other of increasing difficulty. Age of empires II offers 4 campaigns plus a training campaign, and to be precise the Joan of Arc, Genghis Khan, Saladin and Barbarossa + William Wallace training campaign, which somehow reproduce the historical events that led to the rise of the characters mentioned. GAME MODES FOR ALL TASTES The difficulty level is perfectly calibrated and be sure that these campaigns will keep you busy for a very long time. The Conquerors offers 4 other campaigns dedicated to the great conquerors of history: Montezuma, Attila the Hun, El Cid and others. For those who want to try something different, there are completely new game modes: ~King of the Hill~, in which we have to take possession of a monument in the center of the map and keep possession of it, ~Sviluppo Meraviglie~, in which the only objective is to build a wonder first, and ~Wonder Defense~ , in which a single player owns a walled wonder and must defend it from enemy attacks, ~Regicide~, in which the death of one's king brings about one's end and ~Match to the last Blood~, in which everything is centered on war and the economy takes a back seat. In short, there is something for all tastes ... GOLD EDITION? YES PLEASE! To make the package even more attractive, in the ~Gold Edition~ version there are not only the two games mentioned above, but also beautiful recorded games played by champions (The_Sheriff and maimin_matty are a sort of myth for those who usually play on The Zone , Microsoft's online game service) really very very useful for learning the secrets of the game, as well as a large number of additional maps that never hurt. GOLD EDITION? YES PLEASE! To my great pleasure, opening the box, I didn't find the usual brochure passed off as a manual to which I had recently gotten used to, but a full-bodied and exhaustive double guide (on one side for Age II, and turning it backwards for The Conquerors!) as well as a ~map~ of all developable technologies and a summary of all unit attack bonuses towards each other. Really useful, I must say! AND FINALLY... I honestly can't think of what more to expect from a real-time strategy game: the graphics are the best you can imagine for a 2d game. It certainly doesn't compare to the three-dimensional glories of Emperor: Battle for Dune or the more recent Empire Earth but I played Age of Empires 2 on a Pentium 200 MMX without the slightest problem, which I don't think is true for the other two titles mentioned. The sound is beautiful, completely dubbed in Italian and above all in an extraordinary way. Just listen to the voice of introduction to the campaign of Attila the Hun to believe ... I really got the chills! The user interface is simple, intuitive and fully configurable (I strongly suggest you memorize the hot keys, it's really worth it). AND FINALLY... In conclusion, I highly recommend the purchase to all lovers of real-time strategic games, but even those more inclined to ~slow~ or turn-based games will certainly not disdain a game every now and then, thanks to the not excessive frenetic action. If, on the other hand, strategists aren't exactly your forte, this game could prove to be an excellent reason to change your mind. RTS TO THE NEXT POWER I still remember the circumstances that brought the box of Dune 2 into my (at the time) placid little hands. I had to get blood tests done, and having a mortal fear of needles, I asked my mother for a little gift in return (as the little blackmailer's manual teaches ). I remember the following month I spent finishing the game with all three houses, and once I finished I started all over again (so much free time!)", "date": "2001-12-20", "grade": null}
