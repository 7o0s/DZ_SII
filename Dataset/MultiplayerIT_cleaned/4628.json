In the indie field, initiatives that are closest to the parody genre often find space, and given the rarity of these, we welcome them gladly, especially if they tend to make fun of the videogame industry itself. This is precisely the case of GameDev Empire, a clicker that puts us in control of a rising star of development and transforms the noble art of creating video games into a frenzied click between various menus, with a smile on his lips (at least at first) . A humorous vision of this environment was also provided by the always valid Game Dev Story by Kairosoft, but the cut in the case of GameDev Empire is much more incisive and sanguine: where the oriental production limited itself to playing on some clichs of the videogame panorama, keeping to the typical cuteness of the team's productions, the Tiny Games game goes into more detail, proposing caricatures of famous characters from the development with lots of mangled names and surnames, parodies of games in mini-game version to be used to get additional bonuses and make fun of a bit of all the mechanics of the current industry, its schematic system of genres and the way of marketing between traditional channels and social media. Now, one might laugh at the fact that the game presents this mockery in the form of a clicker game, which is one of the most alienating and fiendishly compulsive genres that the industry has spawned, except that as a clicker you actually take the hell out of serious. GameDev Empire makes fun of the entire gaming industry and a little bit of ourselves too The Click Factory GameDev Empire is therefore a pure clicker, with some digression provided by the mini-games which are useful for increasing the available budget but are, to say the least, basic in terms of structure. Guided by a sort of guiding spirit in the shape of Gabe Newell (obviously) we find ourselves trying to grow the business of our software house enormously, starting from a simple garage company to make it a sort of billion-dollar corporation, which moreover, it takes place within a few minutes of the game. All this happens by simply clicking on the buttons that appear on the screen and represent the different projects to be carried out in the software house or the collateral actions to be taken to promote the various titles, such as tweeting comments or taking initiatives always concerning social media and the like to collect new followers . As the different genres to be developed are progressively unlocked (similar to what happens in Game Dev Story) we find ourselves having to carry out several projects at the same time: at this point, instead of continuing to click continuously on the increasingly numerous buttons on the screen it is possible to hire various developers to do it for you, leaving you with the sole task of investing in multipliers and taking part in the various secondary activities. Therefore, various caricatures of famous developers enter the scene with mangled names that we can thus employ in our employ, while we try to further expand the business by increasing the production speed and the amount of projects in progress. Some variation to the simple click comes from the possibility of taking part in mini-games, in turn inspired by some particularly successful mobile or classic game, but these are obviously reductions to the minimum terms that are used to have a couple of additional laughs. What is much less funny about GameDev Empire is its continuous reference to micro-transactions, which are really everywhere, as well as advertising videos that soon become an integral part of the gameplay to get additional money or even simply to turn off the annoying notifications that they go out of their way to push us towards these monetization schemes.", "date": "2017-10-06", "grade": "6.0"}
