{"name": "Unreal Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-championship_a.html", "text": "Goal XBox Live Unreal Championship was born as a multiplayer game and was designed to give its best on XBox Live. It is therefore not easy to find a term of judgment for a title that promises to excite when played online but which does not seem to have much to offer for offline or single player play. Nonetheless, I think it's pretty easy to predict that Unreal Championship could become a formidable killer application, when online gaming becomes a reality in Europe as well. Until then, however, it will not be possible to participate in online deathmatches, capable of hosting up to 16 human players, or to download unpublished maps, characters and new options from the web. So what does Unreal Championship have to offer right now? An all in all fun single-player mode and a multiplayer one that, via split screen, can give hours and hours of fun to four players, willing to beat each other up. But let's find out together in more detail the constituent parts of this new Unreal. The tournament can begin The single-player game consists of a series of team matches that see us pitted against other teams in an attempt not only to overcome individual challenges, but also to reach the end of a real tournament. The game scheme re-proposes the structure of some sports games for consoles or, better still, some fighting games. The tournament begins with the composition of our team, with the choice of the name, the logo, the character we control and five other teammates who will become our allies in the conquest of the final victory. The characters belong to six different races, each characterized by peculiar abilities: Anubans, Automatons, Gen Mo'Kai, Juggernauts, Mercenaries and Nightmare. Physical characteristics such as speed, agility and acrobatic skills combine with precision, resistance and power to form very distinct classes and able to provide a different contribution to team play. Each challenge of the tournament features not only a different game arena (there are more than 25), but also a different mode. In addition to the classic Dethmatch and the team variant, Capture the flag, Survival and the new, or almost new, Double Domination and Bombing Run could not be missing. The latter two deserve particular attention since they represent a novelty for Unreal. Double Domination is the evolution of Domination, already appeared in the past in Unreal. The goal is to simultaneously take control of two checkpoints for at least ten seconds, defending them from attacks by the opposing team. Bombing Run, on the other hand, represents a real sporting discipline, the aim of which is to take possession of a ball, actually a bomb, and to throw it inside a ring located in the opponent's base. Having tried Deaththrow, you will not struggle to find similarities with the Ubi Soft title. On balance, the gaming experience offered by the single-player is certainly fun and compelling but certainly not able to captivate for a long time. Soul is always multiplayer Something more interesting instead comes from the multiplayer game which, although it cannot yet take advantage of XBox Live, undoubtedly represents the strength of Unreal Championship. Through the same maps unlocked in the singleplayer, it is possible to challenge up to three friends in encounters with a significant adrenaline-pumping impact on our nervous system. I got to try all the modes available and I have to admit that I have rarely reached such levels of excitement in a console shooter. As far as playability is concerned, Unreal Championship succeeds perfectly in the enterprise of transferring the winning and tested game system of the first-person game born on the computer to the console. The arenas, on a single level or developed on several floors or in intricate tunnels, provide the perfect setting and the stimulus that leads to hide, to hide behind artificial structures, plants and rocks or to seek, chase, ~sniff~ the fear of opponents, who flee intimidated by our firepower. However, it is not only the latter that makes the difference in Unreal Championship. The tactical component is, in fact, extremely important and, in many cases, knowing how to exploit the structure of certain settings or the abilities of the characters controlled by us proves to be fundamental, able to provide offensive or coverage. The weapons available derive partly from the tradition of Unreal and partly represent innovations compared to Unreal Tournament. They range from the inevitable machine guns to bio-guns, from energy weapons to the very powerful rocket launcher capable of firing up to three missiles simultaneously. In short, there is something for all tastes and I don't think there is a lack of other weapons present in Unreal Tournament 2003 too much. Each weapon has a double fire function, which can be activated by pressing the right trigger rather that of the left one. The choice of the control system is particularly happy, taking up, almost entirely, the control already used in Halo. Mouse and keyboard are therefore not regretted and, in case you want to experiment with an alternative solution, it is possible at any moment of the game to modify the control settings to your liking, assigning the desired function to each key and editing the sensitivity of the analog sticks . An ~unreal~ graphic From a technical point of view, Unreal Championship achieves excellence thanks to a level of detail rarely admired on consoles. The arenas are beautifully made, characterized by appreciable polygonal constructions, very detailed textures, albeit not up to those admired in the PC counterpart, by many small details that make every corner of the screen glitter. However, not everything works as it should and I am referring in particular to the primitive and insufficient animations of the characters and to the rather hiccup framerate, which in some cases becomes annoying. No problem, however, as regards the audio sector, which always gives us spot-on music and very spectacular sound effects. Note that the game has been entirely localized in our language, so expect texts and dialogues in Italian. Comment Unreal Championship is undoubtedly an excellent title even if the final judgment can take on a different weight based on the use made of the game. Fun but limited in singleplayer, exciting in multiplayer, the shooter of the Digital Extremes instead promises to become a must-buy if you are willing to go down the road of online gaming next March. But there is still time for XBox Live and at the moment the purchase of Unreal Championship is recommended only if you have 4 joypads and three friends willing to sell dearly in deathmatch to the death. Pros: Unreal on XBox! Well-implemented control Addictive, painful, bad as ever Great multiplayer mode XBox Live support Cons: The usual Unreal Some slowdowns Limited single-player mode XBox discovers the myth of Unreal The myth of Unreal, one of the most popular shooters on the PC scene, has finally landed on XBox in a new version specially designed for the Microsoft console. We are not dealing with the conversion of the highly acclaimed Unreal Tournament 2003 but with an original game that tries to marry all the characteristic elements of the Epic Games shooter with the features of XBox, its controller and especially the new game service Microsoft online. In recent days, XBox Live was inaugurated in North America and with it a new gaming philosophy which, in the coming years, will try to make online gaming the favorite pastime of console owners. Unreal Championship is proposed as the most representative title, certainly the most important, of the XBox Live launch line-up. A little less than four months after the debut in Europe of XBox Live, the shooter developed by Digital Extremes also arrives in the old continent with more than warlike intentions. Looking forward to March 14, will we be able to find enough attractions in this game?", "date": "2002-11-20", "grade": null}
