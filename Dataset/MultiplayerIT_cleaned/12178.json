{"name": "Bonk's Return", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bonks-return.html", "text": "Bonk's Return is prefigured as an extremely classic platformer, which does not intend to remove or add anything to the spirit of the original PC Engine version. The result is immediately noticeable after a few minutes of play, during which the old school nature of the Hudson title comes out in all its glory. Indeed, Bonk's Return has the innate virtue of being a very simple product, which makes it a perfect mobile game and a faithful tribute to the gameplay of the past at the same time. In the role of the bald protagonist, all the user has to do is jump from platform to platform, collect bonuses and head-butt enemies, in an adventure that sees Bonk busy rescuing the princess from the clutches of the evil Drool. The game is divided into a series of stages - not very many, actually - interspersed with nice static sequences of dialogue between Bonk and the bad guy, who most of the time insult each other in a decidedly original and amusing way. In addition to the main Story Mode, the Two Tribes work also offers a section dedicated to a handful of challenges (climbing, crazy race, soft race, volcano) complete with scoreboards that help increase the longevity of the title. As is evident, Bonk's Return does not surprise with special effects, but instead puts a simple but tasty dish on the plate: the Hudson product is in fact very fun, in fact proving to be one of the few recently released platformers capable of really involving the player. Thanks to an effective play structure, a level design worthy of the name and an intuitive and functional control system, without forgetting the important role played by the graphic creation. The guys at Two Tribes have done a really good job, bringing to the screen a version of Bonk that is instantly recognizable by aficionados of the series (enemies, bonuses and scenarios are always the same) and at the same time up to today's cosmetic standards of mobile gaming : excellent in particular the animations of the protagonist, fluid and numerous, but great credit must also be given to the generous dimensions of the sprites and the impeccable use of colours. The technical prowess of Bonk's Return is only affected by a too little sound sector, even if the Hudson product should be commended for being one of the few mobile titles to include the highly appreciated volume adjustment option.
