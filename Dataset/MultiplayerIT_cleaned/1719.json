{"name": "The Mark of Kri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-mark-of-kri-2.html", "text": "The first innovations are found precisely in the combat system, certainly difficult at first, but particularly satisfying and profound after having done the necessary practice: with the right analog key we will be able to lock up to three enemies at the same time (although in reality with the advanced weapons this number may increase), each of which will be assigned to the square, circle and x buttons of the Dual Shock. When these buttons are pressed, we will attack the corresponding enemy, even if this is behind us or to the side; we will therefore have to worry about parrying any blows or getting around the enemy's shields, regardless of the position. In the event that one of the keys that can be assigned to enemies is free, it can be used in conjunction with the others to perform devastating and often very bloody, as well as spectacular, combos. The weapons that Rau will use during the adventure will in any case allow the use of different tactics, the sword for example can be used to launch fast but not very powerful attacks, while the bow for assaults from a distance, or the ax, in capable of slicing even thickly armored enemies. The faithful crow Kuzo will not only accompany our protagonist, but will be of vital importance during the adventure; in fact, it can be used to activate some gears that would otherwise be inaccessible and will act as a third eye for Rau, as he can be sent ahead on some raised ledges and anticipate his master's moves, providing him with a clear view of what awaits him and above all allowing him to act (when possible) without getting caught. Yes, because in The Mark of Kri there will also be a very strong stealth component, even advocated in some situations and towards enemies equipped with a sort of horn, which if they discover you, they will not be slow to use to attract other fighters, putting you clearly outnumbered. In fact, the San Diego team aimed to make the gaming experience very varied and not fossilized on a single fighting style, and to make up for a certain linearity of the levels, it decided to give the player all the characteristics of the title by continuing in the adventure and not entirely at the beginning; moreover, each level has a different setting from the previous one, and if, for example, in the first we will be able to use the sword as the purest slash'em up, in the second we will have to use mainly the bow and arrows, in the third we will have to act more silently possible, and so on. The idea of the Californian team therefore succeeds in its intent, and during the game sessions of The Mark of Kri the repetitiveness will never peep out, indeed perhaps the brevity of the adventure will clip the wings of the title in its highest peak. To make the gaming experience more attractive, the programmers have seen fit to implement some sub-challenges within the levels, such as the recovery of a particular artifact or the elimination of a certain number of enemies using a precise technique, which will unlock new costumes, arenas for one-on-one combat and other little secrets that will try to exponentially increase the longevity of this game. Some problems derive from the camera, not always precise in its movements, and in the selection of the weapon, which we cannot define as really comfortable. The weapon change itself takes place slowly, but it must be said that all the weapons are present (and visible) on the protagonist's back, and therefore the time required to change weapons is realistic. Ars Technique The hand of designers who grew up within Disney and under the guidance of Don Bluth can be seen from the very first steps we will take in the adventure, with fairy-tale and very atmospheric landscapes that collide with a game scheme and very marked violence: one strange mix that eventually makes it to perfection. Rau's animations are multiple, fluid and convincing, and the design of the enemies is of a high level, but they cannot count on a substantial number of polygons. Some slowdown can be seen in the presence of a large number of opponents, but otherwise the graphics engine moves without too many problems, ensuring good general performance. It should be noted that during the uploads, various very inspired artworks will be displayed, which will transform into the same entirely polygonal scene, which starts the level. The dubbing, completely in Italian, can count on a good narrative voice, but on a rather coarse translation of the texts, especially for the terms used. The music dynamically adapts to the situations in the game, and goes very well with the scenario that the player will be exploring. Definitely... The Mark of Kri succeeds in itthe difficult attempt to propose an original and very varied action/adventure, able to gratify the player until its completion and to offer a pleasant and fun game mechanic. A few more levels probably wouldn't have hurt, but beyond a non-astronomical longevity, the San Diego Studios game is a brilliant and proud exponent of the action adventure genre.Pros Original combat system A lot of variety in tackling the levels Game plan captivating Cons Not overly long Some issues with weapon selection The emblem, what a problem The Kri emblem is an ancient artifact that actually hides a very powerful spell capable of linking the real world with that of darkness and thus acting as a vehicle for the forces of evil and their incessant thirst for power. In order to prevent this misfortune, the emblem was stolen in the past and divided into six parts, entrusted to as many families. Unfortunately, the weight of this burden is great for those who keep it, not to mention that there is someone who wants to reunite these six fragments and thus recall the terrible spell... At this point you, or rather your alter ego, come into play. Rau, mighty and rough fighter, accompanied by his trusty crow Kuzo, who will play a very important role for our hero. Through six long levels you will have to discover the reason for your involvement in this story, where you usually play a crucial role. The game proposed by San Diego Studios (internal studio of SCEA) has been repeatedly referred to as an entirely polygonal with linear development. In reality, this definition is quite close to The Mark of Kri since the adventure component is clearly visible, as are the efforts made by the Californian team in an attempt to propose a control system that is at least original and not obvious, as well as a game mechanic as repetitive as possible.", "date": "2003-03-19", "grade": null}
