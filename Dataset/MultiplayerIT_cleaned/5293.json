{"name": "Tripletta BioShock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174025-bioshock-the-collection-tripletta-bioshock.html", "text": "Rapture, an allegory of capitalism and the abyss of mankind, hope suffocated by ambition, a glittering place populated by unspeakable horrors created by wicked enthusiasts of the most unbridled individualism. The cream of society turning into a monstrous species of parasites (and we're not even on Wall Street), controlled by men of genius who have created their own little kingdoms at the bottom of the ocean. Released in 2007 on PC and Xbox 360 (on PlayStation 3 it arrived the following year), BioShock shook the world of video games, becoming yet another hope to see them transformed into something more than a technological pastime for bored people. Ken Levine, the director of the game (is it appropriate to start translating director with director?) had collected the experience gained with Thief: The Dark Project and System Shock 2 and had merged it into a modern and deep shooter, shaped from the expert hands of his studio, the Irrational Games. BioShock was its mechanics, but also artistic vision that permeated every element. Not for nothing has it become one of the most iconic titles of the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation, giving us incredible characters such as Andrew Ryan, Atlas, the Big Daddies, the Little Sisters and the protagonist, unwitting victim of a bigger plot, who finds himself reluctantly determining the fate of Rapture. BioShock 2, developed by 2K Marine and released in 2010, is the worst chapter of the trilogy. In reality it's not a bad shooter, but it falls into the classic trap of wanting to add details to a story that doesn't need them and, on the contrary, the more it is weighed down, the more fragile it becomes. Ken Levine did not enter the project which he has always looked on with a certain condescension. The protagonist is a Big Daddy looking for his little sister. The journey he will make will lead him to cross new areas of Rapture and to fight against new opponents. Paradoxically, it has better action moments than the first chapter, but it is precisely the plot that makes it superfluous. The whole project is perfectly represented by the Big Sisters: female versions of the Big Daddies, they are very strong opponents and very fun to face. Too bad they are also conceptually ridiculous. Last is BioShock Infinite, arguably the most troubled of the three games. According to the chronicles, the development has undergone several jolts and in the end 2K forced Levine to close everything, with showy compromises in terms of gameplay stratification, much more linear than what should have been in the original intentions. Yet Columbia is a fascinating place that alone holds up the entire title and the experience has still allowed Irrational to pack solid and multifaceted gameplay. The plot is quite intricate and tells of detective Booker DeWitt who must search and bring back to New York a girl named Elizabeth, held captive somewhere in the floating city of Columbia, founded by the prophet Zachary Hale Comstock. In reality, by playing it turns out that nothing is what it seems and between one twist and another we arrive at a surreal ending that is further developed in two DLCs, the excellent Burial at The Sea 1 and 2. We have reviewed BioShock: The Collection: definitive experience or just a mere commercial operation? Remastering The BioShock Collection collects the three chapters of the series, with related DLCs, and offers them in revised versions from a graphic point of view. The major work was done above all with the first two chapters, for which many textures were redone and advanced post-processing effects were added. Above all, the lighting system has been completely revised, adding lights here and there that greatly improve the overall atmosphere. In short, Raputre has never been so creepy and well lit. On the other hand the 3D models have remained the same, so don't expect who knows what else. BioShock Infinite received a similar treatment on consoles, while on PC it remained identical to the one released in 2013. In fact it is the title that most of all showed a deep technological gap between the console and PC versions, a gap now filled on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. However, the result is the most obvious one, namely that we are faced with three titles that are more beautiful to see than the original editions, but identical in content, apart from a few extras. In fact, those who have already played them will then have very little motivation to take them back. Of course, the three games arrive complete with all DLC and all the content published post-launch, such as the Test Chambers or the museum with the sketches and models discarded for the finished game (it's not new, since it was included in the collection Ultimate Rapture Edition). The only real novelty is the comment by Ken Levine in the first BioShock. Sure it's interesting to listen to, but it's a little bit. The PC versions deserve a separate discussion. Given as a gift to those who already owned the originals, they offer a few more graphic options, but nothing that makes you cry for a miracle. Even the support for 4K leaves its time, while it's a bit sad to find some of the original bugs, a sign that apart from textures and resolution, the work done is really minimal. Could more be done? Definitely yes, especially to entice old players to return to Rapture and Columbia. As it stands the BioShock Collection opens up a large discussion of what its target audience is, a discussion we'll address in the commentary.", "date": "2016-09-19", "grade": "8.5"}
