Despite these difficult environmental conditions, the French software house wanted to engage in the search for a winning solution, and we would be happy to say that it hit the spot right away. The money is out Creating a new world must certainly not be an easy task, but creating a strategic Wii worthy of the name is obviously a more affordable conquest, given the apparent fluency with which the developers of Blue Byte and Keen Games have managed to offer all user a complete package from all points of view. Year: Create a New World is notably detached from the complexity of the original PC series, and even with the necessary simplifications of the case, it does not struggle to become the best representative for Wii of the strategic genre in the strict sense (hybrids such as the excellent Little King's Story). Let's analyze the reasons for this success. The Ubisoft product has as its secret weapon a highly sought-after balance of each of its playful elements, a factor that makes progress in the adventure both simple and rewarding. The user takes on the role of a prince commissioned by the king to find new territories and transform them into efficient agglomerations dedicated to the production of wealth, in order to make up for the serious difficulties of the kingdom. Set foot on a boat, our protagonist must therefore set out to conquer a vast series of islets, which in fact constitute the stages of which the Story Mode is composed: the choice of such limited settings is anything but casual, given that it has twice the aim of making it easier to visualize the territory and at the same time to force the player to make the most of the limited space available. It is not simply a question of juxtaposing the various buildings, but it is necessary to constantly take into account a whole series of factors: citizens, for example, demand houses that are close to buildings of public utility such as the church or the market, while farms and various production plants require land that can guarantee a satisfactory influx of raw materials. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of a management system that hides a very noble depth, softened for newbies by the presence of various advisers who can promptly indicate the best path to follow. Building is sweet to me in this sea Continuing to praise the excellent balance of Anno: Create a New World, it must be said that progress in the adventure is carefully divided between pure and simple exploration moments and phases of construction and maintenance of one's possessions, without disdaining some pleasant naval battles: the pace of the game always stands at appreciable levels, and it is difficult to find yourself yawning or waiting tiredly to reach your target of gold coins to move on to the next step. Another arrow in the bow of the Ubisoft product is represented by the presence of two distinct modes, which in fact constitute two extremely different approaches to the playful experience: the Story Mode could therefore be defined as a long tutorial, divided between various missions with specific objectives in which the user is punctually assisted by the valuable advice of his virtual collaborators. Conversely, the Continuous Play Mode more closely resembles the classic Sim City setting, with the player having to ~only~ worry about building an ever-growing empire step by step, making sure to always keep it healthy. As we have mentioned, there are many parameters and statistics to keep an eye on, but Anno: Create a New World manages to make everything extremely intuitive thanks to a truly excellent interface and a very intelligent control system. which manages to compress all the necessary actions using only the pointing the Remote and the two keys A and B. As if that were not enough, the work Blue Byte and Keen Games also offers a visual impact of decidedly higher quality than that of its direct competitors: framed by an always reliable virtual camera, the scenario it showcases detailed and colorful constructions, and there is no shortage of little gems such as the frenetic comings and goings of freight wagons through the city streets. If you really want to find fault with Anno: Create a New World, you couldto say that the simplification of the control system paradoxically makes some processes a little too cumbersome, and that the global difficulty level is really laughable for anyone used to a ~real~ strategy game: really little for a title from which many developers should take example.", "date": "2009-06-26", "grade": "8.4"}
