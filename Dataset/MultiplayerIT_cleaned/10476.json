Therefore, the decision taken by EA to transform the original ~life simulator~ into an action adventure, or rather this Spore Hero that we are about to review, is not surprising. Supermassive black hole Spore Hero combines the aforementioned genre variation with a narrative dimension unknown to the original PC title, essential for any action game worthy of the name. In this case, the EA product opens with a sequence that sees two asteroids crashing on a peaceful planet inhabited by a plethora of bizarre creatures: from the first emerges what will become the protagonist of the game, from the other his direct nemesis, a being endowed with a dark power capable of making anyone who approaches him lose his mind. The final objective of the adventure will therefore be to remedy the chaos that has arisen, restoring the world to its original tranquility. Right from the start of the game, the handful of main features that Spore Hero ends up repeating cyclically for the entire duration of the playful experience are evident. We are therefore faced with a third-person action adventure, to be tackled by exploring the areas into which the planet is divided, talking to NPCs, completing quests, obtaining various upgrades and power-ups and fighting against those who should prove hostile. In some respects, Spore Hero does a decent job when it comes to user engagement: the scenarios are well constructed, and provided with a proper juxtaposition of missions, minigames, secrets and so on. In short, there are many things to do, with an eye to the global variety: the quests that we find ourselves solving often fall within the ambit of skill tests, including rhythm games, semi-sports competitions (racing obstacles, speed races, etc.) and some simple puzzles mostly of an environmental nature. However, the balance of difficulty between the different activities is not equally positive: if most of them fall within the canons of casual gaming, in some cases we have experienced dizzying and unjustified wheelies capable of making some sections decidedly frustrating. Another problem of Spore Hero is then constituted by the evident watering down of the playful experience, implemented by the developers forcing the player to repeat the same activity too many times in order to achieve a goal: a really clumsy attempt to hide the short duration of the adventure , and which can be a serious problem at times when it involves the -many- minigames that lack a genuine fun or challenge factor. Cosmetic Surgery As we had already anticipated in the preview phase, the real flagship of Spore Hero is the editor that allows you to create and modify the protagonist, in fact a reduced version of the original PC game but still impressive for the freedom left to the user. After choosing a standard shape for the trunk of our creature, you can literally indulge yourself by adding limbs and appendages everywhere (mouths on the belly, eyes behind the back, arms on the head are just a few examples), also establishing the extension with a few simple moves. It's just a pity that all this abundance has little influence on the game economy: if we exclude some minigames that involve the use of the editor to solve the problems of some creatures by modifying their physiognomy, the interesting tool has a little more than aesthetic. Sure, it can be fun to watch the awkward movements of a creature with three disproportionate legs, but it's truly impromptu entertainment. Spore Hero's upgrade system also ends up further stripping the user's time spent with the editor of value. In essence, the new parts with which to enhance the creature they are obtained as a reward for solved quests or are found hidden within the scenarios: the fact is that to continue the adventure you are forced to equip your character with certain attributes, making the changes to its structure basically piloted. If the aspects described so far Spore Hero have been of fluctuating quality, the same cannot be said of the combat system, placed as one of the fundamental pillars of the gameplay (it is no coincidence that it has a special section in the main menuipale) but which is tragically the worst feature of the entire play package. The skirmishes between the creatures take the form of a cheesy beat'em up in matches, and are resolved in a button smashing without art or part that gets boring immediately and which unfortunately repeats itself with nagging frequency for the duration of the game. On the technical front, however, Spore Hero carries out its work in a positive way, offering a pleasant graphic creation and a sound sector that is up to par. In short, without infamy and without praise, a comment that all in all can summarize the entire value of EA's production.", "date": "2009-10-09", "grade": "6.8"}
