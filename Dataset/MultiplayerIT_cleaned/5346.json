The balances established over the course of a generation can be upset with the transition to new platforms, forcing developers to make sometimes drastic choices. The problem is mainly accused by the teams involved with franchises that offer annual releases, such as the many sports that populate the market: among these we also find F1 2016, on which we finally draw conclusions today with our review. A year ago, the Codemasters simulation arrived on the market without the Career mode, the most loved by fans, thus bitterly disappointing those who were anxiously waiting to see the first chapter of the F1 series arriving on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Collecting the feedback from the many Formula 1 fans and taking advantage of a fairly calm year in the evolution of the real championship regulations, the Codemasters developers were able to devote themselves to bringing their creature back to its former glory: after the good impressions gathered in recent months , the time has finally come for the final verdict. After a crash a year ago, F1 2016 puts the Codemasters franchise back on track! Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 50 F1 2016 Trophies, divided into 1 platinum, 2 gold, 10 silver and 37 bronze. Among the latter we invariably find one linked to the new Baku circuit, where to complete 10 laps, together with others linked to the various aspects of the game. Particular attention goes to the Career mode, where for example choosing a team between Force India, Toro Rosso, McLaren and Haas guarantees another trophy. The silver category includes obtaining a pole position and other prestigious results, while the two gold categories are dedicated to winning the drivers' and constructors' championships. The platinum trophy is instead subordinated to the victory of all the other trophies. Summit attack The great protagonist of F1 2016 is therefore the Career mode, back with some new features that make the player's experience even more engaging and satisfying than in the past. The interval of time in which our driver will be able to try to become a Formula 1 legend is now equal to ten seasons, starting from what is a free choice among the various stables that populate this year's championship. The limits of the past in this sense have therefore been definitively overcome, allowing the player to immediately choose to sit in a Mercedes or a Ferrari. However, selecting a top stable means having to deal with more stringent demands from the team, intent on winning the championship in a short time. Conversely, those who decide to populate the rear can afford a more relaxed approach, even if in a world where speed is everything, resting on one's laurels is definitely the last thing to do. It is no coincidence that even in the smaller teams, we will always experience a rivalry with our teammate right from the start, destined to influence the team's choice of first drive and the way our driver is seen on the outside. Returning to the start, once all the details of our virtual alter ego have been chosen, we find ourselves inside the paddock, the place where all the activities outside the race take place in the Career. Under the ~role-playing~ aspect, it must be said that the mode proposed by F1 2016 is not comparable to that of NBA 2K: given the standards to which the basketball series has accustomed us, this may perhaps make someone turn up their noses. The time in which we will enter the press conference to answer questions after winning a Grand Prix is therefore postponed, hoping that next year F1 2016 will evolve in this direction. What is present now outside the race is linked to two figures to interact with: the agent and the chief engineer. The first is intended to guide us throughout the career to juggle any contract offers that will arrive, while the second takes us through the improvements of the research and development division of the current stable. From the same screen, by accessing the driver's laptop PC, it is possible to consult all the data on the current season and on the objectives achieved in his career, together with the tutorials that Codemasters has developed for the benefit of newbies. As we will see further on, the goal of F1 2016 remains to attract as many people as possible, from the less experienced to those who don't want to miss a single moment of the race weekend. Just to satisfy the thirst to experience everything that makes up the Grand Prix, the choice to insert a series of objectives for the free practice sessions is particularly interesting, thus making them an integral part of the growth of the game.tore together with his stable. Through a series of skill tests, concentrated on knowledge of the circuit, tire wear and fast lap, it is possible to reach the goals proposed by the team; in this way, you accumulate resource points to spend when you are in front of the aforementioned PC to advance the single-seater. Thus, one gets the impression of really working together with one's own team of engineers, choosing together with them the aspects to be developed. After the dutiful description of the Career, let's briefly list the other modes of F1 2016: it is a classic list for a driving title, in which the local shared screen does not appear. It is therefore possible to decide whether to run a time trial, a single Grand Prix or a season, or jump into the fray via the Internet. Due to the low server population in the days leading up to the game's release, we were unable to experience the online mode as much as we would have liked, which this year allows for matches of up to 22 players. The multiplayer sessions that we have played, in the company of a lower number of players, have not given any problems whatsoever, confirming the solidity of this sector. We also point out the possibility of creating an entire championship online, with the same maximum number of players listed above. At full speed As we said in the introduction, compared to the innovations of recent years, in this 2016 Formula 1 has introduced minor elements within the regulation, allowing Codemasters to regain ground. Thus the Safety Car returns, another great absence from last year together with its virtual counterpart, which has now fully entered the rules: under the VSC regime, the drivers must respect a speed limit established by a delta, without queuing up behind the famous car grey. Among the novelties of F1 2016, we point out the presence of the formation lap and that of the so-called manual start, in which the driver is called to show off all his timing to get the right cue when the five red lights go out, being careful at the same time not to make an early departure. The dynamics of the game are certainly simplified compared to the real ones, but this still does not affect the satisfaction that can be obtained with a guessed shot on the grid. Once the start has been made, F1 2016 demonstrates that it has largely digested the transition two years ago to the V6 engine of the single-seaters, presenting a driving model similar to that of 2015 pending the sensitive changes that will instead be made in 2017. Below this aspect we therefore continue in the wake traced last year, when we had the opportunity to appreciate the qualities of the game in terms of scalability. As already mentioned, F1 2016 offers a series of parameters able to satisfy all types of players, from those with a joypad in hand who necessarily need some help not to find themselves out at every corner to those with a steering wheel who want to experience all the thrill of speed without the CPU putting its own, or in any case limiting its intervention to a minimum. To go in search of the millisecond, you have the option of choosing various technical parameters, such as the set of tires best suited to the track and the weather, then analyzing your performance on a series of telemetric data that are easy to consult. The five basic structures proposed by F1 2016 can also be combined with some solutions defined on your own, thus accentuating the simulation aspect of a title that makes versatility one of its strengths. Like DiRT Rally, F1 2016 also demonstrates that Codemasters seems to have finally found the right path with its ~simcade~ philosophy, managing to entertain everyone with some necessary compromises. From this point of view, the damages are constantly under observation, revised by the developers to be more realistic: despite the obvious steps forward, some doubts still remain due to excessive resistance of the suspensions, even at the most simulative level. The artificial intelligence seemed to us to be quite adequate both in the behavior of the other drivers and in managing cornering situations and other ~tricks~, promptly detected through warnings and penalties. Luckily, once again the use of the DualShock 4 doesn't take away from the fun of the game, even if the use of a steering wheel can certainly guarantee identification and better control, allowing you to reach a level of sensitivity that cannot be obtained with the controller. Welcome to Baku The expensive Formula 1 license naturally allows F1 2016 to be updated in every respect to the current championship, distinguished by the presence of 11 differentteams and 22 drivers. The number of circuits has also increased, reaching 21 thanks to the introduction of the new European Grand Prix held in Baku, Azerbaijan. The street circuit adds further fascination to the vast set of tracks already present within the championship, already embellished for some time by the Singapore night race. The graphics engine used is the same as last year, the EGO 3.0, on which Codemasters has carried out an optimization work that consolidates the holding of the frame rate to the 60 frames per second already achieved with F1 2015. In terms of visual impact, while making progress F1 2016 does not fill the gap in the series with other driving titles such as Project Cars, but still manages to achieve a decent result by once again making good use of antialiasing and blur. It still happens to spot tearing, but it is a rather sporadic event. On the contrary, the greater refinement of the elements that surround the track, such as the public and the buildings, is constantly appreciable. The models of the pilots are unfortunately below those to which other sports titles with their protagonists have accustomed us, but the result is still acceptable unlike that of the animations, in our opinion entirely to be reviewed. Both the movements of the characters in the interlude scenes and the variety of the latter leave something to be desired: at the end of each Grand Prix we almost always see the same animated sequence, including the award ceremony event. Something on the verge of annoying, which fortunately is balanced by an excellent presentation of the various circuits. In this regard, we close with a note regarding the translation into our language, supported in all aspects of the game: in the commentary we find the television duo composed by Carlo Vanzini and Luca Filippi, who proves to get along well even in the video game.", "date": "2016-08-19", "grade": "8.5"}
