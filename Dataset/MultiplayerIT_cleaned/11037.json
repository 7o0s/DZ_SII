{"name": "Wizards of Mickey", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wizards-of-mickey.html", "text": "The turn-based strategy genre boasts a large group of enthusiasts on PC and consoles, and is slowly trying to make its way onto mobile phones, although it is not exactly the type of entertainment that best lends itself to quick and impromptu use. The rules that govern this genre are clear and refer to the reality of board games: each player, during his turn, can move his units on the board and eventually attack the enemy. The distance that each ~pawn~ can travel varies according to its characteristics, as does the ability to carry and suffer attacks. For example, the owners of the most popular consoles in the land of the rising sun are well aware of the Super Robot Wars series, in which it is possible to control the most famous robots from various Japanese anime to make them clash with the usual enemies in a context shifts; and whoever has a PC cannot fail to know the old but unforgettable X-COM series, or a classic like Civilization. Staying on Java-compatible devices, we recently had a great example with Transformers G1: Awakening. Well, now it's the turn (literally) of the Disney characters, who probably try their hand at this type of video game for the first time... Wizards of Mickey offers us four different modes: the story, the quick game (with random values), the chapter selection (to replay an already completed battle) and a simple minigame with puzzles. During the early stages of the game, we will be accompanied by a series of suggestions that will make us understand how we can move our characters, how spells are cast and which strategy is best to follow to complete the clashes in the best way. At the beginning we will only be able to control Mickey Mouse, who will soon be joined by Goofy and Donald Duck to form the definitive group. Being a game based on magic, during the fights we will be able to attack and defend ourselves exclusively thanks to spells, which consume more or less energy depending on their effectiveness. When we run out of mana, we can decide to leave a character still to ~recharge~, however. Movement management is essential to achieve victory: we will have to be very careful about moving so that we can attack an enemy unit without it having the opportunity to fight back. The spells have a different scope and there are those that influence movement or the ability to defend oneself: from this point of view, the Disney Mobile Studios product appears quite complete and full of depth. After a fight, you have to move on the kingdom map to the next destination, and this journey more than once can lead to the discovery of secret places, where treasures are perhaps kept. Technically, the game excels both in terms of quality and quantity: the characters are really numerous, all well designed and with good animations. The scenarios, on the other hand, appear a bit subdued, especially as regards the choice of colors, but in the end they do their job in a dignified way. It is a pity that the ~comics~ that introduce the various battles have been made in a mediocre way, with an approximate style and far from faithful to the classic canons. The interface always appears practical and readable, and the action is accompanied by catchy and engaging MIDI music. PRO Solid and thick gameplay A large number of stages and characters Very well drawn sprites... AGAINST ...too bad for the backgrounds not up to par Slow action", "date": "2008-11-20", "grade": "S.V."}
