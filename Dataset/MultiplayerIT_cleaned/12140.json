{"name": "Lost Planet: Extreme Condition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-planet-extreme-condition-recensione-2.html", "text": "Let's put the ice on fire In the game you play as Wayne, a ~snow pirate~ on a mission to the planet E.D.N. III, with a rather hostile climate and fauna. In fact, giant cockroaches called Akrid infest the subsoil and try to drive humans out with strong ways. One of these annoying insects is the cause of the death of Wayne's father, and coincidentally it is the biggest and baddest of all: Green Eye, a monster of enormous size that can freeze everything around it. The first thing that denounces the mere porting from Xbox 360 to PC are the constant references to the controller of the Microsoft console, which in addition to appearing in all sorts of tutorials remains the peripheral on the basis of which game control and game navigation was developed. menu; the latter, in particular, is even embarrassing if faced with the keyboard, since it is clear from the first seconds that there has not been a shred of optimization. Another big flaw of Lost Planet is that it is distributed via Steam, which in itself wouldn't be so tragic if it weren't for the fact that even playing the single player campaign you are forced to be connected to the internet, and if unfortunately while you are playing the connection fails for any reason, the game closes instantly without even giving the possibility to save. When pest control is not enough Lost Planet is a third-person shooter, which can also change into a sort of slightly castrated first-person if necessary. The funnest part of the game is very simple: shoot the giant bugs. While mechs and humans fail to guarantee an always adequate level of fun, the firefights with the Akrid are spectacular, frenetic and particularly enjoyable. The Akrid are formidable opponents, and often manage to instill fear in the player thanks to their appearance, their chilling verses and, above all, their indisputable qualities of agility and power. To survive the sidereal temperatures of the planet E.D.N. III the protagonist must continuously feed his survival suit with thermal energy, which is kindly left on the ground by the downed insects in the form of bright spots. A sort of grappling hook also comes to Wayne's aid thanks to which, a bit like we have already seen in Tenchu and other similar games, it is possible to climb almost everywhere in a practical and fun way. Unlike the console version, the crosshair always remains in the center of the screen, resulting in easier controls. In addition to the mouse and keyboard, of course, an Xbox 360 pad can be used (it would be rather strange otherwise given its constant appearance in menus and pop-ups). When pest control is not enough Melting Ice Lost Planet's single-player mode is fun, but it's short-lived. A savvy player can take less than 6 hours to complete the adventure, which places the Capcom game well below the average longevity for titles of its same genre. One of the causes that contribute to making Lost Planet such a short experience is the ease of the game, which almost never, including giant monsters, really manages to engage an average experience player. The multiplayer, which could make up for the problems just exposed, is instead one of the worst aspects of all. Perhaps some problems will be fixed in the future (it is not possible to say for sure), but as the situation was during the days of writing this article, we can say that the online mode of Lost Planet is almost unplayable due to games that they don't start and searches that don't work (a bit like in Shadowrun, but even more seriously). The available modes are the classic deathmatch and team deathmatch, flanked by ~Post Grab~ and ~Fugitive~, respectively a sort of copy of the Battlefield game style and an ~all against one~. It is possible to use the eight basic maps of the game, but, what is not understandable, there is no trace of the additional ones that have already been available for some time on Xbox 360. Graphics and sound Lost Planet has one of its strengths, or even its main value, in its graphic design. Both on a technical level and in terms of character and monster design, the work done by Capcom is certainly commendable, and the result, in addition to being a lookout, is somehow fascinating. Optimized for dual core and native DirectX 10 (but also playable in DirectX 9 without particular differences in quality or performance, to tell the truth), provided you have a rather pumped PC, Lost Planet graphically surpasses its Xbox 360 counterpart with outstanding HDR effects, templates ofmore than good humans, robots and monsters, convincing textures and well-developed artistic side. With the test configuration the game runs at about 20fps with all the effects activated, but it must be said that the 1920x1200 resolution is a bit tricky to grind, so all in all the results are not so terrible. From the sound point of view, there are respectable effects, which in some cases contribute strongly to creating the right tension in the player. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Dual Core and up RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Nvidia 7800 / Ati X1800 with 256 MB RAM or later Disk Space: 7 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: any Dual Core RAM: 2 GB Video Card: X1800 or equivalent up Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 at 3.3 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Ati X1950Pro Monitor: Dell 24@1920x1200 Comment Lost Planet surpasses its Xbox 360 counterpart graphically but falls short in all other respects, losing much of the appeal that characterized the original version. Little care in the conversion, inexplicable design choices, various flaws and a netcode to forget keep the Capcom shooter in the limbo of ~little more than enough~ games, which certainly deserve a look from fans of the genre but cannot be recommended closed box. Another victim sacrificed at the altar of approximate conversions. Pros Good graphics (provided you have an excellent PC) and design Fun fights with massive end-of-level bosses Cons Usual poorly edited conversion Inexplicable design choices Netcode to be reviewed Poor longevity in single player Making the leap from console to PC is never easy, either due to the intrinsic difficulties of the conversion, or above all due to laziness or the relative interest of those who deal with it, and consequently most of the games that follow this process lose several qualities. Now, let's imagine many of these readers are hoping that the next sentence begins with ~But that's not the case with Lost Planet...~. But no: this is precisely the case of Lost Planet.", "date": "2007-07-05", "grade": null}
