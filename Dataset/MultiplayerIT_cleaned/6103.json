{"name": "Figlio di Fallout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155076-fallen-a2p-protocol-figlio-di-fallout.html", "text": "Fallen: A2P Protocol seems to have been born from the great love of the developers for the turn-based strategy genre mixed with RPGs. We imagine them discussing how to make one having all the skills to do it, regardless of possible complications. In fact, at the beginning it must have seemed easy: creating a path to make a character go from point A to point B shouldn't have been a problem, as well as creating some model that recalled the imagery installed on almost all the post works -apocalyptic born from Mad Max. A desert world full of dangerous and violent armed gangs, a character in search of answers, the degraded remnants of a civilization that no longer exists and that's it. Here we are, the difficult thing is to finalize the project managing to solve most of the problems that arise. Fallen: A2P Protocol had its Early Access period and was finally launched in a semi-final version. Not too long ago we dedicated an article to it after having tried a preliminary version and we feel like confirming all the impressions of the time, with some distinctions. What were then promises had to be respected, but this was not the case. Sure, the game is finished and to be honest it's also quite solid in terms of stability, but there hasn't been the slightest improvement in the game interface and enemy AI, to the point that if we hadn't had to review it we would have dumped after just a couple of hours such is the anger that some situations arouse. But let's proceed in order and try to explain ourselves. The intelligence of the brick At the Early Access version, we forgave a lot of things, because we sincerely hoped that they would be changed in the final version. For example character customization or some interface inaccuracies, which we deluded ourselves were transient. Not at all, unfortunately they are still alive and fighting with us. Let's take some examples. As we said Fallen: A2P Protocol is a turn-based strategy game with role-playing elements. There are a series of missions that form the main campaign and there are secret missions and an exploratory phase to season it all, for a poorly counted fifteen hours of play. If desired, there are also casual encounters, but they are not very rewarding and tiresome after a very short time. Let's take the typical case. We enter a new map where initially we do not see any enemies. We move with some caution because we know that the threat lurks in the fog beyond our field of vision. We advance and two angry dogs appear. We shoot them with everyone in the party, except one who specializes in hand-to-hand combat, but the best friends of the raiders prove very capable of survival and quickly come upon us. One stands between two player characters. Panic. We make one of the two point a weapon at him. 80% chance of success. The chances of hitting him are very high. We shoot and catch our comrade. Ah-um. Don't panic. We select the other character and kill the dog with a machete blow and we prepare to welcome his friend who... hey, big puppy, where are you going? The cute quadruped didn't think at all about coming upon us and went away where only he knows. We will find it again later, when we have explored the rest of the map. Tactics or AI problems? The second unfortunately. In Fallen: A2P Protocol it is very frequent to see non-player characters follow bizarre paths that frustrate any attempt to identify themselves with the action or strategic planning. They don't always happen, but they are very frequent to the point of becoming annoying. The strategic Fallen: A2P Protocol deserved a few more months of Early Access Click here, click there! Unfortunately AI isn't the only big problem with Fallen: A2P Protocol. The aforementioned interface further complicates the situation. With the latest patches something has been improved, but in general we are not there. Let's say you want to collect loot on the map. What we have to do is approach the box where the objects are on the ground, click on the collection button, confirm that we want to do exactly what we have just selected to do, then take the objects. Two inventories appear (ours and the one with the items on the ground). We have enough space to take it all. We click on the ~Take All~ button and, as if by magic... some objects are left on the ground. Let's discover the mystery: an object occupies two vertical boxes and we have two free horizontal ones. Not bad, just move an object that occupies a squareand space is cre... can't it? Should we exit collection, adjust inventory, and then go back to collecting items? Before, something similar also happened during fights, in which you had to select the attack option, confirm it, then aim at the target with a targeting system that to define as imprecise is an understatement and which is not a little disturbing when there are multiple enemies on the screen finally shoot. Now just aim at an enemy and the attack action with the weapon in hand is activated automatically. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for coverages that require pressing the coverage button with subsequent confirmation. In short, it seems that Firaxis with the excellent interface of the latest X-COM has not taught the Red Katana guys anything! In short, even the old Fallout: Tactics is less cumbersome, which is saying something. If we want we can also add that in the attack phase it is often not possible to carry out obvious actions, such as shooting enemies in the weapon's range of action, more or less wide depending on the aiming skills of the character, or hitting enemies in the melee, and the disaster is complete. What we have described to you are only the major problems of Fallen: A2P Protocol, which actually has many others. For example, between one mission and the next, you find yourself being able to wander around a game map where the aforementioned random encounters take place. Too bad they are continuous! But shouldn't it be a semi-abandoned territory? There are so many people that it looks like a disco! After all, the exploration system seems to have been specially designed to make us stay in the desert as much as possible. Do you think that to find a treasure there are no markers, but you have to go to the coordinates that are provided. Too bad that the precision required is extreme (you have to hit the exact pixel of the map) and that in the meantime you are bombarded with random encounters! In short, we could go on listing the game's flaws a little longer, but we believe the picture is clear enough. Unfortunately, some qualities, such as a good story or a good longevity, are not enough to redeem what is obviously a project that ended too quickly.", "date": "2015-08-25", "grade": "4.5"}
