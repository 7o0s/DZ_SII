{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2008", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2008.html", "text": "The answer to this question, we tell you right away, is unfortunately negative. While bearing in mind the extenuating circumstances associated with the difficulties of the debut and the fierce competition, especially as regards the equivalent of Gameloft, PES 2008 on mobile is not the small masterpiece we hoped to welcome. In reality it is an interesting and quite successful product, but which is not able to snatch the scepter from Real Football 2008. From the point of view of the available modes, in addition to friendlies, leagues and cups, the programmers have added the ~super challenge~; in reality, beyond the captivating name, the substance is rather conventional, given that it is simply a question of starting from the second division, arriving in first and also trying to win the second championship. And PES 2008 unfortunately doesn't surprise us even with regard to multiplayer, guiltily absent in this case as well as in the competing titles already mentioned. But if it is not possible to collect particular joys from the game modes (the master league is also missing, for fans who have wondered about it), it would still be more than acceptable if the actual playability were even remotely comparable to the one that made on the home console the Konami series as the best expression of football in the gaming world. Unfortunately that is not the case, and although it would be an exaggeration to say that this mobile edition is a bad game, it is certainly true that of the Pro Evolution Soccer we are used to know, it has only kept the name. The control system is quite basic; numeric keys for 8 directions, with double pressure to make short shots. The 5 for the pass, held down for the high pass, the asterisk or hash mark for the through ball and the 0 to shoot. In defense, the latter is associated with the slide while the 5 with pressing on the ball carrier. Everything in the norm, and normality without any flash of particular enthusiasm is also what is felt during the matches; the action is sufficiently fluid, even if a little slow, but the limited number of actions available inevitably reduces the variety of maneuvers that can be performed. Furthermore, the through ball is all too often inaccurate, making it ultimately practically useless or in any case almost never preferable to the normal one; also disappointing is the free kick, which prevents you from having a good view of where to throw the ball. But the most serious flaw is undoubtedly to be found in the ineptitude of the goalkeepers, who can easily be punched even from sidereal distances and are never able to form a credible barrier to opponents' shots. The teams available are the national teams and those of the Spanish, Italian, French and English leagues. Which would be enough, if it weren't for the serious limits of the licenses that prevent having uniforms similar to the real ones, also deleting the original names of the English formations and - a more annoying fact - not allowing the national teams to have real players who make them part. And so if in Juve there are easily the various Del Piero, Buffon and Camoranesi, in the national team you meet instead of perfect strangers. Mystery... Finally from a technical point of view, PES 2008 is a product entirely in 2d sufficient or little more; the animations are pleasant and the outline is quite nice, but everything tastes slightly ~old~ and in any case far from what is seen in games that make the most of the potential of modern mobile phones. The players are completely indistinguishable. Even the sound is not much, almost completely absent except for a handful of effects. PRO Quite funny Smooth even if a little slow AGAINST Of the real PES it has only the name Mechanics too simplified Serious licensing issues", "date": "2007-10-29", "grade": "S.V."}
