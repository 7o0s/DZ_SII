This is the question: is Gran Turismo 4 perfect? No. Yes. Maybe. Let's go step by step. And let's start with the things that are not perfect in the latest Polyphony production. The game structure hasn't changed one iota: of course there are some welcome additions and some tweaks, such as an unprecedented series of mission-based races with different objectives to achieve, but the basis is always the same. So with licenses, this time with lots of tests (fortunately, at least the last ones, quite fun), you win or buy cars, you compete to raise money with which to modify your vehicle, gradually unlocking the possibility of participating in new types of competition. And it repeats ad libitum, until our virtual garage will not be full enough and our ego sufficiently satisfied. It could be argued that Gran Turismo works well as it is, a concept that is irrefutably true. But not seeing any real news, nor perceiving the slightest intention to innovate leaves a bitter taste in the mouth after all these years of immutable immobilism. We tried a little: there is the Photo Mode, spectacular but absolutely an end in itself, and there is the new B-Spec mode, where in practice we watch the race 'from the pits', with our car driven by a virtual driver who can be given limited orders (five degrees of speed, force overtaking, return to the pits), constantly keeping an eye on gaps and telemetry. An interesting way of making what are in fact replays, which have always been the main dish of every GT, partially interactive, but we are far from Yamauchi's intentions to offer an alternative gaming experience. The reason? The B-Spec mode isn't fun enough. As spectacular as the replays are - which, let's face it, are satisfying precisely because they allow you to see that fantastic traverse made in the last corner again - the desire is to play, not to watch. To drive, not to see someone else drive our lovingly modified and tuned car for us. The real revolution could, indeed should have come from online. Of which, at least for the moment, there is no trace. Is Gran Turismo 4 perfect? But it is not only the structure that has remained unchanged in GT4, given that Polyphony Digital has not given a convincing answer to three historical problems of the saga: accidents, AI, incredibly unbalanced level of difficulty. First of all the accidents: you can immediately see that the collisions in the new GT are represented with more accurate and believable physics, but from the point of view of the game they are still irrelevant. We don't intend to throw ourselves into the eternal damage yes/damage no debate, where both sides have excellent reasons, but it was legitimate to hope that at least the odious technique of the curved bank would be eliminated. That is, to overtake an adversary, it is better to look for the accident rather than attempting a clean overtaking. Of course there is, only in some races, a penalty in seconds similar to the one adopted in the Prologue: it mitigates, but does not solve the problem. On the artificial intelligence front, the situation is perhaps even more embarrassing: there are very few steps forward made from the first Gran Turismo to today. The opposing cars continue to keep the pre-set trajectories undaunted, with only a few timid hints of a tussle and the occasional off-track exit. And they don't move, nor do they mention avoiding a very foreseeable accident. Imagine slipping into a corner with a textbook brake, overtaking perfectly and perfectly: you will be hopelessly cylinder-powered, always. This is particularly annoying in races where penalties for collisions are active, where other racers will have no qualms about looking for a collision. Result? For you five seconds of penalty, for them nothing. What's worse though, is that computerized pilots are never a real threat, a real challenge to the player. Which brings us directly to the third unsolved problem of the series: the level of difficulty. As with all previous Gran Turismos, there is no incentive to seek the fair challenge, the confrontation on equal terms, nor are there sufficient constraints to prevent the player from winning a large number of races using a single, sufficiently powerful and sufficiently modified car. Of course, a scoring system has been introduced (A-Spec Point, B-Spec Point): the smaller the performance gap between our car and the rivals, the greater the number of points earned by finishing first, but it's a choice that doesn't actually solve nothing, since, in fact, the points are of no use in the game, but are a simple abstract system to understand how good you are. In short, after a slow start, as in all GTs, just hit the right competitions, winmountains of money and develop some cars to be able to proceed quickly from competition to competition. Having said that, we can anticipate that everything else is really perfect... Give me a steering wheel... The level reached by GT4 in terms of simulation is so high that playing without a good steering wheel doesn't really make sense. The best choice is the Driving Force PRO from Logitech, specially developed for GT4 and fully supported by the new masterpiece Polyphony. Excellently built, very sensitive both in terms of steering wheel and pedals, it offers 900 steering, therefore as close as possible to that of a real car, and simply amazing force feedback. Try to hold a 600hp car straight on the curbs and bumps of the Nurburgring. Or to brush the curves with the correct amount of steering or gas. Or even recovering from a violent skid by countersteering the right way. These are things that you just can't do with the Dual Shock. And they absolutely must be tried. Real Driving Simulator And this time we can really say it. Polyphony Digital has done an incredible job, rewriting the now outdated physics engine of the GT saga from scratch and transforming what was an at times plausible driving game into a real simulator. Difficult to describe in words, to perceive the qualitative leap made you need to get behind the wheel, and in the literal sense of the term given that with the Dual Shock 2, although the game is usable, you really lose too much in terms of sensations and effective control of the vehicle. Choose a track, for example the excellent El Capitan, and a car of a certain power (we take the liberty of recommending the timeless Deltone). Do a couple of laps. And you will never be able to tear yourself away from it. In terms of pure sensations, the GT4/steering wheel combination  we suggest, as per the box, the excellent Driving Force PRO by Logitech  is a unique experience, as well as one of the closest to reality, for a vast set of factors. GT4 is certainly not the most rigorous and precise simulator on the market (and with 650 cars to reproduce, it seems to us also the minimum ...), but in terms of look and feel it is simply the best, bordering on perfection. Visually it pushes PlayStation 2 to new heights: real cars, real circuits. The new Gran Turismo, due to the intrinsic limitations of the hardware on which it runs, certainly cannot show off the effects and textures of the competition, nor can it boast an equal number of polygons. But the fact always remains that it offers, as a whole, the most photorealistic impact. It smacks of truth, the cars are made of gleaming metal, the tracks seem to come straight out of a television shoot, whether they are city courses, real circuits or dusty rally courses. And never mind if in the distance  far, far away  there is a slight pop-up, in any case to a lesser extent than in the Prologue, and if every now and then for a handful of seconds the video synchrony is lost with consequent pixels that are so reminiscent of first PS2 games. It is the price to pay for running so much goodness at sixty frames per second, very constant, on a console with several years of experience behind it. And it's a price we gladly pay, especially when included in the miracle Polyphony offers us the chance to tackle all the ups and downs and all the curves of the 22 kilometers of the Nurburgring Nordschleife, the green hell. Genuine, solid, huge. The new Gran Turismo is a veritable monument to PlayStation's most popular franchise, for better or for worse Real Driving Simulator Yes, the Nurburgring, the most difficult track in the world. Another great test to put GT4's physics engine to the test, and be amazed. It's amazing how the game gives feedback, how the virtual driver always knows exactly what the wheels are doing. You feel the grip, you clearly understand when and by how much you exceed the limit, you feel and take advantage of every minimum load transfer. And you know how to react accordingly, counter-steering to the right degree, letting go of the gas to avoid insidious understeer, giving a pinch of the brakes before a bump to charge the front. But while including over 650 cars in the game, with a wide range of possible modifications and settings, each of them manages to express its own personality, moreover discreetly adhering to reality. From the small nuances to the abysmal differences, the level of accuracy achieved, and the obsessive perfectionism, are able to move any car enthusiast. Just hear the hum of the Stratos' rough idle on the starting line. Or, better still, fighting with the steering wheel to keep the monstrous Sauber C9 straight, launched at almost 400km/h on the La Sarthe straight, the track where the 24hr of LeMans is historically held. And this craze for the deCutting certainly doesn't come at the expense of sheer size: GT4 is simply enormous. Six hundred and fifty cars, from every manufacturer from every part of the world and from every era, which can also be purchased, and some only, used. Fifty tracks, including real circuits - and what circuits: Suzuka, Laguna Seca, Infineon, Nurburgring, La Sarthe -, fantasy tracks and tracks created on real existing roads. In short, really finishing the game 100% is a titanic feat only within the reach of the most passionate virtual drivers (24 hours in line at the Nurburgring, just to mention one of the toughest tests...). On the modifications and settings front, it does not differ much from its predecessors: there is also the possibility of mounting a spoiler on all cars, the roll bar to further stiffen the body and the NOS, which makes very Veloce e Furioso. And there is a large group of Japanese tuners from which to buy various parts of the car (identical, in terms of performance, to those that can be purchased from the standard virtual computer) and, above all, pre-prepared cars. Last note, dutiful, for rallies. If in GT3 the introduction of dirt-track races led to certainly not optimal results and knew a lot about 'let's put them in even if we know they are not up to par', in GT4 every lover of driving on difficult routes will find something for their teeth. The trials on land, on a snowy track or on ice are simply fantastic. The most complete virtual motoring encyclopedia and a real tribute to the world of four wheels. All on one simple DVD, and only for PlayStation 2. Genuine, solid, huge. The new Gran Turismo is a veritable monument to PlayStation's most popular franchise, for better or for worse. He renounces to innovate in the name of his roots, he doesn't even try to change a by now over-tested formula, so much so as to keep even the most annoying defects of his predecessors intact. Yet it is as fascinating as ever, and pushes the limit of driving simulations even further, dictating its rules. Rules that the competition will have to treasure if it wants to try to compete. In short, it is Gran Turismo. Indeed, it is the best Gran Turismo ever. Last notes for the Italian version, which despite once again denoting the absence of 60hz, enjoys a good adaptation and very small black bars, but above all the introduction of some new cars that meet European tastes, such as some models by Audi and the unforgettable Alfa GT. Pros It's true to its name this time around - it's truly a first-rate simulator. Infinite: fifty fantastic tracks and an endless fleet of cars. It technically pushes PlayStation 2 to unprecedented heights. Cons Structure unchanged: all the historical problems of the series remain unsolved. Too bad for the online: it would have been perfect. The Italian presentation by Matteo Caccialanza At the Alfa Romeo museum in Arese, on the outskirts of Milan, a veritable temple consecrated to the history of the glorious car brand, Sony presented the definitive version of Gran Turismo 4 to the press. In a short self-celebratory journey of the myth Alfa Romeo in the world and the well-deserved compliments that Sony bestowed upon itself illustrating the record numbers of Playstation 2 and the Gran Turismo series, there was even space for the testimony of a great racing world like Fabrizio Giovanardi, champion both on track and, apparently, at home on his Playstation. An event that once again confirms the state of progressive maturation of the world of video games, since a brand as prestigious as Alfa Romeo has perceived an advantage in setting up a communication strategy in partnership with Sony, to attract new generations of alfisti. As for us, admiring up close and  unseen  touching Manuel Fangio's 1950 Alfa by hand was certainly worth the price of the little trip! Kazunori Yamauchi loves speed. After all, just take a look at his impressive garage, the forbidden dream of every car enthusiast, to realize how much the owner of Polyphony Digital loves these fascinating four-wheeled objects. And yet, when it comes to Gran Turismo, ours is certainly in no hurry. It's like doing the perfect lap on the track: you study every corner, every braking point, every trajectory. In short, it takes time, you cannot improvise. Just as you can't improvise on video games: and so four years have passed since the release of the last, true Gran Turismo. Four years of obsessive perfectionism. Four years well spent.", "date": "2005-03-09", "grade": null}
