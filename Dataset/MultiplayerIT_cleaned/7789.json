Anyone who spent time years ago on sites like Kongregate has practically seen the birth and proliferation of gameplay of this type, these places being a sort of primordial soup from which all the modern trends in mobile games are derived. The concept behind Moonshot is nothing but a direct derivation of those prototypes, but presented with all the trappings of a well-constructed and packaged title. The story is very simple: the moon called ~Moon Pi~ suddenly finds itself separated from ~mother Earth~ and must try to return to its orbit by crossing various systems in 126 levels divided into 7 worlds, each characterized by new variables that offer obstacles and marginal variations to the gameplay, but which enrich it substantially, keeping it rather interesting and trying to limit the monotonous effect that the continuous repetition of the same structure inevitably brings up, over such a long journey. The journey of the moon is all about gravitational attraction and the exploitation of the slingshot effect, in a similar way to what had also been proposed by Angry Birds Space, just to give a famous example, but with some peculiar characteristics given by the numerous variables that appear along the levels. A stellar, indeed lunar journey Moonshot, an image from the game The goal of each level is to get the little long protagonist of the story to reach a sort of wormhole, so that she can go from one system to another in search of the Earth. To get to the finish line we have to launch the satellite by loading the thrust in order to make it follow the right trajectory, calculating the curvature and power of the launch in order to hit the pass with a single well-aimed shot. Obviously the path becomes more and more complicated as we enter the levels: planets, asteroid belts, black holes, spaceships and various obstacles stand between the starting point and the final point of the path, forcing us to accurately calculate the trajectory from have Moon Pi do it. A barely hinted line allows us to have an idea of the initial path that the moon will follow immediately after launch, in order to have a tangible reference on the direction taken in the first seconds, but for the rest the precise trajectory must be predicted on the basis of the logic of the slingshot effect and the attraction exerted by the other elements, exploiting the planets present on the screen to carry out curves and accelerations. Moonshot, a screenshot showing a more advanced level In short, it is a game solution that is not exactly new, but built with great care by the Morsel Interactive team, which has also managed to enrich the extremely basic structure with additional features given by an increasingly complex level design and in some cases truly appreciable, although the fundamental elements of the gameplay obviously cannot fail to be a bit repetitive. To contribute to the good sensations we also add a precise control system and naturally designed for the touch screen, in addition to the graphic style adopted. The latter is one of the elements that most characterize Moonshot: the delicate stroke of the 2D drawing done by hand helps to give the game a remarkable identity, helping to make it stand out even in the face of a not particularly original dynamic.", "date": "2022-04-29", "grade": "7.0"}
