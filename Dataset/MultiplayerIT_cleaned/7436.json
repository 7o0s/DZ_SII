Before even taking into consideration the dynamics of the game and therefore evaluating the title in the context to which it belongs, i.e. that of the fighting game, we unfortunately stop at the first step, the examination of a control system that appears decidedly deficient, so as to invalidate largely the gaming experience. Let's take a step back: Fighter Within is a one-on-one fighting game with a rather classic concept, but characterized by the fact that it is entirely controllable via Kinect, which in this case does not cover the marginal role of an additional option, but entirely permeates the game. designed to be enjoyed through the new motion recognition camera of Xbox One. It is therefore a product that is located in an area between a classic video game and a fitness game, requiring a certain physical activity in front of the screen, given that it replaces body movement with the classic video game mechanics via joypad. The story of the single player mode, somewhat botched and exposed exclusively through dialogues represented with static screens, tells the exploits of Matt, a young man with a hot head and ready fists who embarks on a ~training~ path based essentially on the destruction of opponents. In short, this is the classic pretext to justify the need to fight a long string of unfortunate people, which is the norm for the genre in question, but an additional problem of Fighter Within is given by the lack of charisma of the cast of fighters , deriving from the choice to maintain a tone as realistic as possible in the characterization and fighting style. On the other hand, these are characters that have a substantially identical set of basic moves, apart from some differences regarding special attacks, so we are quite far from the typical characterizations of classic fighting games, such as Street Fighter or, to stay in 3D scope, Tekken. Fists in hands Set aside controller and relaxed posture as a seasoned player because Fighter Within is played standing up, in front of the screen and the ubiquitous Xbox One Kinect. Starting from the initial menu, the whole game is based on motor recognition, but the first problems can already appear from the selection of the options, with the system used to make the selections (~hit~ the right key while keeping the hand still floating on the screen and at the same time bring it towards the screen) which often proves to be unresponsive. Not bad, since these are side elements, but other problems also appear in the game, during the clashes. There are positives to Fighter Within: the character modeling is good if uninspired while the animations are remarkable and the exchange of blows, as far as the basic punches and kicks are concerned, also returns a certain feeling of impact, regardless of the lack of physical feedback, but the whole experience is characterized by a certain input lag between the player's actions and on-screen reactions, which is even more aggravated by the particular system of mixing real-time action and pre-structured moves that can be activated by executing certain movements. The repertoire of moves includes punches, kicks, parries, projections and special blows that can be performed by charging the Ki, as well as special events that also allow the use of weapons collected in the ring, while the correct timing in the execution of particular combinations of moves and counter-moves triggers pre-set sequences such as combos, special attacks and counters capable of inflicting substantial damage. At the highest levels, the game focuses almost exclusively on the correct activation of these special maneuvers which effectively cut out the player and the interaction with Kinect being substantially pre-calculated. It is therefore, above all, a matter of getting the timing of the attacks right and above all responding appropriately to the opponent's moves with a system which on the one hand introduces an important tactical element into the action, which otherwise could end up in simply shaking hands at random all the time, but on the other hand it distorts the feeling of complete and real-time control over the character's movements, a sensation already caused by the latency between the player's movements and those of the character. Rage against the machine The options present are divided, as per the manual of the genre, according to the classphysical fundamental distinction between single player or multiplayer experience, thus providing the basic modes of the standard fighting game without particular innovative introductions. It should be noted that the story mode is essentially a long tutorial in which the clashes, which gradually introduce the various characters on the roster, are preceded by the aforementioned uninspiring dialogues and are mainly used to progressively teach all the executable moves and special techniques. According to this ~training path~ the clashes of the story mode are rather guided, each being set on the instruction of a particular technique, but in the more advanced levels the challenge still becomes demanding. Little else to report for the single player, which in addition to the initiation has a classic arcade mode with sequential clashes and training, while the multiplayer is only present locally, with a single standard mode. In short, the offer is not exactly abundant and it is clear that the game is designed above all to offer the ~best~ in the presence multiplayer mode, where probably the fact of performing punches and kicks against the air next to a friend can increase the involvement and probably also the fun. The problem in this case occurs due to the potentially chaotic structure of the clashes, which beyond the routines set for artificial intelligence, if you find yourself fighting between human players, it is easy to end the match in a series of punches throw yourself as fast as possible and basically at random, in an attempt to trigger a combo before your opponent, unless you choose a more elegant approach for pure aesthetic sense. Fighter Within makes us sweat, shake and curse in front of Kinect, but not always for the 'right' reasons Xbox One goals Fighter Within contains a hundred unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points to add to the Xbox One Gamertag. Some objectives are placed along the path of the single player mode and are achieved simply by continuing in it, but most of the awards are associated with particular performances performed by the player in terms of quality of combat, results obtained or quantity of winning moves. The small cut of the objectives favors a more widespread dislocation of these, which can therefore be unlocked in large quantities by everyone. Has the next gen arrived? Fighter Within is characterized by an all in all pleasant graphic sector, which alternates excellent things with decidedly more drawn out elements, even if perhaps the aesthetic aspect is the least weak of the whole package, which suffers above all from structural deficiencies of the gameplay. In any case, there are ups and downs, which betray a production that is probably not up to a true triple A intended for the retail market, especially if we consider the platform on which the game runs. In the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 panorama, it could appear as a low-demand but technically decent fighting game, but it is clear that the potential of the next-gen is not touched here, beyond good polygonal models and convincing animations which, however, certainly don't scream to the miracle. As already reported, the problem with the graphics of this AMA and Ubisoft title is a widespread lack of charisma, starting from the development of the characters to get to the plot itself. Except for a few particular cases, almost all the characters appear somewhat anonymous starting from the protagonist himself, and it is a defect that in a one-on-one fighting game is not exactly marginal, even if in the face of the deficiencies of the control system and game mechanics it can seem trivial. The not very high level of production is revealed above all in the side elements, especially as regards the story mode, with its awkward dialogues shown through very simple static screens but, in essence, the problem of Fighter Within is not the graphics, even if from a launch title on Xbox One it would be reasonable to expect much more. In short, the next gen factor has not arrived, but in the face of much worse gaps regarding the control system and gameplay, it is ultimately a marginal problem.", "date": "2013-12-02", "grade": "4.0"}
