It is a series that has earned, over the course of fifteen years and various platforms, a certain number of fans and enthusiasts thanks to the countless chapters, spin-offs and cross-overs. The latter is precisely the category of the latest creature Koei: Warriors Orochi 3, which is actually the fourth appearance of the series. Called ~Musou~ in Japan, the game has almost been able to conceive and reinvent the action genre with some new and original ideas for the time, only to then abuse them beyond belief up to the present day, in which particular changes or innovations are not appreciated compared to the formula devised in the mid-1990s. This has always been the major negative criticism towards all ~Warriors~, and at the same time their fascinating side and catalyst towards all his fans, nostalgic and traditionally anchored on very retro gameplay. Medieval barrels The latest chapter in the Musou series, Warriors Orochi 3, shuffles the cards of the available characters a bit and does it once again by creating a plot that borders on the improbable, or rather science fiction: by lowering the time travel card. After Orochi's defeat, a long period of peace awaited the kingdom, until the appearance of an evil Hydra wiped out all the heroes of the kingdom. The survivors of his rampage, Hanbei Takenaka, Sima Zhao and Ma Chao were given the chance to go back in time and try to save them one by one. This gabola therefore allows the developers to insert warriors apparently distant from each other into the game, giving a similar-logical thread to their appearances with the excuse of time travel. The game structure is easily recognizable by anyone who has ever tried a title in the series: between one fight and another you stop in a sort of field where you choose the warriors to take on missions, buy and upgrade weapons, talk to the other characters present trying to strengthen friendships with everyone. This last aspect is essential if you want to get the true ending of the game, obtainable only after unlocking all the secret characters. The latter can only be obtained by completing some secret missions, which in turn can only be activated when an excellent and stable friendship is reached between some of the protagonists. The gameplay is equally recognizable, given that it is mostly about facing hordes made up of hundreds of enemies on the screen at the same time and exterminating them with combos and super moves (there is a bar at the top that determines its use, duration and intensity). Where in the previous chapters the difficulty level set to ~normal~ appeared as little more than a walk, in this Warriors Orochi 3 the competition against the CPU has been slightly revised, even if not distorted. The game is always quite easy, so much so that you can easily progress through the maps (very vast at times) by pressing the simple attack button endlessly. To break the monotony, some intermediate bosses and end-of-level bosses that are actually tough to eliminate sporadically intervene. It is in these cases that one realizes the importance of leveling one's weapons and increasing the ~skills~ applicable to some of them, obtainable only by collecting some crystals dropped frequently during the clashes. Xbox 360 goals The canonical 1000 points to unlock are obtained through 43 objectives, a good half of which are not exactly easy to obtain. If the first half is obtained automatically by continuing through the ~scenarios~ of the game or by carrying out simple actions such as buying a weapon, holding a banquet or upgrading an object, for the other half there will really be sweating: completing all the collectibles , get all characters, complete the game with all endings, and level ~chaos~. It's not a joke at all. They fight like blacksmiths What really makes the strength of this new Warriors Orochi 3 is not so much the quality of the game or the gameplay itself, almost identical to the prequels, but the quantity of objects, weapons, characters and all that ~outline~ that makes it truly a complete and refined game. There is the possibility of playing co-op with a friend next to you, in split scree. There is the possibility of playing online in matchmaking, versus, single player games. There are more than 120 fighters to select and unlock, featuring heroes from both Dynasty Warriors series, Samurai Warriors and many special guests such as Ryo Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden, Ayane from Dead or Alive, historical figures like Achilles or Joan of Arc. What really still fails to increase is the content of the graphics sector, once again anchored to standards that are too low for the time in which it comes out and above all compared to the competition which in the meantime has made great strides. The Koei graphics engine is definitely to be retired. It contains all sorts of full-blown defects of this gen: from ladders to pop-ups (forgotten for years now), from polygonal interpenetrations to absolutely insufficient AI. Enemies often seem to pretend we exist, standing back against a wall or randomly running around the play area. And even when they target us they are absolutely not fearsome. Yes, there is a large amount of characters displayed but it is also true that the detail is poor, the animations often funny and unrealistic, and many elements suddenly appear out of nowhere. Moreover, the game locations are not at all rich in details and polygons, on the contrary they are once again decidedly bare and uninspired. The music is instead to be appreciated, albeit slightly repetitive, for its harmony and a sense of magnificence typical of a well-played orchestral soundtrack. Of the same level are the splendid Japanese dubbings, very theatrical and well acted. Nothing new on the horizon, then, but we're starting to believe that true fans of the saga also love this decidedly ~retro~ aspect of it. These fans will absolutely not be disappointed by Warriors Orochi 3, which for better or for worse represents one of the best chapters ever for completeness and amount of things to do, see and find.", "date": "2012-04-06", "grade": "7.5"}
