Let's be honest: Final Fantasy mom games in recent times they certainly didn't shine in quality, but the Japanese company would never have dared to put such a title on the market, especially on the occasion of the launch of a new console like PlayStation Vita. The Sony designer laptop fortunately offered a good variety of initial titles, albeit not all of high quality, and between fighting games, sports simulators and adventures, a genre that is missing is the strategic one. Army Corps of Hell attempts to fill that gap, but the result is certainly not what we hoped for. Goblin king, oh goblin king! Connecting the game's forty or so missions is a somewhat grotesque dark tale: the king of the underworld, that is, the player, has been dethroned and hurled into the lowest circles of hell. After subjugating a tribe of goblins, your goal will be to use these gruesome minions to climb the ranks of the infernal powers and return to your rightful throne. Incredible twists, staggering revelations, a passionate love story: all this awaits you in the most modest RPG of the last five years, but not in Army Corps of Hell, there is none of this here. The story is insipid and told through short texts and discreet artwork, but in reality it is only an excuse to make sense of the many battles you will have to face before seeing the credits roll. It couldn't be otherwise, given that the story lacks characters worthy of the name, characterized just by an artistic style halfway between Eastern and Western and by a dubbing disguised in an otherworldly language composed of incomprehensible verses. The aesthetics of Army Corps of Hell unfortunately does not improve even during the actual game, technically much closer to what is proposed by PSP rather than PlayStation Vita, a laptop which, we recall, has already flexed its muscles with titles such as Uncharted : The Abyss of Gold and Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3. The title of Entersphere is dull, both in the modeling of the various opposing creatures and of the battlefields, real small ~arenas~ that tend to look a bit alike all of them. Probably in hell one shouldn't expect rainbows and fields of flowers, but not even such a poverty of chromatic choices. The goblins controlled by our alter-ego come in only three varieties and, as a result, they themselves don't offer much of a visual difference but neither do they offer a particularly satisfying repertoire of animations, despite being the models we will most often see during the game. Thumbs up, however, for the various bosses, of decidedly generous dimensions and often inspired by well-known mythological or supernatural creatures. Playstation 3 trophies The 30 obtainable trophies are divided into 12 bronze, 12 silver, 5 gold and 1 platinum. To earn most of them, just complete the various missions, defeat the bosses and craft items for our army. Others however are more challenging and require the use of only one type of goblin or the collection of all the objects in the game. What kind of magic spell to use? Quoting a verse by David Bowie in the legendary film Labyrinth (in which he played the Goblin King, think about it) we could almost make you believe that in Army Corps of Hell you can choose which spells to cast against your enemies. You really don't get to choose, and frankly, there aren't even any spells to cast. However, your demonic powers can be used to manufacture weapons and objects capable of providing you with comfortable advantages during battles, starting from the materials collected by your subjects on the battlefield itself. The army of goblins that you subjugated at the beginning of the story will surround you during the missions and you will be able to take advantage of three types of minions: the goblin soldiers are units predisposed to melee combat; the spearmen, on the other hand, are the goblins who will attack at medium range, able to sneak into otherwise inaccessible areas to overwhelm enemies that the soldiers cannot approach; finally, the wizards are the goblins capable of hurling disruptive area spells. The goblin king will, in fact, be twiddling his thumbs by simply ordering his units to do his dirty work for him. The gameplay therefore assumes the identity of a hybrid between an action game and a real-time strategy game: the player moves the protagonist and indicates which target to attack, the goblins will take care of the rest. It's a bit sccomforting, however, that a mechanic all in all quite interesting does not fully exploit the capabilities of the Sony hardware. The various missions all tend to resemble each other, the player basically has to figure out how to get rid of the enemies while avoiding the traps scattered around the arena and the choice often boils down to using one or two types of goblins at most, with spearmen practically useless for most of the adventure. Proceeding beyond the twentieth stage, moreover, it becomes clear that it is much more comfortable to rely on the devastating special attack of the soldiers rather than developing complicated tactics that also exploit the peculiar abilities of the other goblins. Sooner or later this strategy also becomes appropriate in the case of boss fights, which in any case immediately become redundant and not entirely dissimilar from a normal overgrown enemy. The sense of repetitiveness becomes almost overwhelming within a few hours, also due to a really excellent heavy-metal accompaniment but characterized by very few tracks, repeated to exhaustion, as if to underline the monotony of our actions.", "date": "2012-02-27", "grade": "5.0"}
