{"name": "Frozenheim", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frozenheim-recensione.html", "text": "We have seen plenty of management and city builders in these ~early years~ of videogame history: every possible setting has been scanned, tested, exploited and dried up. Consequently, it is not easy for newcomers to be able to find a space in the market that justifies their presence. Many have failed, but some have come out on top; to try, this time, is Frozenheim, the first work of the small team of Paranoid Interactive that tries to give new luster to the more than recurring (especially in recent years) Norse culture, looking for a middle ground between myth and reality. Let's see if they have achieved the gates of Valhalla or whether they will be escorted to the gates of Hel in this Frozenheim review. War and Prosperity Frozenheim: a city bulder with a Nordic soul The game, as mentioned, is a city builder that equates management elements and real-time combat. The goal is to make your settlement prosper within a region also occupied by other clans. The game modes are varied and diversified, but most of the time the final goal is given by the annihilation of every enemy community present. To do this, you can act the ~old way~, creating a powerful army with which to directly assault the enemy walls, or ask for help from the gods (thus starting Ragnark, an event that will destroy all enemy settlements), but not before winning their favor by controlling every single runestone on the map. The player must remember, however, that this is still a management game strongly focused on the resources and well-being of your city center. It is as important to prepare for battle as to take care of your settlers, otherwise they can rise up and damage us from within, through the desertion, theft or abandonment; high morale is essential to keep these crazed splinters at bay for as long as possible. Therefore, balance proves once again (as in most titles of this genre) to be the constant to follow, but it is certainly not the only one. The game, however, allows you to approach the game in the way you prefer, following the strategy that seems most suitable at the moment and taking into consideration the territory surrounding your initial small farm. This, at least, during custom games or those online. If, on the other hand, you choose to follow the campaign made available by the developers, you will find yourself facing the sagas of legendary Nordic warriors. These short stories, divided into four chapters each, will put you at ease with the dynamics of the game and the four classes that develop within it. In fact, during your games, you can choose (by building a certain building, the hall of the elderly) which path to take: that of the Clan of the Raven, the Bear, the Deer or the Wolf. Each class allows you to develop a skill tree unique, unbalanced towards a certain approach to the game (the Wolf is more aggressive, the Bear dedicated entirely to defence, the Deer to development, while the Crow to exploration). In short, each game has the potential to turn out to be completely different from the previous one. Vikings, once again Frozenheim: Not for those fed up with river raiding and sacrifices to the Norse pantheon If Vikings, Norse gods, runes and axes are tearing your soul apart just hearing them, Frozenheim has come to your rescue... to finish you off with its own hands. On the other hand, those who are not yet ~satiated~ with experiences of this type will find a very particular game world, even if strongly linked to the contemporary iconography that has developed around this cultural subset. In addition to the usual divinities (Odin, Loki, Bragi, among others, who ~appear~ only as names linked to the blessings that can be invoked at the temples), we find runic stones, wooden structures with a Nordic taste, drakkars (or, better, dreki) who sail the seas, furious berserkers. In short, everything that has conquered the common thought relating to this particular period of Northern European history. Frozenheim: Runestones are vital ~allies~. While not exactly lacking in content and objects, it certainly cannot be said that the developers have made so many elements available to provide a constant surprise in each game. By winning even one of these, it is unlikely that you will miss some element of the game that is not strictly linked to the choice of the clan. This does not mean that the game is repetitive in itself (we were just saying earlier that the variety of approaches allows you to follow different paths), but that it lacksof a depth of content that would certainly have benefited him, considering the fierce market in which it wants to position itself. A handful of buildings, half a dozen units, and a few blessings are barely enough these days to ignite a player's interest, especially a seasoned one. Bet everything on the graphics sector Frozenheim: graphically it is able to amaze What the game lacks in its variety, the developers have tried to make up for with a high-level graphics sector. Considering the independent nature of the project, it is interesting to see how this aspect has been privileged, with a decidedly pleasant meeting between the artistic direction and the technical team. The game is extremely suggestive, especially in the transition from one season to another, during which we witness the radical change of the landscape (with consequent implications in the gameplay, including difficulty of movement in deep snow or lightning storms during autumn), literally seen in a new light. Precisely the latter is the main contributor to the general glance, going to constantly transform the exploration of the game map (for example, when you enter a dense forest with your units, the territory becomes dark, torn only by a few flashes of sunlight that make their way through the branches of the trees). However, although graphically the game defends itself very well compared to the competition, it is musically that gives its best. The soundtrack that accompanies our Nordic raids is the most pressing and spot on one could conceive, with a good dose of epic and solemnity. Too bad that these qualities are undermined by the developers themselves, driven by who knows what evil force to want to insert at all costs unrendered cutscenes and mixed in a horrifying way, with aberrant rhythms and camera movements. Not to mention the not very clear cleaning, which often leads to seemingly unjustified frame drops or bugs which, although not excessively relevant, are certainly annoying and, above all, could have been avoided with a little more attention. All elements that irreparably demean the general image that is created around the game.", "date": "2022-07-18", "grade": "7.5"}
