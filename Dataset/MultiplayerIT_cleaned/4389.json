{"name": "Melatonin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/melatonin-recensione.html", "text": "I wonder if any of you readers played Nintendo's splendid (and colorful) Rhythm Heaven back in 2008: between singing lizards and tutu-clad frogs, you had to rely on audio and video clues to find the right rhythm and touch the screen touch of Nintendo DS following the music. Here, David Huynh has adopted the same method to develop his Melatonin, a rhythm game that amazed us for its aesthetic cleanliness and for the care of the audio tracks, in a very successful mix between hand-drawn dream scenarios and lo-fi music. However, Melatonin is much more than just a music video game. The gargantuan amount of consumable items present in its levels - pizzas, hamburgers, diamonds, handbags - makes the player wonder about the monstrous hunger of our capitalist society. The dreams of Melatonin's protagonist follow the pleasure principle in the same way as a mouse who follows the Pied Piper, to the sound of music that knows no respite. And that's okay, because Melatonin is destined to leave a mark in the rhythm game genre, and getting away from the screen is really difficult. We tell you about it in detail in our Melatonin review. Rhythm is a dancer Between shopping, food, dating apps and video games, Melatonin travels mental paths familiar to many gamers David Huynh lives in Vancouver and worked as a graphic designer before deciding to develop Melatonin, his first video game. Huynh's work experience in design can be clearly seen in the coherence of the virtual world he created, primarily based on shades of pink and drawn with a distinctive and well-finished cartoon style. In short, Melatonin is a feast for the eyes rather than for the ears and the main character of the adventure, sitting on the sofa in front of the TV, has no traits that qualify its genre, making it easy for each player to identify with it. Over the course of four sleepy evenings between drinks and pizza cartons, the protagonist will find himself crossing a dreamscape populated by totemic objects and concepts for our contemporaneity - especially for the youngest: followers, money, shopping, dating apps and video games are just some of the inhabitants of Melatonin's dreams over the twenty game levels. With one (very uninspired) exception, each painting is a visual and musical tale about consumption, desire, and sometimes the pressures of our performance society. And, in turn, Melatonin also proposes a system of evaluation and timing that require absolute precision and dedication, however allowing for shortcuts: we can choose to keep the metronome active during the game, but also give ourselves a greater amount of time to get a coveted Perfect. Melatonin's adventure begins in front of the TV on a sleepy evening at home As in any rhythm game, it's all about pressing the keys in time, as well as remembering which keys to press in different game situations. For example, in a level set in the gym we will have to lift weights by pressing the back buttons; to launch a spacecraft into space, on the other hand, it will be necessary to maintain the pressure for the correct amount of time and release it at a precise moment. These variations hold attention and invite players to use one of the most important qualities for achieving perfection in a musical game: memory. Luckily Huynh has set the Melatonin levels in such a way that the process is never cruel or difficult, just fun. Free your mind and join us Some levels of Melatonin convey a certain angst beneath the superficial cheerfulness of the music used by Huynh Each of the four nights of Melatonin is made up of four themed dreams, plus a mashup level where elements from that night mix. The evaluation is expressed in stars (maximum three) and learning is facilitated by the presence of a test mode, complete with a metronome and on-screen indication of the keys to press (and, last but not least, the correct moment in which to do it ). It is an excellent idea to allow players, especially at the beginning, to learn the systems behind each framework and not feel totally unprepared in the actual levels, equipped with a normal mode and a difficult one that will often put a strain on even the reflexes of the most seasoned gamer. The editor option is also interesting, which allows - in a relatively simple way - to exploit the templates of the various levels to create new paths, inserting events and situations taken from each of the Melatonin settings. It's a good way to go FrDeeper into the adventure after the approximately two and a half hours required to complete all levels in both difficulty levels, bearing in mind that the very pleasant musical selection made by Huynh invites you to return to Melatonin's four nights over and over again, even after the game is over. You can feel it everywhere Melatonin levels are recognizable and well characterized, both from an aesthetic point of view and from a musical point of view What are the elements of a good rhythm game? David Huynh has drawn from milestones of the genre - such as Rhythm Heaven - the absolute cleanliness of the screen, free from interfaces and invasive elements, except that the player wishes to keep the metronome and key indication for accessibility reasons. Not only that: Melatonin presents a musical selection that will delight fans of lo-fi hip-hop, perhaps the true sound of generation Z. It is true that Huynh often marries more aggressive sounds than those of the playlists of the genre, ubiquitous on YouTube - often aimed at encouraging productivity and concentration in study in a society dominated by distractions of all kinds - but the younger ones will certainly feel at home in Melatonin's music and in the almost obsessive repetitiveness of their beats. Visual and sound design of the highest level, therefore, except for a strange fall in style in a level that we found almost incomprehensible in the overall picture of Melatonin, given its poor quality and banality in the excellence of the rest of the game. Apart from this, we can only rejoice in the happy perfection Huynh fielded and, in our opinion, Melatonin's melancholy and bittersweet ending seems completely fitting with the message of the game.", "date": "2022-12-12", "grade": "9.0"}
