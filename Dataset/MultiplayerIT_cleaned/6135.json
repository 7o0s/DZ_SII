{"name": "Gran finale!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154778-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-reckoning-gran-finale.html", "text": "With Reckonining we arrive at the last waltz with the post launch support of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. A support full of ups and downs for what concerns the map packs released with each DLC, but which is always instead of a high level for Exo Zombies. It doesn't close with a bang, but without a doubt the quality of this package is more than good after the half misstep of Supremacy. Let's try to figure out what we liked - a lot - and what we would have seen again... that is, much less. Latest DLC for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. It ends beautifully! We have fun Thanks to Overload we find ourselves in New Baghdad, a location seen both in the campaign and in one of the maps present in the basic package of the title. This time we are no longer in a prison set on fire, but in an ultra-luxury hotel. Rather large map, and graphically successful, it is perfect for all types of game, given the right mix of outdoor and indoor spaces, without forgetting a good extension in height that allows us to better enjoy the new movement characteristics of Advanced Warfare. We cannot fail to mention a kind of small Tesla Coils that ~electrify~ the already frenetic game action a little more. We leave the Iraqi heat for heavy snow suits, flying to the Pole and landing on the edge of a mining site in Fracture. Medium-sized map, but very open and full of structures to jump on, such as containers, cranes and huts, it is undoubtedly very fun at all levels, although it is not particularly articulated in terms of general layout. It is really full of defiles and more generally it is graced by a level design that ~compacts~ the shootings, keeping all the players relatively close even if in opposite areas of the map. Watch out for the moment when the ice melts, resulting in part of the battlefield drifting offshore. With Swarm we go to Korea, in a Seoul under reconstruction after the events of the campaign. Narrow streets and blind corners, but also a lot of ~second floors~, roofs, terraces and stairways to walk and trample, perhaps to implement lethal ambushes from above. But above all we have a decidedly devastating scorestreak available, thanks to which we can launch a swarm of drones that explode on contact with the target. A small map, but this one is also particularly ~dense~ and obviously very fun, given that small spaces have always been harbingers of adrenaline-pumping close-up battles. With Quarantine we stay in the city, but from Korea we move to New York. Not huge map that alternates between open spaces, within the courtyards of the various buildings of a testing center, and interiors, without forgetting a good number of secondary accesses and defilations. A functional map, but undoubtedly the least flashy of the lot, with good ideas for taking advantage of the verticality of the general layout. Not bad, but you'll rarely find yourself voting for her between matches. The real protagonist of Reckoning, as written at the beginning, is Exo Zombies. Descent takes us inside an Atlas submarine base where, level after level, we should fight Oz, played by John Malkovich. As usual, lots of co-op fun, a nice challenge rate, bosses and unreleased zombies. We have a new weapon at our disposal, a sort of crossbow that shoots electric bolts that ricochet around the map hitting multiple enemies, giving us the ability to shoot almost blindly, but there are also a whole series of power ups that we can activate as needed, such as AI-driven drone turrets and much more. We liked Reckoning: the maps were good and above all the new Exo Zombies setting was fun and challenging. Without a doubt a successful DLC.", "date": "2015-08-14", "grade": null}
