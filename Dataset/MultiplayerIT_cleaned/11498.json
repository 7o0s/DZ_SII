Naturally, it is necessary to have a certain familiarity with the various characters of the series in order to better understand their relationships, behaviors and certain humorous gags, an element that immediately alienates anyone who does not know Lupine III from enjoying this DVD. The plot essentially sees Lupine, accompanied by the inseparable Jigen and Goemon, reaching the fictitious city of Sokai to rescue the Machiavellian Fujiko, kidnapped by the underworld Band of the Celestial Dragon, and our lovable villain will find himself dealing with a sort of curse that he will kill him in three days, if he doesn't recover an ancient manuscript hidden in the Sokai temple, where an antidote to save his life could also be found. Meanwhile, Inspector Zenigata also arrives in Sokai to escort a girl who has to participate in a sort of competition, with an artefact as a prize which, coincidentally, Lupine will have to steal to enter the Sokai temple. In short, the paths of Inspector Zaz and Lupine cross again, and there will be some notable twists that make the story decidedly intriguing and compelling, full of fan-service and rather faithful to the original series. Like a game? Basically, the gaming experience in this Banpresto production is reduced to passively viewing the long films, as if you were watching an episode of the cartoon: in fact, the entire narrative is divided into ~episodes~ complete with previews of the next one. The non-interactive sequences are sometimes interspersed with some moments, called L.A.E. (Lupintic Action Event), in which the player finally influences the action, pressing the keys indicated on the screen at the right time as in a classic Shenmue-memory QTE (sometimes downright frustrating), saving Lupin's skin, or whoever him: during the game you will in fact take control not only of Lupine and Zenigata, the undisputed protagonists, but also of their most famous supporting actors, adapting to their very personal style, shooting with Jigen or slicing the impossible with Goemon's katana. There is therefore no shortage of more classic and interactive stages, which make use of a discreet three-dimensional engine, in which we will have to drive cars or beat up the usual thugs armed to the teeth: the problem is that these play sessions are extremely short and minimalist, essentially limited to bridge the various narrative sequences by reminding the player that their PlayStation 2 is still on. Moreover, the controls in these phases of the game prove to be uncomfortable and not very intuitive, making it rather difficult to get used to the new control system for the short time necessary. However, these are the truly playful parts of the Banpresto product, which despite its ingenuity manages to offer a good variety of situations: in fact, there are stealth ~missions~  la Metal Gear in which Lupine will have to, for example, infiltrate a building without being discovered by the guards, or stages in which we will have to gather information by solving simple side-quests. Moreover, the outcome of each episode is evaluated with a rank: the better the judgment, the more numerous the extras and bonuses will be unlocked. Like on TV? The Adventures of Lupine III is not a product that makes you cry like a miracle from a technical point of view, but it is undeniable that the developers have done an excellent job in trying to reproduce the feeling of the animated series as faithfully as possible: in fact, the result is truly extraordinary. The discomfort caused by the translation to the CG lasts a moment: all the main non-interactive films, in computer graphics, are excellently made and animated, full of details, accurately re-proposing the traits and characteristic movements of cartoons, as well as the rhythms and more traditional shots of Lupine III. Even the soundtrack, with the most famous and classic acronyms and tunes of the series, is expertly inserted to act as a perfect frame for the action. The visual quality decreases a bit in the interactive and non-interactive sequences that make use of the game's polygonal engine: in these cases, in fact, the quality of the textures and of the locations is decidedly mediocre, although the modeling of the main characters remains decidedly of an excellent level, with particular care for their animations. There is also no shortage of significant frame-rate drops in the most agitated phases, such as car chases. What makes this DVD truly precious for an Italian fan of Lupine III is the dubbing, truly exceptional: the whole game is entirely spoken in Italian, with an almostperfect, and boasts the classic Italian voice actors of the series, including the late Roberto Del Giudice (historical voice of Lupin) who have done an excellent job as always. Playing The Adventures of Lupine III therefore becomes like enjoying a Lupine television mini-series, with all its clichs, comic and dramatic scenes and appropriate action scenes. And sorry if it's too little. Comment The Adventures of Lupine the Third is a must-buy for any self-respecting fan of the Japanese thief. It is not equally as a video game in itself, unfortunately, given the ingenuity in the creation of the interactive sequences, imposed during the long and frequent cutscenes at a swinging pace, despite their welcome variety. As an experiment it is therefore partially successful: it is nothing more than a sort of semi-interactive animated mini-series, which boasts a good story among other things. However, the game shines especially for the fidelity with which the spirit of the series has been transposed into polygons, but above all for the excellent dubbing in Italian. A niche product remains, intended for fans, who will be able to appreciate it for what it is: another episode of Lupine's eternal multimedia adventure. Pros Very faithful to the original series Good variety of playful sequences Stratospheric Italian dubbing Cons Technically presents ups and downs Swinging rhythm Interactive sequences of naive programming The Adventures of Lupine the Third: Death, Zenigata Love is available for PlayStation 2. Created by the mangaka Monkey Punch in 1967, Lupine III is now undoubtedly an icon of the world's imagination. Only in Italy have his numerous animated series been broadcast with an impressive frequency for decades, while novels, feature films and all kinds of gadgets are constantly being produced on the story of Lupine and his gang: in short, there seems to be no end to the success of Monkey's invention Punch, and this unexpected videogame adventure also proves it, which happened to us a little between head and neck in a now desolate toy library - that PlayStation 2. Not that the games dedicated to the nephew of Arsenio Lupine, the protagonist of Maurice Leblanc's novels, have ever stood out for quality or originality, but the absurd title of this production already instills a certain curiosity in fans and casual users, this is beyond doubt . Whether the game lives up to Lupine's fame or just another commercial operation remains to be seen...", "date": "2008-04-09", "grade": null}
