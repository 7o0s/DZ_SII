Like From the Ashes, the first DLC of a certain weight, it adds content to the main campaign, but unlike its predecessor it is much better integrated with the rest of the adventure. By installing it, three large missions are added to the base game, linked together by the gallant adventures of Hans Capon. Those who have played Kingdom Come: Deliverance will have already understood after which events the DLC is activated; for those who haven't played it yet let's just say that we are talking about something that happens in the first third of the game (after about five hours of the main quest). The plot of The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon is very simple to explain: Hans needs Henry's help to try to seduce a girl and asks him to perform some simple tasks which, of course, will turn out to be much more complicated than expected . Between political intrigues, necklaces to be recovered, dice tournaments to be won, poems to be recited, love potions to be made, murders, thefts and so on, will we be able to make Lord Capon happy? Don't take it for granted, because it's not. As you may have guessed from the description and title of the DLC, its tones are much more goliardic than those of the base game, although there are more serious and tense moments. Precisely this variation, or rather, exasperation of notes that pre-exist in the game (just think of Father Godwin's quest) is what makes it particularly lovable. If you pass the comparison, where Kingdom Come: Deliverance aimed, despite some concessions and all the limitations of the case, to be a real historical novel translated into videogame form, The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon aims for greater lightness , with fun and light-hearted missions, however challenging and full of choices to make. Game mechanics and content In terms of game mechanics, The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon changes little or nothing from what was experienced in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. From this point of view, the continuity with the base game is total, apart from the revision of some minor aspects, such as the Farkle score (the game of dice). In this sense, the new Rattay tournament is much more interesting, from which excellent equipment is obtained, which however is part of the large free update launched at the same time as the DLC and therefore does not contribute to forming the judgment. Another aspect to underline: it is one thing to play The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon starting it when it actually becomes available in the campaign and another to do it with an end-game save. We were able to test the DLC in both circumstances, using a save provided to us by the developer and one of our old final saves: in the first case, the challenge offered and the rewards obtained have a greater impact on the economy of the campaign, while in the second some missions become easier and what you get is only useful for collecting purposes, so to speak. Obviously the narrative quality of the missions does not decrease, they are still worth playing, but they are less decisive. Let's say that if you have already finished Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon is to be considered a good extra to get back into the game while it lasts (we finished it in about 6 and a half hours with the final save) and nothing more. We honestly didn't mind it and it's enormously better than From the Ashes, especially from a conceptual point of view, but we're still waiting for a real Blood & Wine expansion of The Witcher 3, instead of these little additions, which other than that they don't cost much either.", "date": "2018-10-16", "grade": "7.0"}
