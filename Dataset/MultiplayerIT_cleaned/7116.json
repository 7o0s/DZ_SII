Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. There was a time when any mobile developer felt compelled to make an endless runner, perhaps with the hope of creating a new Temple Run; and so we have really seen everything within the confines of this particular videogame genre: from third-person interpretations to horizontal scrolling ones, from beautiful products to decidedly ugly ones, from injections of freshness and originality to the most shameless clones. After the inevitable saturation, when by now the users had the boxes full of trying their hand at yet another running game, the opposite effect therefore occurred, or rather desertification while waiting for the next phenomenon to imitate. Flappy Bird was also a great example of this trend, after all. In short, Harmonix plays a difficult game, on treacherous terrain, with its Record Run. An endless runner, in fact, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store and which boasts musical elements that should on paper distinguish its gameplay from the very numerous competition. The idea is very simple and has already been applied to productions that thanks to this gimmick have been able to gain a large following: a music track from the playlist is imported into the game (adding it to the few songs already present), the software analyzes it to identify the beat and therefore the game is accompanied by the sound we prefer, and which with its rhythm determines the actions we are called to perform, in this case avoiding the many obstacles placed along the path that is faced by the protagonist to recover the discs that are his just been stolen. Record Run offers the nice possibility of using your own music, but otherwise we are not there Funny people Record Run completely entrusts the management of the character to the touch commands, who along a path formed by two lanes, viewed from the side at three quarters, must jump, slide and move from one side of the sidewalk to the other to avoid the impact with passers-by. telephone booths, barriers, movers, cats and whatnot. All of this for a period of time which is actually not infinite, as the genre to which it belongs would suggest, but which lasts exactly as long as the piece we have decided to import and which, with its rhythm, determines the timing of our moves. Each slide that we make on the screen is in fact evaluated with a view to a final score that expresses our degree of precision with respect to the piece, and that we can clearly improve attempt after attempt to reach the five stars, absolute perfection. Unfortunately, the playful component of Record Run, thanks to the already mentioned inflation of the endless runners, runs out in a very short time: the obstacles are fairly numerous but you get to know them within a game and the random generation of content ends up being limited; the usual ~survival~ setting is debased by the presence of three ~hearts~, which can be restored, which make the completion of the stint trivial; the controls are so sensitive that often one action is interpreted as another, at the expense of accuracy; but above all there is really nothing that can place the Harmonix production above blockbusters such as the aforementioned Temple Run or the still excellent Subway Surfers, just to stay on third person interpretations. Of course, the possibility of being able to import the songs we prefer always has its charm and the free experience is guaranteed by the traditional missions, the completion of which earns the ~backstage pass~ necessary to purchase additional slots for the songs, which can also be clearly unlocked via in-app purchase. Technically, then, the title is nice and pleasant: thanks to a good characterization of the characters and even to some psychedelic concessions, which occurs when we pull off a certain number of well-chosen moves and the world around us suddenly takes on acid colors, putting us in a sort of ~state of grace~ which multiplies the score.", "date": "2014-05-17", "grade": "5.8"}
