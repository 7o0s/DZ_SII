After these premises, returning to get your hands on the dear old Ps2 Dual Shock and taking part in the first game is a strange, bittersweet sensation, halfway between meeting a dear friend again for the umpteenth time and realizing that, in fact, not much has changed since the last time we met. Yes, because it seems quite clear right away that, just like the users, Konami itself has concentrated most of its resources on the editions for the new consoles, limiting itself to therefore packaging a largely faithful episode on the historic Sony monolith to the previous one. Not a photocopy though, mind you; there are differences, some more visible than others, but it is frankly difficult to say that this club championship brings with it the annual evolution that we used to encounter. First of all, the game speed is (as always) lower than that of PES, with great pleasure for those looking for a more reasoned and realistic maneuver; from this point of view, building noteworthy actions is easier, also thanks to the improvements made to the passages. In fact, these are more precise and tense, even if on occasion it still happens to see the ~receiving~ player motionless waiting for the ball to reach his feet, perhaps letting the opponent blow it away. The control system has generally been slightly cleaned up and made more responsive and enjoyable, and in the same way the management of shots is more reliable. On the other hand, the news regarding artificial intelligence is more visible, which now appears markedly more ~human~ thanks to the presence of errors in which the CPU can incur; wrong passes, oversized crosses or inaccurate lightening allow you to set your actions differently, perhaps adopting a more wait-and-see tactic by exploiting the lightness mentioned above. On the other hand, the goalkeepers are not entirely convincing, who if on the one hand appear more mobile by adopting much more the exit from the posts, on the other hand they sometimes take positions bordering on the absurd, thus taking goals as amateurs. Furthermore, the choice by the programmers to lower the general difficulty level is quite questionable, to the point that even the fifth of the six available (the sixth must be unlocked with the wen) for numerous ~professionals~ of the Konami series will appear decidedly undemanding. As far as the licenses and available teams are concerned, this episode can obviously count on the first and second division teams of the j-league, but also on those of the top series of the 2006-2007 championships of Italy, Spain, England (this one without shirts and names of the official clubs), France and Holland, plus about thirty ~loose~ teams such as Bayern Munich, Juventus, Boca, Brugges, etc. No national teams, but you can get over it. Player transfers are therefore blocked at the end of last season, obviously without all the news of this summer's transfer market. There are also 62 stadiums available, even if it must be said that most of these, just under 40, are plants located in Japan. The graphic and sound component is practically the same as in the previous chapter, without variations of any kind. I feel fantasist But it is among the game modes that Winning Eleven 2007 club championship reserves the best surprise. In fact, among the various championships, cups, competitions and Master Leagues, there is the unprecedented Fantasista Mode, a challenge in which you are called to take on the role of a young and inexperienced player in search of athletic and professional growth. That's right, you got it right: only one player. And the main camera (although it is possible to change it using the ~classics~) is fixed just behind the shoulders of one's alter ego, therefore extremely similar to the courageous but disappointing ~Libero Grande~ by Namco several years ago. The first step to take is to create the footballer using the editor by choosing somatic features, height, ballistic qualities, and role on the pitch. Being able to enter the perspective of having control of a single player, and not of the entire team, is a very stimulating and intriguing factor; you have to try to maintain your position, observe the movements of your teammates to make the most of them, and above all measure your strength to avoid ending up panting after a few minutes. The camera, while obviously offering some limits and a lesser view of the game, is overall more than sufficient, and also contributes enormously to giving a strong feeling of immersion within the game. Tackling the matches from ~inside~ the stadium instead of from the stands is a solution with a great scenographic effect, and in some respects even exciting. But the moThe Imaginative Dality is more than a simple Master League to be faced with a single player, since you are effectively a member of the team, and not the manager or coach; therefore it is necessary to demonstrate one's worth on the field, and accept to be replaced, placed on the bench or even not to be called up for matches. Your career can also evolve, and putting yourself in the spotlight allows you to obtain market requests from more prestigious clubs. Playing Fantasista therefore gives the impression of being able to represent the first step for Konami, the experiment for what the much-discussed online mode 11 against 11 (or 10 against 10, excluding goalkeepers) should be. The basics are undoubtedly more than valid, even if there are defects; beyond the slowdowns that affect the action in the most complex stadiums, the control system adapts well but not perfectly to the view from the field. In addition, the artificial intelligence of the companions is not always so good, on the contrary, and more generally it seems not to be the same as in the ~normal~ mode. Comment For the first time, a chapter of the Konami football series does not earn an enthusiastic vote on these pages. J-League Winning Eleven 2007 Club Championship is in fact the classic ~end of the race~ episode for Ps2, with novelties reduced to a minimum and more or less marginal improvements. In reality, this latest edition can to all intents and purposes be considered the best ever made, but the step forward is all in all so small as to make the Club Championship effectively a chapter ~only for enthusiasts~. The original Fantasista mode remains, welcome and pleasant but which should be considered more of an experiment to be developed than a concrete point of arrival. Pros The best chapter in the Konami series Always a lot of fun especially in multiplayer Promising playmaker mode Cons Minimized new features and improvements Some serious shortcomings in the licenses The desire for next gen is more than ripe Sooner or later this moment should have come, we all knew it: j-league winning eleven 2007 club championship is in fact the first chapter of the Konami series for Ps2 NOT to have been awaited in a feverish and anxious way by the millions of fans of the best football series never made. Of course, the ~hard core~ of the old guard has once again populated the forums looking for information and news on this first 2007 edition, but most of the gamers used to living on bread and pro evolution soccer is now striving towards the end of October, the period in which the edition for Ps3 and Xbox 360 will make its debut on the market. Which, to all intents and purposes, can be considered as Konami's real and definitive step towards the next-gen, after that PES6 for Xbox 360 that last year was unable to fully convince.", "date": "2007-08-13", "grade": null}
