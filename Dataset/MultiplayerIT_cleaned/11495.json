{"name": "Final Fantasy II: Anniversary Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-ii-anniversary-edition-recensione.html", "text": "On the occasion of the celebrations of the twenty years of Final Fantasy, Square-Enix, having become a ~master~ like Capcom in ~squeezing~ its best brands as hard as possible, obtaining the maximum between remakes, spin-offs, special editions, etc, certainly could not avoid re-presenting, in a revised and corrected version, also the second chapter of his JRPG saga, the most famous ever, alongside the first. Just like its predecessor, Final Fantasy II Anniversary Edition represents a further tribute to the highly successful franchise to which Squaresoft owes all its success. Of course, in many respects it is undeniable that this is also a commercial operation, as it was at the time when it came out in a slightly different version from this one for GBA and PlayStation, but it is also true that for us it is an opportunity to rediscover ( or discover) a title that is considered among the progenitors of modern role-playing games, in a new and much more pleasant graphic design than the original. The Empire This second chapter of the saga is among other things the first to characterize the protagonists of the game, starting from the attribution to each of them of a name, but above all, of a well-defined ~historical~, moral and spiritual identity. It is also the first in which the very nice Chochobo appear, a true symbol of the saga. Final Fantasy II tells the story of a world in turmoil, in which the evil Emperor of Paramekia, Mateus, makes a pact with a demon to obtain extraordinary powers in exchange for making him control monsters and creatures of all kinds, to be used to invade and dominate the planet. When the Paramekian troops penetrate the city of Finn, four young inhabitants, Maria, Firion, Leon and Gus, try to escape to escape the massacre that is taking place, but are caught up and killed in a wood. However, thanks to a spell, with the intervention of Princess Hilda and her dolphin Minriu in that of Altea, they are resurrected, ready to give battle to the wicked tyrant. The gameplay of the game revolves around the traditional concept of exploration & combat & upgrade typical of the old RPGs. The party travels across lands and seas, covering various types of environments, gathering information by talking to non-player characters in villages or around the world, equipment, items and spells (in chests or buying them in dedicated shops), tackling Sub-Quests and monsters of all sorts (one hundred and seventy those present in total) and then resume their journey following the guidelines of the story. A first evolution Final Fantasy II features a classic combat system, with random (too frequent) and turn-based battles in which characters and opponents, transported to a special screen, line up facing each other waiting to perform an action determined by their ATB and, in the case of heroes, from the choices made shortly before by the player through a drop-down menu. However, it presents the first significant innovations for the time, which differentiate it from its predecessor, for example. First of all, the system that regulates the evolution of the characters changes: experience points (EXP) and those for skills (AP) disappear. Here party members evolve in relation to the use and frequency they make of a particular action or ability. For example, if you want to increase the Strength of a Pg then you should often use the Attack command with him, while if vice versa you want to increase his magical peculiarities you need to act on the Magic command. Instead, to increase parameters such as HP and MP it is necessary to suffer, risking, damage of a certain amount, bringing the relative indicators in battle to about half. In this way it is possible to characterize each individual element of the team by attributing certain ~skills~ with practice given that, among other things, the Classes to which they belong are missing. Thus it is possible to have characters who are proficient in the use of swords but have not precluded the use of magic. Even if in a limited way compared to those who are perfected in using it. In fact, Final Fantasy II provides that if you improve in one aspect, you ~get worse~ in the other so as not to create too powerful heroes in everything. For example, if Firion by dint of using his sword becomes powerful in physical attacks (Strength), his magical abilities will tend and decrease hand in hand. As mentioned before, she will be able to use magic, but not with the same effectiveness as a Maria trained in its constant use. Novelty? Another important novelty of the time was the introduction of a system that managed the ~growth~ of weapons and spells separately, as we were able to appreciate, at least as a concept, in an evolved and modified version in the recent Final Fantasy XII. On the other hand, specifically intproduced in this remake there are few, in terms of playability even none (some tweaking and recalibration of some aspects here and there). In fact, if we exclude some new scenarios among the dungeons to explore (two new ones, the Arcane Labyrinth and the Arcane Sanctuary), a new Boss and some creatures, these mainly concern the graphic and audio sectors, given that even the unlockable mode Soul of Rebirth (almost an extra narrative chapter) is taken from the Game Boy Advance version of the game. In the first case we have a spectacular CG introduction and some cutscenes in the key stages of the story, a retouched bestiary, an Art Gallery and a complete restyling of areas and characters. These are reproduced in a detailed way for a 2D engine, with defined and very nice sprites, characterized by bright colors. In the second, some effective retouching of the sounds inherent in explosions, blows, etc., and the reinterpretation of the excellent soundtrack then created by a young but already talented Nobuo Uematsu. Comment A discreet technical achievement as a whole, which finds its apex in a respectable graphic sector, referring to 2D, combined with a plot that clashes with a ~comic~ character design for its drama, make this authentic myth such a product not intended only for the most ardent fans of the Squaresoft saga. Final Fantasy II: Anniversary Edition, even with all the limitations of the case, especially related to the ancient and sometimes repetitive gameplay, despite not adding anything really new (apart from the graphics) compared to the other reinterpretations, is one of those titles that at least once you have to play in your life as a gamer, for personal culture, for passion for JRPGs and to appreciate the origins of a saga that is in many ways ~magical~. Pros: Good longevity. New translation for better dialogue fidelity. Compelling storyline. Cons: On some occasions difficult. Good but outdated gameplay. The usual random fights too frequent.", "date": "2008-04-10", "grade": null}
