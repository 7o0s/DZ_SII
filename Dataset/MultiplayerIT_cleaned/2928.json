In fact, one of the strengths of Paradox's new grand strategy, which was also the strength of its glorious predecessor, is its ability to create engaging plots while giving the player all the tools to manage them as he sees fit. For Crusader Kings 2 there was talk of the best video game transposition of Game of Thrones, even without an official license, for the sequel we can say the same, with the addition of various features that make its intrigues even more significant. Gameplay Told in a nutshell, Crusader Kings 3 is a strategic game in which you need to be able to make your dynasty prosper, both at a territorial level and at the level of political power. The game is set in the Middle Ages and is divided into a large number of campaigns of varying difficulty, which see us play various feudal lords in search of fortune. The initial difficulty varies depending on the size of the kingdom, the resources available, but above all the relationship of the leader with the neighborhood, as well as the breadth of his line of succession. The fully 3D game map helps enormously to obtain the information needed to start immersing yourself in the gameplay and to pursue our objectives, be they expansion, stability or the creation of a broad line of succession (the game leaves free in this sense, while giving some general objectives). As in Crusader Kings 2, the map is freely zoomable. Each zoom level corresponds to different information, such as the political borders of the various kingdoms or the vision of the icons of the troops that are moving through the territories. There is no shortage of indications on the internal division of the individual kingdoms, icons linked to some key roles, such as the shields of the vassals (personalities to whom the feudal lord entrusts the government of a certain territory), or the representation of the major cities present. The latter give the possibility to click on them to manage them, perhaps by constructing new buildings or verifying the happiness of the population. One of the first concepts to understand in order to play Crusader Kings 3 at its best is how it is not only an economic, military, but also a political and, in some ways, human simulation of what a kingdom could have been at the time of the Crusades. To better understand the game, the first thing to do is start the tutorial, which in any case doesn't even try to explain in detail all the functions of the interface in its hour of duration. After all, it wouldn't be possible. Provided us with some basic concepts, he then invites us to experiment and consult the internal encyclopedia if necessary. It should be noted that Paradox has chosen to focus much more on explaining how the characters work, than on illustrating the military side, already giving the idea from the tutorial that the goal of Crusader Kings 3 is not just to make us go to war with anyone, but also to make us understand the balance of power determined by human relationships and by the ability of a ruler to guarantee himself a strong offspring, as well as to satisfy his most faithful servants. In between is an infinite amount of possibilities. Leaders are normal human beings, therefore transient creatures with strengths and many weaknesses. Their character traits determine their relationships with other characters, whether they are court people, lords of other territories or representatives of various religions. From this point of view Paradox has done an exceptional job, endowing each character with his own personality that enters into a relationship with that of the others in a plausible way, but also leading to unexpected results. The first thing to do at the beginning of each game is to pause the action (the gameplay flows in real time at player-selectable speeds) to examine the character traits of all the characters in the leader's circle, as well as those of the key figures of the territories around ours. It is vital to know the consideration that our vassals have of us, as well as to understand immediately with whom it is possible to ally and with whom we will probably end up making war or worse. After all, it is also important to immediately understand that relationships are inevitably fluid and that every choice made produces cconsequences based on the expectations that others have of us. But now let's take an example of a game situation, which is perhaps the only way to really understand the spirit of Crusader Kings 3. A game situation Our leader, of Scottish origins, is a rough and charismatic man, a lover of the good life and escapades, but at the same time very economically shrewd. He is married to the daughter of a Scandinavian lord, a sober and pious woman who has very little regard for him, despite being his adviser. The two already have their own descendants, but the two sons seem to lean more towards the mother than the father. In terms of general policy, we decide early in the game that our government will keep a close eye on spending, but will try to do good for the people by not overtaxing them. In this way growth will be slower, but we will avoid internal insurrections. Our initial skills will all focus on the principle of social peace. Over time, factors such as education, stress and the natural change of leaders due to aging and death will lead to changes in government ability, but given the initial situation it is better not to pull too much with the population, given that our character traits are harbingers of many others. As we said, our leader is an unredeemed seducer who can't help but slip into the sheets of the women of the court and even of his friends' wives, at least of all those who cast lascivious glances at the table. If we wish, as players we could avoid satisfying this bow tie side of his, with however the result of dramatically increasing his stress, probably driving him straight to madness. Better to indulge him. The problem is that this weakness of his creates strong disagreements with various people: the husbands of his mistresses, which in the case of other feudal lords can mean the exacerbation of relations up to war; the ecclesiastical representatives, who never look kindly on a leader who indulges in the wildest lust; and wife and children, who do not appreciate a too libertine father. Furthermore, treason is a powerful lever, which some unscrupulous men can exploit to increase their power through schemes (basically long-term plans that involve seduction, murder, the renegotiation of vassalage conditions and much more), so much that one of our vassals convinces his wife to be very available to us precisely to get what she wants: a seat on the council. In short, the first change of leadership of the game, quite sudden, takes place by poisoning. The sender of the sweet gift seems to have been our most chaste wife, in collaboration with one of the children who had become an adult, who shared her profound contempt for us. He is the new leader. The young man is of a completely different kind than the old sovereign: a lover of war and a fervent Catholic, he wants the population to rise up against some unworthy sovereigns, probably guilty of resembling his father too much. His political entourage (vassals or personalities of the realm assigned to key roles such as administrative and intelligence) also undergoes a real revolution, with the changes aimed at rewarding the faction that helped plot against the unworthy parent. Old friends of orgies and drinking now become enemies to be kept on the edge of the kingdom, while old enemies are now installed in key roles and have also been rewarded with noble titles that give them further prestige. The important thing is that the dynasty continues and that the conquered titles are not lost. War The military side also deserves a few words. As in Crusader Kings 2, it is not the focus of the game: armies can be formed by hiring different types of units, but the clashes take place automatically and are determined by the overall strength of our army, which we cannot give direct orders in combat. Somehow we are faced with the simplest system of Crusader Kings 3, almost secondary compared to the others: to declare war we must have a casus belli, useful for not suddenly deteriorating relations with the other kingdoms (declaring war without a reason is not frowned upon by no one). The casus belli can be the simple assertion of rights over a certain territory for dynastic matters, or having been attacked, or having very strong leverage against someone. For example, a deeply religious leader can attack the territory of a leader with a dissolute lifestyle by leveraging precisely this (perhaps after sending some courtesans specifically to manufacture provand against the opponent). Once in the war it is possible to raise all the troops of a territory to form an army and send it where it is needed. If you have allies you can call them to our defense, increasing the scale of the conflict. Usually the wars of Crusader Kings 3 take place between multiple kingdoms, especially in the advanced stages of the game, where the previously built political relationships take on a strictly practical utility in terms of deployable forces on the field. Naturally, the bigger our army, the more it costs to maintain it. But this is really the basis. In general, even the military side has precise implications for all the politics of our kingdom. For example, too long a war would inevitably end up exhausting the population; an unmotivated war would risk creating new enemies for us, while a lost war could force us to cede territorial sovereignty. The feasible cases are many and varied. The important thing is not to list them all, but that you understand how interconnected they are with everything else. Graphics Graphically Crusader Kings 3 is a definite step forward compared to its predecessor. Paradox hasn't performed any miracles and, given the genre, it wasn't even required of it, but some new features are certainly welcome. Meanwhile, now all the characters have their own 3D portrait and are equipped with small animations, which make the picture more dynamic. They also age over time, showing their evolution in a plastic way. Sure, the character models aren't beautiful, but with thousands of them, it was pretty clear that Paradox would have to make some compromises. In any case, the function of the 3D portraits is not merely aesthetic, but like all the other elements of the game it serves to give the player information. For example, the expression of the character we are talking to allows us to understand his attitude towards us by eye. It is a small thing, in hindsight, given that there are numbers to give us the pulse of the situation, but one of those that helps to immerse yourself more in the gameplay. Remaining on the technical side, the map also deserves a few words. It displays more information than Crusader Kings 2, but it's also more enjoyable to look at due to the greater detail - be it the better representation of biomes or the 3D cities with their key buildings in full view. Perhaps it is slightly less legible than that of its predecessor, but it must be said that after a few hours of play you get used to the new icons and you no longer notice them. After all, the greatest amount of information on the screen is worth the candle, as they say. Problems One of the limitations of Crusader Kings 3, if we want to define it that way, is its being easily readable as a basis on which Paradox will build a castle of additions. From a content point of view, the comparison with Crusader Kings 2 at the moment is merciless, but it was inevitable that it was like this: we are talking about a game released in 2012 which now has more than sixty DLCs, for around 300 in total value. Naturally, those who come from that experience must accept that they cannot immediately have the same amount of content, or wait, perhaps even years, for the game to be equipped with extras. It should be noted that we are still talking about a title that can easily hold up for tens, if not hundreds, of hours. We ourselves have spent more than fifty hours writing this review and we have always run into different situations. The question to ask is therefore not whether or not Crusader Kings 3 is able to hold a candle to Crusader Kings 2, but whether it is a valid basis for building something equally majestic in the long run. The answer in this case is that not only is it, but also that its novelties will certainly allow developers to make diversified content for the game. In particular, the focus on personalities and dynasties opens up possibilities that Crusader Kings 2 did not have. However, it is too early to start making predictions of this type. There's a kingdom to rule and a pair of pesky adversaries to assassinate, so their cronies understand that forming factions to overthrow us with the help of a foreign king is never a good idea.", "date": "2020-08-31", "grade": "9.0"}
