Of course there are plenty of fighting games, but this is another matter: the clash between boxers in a ring, beyond the romanticisms that have always served as a necessary accompaniment to this ancient sport, is in fact a rather technical thing and not even too fun to translate into a video game, in most cases. There are therefore few simulations, and also few arcade reinterpretations of this type of fight, except for a few rare examples. The most famous and most successful title of the latter category is certainly Punch-Out, the Nintendo series that originated with the old 8-bit NES and has continued, albeit with a much less frequent cadence than other series from the house of Kyoto, until recently, and Justin Mai's Prizefighters is clearly inspired by this. The concept is the same, and given the adoption of the same shot it is clear that the structure is very similar to that of the original Nintendo: it is a question of facing various opponents following the career of a boxer, with the clashes reproduced in a very intuitive and basic, but not for this undemanding. It's an arcade that doesn't try to realistically replicate the progress of a boxing match but leverages the timing with which to launch attacks and apply defensive maneuvers, while trying to manage energy to overcome the opponent. The shot is behind the fighter, which fully incorporates the particular cut of Punch-Out and consequently makes the action somewhat similar to that of the model, even if in this case we are quite far from the level of gameplay of the classic Nintendo .

Fistful career There is a sort of career to follow which is essentially a long sequence of fights to go through, with the choice of choosing your opponent or accepting any challenges for the defense of the title. The combat system is based on simple touches on the screen, both for attacks and for defensive manoeuvres: touching the upper part of the screen hits the face or keeps one's guard up, touching the lower part corresponds to attacking the abdomen or low block, while the different duration of the pressure determines the power of the attack and the movement of the finger on the screen instead allows you to dodge in the chosen direction. The game is therefore structured entirely on the use of the touch screen and this is good and right for a mobile title, resulting intuitive and accessible for everyone. From here to the risk of bordering on simplistic the step is short, and in fact it cannot be said that Prizefighters demonstrates great depth in combat or a particularly convincing strategic approach: in the early stages it is more profitable to strike blindly by tapping the screen quickly rather than being attentive to the opponent's movements and trying to anticipate his intentions, but from the middle of the ranking onwards it becomes necessary to master the system as best as possible, which poses difficulties because the ~reading~ of the match is always rather chaotic. In particular, the various bars are not easily visible while controlling the opponent and the controls sometimes do not have a perfect response, which prevents total control of the fight. It is also a pity for the poor characterization of the approximately 30 opponents that we meet: we can forget the particularities of each single opponent seen in Punch-Out, in short, because here each fighter is substantially the same with some different pattern. On the other hand, the addition of a certain progression is interesting, which allows you to increase the score applied to the various characteristics of the fighter such as strength, endurance, defense and more, so as to also includeof the protagonist's deeper management elements.", "date": "2017-12-28", "grade": "7.5"}
