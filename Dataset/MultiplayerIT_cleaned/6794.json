However, the restructuring of the market towards a more faithful, passionate and consequently spending type of user, and the same repositioning of Nintendo with Wii U, has inevitably reduced the numbers of the series, which has gone from the tens (and more) of millions of copies sold at the peak to about 5 of the last chapter. It is no coincidence that the French house has played the card of the mobile version this year, which we have more than favorably reviewed recently on these pages, correctly identifying the currently most consistent casual basin in that market. Obviously the iOS and Android version did not compromise the publication of a ~classic~ edition for home consoles, entitled Just Dance 2015. Unfortunately, the results are not as interesting. The King of the Ballroom The history of Just Dance has gone through an almost completely non-existent evolution of the basic mechanics, a sign of the goodness of the original idea: whether it is with a WiiMote in hand rather than with Move or in front of a PlayStation Camera or Kinect, the concept of the basis has always remained to try to replicate the proposed choreographies in front of the screen, on the notes of a selection of the most famous pop (and not only) songs of recent years. The development team therefore preferred to strengthen the offer of the outline, adding modes and ensuring multiplayer not only locally but also online. If up to now the production effort has therefore been perceived rather distinctly, with Just Dance 2015 on the contrary there is a moment of stasis, of tiredness of the franchise, probably arrived in the current formula to have said everything it had to say. The actual novelties are in fact limited both in their number and in their effective impact on the experience: in fact we are talking about the Community Remix, or rather the availability of songs (for the moment only Happy by Pharrell Williams), in which the choreography is not composed of the usual silhouettes but of clips of videos recorded by real users during their performances. A nice variant, but nothing more. Added to this is the Challenger mode, which allows you to challenge friends and other players in a more detailed way, making single sessions less ~lonely~. An interesting effort, just as the online mode is pleasant, almost identical to last year's, but it is evident how Just Dance gives its best when played together with other people in the same room, sharing both the embarrassment and the fun. The version we've been able to test is the Wii U version, but as far as Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are concerned, Ubisoft has had the excellent idea of allowing users who don't have the relevant cameras or motion sensors to play. All this thanks simply to smartphones (iOS and Android), which thanks to a special application can act as a controller exactly as if they were Wiimotes. An intelligent solution, which reduces the entry cost for Just Dance 2015 and at the same time fits within that more than evident trend of abandonment of peripherals of this type that the market is following. Just Dance 2015 is still a splendid party game, but the series now needs to be rethought The reality is that Just Dance 2015 is a product that in its 40-50 euro retail version, after 6 years of exploitation of the franchise, is starting to struggle to find full justification. The undeniable reduction of the creative drive ultimately translates into a product that is essentially nothing more than a collection of new songs with the relative choreographies. There are over 40 songs on the disc, to which others can be added which must however be purchased individually through the appropriate Shop: at the time of writing, most of them are recycled from previous episodes, but it is assumed that the offer is strengthened with unreleased tracks in the coming months. The problem is that the extreme variety in the genres of the proposed tracks, organized in such a way as to try to be able to interest the largest possible slice of users, brings with it the downside of making only a handful of them really relevant for the user. Hard to believe that those who love to dance to the tune of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance have the same predisposition with Let it Go from the Frozen soundtrack, The Bouzouki's Epic Sirtaki or the chilling Xmas Tree from Bollywood Santa, while it is more probable that from total of the songs offered are thenonly less than half those that will actually be consciously chosen. An ideally similar product for target users such as Singstar has adopted the digital distribution channel, with a free basic client that can then be built song after song on the basis of one's tastes. A similar path could also be the preferable one for the future of Just Dance.", "date": "2014-10-31", "grade": "7.5"}
