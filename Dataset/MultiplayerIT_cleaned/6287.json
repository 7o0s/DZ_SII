The developers have sewn on him the perfect cursed video game suit, focusing everything on the violence of the contents and on some gimmicks that have defined the target unequivocally. Let's clear up a misunderstanding: Hatred is not a pure representation of hatred against mankind. I'm bad and longhaired To be honest from this point of view it is far too weak, given that it is burdened by immense conceptual limits which, indeed, ideologize it with no way out. The protagonist of Hatred, despite not having a past, is actually a well-definable character in his cultural essence. If we wish, we could define him as a concentrate of that adolescent nihilism that the entertainment industry likes so much and which allows him to sell films, books and video games galore. Usually everything is mediated by irony (see the Grand Theft Auto series) or is framed within a moralizing context, in which anti-social behaviors are left free to manifest themselves, to then be put under control and sanctioned (just see any superhero movie). In Hatred this does not happen and theoretically the goal would be to give free rein to that anti-social energy that, more or less, we all drag along. The problem is that Hatred, in his desire to be brutal at all costs, ends up being false and much more constructed than one might think. Destructive Creations has fallen victim to the same hypocrisy that, theoretically, it would like to see swept away. Hatred is finally out: let's find out if it was real glory or if it's just a big flash in the pan Too much hate Hatred is a twin stick shooter like Geometry Wars. Basically you go around shooting everything that moves using the handful of weapons available (machine guns, pistols, shotguns and so on), with the aim of eliminating as many people as possible between civilians and law enforcement. The levels are built as small open worlds in which there are main objectives, such as destroying a police station or surviving the onslaught of special forces, and some optional secondary objectives, such as generating chaos at a party or enriching of corpses a funeral. The explosions are the best part of the game After a while the performances become repetitive In general, the formula is always the same: you go around trying to reach the red dots on the map and shoot. Anyone who doesn't die immediately riddled by gunshots can be killed by approaching and pressing a key. What you get out of it is not only particularly gory animation, but also some energy. Executions are the only way to recover lost life. It is not clear why, apart from forcing the player to look at them, but it is. If you want, you can also drive vehicles to get around. Too bad that the guidance system is so bad as to make it preferable to move on foot. Fortunately, the only level that necessarily requires you to drive, that of chasing the train, which is also the only variant of the game formula described above, does not involve having to make big evolutions behind the wheel. The bad driving system is not a secondary problem, because it makes the journeys much longer. So we often find ourselves having to revisit long stretches of the map running wildly towards the objective of the moment. Paradoxically Hatred has constant dead moments from which you can not escape. The progression system is also particularly irritating. The developers have planned only a handful of respawn points, both places and the possibility of returning to life once dead, for each map. Since the game is quite difficult, mainly due to some big problems that we will discuss shortly, you are often forced to start the levels from scratch once you die or at least have to retrace entire maps. After finishing it, we understood the reason for such a radical choice: Hatred is very short. With all that we died many times, we completed it in about four hours. If they had thought of a less punishing respawn system towards the player, it would have taken even less. Bad people But we mentioned other problems. The most noticeable is the woodiness of the protagonist. Our unnamed killer is slow at everything, both shooting and throwing grenades. Couple his shortcomings with enemies shooting when they're still out of frame and you get a pretty bleak picture. Often it is not clear where the enemies are The best tactic to win is to get behind cover and wait for the stupid AI to get theremake the chicken on duty come against him, who despite the presence of the corpses of his colleagues in plain sight, will not think twice about attacking head on. Any other tactic is a waste of time. To make the situation worse in many cases, the graphics engine also takes care of it. Visually, Hatred is characterized by low-contrast black and white, with some elements of the scenario in color (for example the explosions, objectively very well done). The problem is that the predominance of black over other shades of gray creates situations where it is really difficult to distinguish enemies. This is especially true in particularly dark levels such as those set in the sewers, where you often find yourself dealing with moving spots. In short, the shootings, which should be the highlight of such a violent title, are in reality of a suffocating slowness and repetitiveness. The only times they work are when the targets are disarmed. Unfortunately, the best feature of the game has been underexploited, namely the engine that manages damage to buildings, which explode and collapse in a magnificently unrealistic, yet convincing way. In short, the very violent Hatred is overall a short and mediocre video game which, if it did not foresee the massacre of unarmed civilians, would have been snubbed by most of those who today consider it the new messiah. Sick mind But let's go back to the theme of the game and the underlying hypocrisy that characterizes it. As we wrote in the first paragraph, Hatred aims to be a pure representation of hate. A kind of vent against social hypocrisy. Too bad it replaces social hypocrisy with that of its developers and its target. Hatred is part of human nature. You can limit it, but you cannot cancel it. A feeling of pure hatred should be, in a certain sense, democratic, that is to say, it should spread over everything and everyone without distinction like death. Much ado about nothing? The feeling of hate expressed by Hatred is the most targeted that can exist, because we are not allowed to express who we are, however much we may abhor it, but we are asked to share someone else's hatred, i.e. to who wrote the game. The protagonist is not an abstraction of sentiment, but a representation of it aimed at a certain cultural target, just as his targets are not generic neighbors, but very specific social categories. It is enough to consider the presence of objectives, which as such must be thought of, elaborated and written, to realize how much this hatred is mediated, profoundly hypocritical and conformist in its own way. Because conformism manifests itself every time one adapts to a common and stereotyped thought, even if it is that of a marginalized cultural minority. Looking closely, Hatred is full of stereotypes, starting with the visual characterization of the protagonist and the sentences he pronounces. You spend the entire game hearing him say platitudes like, ~You don't deserve to live~ or ~Where's your guardian angel?~. Stuff for frustrated altar boys, aggravated by taking themselves too seriously. Every action he performs is not the result of natural brutality, therefore the bearer of a material and controversial truth, but is a slave to an aesthetic that is expressed in poses, designed to satisfy precise expectations. In Hatred everything is deeply childish, starting from the title. Indeed, starting from the price of  16.66. His problem therefore is not so much the violence, which undeniably exists, but his inability to represent it as something that goes beyond an epidermal nuisance. In short, more than an extreme title, it conceptually reminded us of the videos of a Truce Baldazzi or a Simoncino, to whom we dedicated the titles of the paragraphs, that is, stuff that impresses teenagers because killing black people and revelers seems alternative to them.", "date": "2015-06-03", "grade": "4.5"}
