{"name": "Sudden Strike Forever", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sudden-strike-forever.html", "text": "The first news Let's start from the beginning. The first difference compared to the original game can already be seen in the main menu, which now offers the possibility to set the difficulty level according to one's abilities: easy, medium (which corresponds to the difficulty level of SS) and difficult. Given the steep learning curve of the title, now even the less experienced can approach the campaign in a more ~soft~ way; for the more skilled naturally the opposite is true, even if I don't think there are many eager to deal with the (already) difficult missions on the hard level... As for the single-player mode of the game, additional ones appear in addition to the original campaigns , in which it will also be possible to take control of the British army, engaged in a rather demanding and well-structured African campaign. Naturally, the other Forces featured in the original game also benefited from brand new missions, even more difficult to complete than in the original title. Finally, in the group of single missions, seven new missions appear, recommended for learning the style of play. From a graphical point of view, it seems that the general appearance of the maps (and of the units) has been slightly retouched, and even if it hasn't undergone substantial changes, it cannot be noted that some small details have received better treatment: the woods of Europe no longer have a monotonous green tone, but also have yellow and red autumnal tones, the animations of the military themselves are improved, the appearance of the sapper trucks (the repair-supply units) is now different for each faction and they are instantly recognizable. Of course, the new African setting is full of unpublished details, and the maps of sand, palm trees and pyramids represent a good range for those who have always wanted to emulate Patton... Finally, a last word on the multiplayer mode, which benefits in this expansion from a twenty new maps dedicated to the Capture The Flag and King of The Hill modes. Unit reporting! If there was one aspect of the original game that couldn't be faulted, it was definitely the variety of units available. However, the thing does not seem to have worried the programmers of the CDV, as in this expansion we find some important innovations also from this point of view. One could say that in general the gaps in some departments of the armies of the different factions have been filled, but it is worth taking a little deeper look into this aspect. One of the most important units introduced by the expansion is the general, who has wide-range binoculars with which he can explore the play area in depth: to do this, however, he must remain still, and this helps to expose him in critical conditions, not a little increasing the tactical approach of its use. Let us also recall the doctors, who are much more flexible to use than the ambulance because, if in adequate numbers, they can be well distributed where needed: naturally, unlike vehicles, they are subject to the fragility typical of infantry. Now the soldiers armed with mortars are able to move the weapon in their possession by themselves, even on foot, and if on the one hand there is no longer the need to use a truck for these movements, on the other it is no longer possible to steal their weapons. ' weapon once killed. The ~howitzers~, i.e. the long-range cannons, are now distinct from each other: there is an ultra-heavy model, with extreme power but which can only be moved using the truck and a lighter version, less effective but capable of strike either at a greater range, or with a short, accurate blow. Finally, in some missions there are fixed artillery positions capable of hitting almost anywhere on the map. In addition to the introduction of these new units, some minor defects regarding the existing ones have fortunately been corrected: among all, the tanks (and all vehicles in general), which can finally retreat. Affected by enemy fire, to escape, they don't have to turn around and expose the rear (less armoured) but they retreat (among other things, continuing to shoot) offering the more reinforced front, which is exactly what happens in reality. This provided that the selected unit is made to make a short distance backwards, with an appropriate click of the mouse, otherwise it will turn around with a considerable waste of time. The officers have also been improved, as now, in addition to offering a wide range of vision, they conferor to the units within their radius an increase in experience (this also happens when the graduates are on a vehicle): really not bad. Unit reporting! Even the vehicle refueling system seems to have been simplified, making the process more automatic and less cumbersome, as well as repairing vehicles and depositing mines: this is possible thanks to the improvement of the game interface, which now allows you to perform the same actions with a few clicks less... Improvements and defects Fortunately, the A.I. of the enemy units has received a dusting from the programmers, as now we no longer witness a passive attitude of the opposing troops, happy to be destroyed by the fire of the long-range cannons (as unfortunately we had seen several times in the game original): on the contrary, it is not uncommon to have to deal with rapid sorties from the enemy or to witness movements of vehicles and units in search of shelter. The correction of this aspect of the game, which from ~sitting duck~ has turned into a more valid challenge for the players, undoubtedly represents one of the strengths of the expansion, even if... Although unfortunately we still have to record some problems related to path finding, and it is quite common to see infantry squads which, having to face a narrow passage and unable to cross en bloc, scatter looking for another way exposing themselves to enemy fire. For this reason it is still necessary to babysit our troops a little too much, and this has more than once had the power to make us lose concentration (as well as nerves). However, what we are unable to classify among the merits, or among the defects, is undoubtedly the raising of the difficulty level of the game: in fact, although it is, as we have seen before, adjustable, there is no doubt that the challenge offered by the individual missions it is definitely high. This is also because one gets the impression that, compared to the original game, the new maps are full of ~puzzles~, in the sense that one must first understand what is the best (if not the only) way to be able to achieve victory. If on the one hand fans who have finished the original title will be satisfied, those who have waited for this expansion to approach the Sudden Strike universe will remain a little perplexed, and before possessing a complete mastery of the game, they will have to sweat the proverbial seven coats . But, on the other hand, it is since the time of Covert Operations (the expansion set of the unforgettable Command & Conquer), that the difficulty level of an add-on pack has been raised to a much greater challenge, and even in this case we cannot register it as a fault. The mission editor Personally, I've never been able to use the editors that programmers have increasingly offered to players (maybe I remember an exception for Warcraft2, where I even managed to change the voices of the orcs...), but when it comes to Editors one cannot help but remember that part of the longevity of a title's appeal is generally due to it. In this case the mission editor contained in this expansion (which could even be the greatest incentive for someone to buy), is certainly very valid and the interface is fairly ~user friendly~; of course it takes a learning period to accomplish anything remarkable. In addition to the possibility of drawing a map by inserting each element, there is also the way of activating conditions and effects, through scripts similar to the Starcraft ~triggers~ system. In this case, the impression one gets when working with the editor is that of building a small scale model, perhaps due to the high realism of the setting. Never as in this case it must be said that the time invested in learning the editor will return, thanks to its extreme flexibility, in the form of single / multiplayer maps decidedly similar to those proposed by the programmers. The only caveat is to arm yourself with a lot of patience: perhaps the same needed to overcome some of the more difficult missions... Conclusions. At this point, we just have to answer the question we asked ourselves: is the value of the expansion equal to the price at which it is sold? Is there what is expected of an expansion? Summing up, I would say yes. The new campaigns and missions are in sufficient quantity to guarantee a good longevity (given then the difficulty, however adjustable, which is decidedly increased) even for the most savvy players; the editor of missions represents an invaluable surplus value, also for the new maps that enthusiasts will create in the immediate future; the playability has finally enjoyed, as we have seen, a few but targeted improvements. The judgment, in this sense dedicated to fans of the original game, is rather positive and with few glimmers of error. If, on the other hand, you are among those for whom Sudden Strike meant nothing, this could be a good opportunity to return to the battlefields of the Second World War in this strategy with a partly innovative concept: but if by chance the high difficulty or the he general layout of the game didn't satisfy you, so invest your funds and maybe your time in something else (why not Shogun Total War?). Two final technical notes: the system requirements are identical to those of the original game, and the expansion is, unfortunately, not Stand Alone, but requires Sudden Strike installed on your computer. Finally, thanks to an agreement made between Leader and CDV, the distribution in our territory of the localized version (unfortunately only box and manual) of Sudden Strike Forever, which you can find at a lower price than the imported one, should be recorded. We can only be happy about this, also because the agreement provides that future CDV titles will be completely translated. Conclusions. P.S: a special thanks, as is happening more and more often for reviews of strategic titles of a certain importance, to my good friend Antonio ~TNT~ Strada. A small introduction. Sudden Strike, a game whose review we published a few weeks ago, is undoubtedly one of the pleasant surprises of this year: a little-awaited title, it was able to receive a rather unanimous consensus from critics and strategy enthusiasts thanks to its approach to decidedly original and well-groomed genre. Despite the lack of timely distribution in Italy, the many positive aspects of the title have allowed it to achieve a good volume of sales in our country as well, a volume which is however also confirmed by the success achieved abroad. It is therefore not strange to see it appear so soon after (although it is worth remembering that Sudden Strike was completed more than a year ago, and only some delays related to distribution prevented it from reaching the Italian gaming scene in a short time ) this expansion, entitled Sudden Strike Forever, which aims to correct the defects of the original title and to expand some features. As is our habit, whenever an expansion pack comes to our attention, we will try to understand how much the value added by the game can be worth the expense, which in this case is quite high (about 35 Euros), which lovers of the original title must face.", "date": "2001-11-14", "grade": null}
