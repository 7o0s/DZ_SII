{"name": "Trepang2: la recensione di uno sparatutto poco originale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trepang2-recensione.html", "text": "We have already wondered in the past if solid, fun gameplay, but with nothing original, is enough to keep a video game going. During the Trepang2 review we asked ourselves the same question and gave the same answer as always: yes. This shooter is a chaotic blend of genres and references in which, if we were to take its individual elements into consideration, we would see a title that struggles to stand up. Taken as a whole, however, it offers an intrinsically fun experience, at times pleasantly horror and in some cases blatantly rude. Developed by Trepang Studios and published by Team17, this shooter will please those nostalgic for Crysis thanks to the super powers of the protagonist who recall very much those of the Nanosuit. Invisibility is at the heart of the stealth sections (all optional and can always be tackled with guns blazing) while instead of the Crytek armor there is a function to slow down time. Trepang2 is a schizophrenic game because in its 11 levels (seven of main story and four of side missions) it goes from being a survival with gun and torch, to a psychological horror with surreal environments, without forgetting to become an arrogant shooter with hordes of enemies to deal with Doom to end up with zombies and mutants to slaughter in a short time to blow up a reactor. Wake up 106 Trepang2 will not be remembered for its sensational storytelling, but because it is an experience that is inherently fun and never ceases to entertain The story of Trepang2 begins in medias res with the protagonist, Subject 106, who is rescued from a black site of an evil multinational corporation, the Horizon Corporation, which serves as the main antagonist throughout the game. The first level is very simple and straightforward and consists of a few stealth segments interspersed with the usual large rooms full of enemies that will come at you in waves. Each mission has a more or less powerful final boss to be eliminated through battles that are never simple. Already halfway through the second level, however, it immediately becomes clear that things are not as simple as they seem. Your opponents begin to reveal secrets to give you clues which, at the end of the game, fit together in a puzzle that reveals the final twist. Unfortunately, both in the individual missions and in general there is very little original narrative. There are many stereotypes and the motivations of the opponents leave much to be desired. The beauty of Trepang2, however, is that all this is absolutely irrelevant because the chaotic and extravagant gameplay manages to entertain and amuse leaving the narrative a secondary role. Despite the lack of originality, the writers of the game must be recognized for a certain skill in connecting levels and scenarios that are so distant from each other. In fact, from a military setting to Metal Gear Solid, we move on to laboratories full of zombies in Resident Evil style, from the disturbing surrealism of a psychological horror like Alan Wake to the technological futurism of Crysis. The transitions aren't always perfect, but the experience feels coherent once it's over: lots of different parts that mix together and form an enjoyable experience. Narratively what seems like a flaw from afar, but makes you smile up close, is the English dub which we believe was designed as deliberately exaggerated to reference the great action-adventures of the past. Both the director of operations and the traveling companions seem trapped in an 80s B-movie action. At the beginning it is slightly alienating but then it becomes a pleasant comic curtain between one level and another. With weapons drawn In Trepang2 the weapons are varied and customizable even if some are decidedly more powerful than others. Ammunition is also not very frequent, especially at the higher difficulty levels The arsenal available to Trepang2 players is sufficiently varied and customizable, albeit with some dead weights that we advise you to avoid. It starts with the inevitable pistol that already at the second level can mount a silencer and become the best friend of stealthy players. In fact, each weapon has two or three customization options available through accessories that can be installed at the workbenches scattered throughout the levels. To unlock an accessory you will have to go in search of some collectibles, which look like a military-style yellow case, which contains the viewfinder for the machine gun or the incendiary bullets for the shotgun. The classic assault rifle and the drum grenade launcher that you will conquer after defeating a boss could not be missing. Then there is a futuristic dart launcher that shoots three minisdelayed-explosion grenades and a hilarious minigun, also obtainable by defeating the juggernauts, the classic armored enemies who act as mini-bosses. The weapon to be carefully avoided is the DMR, the sniper rifle, because it is ineffective in 95% of battles that you will face in this game as they are held on medium and short distances. The weapon we always carried around was the shotgun which, in combination with the power that slows down time, can eliminate groups of four or five opponents in seconds. The abundance of ammunition depends on the difficulty level and the weapons wielded by the enemies you defeat. At the lower levels (including the normal one where we recommend you start) however, there are several ammo crates scattered throughout the game levels. Subject 106 also has two life bars, a blue one that indicates armor and is recharged by collecting plates dropped by enemies, and a green one that represents health and regenerates through medical kits. The last quarter of the latter regenerates automatically but with so little life a couple of bullets are enough to take you down. The final component of your arsenal are throwables which include grenades, flashbangs, tomahawks and firebombs. Grenades are very powerful and can take out even an armored enemy when well placed. The problem is that your opponents throw a lot of them and this will force you to always stay on the move because even on normal difficulty the explosion of a grenade at your feet will kill you in one fell swoop, even with maximum health and armor. Movement is key in Trepang2: you'll have to slide, grab enemies, slow down time and activate invisibility even in the middle of a firefight In the fight against enemy soldiers the symphony of Trepang2 takes shape and shows its full potential. The fights are always frenetic and you will often find yourself sliding, running, taking enemies hostage and throwing them against walls to eliminate them. The options are many and the volume of fire of the opponents is always high. The AI of the enemy units is well done and will be looking for you in all corners of the map: standing still is not an option. Invisibility isn't just for stealth either, you can use it in combat to appear behind an enemy, use it as a shield, and fill the remaining opponents with lead. It is even possible to hold two weapons akimbo to multiply their destructive potential but they cannot be fired independently, by pressing the trigger they both fire. This solution is great for damaging bosses that have very short windows in which you can hit them but it will use up your bullets very quickly. We particularly appreciated the final boss who, without spoilers, will force you to use all the elements of your arsenal to be able to defeat him.", "date": "2023-06-19", "grade": "7.5"}
