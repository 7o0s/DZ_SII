{"name": "Dropship: United Peace Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dropship-united-peace-force.html", "text": "In heaven and on earth It took two long years to complete the development of Dropship but finally we can evaluate if the promises made in the past have been kept. Studio Camden, certainly not among the most well-known development teams, has kept its work a secret for a long time, hiding from the general public the progress of a game that had certainly not impressed the press at its first appearance. In recent weeks, however, the expectation for Dropship has grown, thanks both to the increasingly convincing static images of the game distributed monthly and to the spectacular trailer that we recently offered you. Dropship is essentially a shooter and it was Jason Fitzgerald of Studio Camden who supported it a few days ago during an interview granted to our site: ~Dropship is a shooter and I don't think there are any doubts about this. Although you will be engaged in Air/Air combat, Air /Earth and Earth/Earth, the game is simply a shooter~. Nothing clearer. The protagonists of the game will be the United Planetary Forces, among whose ranks we will have the honor of being enrolled ourselves. Our task will be to defeat some terrorist organizations through missions that take place essentially over the skies of Libya, Colombia, Kazakhstan and China. To tell the truth we will not only have to pilot supersonic fighters and super-bombers but also drive land vehicles of all kinds: jeeps, tanks and various crawlers. What is a Dropship? After creating our pilot, the first step in our military career is to access the training phase that will allow us to become familiar with flying and non-flying vehicles and to practice team maneuvers. Once the training is completed, a beautiful Dropship will be waiting for us in the hangar, ready to take off for the first mission (of 5) set in the desolate Libyan lands. The Dropship is essentially a large aircraft with a futuristic design capable of carrying vehicles inside it but also of facing attacks and in particular bombing actions. This is the first of a long series of war vehicles that we will have to control during the game. It should be noted that each aircraft is able to land and take off vertically, a bit like what happens nowadays with the most modern Harriers. During the missions, a little of everything could happen to us and for this we must prepare ourselves for any eventuality. Most of the time we will be called to patrol a certain airspace and to free it from the intrusion of enemy fighters. Other times it will happen instead of escorting cargo planes or protecting troops on the ground. But the inconveniences are always possible and so to avoid being captured by the enemies due to the failure of our Dropship, we will be forced to leave the rear hatch of the big plane and flee on board a crawler or a jeep, protecting our retreat with a poor machine gun. This is just one of the possible situations that can occur and the strength of the game lies in the variety of each action. However, this does not mean that Dropship proves to be damned funny most of the time, especially in the flight phases, which are really well done and particularly adrenaline-pumping. Target locked Whiz between the peaks of snow-covered mountains, hide between the mighty walls of a canyon, dive towards a target, chase an enemy aircraft at the crazy speed of 2000 km/h, lock on to the target and eliminate it with a lethal air missile. air... all of this will be possible for all of you thanks also to the undoubted qualities of a control system that is truly up to its task. By simultaneously pressing the L1 and R1 keys it is possible to take off vertically and reach an altitude at which to release the power of the Dropship reactors which we will be able to control thanks to the X key. With the L2 and R2 keys, pressed once again simultaneously, we are instead able to lower our altitude until we land vertically on almost any surface. With the Square key we can instead decrease our cruising speed and activate the air brakes that allow us to stop in a short space. The left analog stick is instead entrusted with the non-secondary task of controlling the direction of the aircraft both vertically and horizontally. The right lever instead allows you to rotate the camera and activate a very powerful zoom, very useful if you want to hit targets at a distance. With the triangle and circle keys we can instead fire the machine guns and launch different types of selective missiles respectivelybilitable with the R1 key. Each key works perfectly within the control system and this, in addition to facilitating our task, makes the execution of each single evolution pleasant and natural. Unfortunately Dropship is not without its flaws, the first of which is to be attributed to its excessive difficulty which will turn into real frustration during some missions. Repeating some long missions several times may in the long run tire the less determined to complete the game. Nice to hear... Graphically, Dropship combines good things with other decidedly subdued ones. The robustness of the graphics engine is absolutely flawless thanks to the 60 frames per second that are constantly moved on the screen. The models of the vehicles and buildings on the ground, and the effects are also convincing although much more splendor has been seen on PS2. The negative notes come partly from the absence of anti-aliasing, but above all from scenarios that could not have been more sparse. The elements on the ground can be counted on the fingertips and if we add to this that the textures used are rather confused and poorly defined, the feeling of visual dissatisfaction is made even stronger. As for the sound, the speech is fortunately different. Dropship may not be pretty to look at but it sure is nice to hear. The music is always suitable for the situation, while the sound effects are top notch for PS2 titles. The Italian dubbing of the dialogues should also be considered good, which for once will not make us regret the original language versions. Waiting for Ace Combat 4... We are facing one of the first surprises of 2002. Dropship is undoubtedly a good game that could have been even better if greater care had been taken in the technical implementation and in the calibration of the level of difficulty. The possibility of being able to pilot powerful warplanes and to control numerous land vehicles will probably make happy those who wish to live a complete war experience. The purchase of the game is recommended for almost all PS2 owners, provided they have a healthy dose of patience. However, it should not be forgotten that in just over two weeks the Pal version of Ace Combat 4 will also arrive in stores, a title with which Dropship seems to have more than one link. The long-awaited Namco air combat game promises to have an edge over this Dropship but I am convinced that fans of the genre will not miss both games in question. Pros: Fun and varied Effective control system Completely in Italian 60 fps constant 50/60 Hz option Cons: Scarce scenarios A bit difficult Terrorists again! Year 2002. The war on terrorism is now raging in every corner of the planet. The attacks by the allied forces have unfortunately not been able to dissolve the Al-Qaida regime which, subtly, seems to be reorganizing itself outside Afghanistan. The nightmare that began that morning of 11 September is not over yet and unfortunately it is not yet possible to predict when the world crisis situation will be considered over. Almost in the wake of the tragic events that we all know, here comes a game on PlayStation 2 that seems intent on making us experience first-hand the events that until now we have been able to observe with anguish through television screens. From Studio Camden comes Dropship, a new ground and air combat game produced by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and dedicated to the fight against the scourge of the 21st century, terrorism. The year is 2050 and the planet is once again threatened by fearsome terrorist organizations determined to spread their own law of death and destruction. However, thanks also to our fundamental contribution, the army of the FPU (United Planetary Forces) seems to be able to erase these enemies of humanity from history forever.", "date": "2002-01-16", "grade": null}
