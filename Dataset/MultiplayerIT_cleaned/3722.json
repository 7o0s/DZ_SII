{"name": "Rush Rally 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rush-rally-3-recensione.html", "text": "In a jagged sector like the mobile one, the Rush Rally series can now be considered a sort of guarantee. After an interesting debut chapter - a tribute to a great classic of the past such as World Rally - and a very solid sequel that is noticeably closer to modern automotive products, the British developer Stephen Brown has once again appeared on the App Store and Google Play with the latest version of his popular racing game. Rush Rally 3 tries to build on the good choices made in the past and aims to further expand the offer with some tasty news. The title has been available for download since March 29 and is offered on iOS and Android at a price of 4.99 euros. So let's find out if this third incarnation of the series has actually managed to hit the mark. Racing excellence in the mobile sector Rush Rally 3 continues in the footsteps of the previous episode by offering players a realistic approach and a solid driving model, capable of adapting properly to the needs of the touch control system. However, there is no shortage of alternatives, since from the settings menu it is possible to choose between three types of configuration. We have the standard one, which plans to use the virtual accelerator, brake and handbrake lever indicators on the right side of the screen, while on the left side we find the arrows to press to impart direction. Alternatively, as was the case in the past, you can rely on the accelerometer of your device. The third option instead involves replacing the arrow keys with the virtual reproduction of a steering wheel, but of the three hypotheses it is certainly the least preferable. In our opinion, the most intuitive solution remains the first, but it must be said that the game leaves a certain freedom to customize the feedback thanks to the command mapping function: by accessing a special menu it is possible to move the position of the various indicators on the base at will of your own needs. None of these solutions excite you because ultimately you are incurable traditionalists? Don't worry, through the practical bluetooth connection Rush Rally 3 allows you to connect a real pad to your smartphone or tablet. Moreover, even on this front, you have access to a rich range of settings that are useful for improving the responsiveness of the external control system. The game offers a fleet of 15 cars that are progressively unlocked by collecting credits. The in-game currency is obtained simply by driving, but by taking home the medals you access valuable bonuses that are very useful for expanding your garage more quickly. The accumulated money is used to purchase new cars but also to customize or upgrade your vehicle with various aesthetic or mechanical interventions. In the first case you can apply sponsor stickers, choose the color of the car or the style of the alloy wheels, while in the second case the modifications range from changing tires to the engine, passing through other items such as handling, the transmission system , the frame and the suspension. The circuits available are once again 72, characterized by a good variety and different configurations depending on the selected discipline. There are also variables such as the alternation between day and night time and mixed surfaces including asphalt, gravel, dirt and snow. The approach on the track also varies according to the shot selected, which now also includes the perspective positioned directly inside the passenger compartment. However, what makes Rally Rush 3 a complete product is above all the variety of modes that have been made available to the public. Alongside the quick game, the Lap of Fire and the pleasant Rally Cross mode that puts us in competition with five other opponents controlled by artificial intelligence, the Skill Games section has been introduced. In this case you are tested with a total of 18 challenges of increasing difficulty. The assignments are quite varied, providing for example to make your way on a busy road, avoid areas where works are in progress, ring doors and collect NOS canisters to increase your speed, but also dodge missiles or recover coins in the manner of a phantom moustachioed plumber whose name escapes us now. Alternatively there is still the Career mode, where starting from the Junior Rally championship you have to work your way up in the Amateur and Semi-Pro competitions to become the world champion of the Rush Rally Championship. The events are distributed on a small globe where the desired destination is indicatedbetween multiple locations scattered around the globe, while the scores of the general classification can be consulted on the left of the screen. That's not all though, because if necessary Rush Rally 3 also plans to participate in pleasant multiplayer challenges both via the internet and locally, albeit exclusively in Rally Cross mode. The only flaw is the presence of a matchmaking that is not particularly responsive, but during the sessions we have not encountered any particular performance problems. Nonetheless, the game can be enjoyed safely even when you are offline and does not include advertisements or optional in-app purchases that could in any way annoy its use. Finally, it is worth noting that, unlike Rush Rally 2, this time there was no compatibility with AndroidTV.", "date": "2019-04-13", "grade": "9.0"}
