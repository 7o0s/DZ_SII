{"name": "Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-pc.html", "text": "Knowing Tom Clancy Tom Clancy has been a known name in the industry for years, but not everyone is aware of the difference between this prolific author and other video game celebrities such as Sid Meyer, Peter Molineaux or Geoff Crammond. Thomas L. Clancy Jr., born in 1947, is in fact neither a programmer nor a game designer, but was born as a writer and achieved immediate success with his first novel, The Great Escape of Red October, then brought to the big screen by Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin (the first Jack Ryan, who later passed the baton to Harrison Ford and - more recently - to Ben Affleck). Since the 80s his immense literary production has been an inexhaustible source of content on which to build video games (Red Storm Rising and Harpoon tell you anything?) but among the most recent productions born from his pen and then transformed into successful video games, how not to mention Rainbow Six, progenitor of a franchise that is still enjoying success with audiences and critics. Among all his literary and cinematographic characters, the one perhaps closest to Sam Fisher is the protagonist of the novel Rainbow Six, John Clark, ex Navy Seal, ex CIA agent, grizzled veteran who is approaching forty, methodical and silent individual, with the same caustic, dark sense of humor that Fisher sometimes displays in his dialogues with Irvin Lambert. Sam Fisher is back. The first Splinter Cell was an experience as intense and demanding as it was brief for the appetites of those who let themselves be captivated by the highly successful cocktail of action and secrecy that bore the prestigious signature of Tom Clancy. In a vintage that promises to be greedy for fans of the genre (Metal Gear Solid 3 and Hitman: Contracts are on their way), Pandora Tomorrow is the first in the starting blocks, thanks to the unanimous approval of the public and critics earned by its predecessor . After having dedicated a substantial special to the gameplay offered by the new multiplayer mode, the time has come to deal with the new single-player campaign as well, in order to paint a complete picture of this new - and extremely complex - Ubisoft production. For those who have tuned in just now, the protagonist of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow responds to the name of Sam Fisher, an operative agent in the secret government agency Third Echelon, a sort of occult detachment of the CIA that deals with holding one's nose and to get him into the dirtiest business involving national security. Sam Fisher is back. Starting from a simple investigation on the site of an attack, our hero finds himself once again in the middle of an international conspiracy led by the terrorist and guerrilla Suhadi Sadono, who intends to hold the whole world hostage with a bacteriological threat of terrifying. Such a situation certainly cannot be ignored and this will force him to travel far and wide across the two hemispheres, trying to straighten the situation with targeted and lightning-fast actions as only a ghost warrior like him can do. Although there are only eight missions, they are almost always extensive levels, full of details and intriguing despite their iron linearity. Some locations closely resemble the indoor settings characteristic of the first Splinter Cell, but for at least a good half of the game we will find ourselves in open-air areas, a clear change in level design compared to the past. Not only stealthy advances immersed in the dark, therefore, but also infiltrations behind enemy lines in full daylight, immersed in the water of tropical rivers or protected by tall grass in which we crawl like predators. The objectives of the missions - however varied - still remain limited to the classic range of interrogations, information searches, sabotages and so on, even if a correct cocktail of the same, together with some original game design inventions, have led to the creation of playability pearls such as the level set in a moving train, almost a videogame transposition of the film ~Trap in the Rocky Mountains~. What an interface you make for me! In fact, the interface, the control system and the gameplay as a whole have remained the same in this sequel, but some small tricks have improved its functionality. For example, by concealing a corpse it is possible to have confirmation of the successful completion of the operation by means of a brief flashing of our luminosity detector. This indicates that the body of our unfortunate friend is in a truly dark area, not only apparently dark due to some strange trick of the lighting system, such as spesknow happened in the first episode, causing the alarms to sound and the mission to end. Speaking of alarms: in most of the levels, should it happen to be identified, the general alarm will not immediately go off, but there will be a more manageable escalation of alert levels ranging from zero to three. With each increase, the enemy guards will equip themselves with new equipment as a precaution (bulletproof vest, helmet, etc.) thus making life more difficult for us. From a certain point of view this is an excellent idea, which reduces difficulties and consequent frustration, but it is at least debatable - and certainly unlikely - that it is sufficient not to be seen for a few minutes for the alert level to return to the standard level as if nothing had happened, even in the case of firefights with lots of corpses on the ground. In fact, artificial intelligence is perhaps the sector that would have most needed some correction, having never shone for creativity. Although our Sam boasts some new arrows to his bow, such as the possibility of attracting the attention of enemies by whistling, that of shooting upside down from a tube or the use of the telescopic sight, we are rarely forced to resort to more elaborate tactics than the classic sneak attack from behind. In fact, the NPCs limit themselves to carrying out their pre-established patrols, faithfully following the pattern of consequential actions assigned to them: identification of the intruder, approaching, calling for reinforcements and opening fire. The value of the game is to overcome this problem by managing to avoid the feeling of having to deal with a mass of brainless robots, but conversely giving the impression of being a thousand times smarter than them, true tactical geniuses capable to exterminate an entire mercenary base without ever being seen. In fact, cultivating the player's ego is a great strategy! My eyes (and ears)! From a technical point of view we have few words to spend. Despite the age of the graphics engine, the game is graphically satisfying and it seems that all those small graphic flaws that afflicted the PC version of the original title have been resolved, which this time outclasses even the Xbox one for depth of contrast and quality of the colors, even if for the obvious difference in resolution. Of course, the game physics management engine shows the weight of the years, especially if compared with the applications of Havok in all the latest major action games (such as Max Payne 2), but in other aspects, such as the enlightenment, Pandora Tomorrow doesn't take lessons from anyone yet. On the sound front, beyond the effects (identical to the previous version), many of the music and new arrangements of the main theme are worthy of note, rhythms full of tension that blend well with the different contexts. In fact, activation is once again dynamic, but it is sad to note how some activation triggers are approximate, with some dissonances caused by the failed (or delayed) start of the track dedicated to a particular location, which tends to cause bizarre juxtapositions. The dubbing, devoid of the slight asynchrony of the predecessor, is perfect, even surpassing the original one, afflicted by a significant difference in quality between the voice of the protagonist (the great Michael Ironside) and those of the supporting actors. On the contrary, not only the Italian voices of Sam Fisher (Luca Ward) and Suhadi Sadono (Morgan, former member of Bluvertigo) make a fine show of themselves, but also the surrounding ones all maintain an excellent profile. Final comment There is little to say: Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow deserves the purchase only for the almost flawless singleplayer experience that it is able to put on the plate, which we recommend to anyone who has not tried the original Splinter Cell, like many of the quests 'last failed to satiate. For everyone else there is still the fun and surprisingly innovative multiplayer mode, which has clearly and roundly demonstrated that there is still ample room for innovation in the field of tactical team games. Pros: Unbeatable and unmistakable gameplay Engaging and well-written storyline Sam Fisher has charisma to spare Voice acting like you can't see enough Cons: The AI deserved a little more attention A few too many bugs", "date": "2004-03-30", "grade": null}
