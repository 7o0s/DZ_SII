In the case of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, we are at the umpteenth attempt at transposition, such is the popularity of this game. The rules are simple: the circle of selected contestants must first participate in the ~fastest finger~ game by placing a series of elements in the right order. Whoever succeeds first has the right to participate in the real quiz, sits in front of the presenter and can already read the first question... Each question corresponds to a sum of money, which gradually increases up to one million euros. Sometimes making a mistake is equivalent to going home with nothing, but there are figures which, once reached, guarantee us a certain amount. We will have four possible answers from which to select the one we believe is correct, and the possibility of using three different aids: 50:50, which eliminates half of the wrong answers; the public, which can express itself on the question and provide a percentage response; the phone call home, in which we can speak to a designated acquaintance and ask him to find the answer for us. In the TV quiz there are no time limits to answer, so the contestants can go on for several minutes with their reasoning to find the right answer. On mobile, of course, things can't be that simple and we'll have to respect a limit of a few seconds to answer each question. When we resort to the ~phone call home~, we will be able to select one of the characters available to help us, each characterized by certain abilities and some defects (perhaps there is the guy who is very sure of himself, even when he makes a mistake, or the girl who doesn't she is very knowledgeable in general culture, etc.). The technical realization of the game is discreet and functional: the television studio is reproduced in a rather faithful way using polygonal graphics, but these are only short sequences. For the rest, the questions are always legible and that's what matters most. Loads between one screen and another are immediate, so we won't have to wait for anything and the experience turns out to be ~agile~, also suitable for impromptu use. The sound sector consists of music and effects that refer to the transmission in a faithful way, just a pity that it does not have an independent volume adjustment. The control system is based on the joystick and the 5 key, it is very simple and responds promptly to inputs. It is possible to use different save slots for as many profiles, in case some friends want to try their hand at the game... PRO The game is always that Technically well done Simple and addictive AGAINST The game is always that There are very fierce competitors No innovative element introduced", "date": "2008-04-01", "grade": "S.V."}
