{"name": "Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-heroes-2-recensione_a.html", "text": "First in line In the role of a soldier belonging to a special unit, we will once again find ourselves fighting Nazi soldiers in a series of missions of increasing difficulty. After finishing the briefing, we will be catapulted into the real action, and we will finally be able to get familiar with the much talked about game control system. Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 uses the Nunchuck for character movement, while the Wii-mote pointing at the screen determines the aim. It is possible to carry two weapons with you at the same time, in addition to grenades, and inside the locations you can collect ammunition but also steal the weapons from defeated enemies (advisable practice to immediately replace the service pistol with something more effective) . You shoot by pressing the B trigger, while the A button is responsible for jumping and the tiny d-pad (a bit awkward to reach, unless you have big hands) is used to change weapons, reload and crouch. These basic actions are joined by the same number for particular weapons: grenades are literally thrown, holding down the B button to determine their direction and then shaking the Wii-mote; to use the rocket launcher you have to put the controller ~over your shoulder~ and adjust the aim with the Nunchuck's analog stick; to use the scope of sniper rifles, you have to slowly turn the Wii-mote clockwise... and these are just some of the things we can do. Artificial deficiency? If MOHH2 can count on a precise, engaging and original control system, it is also true that the enemies we will face will not be the portrait of lucidity. Quite good at moving from one post to another, they won't notice our approach even if we crouch next to them, strafing them mercilessly. Probably the presence of numerous reinforcements determined a ~group~ modus operandi, with little attention to the behavior of the single enemy. Game structure Probably the new EA title is the one that uses the Wii controls in the most imaginative way in a context that is still dramatic, and there will be situations in which we will be called to perform particular movements with the Wii-mote. At one point, for example, we will find ourselves in front of a radio that we will have to adjust to receive instructions from the command, very slowly rotating the controller to lock the frequency. As far as the more ~eventful~ situations are concerned, we will have to deal with the usual fixed machine guns but also with very complicated ~rotating~ mortars, which we will have to move by turning a ~virtual~ knob until we have the target in sight. Or we will have to adjust the timer of bombs designed to destroy key objectives during a mission. They are all gimmicks that make the action quite varied and very entertaining, and that contribute to creating the ~finish~ structure that characterizes the game. The stages are far from huge, in fact, and can be explored in their entirety in minutes. But at regular intervals we will find ourselves facing enemy positions in which the soldiers die and are immediately replaced, with a fortunately limited ~respawn~ effect. Let's also say that the spirit of MOH: Heroes 2 is precisely this, that is to present us with a series of challenges that must be analyzed tactically in order to be overcome in the best possible way, identifying how many and which enemy soldiers will appear and from which side of the scenario, then following the tactical behavior that we deem more appropriate. Zapper yes, Zapper no... Like all new first person shooters for Wii, Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 natively supports the Zapper peripheral and gives us the possibility to access a set of commands designed specifically for that type of configuration. In any case, playing without this curious accessory soon turns out to be more fun (as you can freely perform all the ~alternative~ actions with the Wii-mote and Nunchuck), also thanks to the great precision of the controls, which can be further improved by a number of advanced settings. Game mode In addition to the classic Campaign, we will be able to access a nice Arcade mode (in which to replay the missions already completed, following a simplified structure) and the highly anticipated online multiplayer. The latter works through the EA Nation service, so we will have to create a profile using the Wii's internet access directly and then we will be able to participate in the games. The registration operations are surprisingly fast, it will only take a few seconds to go from entering the e-mail address to action, where we will be surprised by the large amount of connected players. The modes available are the deathmatch clasphysical, team and ~capture the flag~, for up to thirty-two participants at the same time. Playing online with MOH: Heroes 2 is a bit traumatic at the beginning: accustomed to not very intelligent opponents, we will have to deal with people who are already quite expert, able to eliminate us several times by hitting us from a great distance (the usual, nice snipers ) or particularly accustomed to close-quarters firefights. Without the due apprenticeship, online becomes quite fun and turns out to be quite organized. It is not possible to dialogue with your teammates and you have to use pre-packaged commands, so the strategy suffers quite a bit, but the maps are large and varied enough to make everything engaging. A very positive note is represented by the general lack of lag, which allows the playing of always balanced games. Technical realization With only the PSP version acting as a 'counterpart', it's clear that, on a technical level, much was expected of Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 for Wii. Unfortunately, the final result is not completely positive, but hides more than one shortcoming: it is true that the game runs at a good sixty frames per second, with few uncertainties, but at what price? The polygonal models are simple, not very detailed, with a quality and quantity of animations equal to the minimum wage. The corpses of eliminated opponents do not remain on the ground, but disappear immediately. The stages boast some better textures than those seen in the PSP version, but the amount of moved polygons is very similar, with the buildings characterized by very simple structures. Fluidity aside, therefore, there is not much to be happy about. And in the online game mode, unfortunately, things get exponentially worse: the frame rate remains high, but there are some polygon rendering problems and, above all, the soldiers are unwatchable: hunched over their machine guns as if they were hunchbacked, with the legs moving in such a way as to appear independent of the body. Fortunately, the sound sector does not suffer from any drawbacks: the effects are really convincing, the speech is excellent and the music, as usual, has a great atmosphere. Comment Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 is an atypical first-person shooter in structure, with missions divided into phases to be completed and very little intelligent enemies, who move with the logic of the group and must be faced accordingly. Its strengths are primarily in the control system, among the best seen on Wii, equipped with advanced adjustments that can really ~sew the game on you~. The aiming is quite precise and the large number of ~alternative~ actions make some stages really exciting. It pays dearly for the excellent frame rate, preferring fluidity to detail and animations, but has a multiplayer mode that finally allows Wii owners to challenge each other online through deathmatches and so on. In conclusion, on a technical level it was reasonable to expect something more, but it is clear that the developers have made an effort to make MOH: Heroes 2 more playable and fun than beautiful to look at, thus insisting on fluidity and packaging a product that occupies a prominent in the panorama of FPS for Wii. Pros: Outstanding control system Great sound quality Online multiplayer up to 32 players Cons: Very smooth graphics, but at the expense of the rest Mediocre enemy AI Campaign mode a bit short", "date": "2008-02-01", "grade": null}
