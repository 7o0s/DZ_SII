It's curious because the game control system takes up the one that could be found in some cabinets in the late 80s. The principle was that of the mouse, but reversed, it's called Track Ball, and maybe you've seen it in some PC peripheral. Half of a sphere protruded from the cabinet and moving it with the hands (usually by rotating it quickly) gave commands to the video game. Imagine that this sphere is drawn on the touch screen and that you have to move it with the stylus (with the dragging technique) to orientate the direction of Taz, and you will have the Galactic Taz Ball in mind. It's a curious idea because the new generations have never seen such a control system and the older generations are absolutely not the target of this game, so it is not clear why this choice was made. If it's a tribute, it's a tribute that no one will notice. In any case, it is by rubbing the stylus on the sphere that the protagonist will move around the three-dimensional levels. With a few small pushes it will move slowly, with more decisive and continuous pushes it will begin to whirl with the double function of going faster and escaping the dangers scattered throughout the levels. Any key is used to make Taz carry out an attack that can stun some enemies but which we found to be of dubious value. Overworld and Underworld In Galactic Taz Ball levels are divided into two types. The outdoor ones are in 3d and offer platforms on which to demonstrate your acrobatic skills trying to move Taz without falling down. In more advanced levels the design even becomes interesting with moving platforms in which to use some caution. Every so often in the level there will be some holes that will take Taz to the dungeons. In these levels the game becomes side scrolling (like New Super Mario) and they offer some new ideas compared to 3d worlds. In the first schemes there will be treadmills that will make our little devil move forward and backward. By touching them we will alternate the direction of the carpets in order to bring Taz to the end. In others, however, by tapping on the screen we will make the protagonist move and when he arrives on a spring, again with the stylus we will have to lower it to blow up ours. Generally in these levels the puzzle part takes over the action part, but you will never have to play Tetris. The adventure always develops in this alternation, where there is little else to do other than just keep going. There are some collectibles, there are some mini-bosses, but the most is given by the level design of the upper world, which also sports a graphics engine that is certainly not refined but which does its duty. For the rest everything is very simple, too simple, suitable only for a very young and novice target. Everyone else pretends it doesn't exist.", "date": "2010-07-19", "grade": null}
