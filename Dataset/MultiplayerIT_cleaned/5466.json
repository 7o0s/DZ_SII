Concepts of which she continues to reveal herself as the absolute master, knowing how to control and shape them at will, to the point of promptly elevating them beyond the limits that were thought to be insurmountable. After Sky Fortress, we have a further demonstration with Mech Land Assault, the second leg of that expansion program that corresponds to the name of Air, Land & Sea, a tour around the sky, land and sea which aims to broaden the boundaries of the basic game, towards new outlets. And once again the Swedish team has hit the mark, pushing the impulses it has always been the standard bearer of towards a new, electrifying dimension, albeit with some more or less serious underlying problems. Did you think you had put Medici on fire? You should find out what you can do in Mech Land Assault! Gordon Automatron Mech Land Assault continues the small narrative arc inaugurated by the previous paid content, again pitting Rico against the evil duo eDEN Corporation-Black Hand, only that the roles are reversed, with the second taking on a more prominent and active position. As the protagonist has made us sardonically understand more than once over the years, in these parts the story is nothing more than a pretext to blow everything up. What gets noticed, rather, is the new playground available, Isola Lacrima, a region created from scratch, embellished, however, by some derivations that recall the poetics of ~nature regaining the upper hand over civilization~ already appreciated in titles The Last of Us and Crysis 3. The real protagonist, however, is another, or rather the mech that qualifies the name of the expansion. In addition to plowing any type of terrain, jumping, shooting (with an automatic cannon or a Spaccabavarium) and having an energy impulse with which to get the better of certain protections, through the GRIP the robotic vehicle controllable by Rico is happy to open the doors again, apt variation with which physics is manipulated in Just Cause. This time we are around Half-Life 2, an ideology towards which Rodriguez had previously already shown attraction but which he now makes fully his own, to the end. Unlike what the intellectual Gordon Freeman does with his Gravity Gun, Rico doesn't just grab one object at a time, and mostly small ones, but lifts soldiers, animals, drones, motorcycles, cars, helicopters, containers and so on and so forth, perhaps by handfuls, throwing them with force, giving free rein to a vocation for chaos to be discovered. If you want, you can also hold a vehicle ~hostage~ and shoot enemies, while using it as a shield, or rage on him to ~soften~ him, causing him to catch fire and then throw him like a bomb. Not to mention that until an object is destroyed (or, in the case of a non-player character, dies) it can be attracted again, even instantly, perhaps together with other ~stunned~ in the meantime, allowing you to improvise a ~yo-yo effect ~ which can take the form of devastating cluster bombs. The implications of the game and the opportunities to extend the already large repertoire of slapstick comedy situations that traditionally accompany them are easily imaginable. Aware of such potential, the developers have also appropriately revised the Challenges accordingly, through which to unlock the Mods dedicated to the Mech: these are real arenas, with several waves, with the score that rewards combos and style in an articulated way, like in a Devil May Cry or a Bulletstorm. There are only two, but if you are particularly fond of the gameplay they offer playable material for an above-average amount of time. Mediterranean monotony Sadly, it's not all fireworks and merriment. In addition to a swaggering broadside of fun, Mech Land Assault also invests with a certain amount of tedium. It's what you feel the moment you realize that you're basically always doing the same thing. The only two ~real~ missions are the opening and closing ones, which are not even particularly successful in terms of construction, rhythm and difficulty balancing. All there is to do in between is liberate outpost after outpost. It should be acknowledged that Avalanche has tried at least to make the island-prison theme a playful virtue, providing in each of the four provinces of Lacrima a special field in which, in addition to sweeping enemy installationsit is necessary to free the prisoners and their leader, give them access to weapons and above all fight to defend it from the attempts of the Black Hand to regain control of it. Undoubtedly a pleasant hint of inventiveness for a mission design once again obsessively devoted to a modular reiteration that almost leads to ~grinding~. Nonetheless, we would like to recommend Mech Land Assault, unlike what was done with Sky Fortress at the time. In addition to lasting a couple of hours longer, we have to consider the overall picture that helps to outline, right now: the Mech in tandem with the Wingsuit at the Bavarium offers a large and tangible added value, allowing enjoy the pure gameplay of Just Cause 3 in new, exciting ways. If you find yourself here, today, wanting more, after having overcome the repetitiveness of the base game, its artificial intelligence capable of touching dysfunctional abysses bordering on the comical and its other general refinement deficits, in all likelihood it means that you are madly addictive with its crackling sandbox gameplay. And the Air, Land & Sea project, as it is taking shape after two outings, is able to really make it shine, indeed make it explode, with bangs that until yesterday we didn't think possible. If, on the other hand, you are looking for something more, you can easily go further, with complete serenity.", "date": "2016-06-07", "grade": null}
