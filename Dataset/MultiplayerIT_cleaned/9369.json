After making a stop on both PC and Mac, the game by the Danish team Press Play has now also arrived on the App Store under the banner of EA Mobile, finally allowing you to interact through a tactile interface and satisfying those who felt uncomfortable in the waving a remote in the air or drawing with an awkward mouse. A creative platformer Levels to complete, enemies to defeat and obstacles to avoid by bouncing from platform to platform. What apparently may seem like a decidedly classic platformer already opens with an atypical premise: an orange-haired boy comes into possession of a strange felt-tip pen capable of literally giving life to his drawings, but all his colorful worlds have been invaded from hordes of monsters and his goal is now to drive them away, helped by the magical tool and a pinch of imagination. By playing Max & The Magic Marker, the screen of your iPhone is thus transformed into a sheet on which to scribble with a finger: whether you draw a line, a curve, a circle or a square, everything becomes subject to the physical laws of the game. In this way it is possible to create a boulder to drop on the head of an enemy, draw a bridge to overcome an otherwise impassable ravine, or even create a ladder on which to climb to reach high places. It is a very original idea and which, at least potentially, could materialize in particularly amusing game situations. Unfortunately, however, two major problems arise, the first of which is linked to the iPhone's far too small screen: precisely because it is difficult to be able to create precise drawings in such a small space, most of the time we end up scribbling spirals or sketching crooked bleachers on which , hopefully, we can climb it. With a little inventiveness, in Crayon Physics it was possible to create complex catapults, wheelbarrows, tows and many other contraptions with the few tools at one's disposal, but in Max & The Magic Marker one finds oneself drawing the same trivial things from the start to finish. None of the proposed puzzles represents a real challenge, and indeed there is not even one able to shine for ingenuity and originality. The need to collect some ink balls and refill the marker before each use ensures that the player does not cheat or simplify his life too much, but this is not what makes the game difficult: the other serious flaw of the in fact, the title concerns the uncomfortable and imprecise on-screen controls, whose imperfections are felt above all in jumps and climbs. That's no small feat, considering many puzzles are meant to be solved by drawing small platforms suspended in the air and jumping on them for an instant. The end result is certainly not disastrous, mind you, but it gives the clear impression that the iPhone is not the most suitable platform for Max's adventures. In addition to the problems strictly related to the screen size and the new touchscreen interface, the Press Play game it drags along the same boring and repetitive levels of the Wii and PC versions, unable to give any surprises or, at least, some small variations that keep the interest high. Aesthetically, however, the title presents itself very well, with catchy tunes and colorful cartoon graphics enhanced by the support for the Retina Display, where the stylistic effect obtained by pausing the adventure is very pleasant: the level transforms into a sketchy drawing made by a child with his markers, while the player can draw without any hurry objects and shapes to use in the game.
