Our adventure at the Tensei Academy has ended and it's time to sum up this captivating JRPG, which far from being the usual clone willing to chase the glory of Yu-Gi-Oh! it has conquered its space over time. Originally, Shadowverse was (and still is) a card game for PC without any anime or childish connotation in general: more oriented towards Magic: The Gathering-like atmospheres, it had growing success, to the point that it was decided to expand its universe and create an animated series to make it more attractive to the very young. From here we moved on to the development of Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, an anime tie-in that incorporates the main characters to give life to a spin-off where the players, as students who have just transferred to the Tensei Academy, immediately find themselves involved in the exciting battles of the Shadowverse that go crazy among everyone - boys and adults. For all fans of card games and their complexity, but also for those looking for light stories as a side dish, this is the perfect title to immerse yourself in, also thanks to the portability of Nintendo Switch. So let's find out Shadowverse: Champion's Battle in our review. A world to explore Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, the protagonist along with other characters We have partially summarized the story above. Shadowverse: Champion's Battle puts us in the shoes of the classic student who has just moved to the Tensei Academy, a school where, among the many activities, the card game Shadowverse is also very popular. For a series of coincidences, the (or) protagonist will find himself involved in safeguarding the school club dedicated to Shadowverse, which is in bad waters, to the point of having to compete in the national championships. After quickly creating our character, we are ready to begin our adventure, card after card, challenge after challenge, deck after deck. The story of Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is told through a series of cutscenes and in-game conversations along the lines of the visual novels, all entirely dubbed in English (but not localized in Italian). There is much more dialogue than one might think, for a game starring middle school kids, but it must be admitted that the scenes are not intrusive and, in any case, if we are not interested in following them we can skip them altogether. Nonetheless, some side quests and character interactions are enjoyable and well worth the little time they require. Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, the student council president is the first hurdle to overcome Speaking of side missions, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle gives us a whole world to explore when we're not busy battling with cards. Between one story event and another, we are free to wander through multiple settings, inside and outside the school, to collect money or cards, challenge people who are not students but above all accept different assignments to obtain as many rewards. In addition, the game offers a series of missions along the lines of Persona 4's Social Link mechanics to deepen the relationship with our companions: the yield is excellent, considering the original material, and manages to diversify well based on the personality of the character in question. Precisely because of its anime tie-in nature, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is not the classic mechanical experience in which we grind deck after deck with the sole aim of becoming stronger. The world-building effort is commendable, and from the point of view of the main campaign, it really is like enjoying a long episode of the animated series. Challenge to the last card Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, playing cards is serious business When it comes to taking the field and showing off our skills as players, this is where Shadowverse: Champion's Battle shines the brightest. If you've already tried the PC original, then you won't find anything new to surprise you: the games are played in exactly the same way. For anyone unfamiliar with the Shadowverse universe, it could be described as a cross between Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering with enough uniqueness to copy neither. Above all, like any card game, it is wrong to underestimate it, believing it to be for children only because it is closely linked to the anime. It takes strategy and planning from the start, or you don't want to be burned to the ground before you even figure out how it happened. Especially since the Shadowverse differs in the absence of theblock: Creatures, here called Followers, can freely attack the opposing player regardless of any enemies on the field. The only way to prevent this is to play so-called Wards, creatures that attract attacks to them and become the only target until they are destroyed. The heart of the experience, therefore, is to create the right balance between offense and defense, absolutely avoiding neglecting the fact that you can always be vulnerable to enemy attacks. Another fundamental mechanic is Evolution, which is unlocked after a certain number of rounds and allows, in fact, to evolve their creatures by making them get more attack, defense and even special effects if the card allows it. From the moment they are activated, evolution points can be used at any time, even keeping them until the final stages of the duel: it depends on us, on our strategy, and we assure you that they can really make the difference between victory and defeat. Evolving a newly played creature allows you to attack with it in the same turn (which is otherwise impossible) but, to avoid excessive imbalance, you can only target the opposing creatures and not the player. However, this allows you to restore balance, or even take an advantage, with respect to a given situation. Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, Evolution is another fundamental mechanic of the game Of all the mechanics, evolution is the one we like most in Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, especially since it also takes into account the order of play: the player who goes first will have fewer evolution points, while the second player will have more more - and will even be able to draw an extra card during the first turn. This does not mean that starting last is always an advantage, after all we are playing cards and a lot of it is entrusted to luck when fishing. Not to mention that the action points, needed to play any card, grow by one unit per turn, provided you don't use cards that speed up the process: in this sense, being second puts us at a potential disadvantage. Precisely because of the variability of the clashes there are different types of decks, each with its own characteristics, on which to base our entire style. Apart from the neutral cards, no other cards can be assigned to a different type than the one they belong to, which makes it easier to manage the decks without getting lost in infinite combinations. To help us, moreover, there are the Deck Codes: by defeating a player , we can obtain the code of your deck, store it in the device and possibly recreate it if we have the necessary cards. The variety of Deck Codes is more than enough to meet everyone's tastes, or at least to give excellent foundations on which to then make small changes. Obviously, the higher the level of the defeated player (up to Grandmaster) and the better his deck will be, just as it will be more complex to create it. The necessary cards are obtained both by defeating the opponents, and it is always advisable to aim for those similar to our type, and by buying them at the terminals or by trying your luck with the packets. A combination of all three helps speed up the process but, especially when discarding packages, it's all a matter of luck. It may take a moment or a few hours to put together the necessary. Overall, while not offering who knows what innovation, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle makes its card game an engaging and challenging experience enough to keep us glued to the end of the story and beyond. Shadowverse: Champion's Battle, occasionally a trip outside the school is good to find new items and challengers To the approximately thirty hours necessary to complete the main plot, those expenses for the secondary missions and, if we are completionists, for the collection of each individual card must be added. There is also an online mode, which we have not been able to try until launch, but it follows the same logic of the main game with some additions: in addition to the possibility of challenging opponents from all over the world and exchanging mutual Deck Codes, there is a Battle system Pass that level after level allows us to obtain increasingly valuable rewards. Experience points are obtained by defeating other players, or by completing both daily and more ~long-term~ missions, which can vary from the number of defeated opponents to the use of specific cards in the game and various others. We were not convinced by the presence of a Battle Pass Premium, which allows you to unlock greater rewards by paying a certain amount: considering the type of game, it seems to us a completely superfluous and, indeed, very out of tune component. Sebbne may like to challenge other players in Shadowverse, for a PvP only experience there is the original for PC: the tie-in game could limit itself to offering the online component as a habit, without necessarily implementing a paid system that is useless To conclude, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle proves to be decent from a technical point of view, although there are occasional frame rate drops and there is excessive recycling of secondary character models. The soundtrack itself isn't particularly memorable. For the rest it is an enjoyable and fun experience, even for those who know the original game by heart, soiled by the presence of a Battle Pass Premium.", "date": "2021-08-11", "grade": "8.0"}
