We find that same approach in the interesting Candleman, a puzzle-based adventure that arrives on iOS and Android (but also Steam) a year after its debut on Xbox One, greeted with enthusiasm by the international press. The protagonist of the original story told to us by the guys from CMGE is a sentient candle, able to walk but with a reduced life expectancy: its flame can burn for just ten seconds. When moving within scenarios that are almost completely dark and fraught with pitfalls, however, even such a short timescale can and must be enough to light up the journey enough to avoid falling into the void or coming into contact with a dangerous object. This is exactly what we will find ourselves doing during the Candleman campaign, in the context of twelve chapters each divided into various levels, which require a total of four or five hours to complete. Our goal from time to time will be to overcome a more or less complex obstacle course and find the exit, while trying to light as many candles hidden in the settings as possible. A simple feat or not? Alone in the Dark A narrator introduces us to the story of Candleman, after which we immediately move on to the action, with the very first stages acting as a tutorial regarding the control system: a virtual and invisible analog stick on the left side of the screen allows you to move the character , while touching the right side of the touch screen allows you to light the candle flame and illuminate the surroundings. To jump you need to swipe upwards, always on the right side of the display: a solution that works very well, a pity that the stick has low sensitivity, which often translates into shaky and imprecise control, moreover lacking of adjustments, capable of causing unwanted and frustrating game overs. Fortunately, this is the only substantial defect for a production that immediately conquers thanks to its particular atmospheres, to the scenarios that are illuminated by small flames, but also to the very variety of situations, which gradually become more complex and introduce new mechanical. From this point of view, the first levels are clearly characterized by simplicity, after which environmental puzzles are introduced, mechanisms to be activated to move dangerous objects, flashes that come out of pipes and which must be overcome by calculating the times really well, bottles to roll because the air they release allows us to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms, and so on. In short, Candlman's experience is a successful mix of good ideas, with an intriguing starting concept, an essential but elegant soundtrack (a pity that the effects are not as brilliant) and fluid and detailed graphics, which are enhanced in the contrasts between dark and light, thus covering those technical edges that it is natural to find in an independent production. The only drawback of the direction are the sometimes uncomfortable and complicated shots, which in combination with the touch controls can create some headaches.", "date": "2018-04-11", "grade": "7.8"}
