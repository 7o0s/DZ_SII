The history of the Japanese developer is also much longer than one might think, given that it was founded by defectors from Toaplan, another very active Japanese developer in the decade 1984 - 1994 dedicated to arcades and in particular to shoot'em ups (Tiger Heli , Slap Fight, Hellfire, Zero Wing, Truxton and Batsugun tell you anything?). Mushihimesama, also known in our parts as Bug Princess, shares a long and articulated history with its developer. The first version of the game was released in 2004 in arcades, then versions were made for PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and mobile systems. When Cave announced that he would publish his titles on Steam with the support of the publisher Degica and that he would make his debut with Mushihimesama, many of the fans of the genre rejoiced, given that it is one of the recognized masterpieces of the genre. In reality, between many ups and downs, Cave's production has always been appreciated and there are not a few who would like to see official PC versions of titles such as DonPachi, DoDonPachi, ESP Ra.De., Dangun Feveron, Guwange, despite the years on rump. In short, even if we imagine that many of you know little about the genre of classic and cave shooters, it is right to make you understand that we are not talking about the typical studio with its first title that out of passion chooses to focus on an obsolete genre, but of a historical presence of our industry, which has been in operation for more years than the lives of many of us (of you, sadly) can count. The Insect Princess Mushihimesama tells the story of a race of giant insects, the Koujuu, particularly aggressive and lethal to humans, due to the Levi-Sense, their toxic life force, sympathetically renamed Miasma. It didn't take much for the Koujuu to exterminate the human race, allowing a few to survive, as long as they made human sacrifices. In the game we take on the role of Princess Reco, the next sacrificial victim, who decides to save her people by fighting against the Koujuu on the back of her golden beetle, Kiniro, with which she is telepathically connected by a bracelet given to her by a mysterious guy, when from little girl got lost in Shinju forest. All this meddling serves to justify a five-level-long furious war against bugs of varying sizes who will do anything to make Reco raw material for dung. On her side, our princess has an upgradeable frontal attack, with a more or less wide range depending on the initial selection (more width equals less damage), and some satellite insects, in technical jargon Options, which follow her and which can fly in different formations, selectable during the action. If desired, it is also possible to concentrate the shots to do more damage, however slowing down Reco's movement speed. As we said, the game consists of ~only~ five levels. Those who know the genre won't be surprised much, since they are also aware of how long it takes to master it and finish it with a decent score. For all the others, we specify that Mushihimesama is only apparently short, because the five levels that make it up are actually very long and also offer intermediate bosses. Furthermore, we are talking about a game that most players will not be able to complete even in normal mode as difficult as it is, let alone selecting Maniac and Ultra, which are dedicated to those who aspire to understand why manic shooter fans laugh every time fans of other genres speak of challenge. Other game modes are the Arrange, in which you start with Reco fully boosted, but with an impressive density of fire on the screen, and the Matsuri, which we will discuss in the next paragraph. If desired, there is also the points challenge, with which to try to climb the world rankings, but we advise you to face it only after having practiced a lot, otherwise you risk making very thin figures. We reviewed Mushihimesama, the first Cave title to be released on PC. Find out! Port and version 1.5 From a technical point of view, the PC version of the game is in fact a direct port of the Xbox 360 version. Nothing exceptional, but much more could not be expected. Some issues from the first release were fixed with patch releases, so we haven't accounted for them. The slowdowns you noticeor when the screen fills with bullets are not due to bad optimization, but are a precise choice of the developers. It is actually the only possible trick to give the player some chance to get away with it in the most extreme situations. If the action didn't slow down, in a kind of automatic bullet time effect, it would simply become impossible (or almost) to finish the game without continuing. It should be noted that according to some the slowdowns were initially introduced due to the limitations of the hardware used in the arcade by Cave and only later did they find a justification in the gameplay. The PC version does not include, but can be enriched by the Matsuri mode, or Mushihimesama V1.5, published as DLC, which modifies many aspects of the game and is designed for the best players who know the base game by heart. For example, the color palettes become more saturated, the enemies have a different positioning and fire shots with different patterns from those of the original game. Furthermore, Reco starts immediately with two Options, an advantage justified by the greater general difficulty. In short, this is the classic addition designed for those who, having fallen in love with the game, want to have more after stripping it. Perhaps it would have been appropriate to include it in the basic offer, since we are not talking about a brand new title, but it costs little and adds many hours of gameplay, so we can complain relatively.", "date": "2015-11-12", "grade": "9.0"}
