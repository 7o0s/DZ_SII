Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Onslaught is the latest downloadable content from PSN (or Xbox Live) dedicated to the DICE masterpiece, and adds to the already juicy gameplay a cooperative mode for four players through as many maps modified for the occasion. The ingredients that have unleashed the euphoria among FPS enthusiasts are once again the same: many air and land vehicles to drive, open and decidedly large environments, the almost total distructibility of every object, animated or not, that is displayed by the its impressive graphics engine. All for one, one for all The elements that have made the success of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 are therefore always the same, but this time they are shared with three of our ~comrades~ in battle who must help us achieve certain objectives set by the CPU. Cooperation is essential in a war simulation, and leaving aside for a moment the various multiplayer modes (deathmatch above all) in which each player contributes to the success of his team, but basically plays alone and against the same stats as his teammates, in the cooperative, communication and game organization become fundamental to progress in the game and be successful in the proposed missions. DICE has inserted a sort of ~Special Ops~ mode already appreciated in Modern Warfare 2, creating particular points to reach and neutralize through four pre-existing and specially modified maps: Valparaiso, the Atacama desert, Isla Inocentes and Nelson Bay have an even more once captivating with evocative horizons and lights and extremely alive and real, even if basically they remain the maps that we have already come to know. The maps, especially Nelson Bay, have been ~opened~ to previously inaccessible areas and made larger and more diverse than in normal online modes. Each of them has an initial collection point that acts as a lobby for the players, during which the objectives are studied and a draft of tactics is thrown down to face them. Weapons unlocked in competitive multiplayer are all available in the co-op arsenal, and the latter missions help level up and in turn earn new ones. A successful mix Take the conquest mode, mix it with the Rush one, think for a moment about the cooperative missions of the good old Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter and you'll have a pretty clear idea of what awaits you by downloading the Onslaught add-on pack. Starting from the initial base, the four players must advance to the first objective, which can be of various kinds or types: detonate a building, conquer a territory, eliminate an enemy outpost. Once the first sub-mission is completed, the next one proceeds linearly, but through these immense four maps that allow the team to proceed in various ways. On foot, or using one of the many means available: trucks, jeeps, helicopters and so on. Obviously, we can also split up, proceeding on the ground while a squad covers our backs from the sky, or with a sniper monitoring the situation from the top of an adjacent hill. The enemy artificial intelligence is once again excellently calibrated, with decidedly high competitiveness peaks, but never tediously difficult. The feeling that the game always depends on our skill, and not on luck or the malleability of the AI, is always constant and pushes us to play focused, but not to a frustrating degree. There are four levels to choose from, from ~easy~ to ~hardcore~ for the extreme feat lovers. However, there are still some ~bugs~ such as the wild respawn of enemies in some situations, or the excessive firepower of the CPU-controlled helicopters. A patch in the works, however, should definitely fix these small imperfections. Playstation 3 trophies This downloadable content not only adds new modes and revised maps, but also eight trophies for PSN and eight achievements for Xbox Live. It will take two or three hours to get them all: it's basically about completing each of the four maps featured in veteran mode. By doing so you get two trophies for each mission. The level of difficulty, of course, depends this time on the overall skill of the team. Competitive multiplayer simulation In the intentions of the game developers there is a goal that is not so hidden, namely thatto introduce new players to Battlefield: Bad Company 2 in a closed and ~protected~ multiplayer environment, difficult but guided, competitive but against a well-equipped AI. The online multiplayer ocean made up of sharks eager to kill is very unattractive both for those approaching an FPS for the first time and for those who jump into the fray while the game is in progress. Here, in this sense, the cooperative mode offers the best experience in single player, but with the cooperation and the help of three other friends of ours, perfectly mixing the two game experiences without giving useless ~shocks~ to the new player, who here he has plenty of time to practice the controls and gain experience (and unlock weapons!). The graphic and audio sector remains unchanged, if not for some changes to the maps that make them even wider in some situations, or even more tactical in others such as Valparaiso in its new night look that reminds us a lot of the dark and horror atmospheres of some films about the space marines. Ultimately, Onslaught adds the only mode that Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was missing, but it does so without inserting real new maps, albeit revisited, with the possibility of facing them ~in time~ and being part of particular online rankings even with a new enemy vehicle (the Mark V assault patrol boat), but at the price of 8.99. The game can finally be said to be complete from all points of view, but a real integrated co-op mode would have another meaning and this could also have been included as free DLC.", "date": "2010-07-13", "grade": "7.0"}
