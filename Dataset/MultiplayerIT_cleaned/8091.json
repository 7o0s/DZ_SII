RAGE has been loved by many, but unfortunately snubbed by the general public, failing to obtain such a large amount of sales as to guarantee it a prolonged life. But then, against all market laws and perhaps even in a slightly romantic way (nowadays), ID Software throws a huge file of over 2 GB onto the digital delivery circuit to download to broaden the experience of their creature. So go find RAGE in your crowded shelf, put it back, and if it still gives you those chills... well, maybe it's time to try this latest DLC! A game to be rediscovered After the re-release of Doom 3 we thought that nothing and no one could push a software house beyond bringing out an ~old~ brand to give it life once it was placed on the shelves at home. But if the original Doom 3 was released eight years ago, this RAGE in comparison is a kid with ~just~ 14 months on his back and, as mentioned, a new dedicated DLC has been added called ~The Scorchers~ (the Burned). The first expansion of the iD Software title after more than a year of waiting adds to the main game a brand new mode called ~Ultra-Nightmare~, which, as the name suggests, pushes the level of difficulty and cunning to the limit (already very refined) of the game's artificial intelligence. But the main dish of the expansion, however, is a nice slice of unpublished history of the campaign mode to be experienced, for a total of about two, three hours of gameplay. This is the first and real DLC obviously excluding that small mission in the sewers that can be downloaded from the first days of the game's release. ID has therefore practically snubbed the multiplayer sector of the game, abandoned almost immediately by all the players as it is generally considered not very competitive, throwing itself (rightly in our opinion) on the implementation and expansion of the main plot. The Scorchers throws us into the events concerning the notorious Burnt clan, fearsome and violent unscrupulous characters ready for anything: in the adventure we will be helped by an attractive blonde with skimpy clothes named Sarah, who after saving us from an attack will accompany us through the mines and unattractive wastelands of RAGE. As soon as the dusty RAGE disc is re-inserted into the Xbox 360 tray, we immediately notice how the new ~Ultra Nightmare~ mode appears from the main menu but we do not find any reference to the file just finished downloading, containing precisely ~The Scorchers ~. We save you the trouble of finding the ~link~ that links the main storyline to the events in the DLC. You have two options. The first: start the game from scratch again, and the missions related to the expansion will appear after about three hours. The second, much more convenient, select a save later in the game, perhaps even towards the end, and look for Hagar's Camp because it is from there that your new adventures will begin. We also remind you that completing the RAGE story also unlocks the ~Extended Play~ mode which allows you to roam freely around the world of wastelands, so you can quickly find the camp from which to start new adventures. As soon as we cross the door that leads us into the Burnt cave, and have been saved by Sarah (don't worry, it's not a spoiler, it happens as soon as you leave), we are immediately handed over a brand new weapon for RAGE: the nailgun that made our fortune so much of the good old Quake, or the nail gun. There are also two new power-ups available in the DLC, and using them you get a really powerful weapon, even if terribly slow (suitable for bigger and slower enemies). In RAGE, a great deal of characterization and customization of the enemies has been done, starting from the very varied and refined AI that allows each ~clan~ to activate in a different way, defend in a different way, use exclusive weapons and attacks. In this case the Bruciati are crazy about fire, as one could guess, and therefore the green light for flamethrowers and Molotov cocktails that will make life really difficult for us. To start it is necessary to attack them right in their lair, the refinery, under gunshots and flaming arrows, up to the truly characteristic and difficult to kill final boss. We can only tell you, in order not to spoil anything, that if some points of RAGE reminded us of Gears of War (for example the final part of this DLC, set on the rooftops), sometimes Fallout, the boss will remind you, perhaps, of Panzer Dragoon. Once defeated we could access Sarah's trophy room, where all the relics are keptpreviously found in the campaign. If we add a tasty side dish made up of many extras to the main course, the importance of this DLC and above all the convenience of its price becomes clear: only 400 Microsoft Points, about five euros. These welcome extras are, in this case, a new chapter of Mutant Bash TV (extra missions) and two games of chance like a sort of Russian Roulette and a Video Poker on which to squander our savings. To recap: new campaign, new mode, new weapons, new extra missions, new content. Low price. What more could a gamer want? Highly recommended DLC. Also to forget the final gray of RAGE.", "date": "2012-12-25", "grade": null}
