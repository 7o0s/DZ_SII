{"name": "PES 2019: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pes-2019-recensione.html", "text": "When a few months ago Konami announced that it no longer has the Champions League license in PES 2019, we confess that we felt a leap of concern. In fact, we believed that the difference with FIFA in terms of official licenses was already too large to be able to suffer even this blow, especially in light of the fact that the most important club competition in the world went straight to the competition. In retrospect, we can say that we have been too pessimistic towards the Japanese publisher's football simulation: PES 2019 proves to be more alive than ever even after the loss of the Champions League, giving fans of the series a game that finally seems capable of being able to get closer to the glories of the past. There is still work to be done, of course, but the enormous attention to what happens on the pitch makes PES 2019 a title that focuses entirely on the dynamics that regulate the most beautiful sport in the world, giving its fans a truly satisfying experience . We don't want to jump to conclusions without having first written everything there is to know about PES 2019, but precisely because of our doubts - which we imagine were the same as others - it seemed right to us to immediately clarify how things are. Let's go see why. Playstation 4 trophies PES 2019 comes with a total of fifty Trophies. The inevitable Platinum is joined by three of the Gold type, six Silver and forty Bronze. To obtain all of them, the player must deal with all the modes that the game offers, both online and offline, achieving victory even in particular situations. There is no shortage of objectives particularly linked to the user's ability, such as the goal from a free kick from over twenty-five meters or from a set piece. The gameplay: the beauty of football The classic lineup for a sports title would tell us to start with the modes offered by the game, but in the case of PES 2019 it is worth giving precedence to what happens on the football field. Konami's investments for this year's edition have in fact once again gone in the direction of the purest gameplay, to pursue the goal of freeing PES 2019 from the historical problems that the Pro Evolution Soccer series has been carrying around for years . The basis on which the developers worked was the already good one offered by PES 2018, in particular as regards the control of the ball by the players. After introducing the possibility of touching the ball with the whole body a year ago, Konami has further evolved the system that dominates the management of the ball, working above all on the way it behaves in the dirtiest game situations. As we said on the occasion of the trial a few days ago, PES 2019 opens the door to the unpredictability that distinguishes real matches, in which a tackle or header may not always succeed cleanly. Spikes, rebounds and other elements hitherto uncommon in football games - or in any case not very credible - are managed by PES 2019 aiming for maximum simulation, thanks also to a highly sought-after physical model. The path on which Konami has decided to continue also proves to be right in the way in which PES 2019 sets up the matches, forcing the player to open a path in the defense of others in order to be able to reach the net. The main alternative is the one offered by tactics and the game, taking advantage of a passing system which, with the complicity of a certain ~weight~ of the ball, can be very satisfying. The reverse of the medal is represented by the fact that an incorrect control or a non-ideal position for the movement to be performed can lead the player to be late in its execution, missing the ideal moment. What we said a year ago still applies today: the moment you manage to set up a successful action, Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 allows you to savor football in all its essence. All this does not mean that the game completely bans dribbling, which however are not the result of impossible combinations with the controller keys: the main skill in this sense always lies in being able to change speed or swerve at the moment right, with the help of any tricks of the player we are checking. In short, characters like Messi always know how to be lethal, but their impact on the match is much less than in the past. Referees, goalkeepers and artificial intelligence In the editions of Pro Evolution Soccer of the past years the main problems concerned one or more of the three aspects that give the title to this paragraph. It therefore seemed logical to put them under the magnifying glass right from the startcontacts we had with the final versions of PES 2019, to understand if the game could be able to put an end to some historical flaws. The answer is yes, although as we are about to see for Konami there is still work to do. Let's start with the referees, who have long been criticized for their ~blindness~: in PES 2019 the match officials generally appear to be faithful to their duty, most of the time being punctual in calling a foul and possibly sanctioning with a card. It sometimes happens that this attitude changes a bit even in the course of the same game, thus letting the referee gloss over foul situations or forget a sacrosanct card. For the goalkeepers a similar speech should be made, starting from the way in which they now seem safe between the posts compared to the past, taking advantage of the whole new set of animations that Konami has introduced over time for all players. The most skilled of the extreme defenders are able to perform real miracles even in the event of a close shot by the attacker on duty, generally positioning themselves correctly to defend the goal. There are still some flaws on the exits, towards which the goalkeepers still prove to be too lazy especially when it comes to meeting an opponent launched on the net. The hope is that Konami can take charge of this problem as soon as possible, adjusting the artificial intelligence of the goalkeepers. Speaking of artificial intelligence, we must give credit to the developers for having given PES 2019 a truly remarkable ability to manage attack situations, with players ready to jump into holes but also to respect any directives given by the user to avoid overreaching too. The only drawback we have noticed concerns the management of ball possession by the CPU, especially when it approaches our goal: a few shots from outside, many one-twos sometimes even forced ones, but above all a constant search for low crosses for the striker positioned in the penalty area. Speaking of crosses, compared to PES 2018 this new edition gave us the impression of penalizing header goals a little. The arrangements: waiting for something new Now that we have seen what it feels like to take the field with PES 2019, let's find out what are the alternatives offered to the player in terms of modes. Historically devoted to the offline single component, the Pro Evolution Soccer series remains firmly anchored to its roots thanks to the historic Master League, which has been present for almost twenty years now. While remaining similar to the past, the PES 2019 Master League is able to offer greater difficulty thanks to the possibility of selecting the Challenge level, in which the management of the club is complicated by some factors. Having lost the Champions League, Konami secured the license for the International Champions Cup, a summer competition that has become a regular appointment in recent years. It would be hypocritical to say that the lack of the Champions League is not felt, but Konami must be given the credit for having tried to remedy it by bringing many minor leagues into PES 2019, grabbing practically everything that is not present in the giant FIFA. A separate chapter should be opened on the possibility of importing options files into the game, an operation which has by now become so trivial as to provide no justifications to those who refrain from carrying it out: in just a few steps it is possible to obtain Juventus, Real Madrid and all the teams of the Premier League that are missing, thus overcoming the licensing problem. Returning to the Master League, the other news concerns more options in transfer negotiations, as well as a news list on the homepage. Little to report for the Become a Legend mode, thanks to which it is possible to impersonate a footballer created ad hoc or already existing to take him to the roof of the world. Moving on to the online component of PES 2019, the myClub mode stands out as always: we have already dedicated an in-depth analysis to Konami's response to FUT in recent days, so here we limit ourselves only to saying that the developers have responded to many of the needs encountered by users, thus providing a generally simpler experience and less tied to transactions with real money. Still with regard to online, the presence of the three-on-three online cooperative mode should be noted, useful for adding a little variety to the usual one-on-one matches. In general, the matchmaking did not present any particular flaws, forcing us to wait a little longer only on rare occasions. Once the opponent has been found, in ninety-nine percent of cases the match flows without lag problems, at least on the PlaySt platformation 4 on which we tested the game. Graphics and sound: many lights and few shadows In terms of graphics, PES 2019 manages to defend itself well against increasingly fierce competition. As noted in the past, the agreements made by Konami have allowed developers to use players from clubs such as Barcelona, Inter, Milan and Liverpool to reproduce them in maximum detail on the pitch thanks to 3D facial scanning. Even if the jump from partner clubs to normal ones is clear, this does not mean that PES 2019 gives up on properly representing the members of the other teams. Indeed, even the smaller teams can count on features similar to the real ones at least for their most representative players, an aspect which instead constitutes a historical gap for FIFA. We have already talked about the use of the Enlighten engine several times, so all we have to do is confirm the excellent impression that the new lighting effects are able to have even in the details concerning the blades of grass that make up the field . The boost of resolution to 4K with HDR allows those with a suitable screen to enjoy the potential offered by PlayStation 4 Pro, counting on a constant number of sixty frames per second. For the rest, Konami has enriched the elements surrounding the game, bringing its representation closer to what we usually see on television. Players regret taking a chance and the replays are always good in terms of framing and detail, even if we're concerned we'd reduce the frequency just a bit. One of this year's novelties, the so-called Visible Fatigue, allows us to see players who bring their hands to their sides after an action, thus evaluating a possible change that can be made via the quick menu introduced by Konami. However, the impact is not only graphical, given that footballers who run out of petrol seem more prone to missing a pass or shot, or even getting injured, especially when their level of pre-match form was already not up to par. maximum. A final note concerns the game menus, too anchored in the past and not very intuitive to the point of hiding some options especially in the Master League. The hope is that after fixing the gameplay, from next year Konami will also be able to devote himself to the secondary aspects. The audio sector sees the return of the couple made up of Fabio Caressa and Luca Marchegiani to the commentary, together with the same problems as always. The introduction of matches is often subdued, just as the emphasis of some actions is too exaggerated compared to what is seen on the pitch and vice versa. Furthermore, despite the addition of some lines of dialogue, we happened to hear the same sentence repeated in three consecutive actions, a sign that there is still work to be done to improve the commentary of the match. For the rest, the chants of the fans do their job as well as the soundtrack, which features songs by more and less well-known artists.", "date": "2018-09-05", "grade": "8.7"}
