And what an answer: the series has so far sold more than twelve million copies worldwide, setting itself as a point of reference for fans. The latest episode, Midnight Club: Los Angeles, just released for PS3 and Xbox 360, sees us face a large number of clandestine races within Los Angeles, with the city redesigned and ~synthesized~ to meet the technical needs of the developers. For the PSP version, Rockstar Games has decided to go big, adding the now famous suffix ~Remix~ to the title and giving us the opportunity to compete not only in the ~city of angels~, but also on the busy streets of Tokyo . Step one: make a name for yourself Apart from the lack of online multiplayer (on PSP it is possible to challenge friends only in local wireless mode), the game structure has remained almost unchanged compared to the ~major~ versions: our character has just arrived in the city and wants to burn the stages, he wants to quickly build a reputation and beat whoever there is to beat to climb the fastest riders classification. There is only one small detail: in Midnight Club the races are strictly clandestine, and are carried out on normal city streets, with all that ensues: traffic, risks, police, old ladies who go at thirty per hour on the state roads, etc. We will be called by one of our contacts at more or less regular intervals, that is every time we make some progress in the right direction, and he will possibly indicate a driver who wants to challenge us or a race whose prize is high enough to earn us a small nest egg. The GPS (which appears in the form of a radar on the screen, in transparency, but can be called up in full screen by pressing the SELECT key) shows us at all times the places where a race is being held: just get there and flash the high beams (yes activated via the d-pad) to access the event. The races all have more or less the same rules: you have to go through checkpoints for a variable number of laps, then try to cross the finish line first. Second step: make money It is clear that you need to win all the races to increase the percentage of progress and gradually meet stronger opponents, with the Tokyo map only becoming available when we have completed around 80% of the Los Angeles events. And it is equally clear that the money earned with victories we can use to buy a new car or to upgrade the one we have, in many different ways. Midnight Club: L.A. Remix boasts a total of thirty cars, belonging to various international manufacturers, which can be modified in every respect by entering a special workshop (accessible both from the menu at the end of each race, and physically on the map. The options are the usual: it is possible to enhance the vehicle by putting a hand to the exhaust, the engine, the electronics and so on, buying ever more performing kits; and it is also possible to make changes to the bodywork, both in terms of performance (widening, lightening) and in aesthetic terms (painting, adding spoilers, side skirts). The tires can also be changed, with the car's grip clearly changing when we opt for wide, large-diameter tyres. In short, the possibilities are numerous and the upgrade system works well, with concrete feedback in the race: we are not dealing with the best example of the genre in the panorama of arcade racing games, but the work done is more than fair. The demon of speed As mentioned, each race sees the presence of checkpoints to cross before finishing the route, but the way in which we reach these areas is at our discretion: we can follow the normal road or opt for shortcuts. Indeed, the best thing is to follow your opponents and see what they do, to discover more or less hidden passages. The important thing is to keep the distance from the car in front of us stable, because the game uses a very particular nitro system: to load it, we will have to stay in the slipstream of an opponent for a few seconds, and then fire the boost with the Square button. before the charge vanishes into thin air. This is a fundamental help, especially when there is a certain difference in performance between our car and the others: the nitro can literally allow us to cross the finish line first when we are still fourth and at the end of the race there are only a handful of meters. There is also a second big elementimportantly, a sort of bullet time that allows us to slow down the action if necessary: the relative bar loads when we drive cleanly for a few seconds, without collisions, and we can activate it by pressing the Circle button. More than for ~surgical~ overtaking, this extra help will prove useful for limiting the damage caused by the omnipresent traffic: if Midnight Club: L.A. Remix has a flaw, in fact, it is often very frustrating, precisely because of the occasional drivers who crash into our car in the most critical moments, sometimes ruining an otherwise perfect race. Technical realization While not being able to boast the numbers and quality of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, this new episode of Midnight Club for PSP defends itself well: the polygonal models of the cars are well done, rich in detail and equipped with a progressive damage system that it doesn't work miracles but at least it gives an idea of the milder impacts. Looking for realism in such a product is wrong, mind you: you will be able to finish a race even after bouncing off several buildings at high speed, after which it will be enough for you to give a touch-up to the bodywork for your racing car to be like new again. Although small compared to reality, both Los Angeles and Tokyo present themselves as enormous cities, which it is possible to travel far and wide in search of possible adversaries. Unfortunately, the uploads are very frequent, and even if they are not very long, they definitely break the pace of the game, annoying in particular in the car selection screen. The graphics engine manages to manage the settings and the numerous vehicles that move within them in the best possible way, always maintaining a certain fluidity, without slowdowns or uncertainties: it is truly a respectable result. On the other hand, the textures are once again there to bear witness to one of the main technical limitations of the PSP: they are poorly defined, coarse, often grainy. The game is translated into Italian as regards the texts on the screen, while the audio of the dialogues is in English: the acting is of a good standard, even if Rockstar has shown that it can do much better. The music is rather scarce. As far as the control system is concerned, the layout of the commands is completely customizable and gives us the possibility to remedy a series of rather strange decisions by the developers: placing the accelerator on the usual X button is one thing, however putting the brake on the Triangle makes it a bit complicated to drift, while the other two main buttons are for nitro and bullet time.", "date": "2008-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
