However, don't expect the traditional structure to which Codemasters has accustomed us with its titles: after a short tutorial that introduces us to the control system and driving aids, all aspects that are widely adjustable, the game reveals a Clash Royale-style progression, based that is, on ~leagues~ to be accessed by totaling a certain number of victories in quick online multiplayer matches. By facing opponents from all over the world in real time, generally with a level of experience close to ours, we will see our points increase or decrease depending on whether we win or lose, so as to eventually enter a range of competitions that include content different from the starting ones. This is how the four initial circuits (Canada, Great Britain, Hungary and Germany) are joined by others, to arrive at a total of seventeen tracks with which to compete in the context of three modalities: Rapid Race, i.e. with a flying lap; In Grid, which also includes the moment of the standing start; and finally the Qualifications, which do not need further study. By competing and bringing home victories we will be able to unlock a long series of achievements to receive two types of currency, virtual and precious, as well as a large number of cards that can be equipped and upgraded, each relating to a different component of the single-seater: transmission, engine, tires and etc. Gameplay and features F1 Mobile Racing uses an accelerometer-based control system by default, where you have to tilt your device to steer while braking and accelerating are automatic. As mentioned, however, it is possible to modify the settings in various ways: in addition to possibly switching to touch controls (which however are not absolutely as precise as the tilt), you can choose to use the manual brake and/or accelerator, as well as to make the aids to aim for a more realistic and challenging experience. The real drivers of the last Formula 1 championship are present, as mentioned, but we will only see them as rivals, given that we will be called to create a character from scratch and to modify the car, also and above all aesthetically, between one event and another . Unfortunately, it is not known exactly how matchmaking works in terms of balance, but we imagine it is an aspect closely linked to the diffusion of the game, certainly guaranteed by the free game and the absence of concrete constraints due to the freemium model. You have fun on the track, the races are very fast and go well with the mobile nature of the experience, even if there are aspects to which the guys at Eden Games have not paid particular attention: parts of the interface that do not correctly support the notch of the iPhone X, some moments in which the audio is completely absent and the lack of options that can make the graphics more fluid, given that even on the former top of the Apple range the performances often come across small uncertainties, remaining very far from an ideal frame rate of 60 frames per second, even more so when tilt controls are involved. Remaining on the subject of content, it must be said that the single player is cut off from the achievements and upgrades issue, limiting itself to playing a side role, useful at best for practice. However, the graphics are very spectacular, the tracks appear faithful to their real counterparts and therefore the use of assets used by Codemasters for its F1 series is probable. The same goes naturally for the single-seaters, which can be admired in all their detail thanks to the external but also internal views. In short, an excellent job has been done, which we hope will be further refined in the coming weeks in those aspects that still need some attention.", "date": "2018-10-23", "grade": "8.0"}
