It is no secret that Just Dance has adopted a deeply conservative approach over the years, strong in a well-tested formula and bearer of the ancient adage according to which ~the winning team does not change~. Yet, this time Ubisoft has decided to break the delay and do a makeover for the world's favorite dancing video game. Revamped art direction, the introduction of online multiplayer in private groups, the transition from Just Dance Unlimited to the new Just Dance + and more - this is a new course for the series, with many lights and some shadows. We talk about it in depth in our review of Just Dance 2023. Lots of new hits... Just Dance 2023 videos are much more polished than in the past As with every episode, this latest iteration also offers 40 new songs. There is something for all tastes: even not exactly dance pieces (this is the case with Numb by Linkin Park) work great in this context, while, as has already happened in the past, Ubisoft continues to successfully wink at the colorful drag universe (Sissy That Walk by RuPaul). It is debated whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage compared to past titles that adopted a different approach, but in Just Dance it is only the movements of the right hand that count: in our opinion, it is an excellent compromise to ensure the possibility of play even in confined spaces, not to mention that even people with reduced mobility can participate in the dance and have a lot of fun. In this sense, the choreography of Radioactive is emblematic, in which only the hands move. The search function by musical genre (rock, hip-hop, and many others), choreographic style (duet, trio, solo. ..), mood (motivational, epic, calm), period (2000s, 2010s, and then back to the 70s and 80s) and accessibility (to identify pieces that can also be completed while seated, with little space available and/or no jumps). The predefined playlists were also successful: as usual, there is the possibility of creating our own lists, but already at the start there is a great variety to satisfy the tastes of romantic couples, groups of party-loving friends and solitary dancers. Given that the decision to buy Just Dance depends largely on the goodness of its selection of music, here it is.

Alina Pash ~Woman~ by Doja Cat ~Wouldn't It Be Nice~ by The Sunlight Shakers ~Zooby Doo~ by Tigermonkey Ubisoft has not lost the magic touch in managing what, every year, is a selection job that is anything but simple: the watchword is variety, and there are pieces capable of satisfying even very different tastes. . ...but with not just some cuts As usual for the series, even in Just Dance 2023 there is no shortage of group choreographies to dance in company. We arrive at the most significant novelty proposed by Just Dance 2023: the Just Dance Unlimited paid service - with a playlist that had exceeded 500 songs - is replaced by Just Dance +. A simple name change? Not exactly. Now the subscription covers a certain number of game minutes and is no longer monthly, avoiding the unpleasant situation in whichhe quisted the annual ticket, then not using Just Dance for a long time. Above all, we are witnessing a situation similar to the one that occurred in the eighth generation of the most famous pocket monsters in the world. What Pokmon Sword and Shield have to do with Just Dance + is easy to say: Ubisoft has decided to make a clean cut to the selection of subscription songs, dropping from the considerable number of over 500 to 150. Of course, new songs will be added in the future and old songs that are currently excluded will return (as you can see, the comparison with the so-called ~Masudian genocide~ is not so far-fetched ), but at the moment there are so many illustrious victims, and the historical fans of the series will only be able to turn up their noses at the lack of some of their favorite choreographies. It is frankly incomprehensible the choice of inserting two variants (in the case of Another One Bites The Dust by Queen) or even three (for Lady Gaga's Just Dance) for different pieces: it would have been more appreciable to ~save~ a few more pieces, given the drastic decrease in variety within Just Dance +. Of course, this is perhaps an inevitable choice: the qualitative variety between old and new videos and choreographies had now become abysmal, but we believe that Ubisoft could have managed the operation with greater wisdom. A new graphic look The new Just Dance 2023 avatars have very varied styles The good thing is that Just Dance has never been so beautiful to look at and immediate to play. And the great attention towards those who have been following the series for many years is clearly perceived, confirming the fact that Ubisoft really cares about the community of its dancing video game: some songs from the old editions are back in the original version (Toxic by Britney Spears from Just Dance 2), flanked by new videos full of references and winks at past chapters. The new aesthetic approach is interesting, which is in continuity with what we saw last year: the avatars are more realistic but do not lose that pleasant cartoon aftertaste, while the three-dimensional backdrops are well managed and pleasant in terms of colours, lighting and situations. Also, after years of fan requests, we've finally introduced online multiplayer functionality in private groups, a great way to have fun with friends even when you're not in the same room. The style of the new Just Dance 2023 menus is much more sober and essential than seen in the past It remains true that Nintendo Switch and its Joy-Con are the most immediate and natural way to approach Just Dance 2023. It is also possible to use the smartphone app (available for free on both iOS and Android), but the Nintendo platform remains the habitat of election for the Ubisoft title. The new menus, renewed this year, are moving in an equally streamlined direction, essential, clean and certainly less confusing than in the past.", "date": "2022-11-24", "grade": "7.7"}
