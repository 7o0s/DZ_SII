The experiences we have had in the universe of puzzles with PlayStation VR and other viewers have in fact shown that with the right tricks it is possible to enhance the puzzle dynamics, making wise use of the additional level of involvement guaranteed by virtual reality. The possibility of seeing the puzzles to be solved straight ahead and of ~touching~ the game elements with your own hands have given lifeblood to the puzzle game genre, within which we also register the addition of Salary Man Escape with this review . Developed by Red Accent Studios and ported by Sony exclusively to PlayStation VR, the game puts us in the role of an employee trying to escape from his office, or rather the one who allows him to do so. How? We are about to see it. The setting: worthy of Fantozzi The term Salary Man that gives its name to this game was born in Japan in the last century. Although its literal translation stands for ~salaried worker~, over time this appellation has also gone to identify in the rest of the world the employees typically hired by large corporations, destined to remain forever at their company. In short, the so-called ~permanent position~, characterized however by an all-encompassing working life, which leads Salary Men to sustain long working hours accompanied by salaries often not adequate for the commitment made. The stereotype of the Salary Man sees the latter spending even the little free time he always has in the corporate orbit, thus sending his family and social life to hell. An existence from which to want to escape, a term that, not surprisingly, was added by Red Accent Studios to give the name to Salary Man Escape. In fact, all this preamble serves to say that the player's goal is to help one of these stressed employees to get out of their work environment, putting the poor man with the briefcase in a position to reach the office door. This is easier said than done, because between the workstation and the exit there are fixed and mobile obstacles that can make the Salary Man's office life really complicated. Playstation 4 trophies Salary Man Escape is accompanied by twenty-four total Trophies, composed of the usual Platinum plus six Gold, fourteen Silver and three Bronze. Getting them all is not very difficult compared to other occasions, as you just need to be careful to recover all the coins that appear during the game. Speaking of the latter, thanks to them it is also possible to unlock the levels that were initially closed. The gameplay: blocks and puzzles Around the Internet, the mechanics of Salary Man Escape have been compared to those of the board game Jenga, with which in reality the title we are dealing with has in common the only need to remove blocks from the joint in which they are located , to change the structure of a scenario that we obviously find different at each level. Net of other elements intended to increase the complexity of the puzzles, we find fixed blocks of white color (we will come back to the style of the game later) which rest on others of red color. The latter can be moved or removed with the use of the chosen control system, for which you have the double possibility between DualShock 4 and a single PlayStation Move: both solutions present both elements for and against, thus preventing us from advising you in clearly one or the other. With the normal controller in hand, the movements are in fact more precise, but the management of the camera is too cumbersome due to the inexplicable choice of inverting the rotation axes. No matter how hard you try and sooner or later you end up getting used to it, the movement will always be unnatural: it would have been at least useful to allow you to configure it from the menus. Using PlayStation Move, on the other hand, moving the view becomes much more intuitive right from the start with the use of the arms, but you end up losing something in terms of precision: when it is physics that decrees whether you can succeed or If you don't reach your goal, the problem can become big. Also because once the possibility of finding the right path is lost, all that remains is to press the reset button to start over. Also not to be underestimated is the tiredness effect, due to the almost continuous movement to move the view and blocks of the limb with which the stick is held. We were saying that to get to the door, you have to clear the road of the obstacles that populate it, or put together an adequate route spostanding the blocks strategically: once the path has been opened, our Salary Man will proceed alone towards the exit or towards one of the intermediate points present on the ~map~. A fair progression in difficulty makes the numerous levels pleasant to go through in a general sense, but those who expect to see something in particular thanks to virtual reality will be disappointed: from this point of view, the best example therefore continues to remain Statik. As for Salary Man Escape, however, a possible transition to the normal screen would not actually affect anything in terms of gameplay. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view, Salary Man Escape offers an unusual juxtaposition between graphics and sound: the former deliberately anonymous and in shades of gray, the latter animated by songs of the funk/pop genre. The grayness and the almost total absence of colors naturally symbolize the life of our employee, accompanied by a series of notes that give the entire duration of Salary Man Escape the right amount of irony, in the absence of which the atmosphere would be a little too heavy. Each level is then introduced by a note that speaks to us, for example, of the sports competition where the management wins to avoid being fired, passing through other situations similar to the limits of Fantozzi. At this point we have to make a consideration similar to the one you read at the end of the previous paragraph: effects such as those seen for example in GNOG are quite distant, which is why even in graphical terms Salary Man Escape does not offer anything particular in terms of virtual reality. The various levels are presented to us right in front of our eyes, floating in the void with the possibility of being rotated or zoomed in on them to a certain level. As for the soundtrack, however, perhaps a little less repetitiveness would have benefited our ears, especially in moments when there is a greater need to use the head to solve the puzzles proposed by the game.", "date": "2018-07-20", "grade": "6.5"}
