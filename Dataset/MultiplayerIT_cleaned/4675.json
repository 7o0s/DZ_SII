In recent years, with the passage of the official WRC license in the hands of Kylotonn Games, Dirt has almost always dominated but 2017 could see the situation reversed as the French house presents itself at its third attempt with a chapter finally revolutionized from the ground up and ready to compete on equal terms with the best exponents of the genre. Of course, if we were to compare WRC 7 to the quality achieved by PC simulators beyond Project Cars, the gap would still be extremely wide, but on consoles and for Rally games, competition is now really one step away. So let's see what has changed and what the WRC offer consists of this year. Content in first place, but is it enough? WRC 7 is strengthened by the official license and arrives at the test benches with as many as sixty tracks, thirteen official rallies and a more than satisfactory fleet of vehicles, which forgets the historic cars to focus instead on the racing cars of the current season. This new chapter is not a mere graphic and technical update of the predecessor as we said at the beginning but a real complete makeover of the driving structure, physics and even the car models. Great strides have been made in every segment and the final result, both visual and in terms of response to the steering wheel, is truly satisfying. From the initial menu it is possible to decide one of the many activities to be carried out, where the main dish for the players always remains a full-bodied career mode, probably not as articulated as those seen in the Milestone titles of past years, but still able to keep you busy for several hours. Above all, it is able to give you a general smattering of the game, with an increasing difficulty and a challenge that gradually adapts well to the skills of your virtual alter ego. You start with a two-year contract in one of the WRC Junior championship teams and, stage after stage, you fight to excel against your opponents. The team plays a marginal role in this case and what counts are the end-of-season goals, with goals ranging from simple placement in the top positions to winning a specific stage or bettering a direct rival. Unfortunately there are no significant rewards and the feeling of growth or the possibility of doing something more between one stage and another is missing a bit, but the simulation is essentially about life as a pilot and we make it enough for us. However, we can take advantage of the virtual forty-five minutes between the various races to fix the car and repair any damage suffered, choosing through an extremely simple scheme which of the dozens of elements at our disposal to put our hand to: from the tires to the gearbox, passing from bodywork and engine up to the steering wheel. If by choosing the semi-pro difficulty these interventions have minimal relevance, given that you will almost always arrive intact at the end of the races, increasing the level of simulation and the influence of damage, it will be very important to choose to adopt a strategy relevant to our driving style seen that the minutes for repairs will hardly be enough to get back on track as if we had just left the dealership. Playstation 4 trophies By carrying out the WRC 7 career, you will almost naturally acquire at least fifty percent of the trophies available for the title, which require nothing more than to finish first during the various stages or move up a higher category. To get to platinum, however, you will also have to win all the special challenges, extricate yourself from online matches and perform evolutions, random or not, once on the circuit. WRC 7 also has an internal objective system, which must be completed to unlock ~Legend~ the probably most complex golden trophy to obtain for this production. Consistency and variety The one proposed by WRC 7 is an extremely malleable driving experience and if on the one hand even the novice player can have fun with a simple pad and a purely arcade driving style, by moving the bar towards the more extreme simulation, very satisfactory results are obtained even taking up the steering wheel and sitting on a comfortable playseat. Kylotonn Games has therefore included many variables and settings in its rally simulator precisely to reach an audience that was as vast as possible, managing not to displease anyone this time. The driveability of the cars is in fact very good and perfectly reflects the new limitations imposed this year by the FIA championship con extremely powerful and even more difficult to control machines. We really liked the work done on the weight distribution out of corners and after jumps, and transitions between the various surface types also feel vibrant. Asphalt, dirt and gravel make the car behave in a completely different way, restoring good realism and requiring particular attention while driving. What is not rendered perfectly is instead the graphic aspect of the various surfaces, always too flat and lacking in signs of the passage of other cars. It always seems to run on a prepared road, even on dirt roads, losing much of the difficulty of the typical rally depressions caused by the constant passage of other competitors. What has been improved however is the dynamism of the tracks with cars that finally leave the ground due to the numerous bumps, the ditches placed next to the roads and the infinite ups and downs. Esports Master! When esports become a serious matter, they begin to appeal to anyone and after Milestone, Kylotonn also follows the path of online competitions to add some spice to the weekly challenges, offering the best virtual pilots to then get to challenge each other on a global scale. For lovers of shoulder-to-shoulder battles, there is even a split screen and even a hot seat mode for up to eight players. Therefore, if we are not in bad shape with regard to content, a little better could have been done as regards the visual impact with ups and downs a bit in every situation. The cars are excellent but the physical damage model is not so accurate, the views and the edge of the track are good but the public has very backward animations and the frame rate, at 30 frames per second, drops when the particles on the screen increase, perhaps after a restart in the sand, a symptom that the optimization work could have been done better and that the engine has not yet been squeezed to the max. Problems that aren't actually there on Ps4 Pro, which doesn't reach 60 FPS anyway, improving texture resolution only slightly. On the other hand, we did not appreciate the co-pilot's voice almost at all: too mechanical and repetitive, with intonations clearly snatched from a small sample and, for this reason, very little credible to the point of even becoming annoying in the most agitated situations.", "date": "2017-09-16", "grade": "7.5"}
