{"name": "Rail Simulator - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rail-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "little trains! Let's face it, who in front of a model railway has never fantasized absorbed and fascinated by the thousand playful possibilities offered by that interweaving of tracks and landscape elements? Complicated railway exchanges, streams and lakes made of colored aluminum foil, galleries skilfully dug into the papier-mch rock and then them: the trains! Scale models as small and hypnotic as they are expensive and delicate, capable of climbing the paths described in the artificial landscape and giving life to a real world. After all, perhaps this was the secret of these works: the fact of making us feel, in our small way, real gods capable of creating and defining the rules of a probable and plausible world. In short, in their small way they already succeeded in the intent followed - often without luck - by many video games of today and of the past: that of taking us to an alternative but concrete and coherent world within its context. Not without a touch of melancholy and curiosity, we therefore approached this Rail Simulator, an apparently niche title which, however, betrays far greater ambitions above all thanks to the game's publisher. That small EA - Electronic Arts - indeed suggests titles with decisive ambitions both in terms of presentation and, above all, of the market. Where do you want to go today? The itineraries that can be selected in the base game are Bath Green Park-Templecombe, York-New Castle, Paddington-Oxford and Hagen-Siegen, for a total of just under 2000 KM of rails. The second is good Rail Simulator, although it represents an unprecedented brand, is instead the second effort of the same group of developers who, under the Microsoft label, gave birth a few years ago to the first real railway simulator: Train Simulator, the iron and steam counterpart of the much more famous Flight Simulator. The possibilities offered by the title can roughly be divided into three areas. The free simulation, the possibility of playing within the rules defined by a scenario and the mode that allows us to create a real customized game scenario using a powerful editor. Let's say right away that the first real big disappointment of the game occurs right at the beginning, when once we move on to the selection of the railway lines already included in the game we find only 4 lines, three of which are English and one German. Of course we didn't expect a Naples-Portici, but let's say that we would have hoped for and somewhat expected the thrill of leaving from Milan Central Station or Tiburtina. We will just have to wait for the contribution of some loyal or, at most, wait for an almost secure paid add-on produced by third parties if not by Kuju programmers. The locomotives at our disposal will instead be 8 and cover a little the whole story from steam trains, passing through diesel and arriving at electric locomotives. The reproduction of the latter is obviously maniacal, so much so that, for example, when we get on a convoy of the German DB lines the commands on the dashboard of the locomotive will be in... German. In this regard, the control system of this Rail Simulator immediately appeared simple and able to satisfy both last-minute train drivers, perhaps more interested in the editing section of the scenarios, and more mischievous enthusiasts who instead try their hand at the simplified control mode, they will be able to choose to move freely inside the control cabin and will be able to press the buttons and move the levers directly by simulating the real gestures of the train drivers. Rail Simulator offers about twenty scenarios The second is good Of course, it must still be said that also thanks to the not very many driving notions required to be able to master a train (our railroad friends don't want it) soon everyone will be able to decide to try their hand at the expert driving model and therefore be able maneuver between steam injectors, speed inverters and sandboxes with great simplicity of use and above all, enormous and unexpected satisfactions. The game manual, although few words and rather sparse, still helps us, thanks to a certain number of summary tables which, in addition to summarizing the controls, will give us an initial smattering regarding the interpretation of signs and various symbols. Playing in expert mode, for example, we should pay attention to the AWS automatic warning systems and possibly react in the event of an acoustic andor visual alarm. Most of the time, the difficulties will not lie so much in driving as in having to extricate oneself between tracks, switches and couplings of various wagons. Overall, while hard to believe, even non-enthusiasts could risk itbe fascinated by all that series of more or less daily gestures that driving a train hides. The fact of having a moving vehicle weighing several hundred tons under one's control, at least the first few times, makes seemingly simple actions difficult and almost exciting, such as stopping, approaching the points or tackling a bend at full speed in downhill and maybe with ice on the rails. In case you get bored with the free mode - after all, talking about freedom in a game that takes place on tracks is practically an oxymoron - Rail Simulator offers about twenty scenarios capable of offering a rather varied and differentiated degree of challenge. We go from the difficult (and perhaps boring) job of storing wagons, passing through driving freight trains, up to the ever-present passenger lines and not forgetting even more or less plausible and out of the ordinary situations, such as the inauguration route of a line high speed or a very special ride in the middle of the Halloween night. We talked earlier about scenario editors, unfortunately all those who are already rubbing their hands thinking about the opportunity to recreate their favorite scenarios will risk being disappointed. Not so much due to the lack of customization options, but rather due to the fact that users are given - more or less - the same tools used by the developers to create the game and additional content. All this guarantees, on the one hand, a perfect and profound personalization of the game opportunities, but on the other hand, it precludes this possibility to all those who, like a model of Lima, would perhaps simply like to build a small game world for themselves. All of these will therefore only have to wait for the release of amateur or paid expansions. A bit like today it already happens for the Flight Simulator series. Steam and graphics From a technical point of view, Rail Simulator manages to defend itself quite well and, almost unexpectedly, it makes it pleasant to even simply watch the scenery go by as if we were on a real train. Especially in the free play mode, more than once you will find yourself lost navigating the various game views observing the details in the background. The game world is uploaded in streaming without interruptions and, even on systems that are certainly not of the latest generation, it manages to travel almost always fluidly and without uncertainties except in moments of greater crowding. To tell the truth, we would have expected something more from the quality - rather fluctuating - of the textures used to reproduce the interiors of the locomotives, so much so that, especially in high resolution, some writing or components may be difficult to read or in any case too grainy. Otherwise, expect the day/night cycle, variable weather conditions (complete with fog and ice) and a rather lively and plausible game world. The number of visuals available is quite numerous and, in addition to the more choreographic and accessory ones (such as the one showing the passengers of our carriages) there are also more purely technical visuals such as the 2D map of the track layout, complete with indication of exchanges, traffic lights and various control points. The game interface makes extensive use of unfortunately not customizable hot-keys, both for controlling the train and for managing warning messages or help panels regarding the current operating status. Furthermore, rather guiltyly, a replay and management function is missing. The audio, albeit subdued compared to everything else, does its job more than excellently by convincingly reproducing the railway experience with lots of support for the latest version of the EAX libraries. Manual and texts inside the game are entirely localized in Italian. Comment Rail Simulator seems to achieve most of its main goals. Able to thrill railway lovers and, incidentally, even the simply curious, the developers of Fund4Games can be proud of their work. Unfortunately the work seems to be only half successful, when we go to see the contents offered by Rail Simulator. The few railway lines offered, even if spread over several thousand KM of rails and, above all, the only 8 locomotives could disappoint enthusiasts who are not willing to possibly spend more money for probable new expansions, perhaps for a fee. There are also some rather inexplicable shortcomings such as replays or, more simply, the possibility of varying the speed of the passage of time. On balance, a good title with still room for improvementent, both from the point of view of completeness and usability. Even so, however, we would like to recommend it to all enthusiasts.
