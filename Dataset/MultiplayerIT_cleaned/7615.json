Despite a debut in three French, Italian and German languages, with a subsequent edition also in English, the game created by the transalpine company Rackham has not managed to establish itself within its market, populated by real sacred monsters that are certainly difficult to beat. When the company that created the game went into liquidation in 2010, the fate of Confrontation seemed doomed, but it was at that point that he surprisingly found his second youth, moving from real tables to videogame monitors. In fact, the French team Cyanide decided to make the rights of the entire universe its own to dedicate a video game to it, which was then released in 2012 with the same name. After gaining a quiet sufficiency also from the parts of Multiplayer.it, Confrontation has deserved a new investment, demonstrating that the plans of the Pro Cycling Manager developers were already looking beyond; precisely until this 2013, the year of release of Aarklash: Legacy, a new adventure within the world created by Rackham. At this point, the most attentive readers will surely remember the positive impressions gained during the testing phase and reported in the article published a few weeks ago, leaving us hopeful for the success of this new title. Whether or not the Confrontation brand will definitely navigate calmer waters will depend on the confirmations coming from the final version of Aarklash: Legacy. Tacticians have their match in Aarklash: Legacy! Aarkeche? In the Aarklash universe, a war is raging between the Darklords of Acheron and the Barons of Alahan. Like all protracted conflicts, this war carries significant costs that the warring factions have covered by borrowing from the Goldmonger Guild. There are many nobles who have lost all their possessions, in some cases refusing to pay the amount due in front of the so-called Wheel Swords, a group of expert mercenaries enlisted by the Goldmongers to collect debts. The story told in Aarklash: Legacy begins with what seems like a normal mission of a group made up of four Wheel Swords, who after having done their job in the territory of the Lions will find themselves outlaws, fleeing from those who now give them the hunting in every corner of the world. In its initial form, the basic group (which we have already known) is made up of the protagonists Nella, Wendaroo, Denzil and Knokka, who can be replaced according to one's tastes and styles of play by the other four controllable characters; the acquaintance with the first of these, Leck Lorus, takes place quite early in the adventure, thus allowing us to immediately practice other skills other than those of the initial poker. The types of heroes at our disposal see their characteristics adhere rather uniformly to the tradition of the classes usually present in fantasy-themed titles, while giving some members of the team some skills that make them a little more hybrid than the classic ~damage dealer~ or ~tank~, therefore increasing their ability to get away with different occasions. The type of game of Aarklash: Legacy, moreover, as we are about to see requires it. Violent punches To a superficial eye, Aarklash: Legacy could give the impression of a hack'n'slash without too much depth in the fights, but just spend a few minutes in the company of Nella and company to discover that the fundamental component of this game is tactics. The mechanics that make up the heart of the combat are reminiscent of those of Icewind Dale, offering the player an experience that is overall challenging, but never frustrating, even if losing a fight due to the series of events unleashed following a single mistake can be a deterrent, at least for some. Once the nature of Aarklash: Legacy is well understood, it becomes impossible not to appreciate the skill of Cyanide in managing to create a game that presents itself as quite difficult even at its normal level, while simultaneously managing to offer a combination of challenge and immersive combat seen on a few other occasions, especially in recent times. In addition to a hint system that accompanies the player with some useful advice, Aarklash: Legacy also allows us to recognize our mistakes, thus encouraging us to try again to pass the point where we fell. The tactical pause during battles is the moment in which to give orders to the various characters, with the possibility of also indicating to them a sequence of actions to be performed, for example by moving to a certain place before casting a spell with an area effect. Somene skills make the aspect related to the positioning of the user even more important, such as the main healing ability used by Wendaroo; a real projectile that adds energy points to anyone in front of it, enemies included. If the fabric of which Aarklash: Legacy is made is of excellent workmanship, the seams made by Cyanide to put everything together are a little less so. The role-playing elements are clearly below what it would be reasonable to expect: if the skill tree in which to spend the points acquired by the characters at each level up is without infamy and without praise, the system of finding objects and equipment looks decidedly sketchy. The weapons of the characters remain the ones we see in their endowment from the beginning, giving the player the option to choose only between elements such as necklaces, earrings and other types of frills, which in any role-playing game with a capital G would only serve as a side dish . The plot also suffers from the design line adopted by Cyanide, which after a while will almost be forgotten and fade into the background: perhaps it would have been enough to insert a few more cutscenes with interactive dialogues, to keep the interest high who is in front of the monitor against him. The inspiration is there and it shows From a technical point of view, Aarklash: Legacy proves to deserve several compliments, especially from a stylistic point of view. While some may see a mischievous nod to Diablo III in the overall use of bold colors, the quality of Cyanide's work is undeniable. In terms of performance, the engine generally behaves well, allowing the game to move easily even on slightly more dated configurations, net of some sporadic uncertainty which in some phases causes some slowdown even on high-end PCs. The protagonists show off a good level of care in the realization of their figure, a little less evident instead for the secondary characters. A soundtrack from the classic fantasy genre is accompanied by an appreciable spoken word in English, with which the voice actors are able to characterize the members of our party properly. Finally, a special mention for the interface designed by the developers, inherited to be honest largely from the classics of the genre, but with the merit of never being invasive while offering the player all the elements he needs on the screen.", "date": "2013-09-18", "grade": "7.8"}
