It is a monument to playability, an unusual overdose in these times of unbridled easy business. And we, although devastated by the impact, thank you. Otherwise who would get lost behind a graphics engine with an expressive force strongly limited by the ancient Renderware tool (or almost, look at Burnout 2)? With its woody players who proudly enter the field between rows of cardboard photographers, with its washed out colors, with its audience spread out in the stands, proud of its two animated frames, the engine seriously struggles to offer a visual spectacle worthy of the gameplay. But in the end, cui prodest? Once the diabolical Konamian device is activated, there is none left for anyone, and the desire to flirt with the joypad rages inexorably, burning flesh and polluting dreams. And we think back to Fifa, with its army of finely replicated competitions, teams and uniforms, to its apparently infallible business. PES 2 is by comparison a clochard sleeping on the sidewalks of Paris, but if you knew what this funny bum hides under his patched jacket This is real football, on consoles. It is an anarchist planet gone mad, uncontrollable, an inexhaustible box of wonders hungry for human input. KCET denies all imaginable frills to the player: many fictitious names, crippled club teams, Holland reduced to a numbered ~Orange~ which cancels any player identification process. The involution of the contour is so clear as to raise the playful nucleus of the Konamian atom to maximum power, which explodes with a devastating crash in the face of the videolpayer. And we, although devastated by the impact, thank... We Will Rock You After having seen the beautiful CG intro (entirely inherited from the Japanese version) with Freddie Mercury and his Queen, we arrive at the main menu, noting that in fact little has changed since last year. But strength and courage, we're not at a new EA Sports release. Finally it is possible to play customized tournaments between club teams, there are some new teams and stadiums and an even more appetizing master league mode: 3 divisions, an interesting player purchase / loan system, a sponge and a bucket. You will need the last ones for the liters of sweat you will have to pour on the turf (as well as on the aching keys of the dualshock). PES2 is tough stuff, the desire and ability to open new playful horizons, intrinsic values in the product in question, are granted only to those willing to invest a considerable amount of time and effort. So Sunday players, listless and frivolous should abstain, as it is practically impossible to benefit from all the qualities of the title without making the most of the schemes, formations and substitutions. Each footballer has his own values and makes his presence felt on the pitch, where the right person at the right time (and in excellent strength) can tip the balance of the match. But the most unsettling surprise, and which helps to generate the infinite sense of playful wonder, comes ball and chain. In no similar product is it possible to witness such realistic physics of the sphere: the sense of randomness represents the pivot on which the Konamian empire stands, a universe that not even the cpu can abstain from, and it is extraordinarily gratifying to see the computer run into embarrassing fouls or penalties. But of course nirvana is only reached in multiplayer, a field in which the Konami simulation reaches unimaginable and illuminating peaks. The daredevils can safely add two multitaps and seven friends, in this way a long neurovegetative state is guaranteed. PES 2 vs WE 6 Of course, PES 2 is not just marvel. The aforementioned graphics engine is not free from defects, although proud of its stainless 50fps and superfine animations, but the serious reasons for criticism emerge following a reasoned comparison with the Japanese twin, WE 6. Compared to the latter, PES2 is much more and much less than a simple conversion: much more for the commendable optimization work, aimed at definitively eliminating the slowdowns that afflicted the Japanese version (for myself a serious reason to prefer it to the latter), much less for certain unwelcome links with the European prequel, in this case the still annoying inertia (albeit much less marked) and a ball that is too light, which requires moderate management of shots on goal and passes. The reasons for these characteristics are unknown, why not offer us a WE 6 at 60Hz and without slowdowns? We will never know, what we have is ultimatelya hybrid between the pal and ntsc version, which however clearly enjoys the usual time delay from the japanese release; this implies a substantial parity between the two versions, even if the user is still clearly divided today. Compared to PES, on the other hand, the advantage is radical and unconditional, so much so that the title we loved last year is automatically useless and liquidable; but on the other hand, progress is worth some sacrifices...

In reality we are dealing with a deliberate terrorist attack on our precarious social life: no more work, girlfriend or friends (because you will lose them in bloody group sessions).
