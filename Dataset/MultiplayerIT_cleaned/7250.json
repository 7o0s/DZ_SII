Among the most anticipated titles of the year, this mech-based multiplayer shooter marks the debut of Respawn Entertainment after the abandonment of Infinity Ward by its most representative members, and can therefore count on the know-how and skills to establish new standards in the crowded vein of first person shooters. Against the backdrop of a terrible war involving two factions, on one side the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and on the other the Militia (respectively a mega-corporation and an armed group made up of rebels and bandits), the game puts us in play as a Pilot, an upgraded and highly selected soldier, in five competitive modes based on simply eliminating opponents rather than controlling the territory. ~Attrition~, the best option for beginners, offers for example a traditional team deathmatch, in which it is possible to face not only the Pilots of the opposing team but also a certain number of ~minions~ controlled by the artificial intelligence, all while waiting for the fearsome Titans to be projected from the sky, i.e. robots eight meters high and armed to the teeth. ~Survival Titan~ instead stands as the mech festival, with two teams of six players facing each other starting directly with a Titan and without respawn, to the best of five rounds. ~Domain Control Points~ represents the inevitable territorial mode, with three locations on the map that you have to conquer and control for as long as possible, totaling the points necessary to win the game, while ~Capture Flag~ reflects exactly what the name says . Finally, ~Cacciatore di Piloti~ stands as a variant of ~Attrition~ in which points are awarded only following the elimination of a Pilot. In the absence of a real single player campaign, the developers of Respawn Entertainent have also deemed it appropriate to include a series of missions (called ~Campaign~) which are practically like playlists and which first see us fight in the ranks of the IMC and then of the Militia, within matches that are completely similar to the traditional ones but which enjoy a specific introduction and a precise narrative thread. The prize for those who complete them is the unlocking of two additional Titans, Ogre and Strider, for use and consumption of the customization slots. The PC version of Titanfall is the best in definition and frame rate, but there are some perplexities From horizontal to vertical As mentioned at the beginning, the know-how of the former Infinity Wards is indisputable and the potential of Tifanfall in terms of pure gameplay is there for all to see. Taking a pinch of Crysis (the invisibility, climbing walls by leaping) and adding the best of what has been expressed so far from shooters where you pilot a mech, the developers have gone without fail and created a fun multiplayer experience , enjoyable, immediate but with numerous facets capable of rewarding skill and experience. In fact, a rich and competent offer in terms of weapons, skills and perks could not be missing, capable of opening up ample possibilities in terms of customization and therefore of defining the capabilities of our soldier based on the approach we prefer. A silent sniper who roams the highest rooftops, catching opponents off guard, or a two-legged rocket armed with a devastating shotgun, capable of killing with just a glance? Or still one of the many middle ground between these two extremes, with weapons able to lend themselves both to exchanges from medium distance and to face-to-face clashes? It is in these aspects of the experience that Titanfall gives its best, placing itself a step above the crowded and fierce competition thanks to an interpretation of the gameplay capable of adding verticality to the action, urging us to jump on walls and climb the as high as possible to be able to attack the Titans, deciding to advance aboard our mech or to fight alongside it, leaving the commands to the artificial intelligence, and resorting to precise strategies for every occasion. Clearly there are some perplexities, given that a team like Respawn Entertainment could certainly have also introduced some innovations regarding the methods, which are currently very traditional and devoid of innovative ideas. The question of the ~Campaign~ also appears very controversial: if you want to see the glass half full, themed playlists are welcome; but the position of those who expected a lot is also legitimateto more in this sense. Need a hand? If the Titanfall experience seems difficult to you and you still don't know what the best strategies are for winning, take a look at our special, in which the tactics that work best in the various game modes are analyzed and, in general, the philosophy behind the title branded Respawn Entertainment. The PC version Let's face it bluntly: on a purely technical front, the Xbox One version of Titanfall was half a disappointment. Based on a graphics engine with a good ten years on its back, however reworked, the game is striking for the quality of the design and for a whole series of touches of class, see for example the animations for entering the Titans based on the position of the Pilot , or the very rendering of the mechs and their ~weight~ on the battlefield, absolutely convincing. However, a certain behavior in terms of frame rate was expected from a multiplayer-based production and the former Infinity Wards have always been of the opinion that 60 frames per second are an essential element from this point of view, without however succeeding to get them on the new Microsoft console. All this despite the adoption of a bizarre resolution, those 1408 x 792 pixels which are neither meat nor fish and which we suppose were put there for a mere marketing issue, avoiding at all costs to offer yet another title to the public next gen which, however, only runs at 720p. In short, if you want to enjoy the Titanfall experience to the fullest, the PC version is an obligatory choice, even if even on the Windows platform everything is rosy, and indeed we believe a great opportunity has been wasted to dampen any discussion in the bud. Let's start with the good news: the resolution of 1080p (and beyond) guarantees substantially higher detail than what is available on Xbox One, especially in the presence of not very visible details. Furthermore, on NVIDIA cards, antialiasing (which on the Microsoft console stops at 2X MSAA) can reach 16X Q CSAA without any particular impact on performance, clearly depending on the configuration. The draw distance dial does offer some additional scalability, but setting it to maximum doesn't really make any difference to the console version. Similarly, the quality of the assets seems the same and PC owners will be happy to know that to use the ~insane~ level textures it is not necessary - as instead officially reported - to have a video card with 3 GB of RAM, since with the GTX 770 Jetstream 2GB we had no problem handling them. Another crucial aspect is the frame rate: we can say that the problems encountered on Xbox One are not present on personal computers, but nevertheless some considerations must be made. Firstly, disabling v-sync causes rather marked tearing (as reported by many owners of the Microsoft console), a problem that in our case we could only solve by setting the adaptive vsync from the NVIDIA control panel. In this way the frame rate was locked at 60 fps, but at that point a second problem arose which seems to depend on the limitations of the Source as regards the exploitation of multicore processors and, therefore, compatibility with AMD CPUs. This translates into substantial drops in fluidity during the most agitated situations, drops that Intel processor owners generally do not experience. There is no doubt that this depends on the CPU, in the sense that we tried to adjust the settings in various ways to try to obtain a stable frame rate, but we only managed to lower the quality of the shadows and ragdolls, i.e. the physical complexity of character animations upon deletion. As admitted by Richard Baker, technical director of Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall uses a very old version of Havok for the physical calculation and it was therefore impossible to expect an optimization from a multicore perspective in this sense. Thankfully foregoing advanced shadows and ragdoll isn't as extreme a compromise as opting for lower texture quality or lower resolution would have been, but nevertheless there remains a bit of a bitter taste for a production of this caliber that gets lost in the proverbial glass of water. Beyond the engine, a second problem with the PC version of Titanfall derives from the unholy decision to use almost 50 GB of space, 35 GB of which for audio only in uncompressed format and in various different languages. The game on Xbox One occupies 14 GB and uses compressed audio, which is fully compatible with the nature of the product, therefore the choiceRespawn's choice in this sense seems absurd to us, all the more so for the reasons given, namely the intention to make the game usable even on medium-range configurations. Seriously? Use an engine that doesn't take advantage of multicore processors and then try to make do with 35 GB of uncompressed audio, without giving users the choice? Many SSD owners, including the writer, have been forced to delete a lot of data to make room for the game installation files, and unfortunately there are currently no ~workarounds~ to solve the problem: a possible deletion of ~useless~ elements would lead to their subsequent restoration via Origin. As far as the controls are concerned, purists of the mouse / keyboard combo will have no problem managing their Pilot in this way, but equally those who prefer the Xbox 360 controller will be faced with an identical layout to that of the Xbox 360 edition console, thanks to a well-balanced calibration and able to guarantee a more than decent competitiveness in online matches. Speaking of online, we found the matchmaking system fast and effective, with low average latencies, lots of players and the ability to select servers based on geographic area for better performance.", "date": "2014-03-17", "grade": "8.5"}
