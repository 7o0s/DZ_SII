{"name": "7 Days: Salvation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/7-days-salvation.html", "text": "Clearly inspired by the Silent Hill series, 7 Days: Salvation is a three-dimensional adventure in which we take on the role of a writer who suddenly finds himself trapped in his home, struggling to distinguish what is true from what is not. The servants have gone away and left him alone, but there is someone else within those walls and his presence soon becomes clear. It's just that these aren't normal people... After a few stages of the game, in fact, exploration will also give way to physical confrontation with terrifying creatures, using different objects or taking advantage of hiding places to escape the clash. There are seven chapters that follow each other and represent the seven days in which Salvator Ken will have to survive his nightmares, trying to save himself. The game structure is typical of survival horror, with our character moving in three directions within scenarios which in this case are not pre-rendered but calculated in real time and made up of polygons. A calling card in many ways astounding, given that there aren't many fully 3D applications on mobile phones and perhaps it would have been easier to adopt the strategy of two-dimensional and static locations. It is clear that controlling our good writer using the joystick in this context could prove to be at least inconvenient, but in reality the developers have worked in such a way as to make movement simple, limiting as much as possible the feeling of ~cumbersome~, especially when the shots change (the control system is relative to the screen). Using the function keys, we can access a map at any time that shows us the rooms of the house divided by floor, but without providing us with information on the places we have already explored and leaving us with the task of remembering where we have been. At least the ~where to go~ is not a problem: the game takes us by the hand, and through the considerations of the character suggests where to go. Around the scenarios we can collect notes, medicines, weapons or key objects, and identifying them is simple since they ~flash~ on the screen. The resolution of the puzzles is often linked to the combination of two objects, which once it has taken place starts a sequence that shuffles the cards on the table and sets us a new goal to achieve. We will often find ourselves wandering around in a sort of alternative dimension, which distorts the normal appearance of the house or completely distorts it, gaining more and more ground as the ~days~ go by. The game's graphics are in 4:3, so we'll have to hold the phone horizontally, and all actions must be performed by pressing the 5 key only. So we'll use it to collect objects but also to fight and interact with the setting. On a technical level, as mentioned, we are really faced with a nice surprise. It is clear that this new production by Dingoo Games needs a high-end device to work at its best, but compared to other 3D titles it appears decidedly ~mature~, with good direction and innovative ideas (hide in a wardrobe and watch from the loophole one's enemy who wanders around the room but doesn't find us, for example). The graphics engine is optimized to give the best depending on the characteristics of the mobile phone, and features somewhat simple but well-characterized polygonal models, also equipped with good animation. The same can be said for the scenarios, which are quite detailed and convincing. The general atmosphere is good, thanks also to a sound sector that has never been so complete, in particular thanks to the well-made sampled effects. Finally, volume adjustment can be done independently from the telephone.
