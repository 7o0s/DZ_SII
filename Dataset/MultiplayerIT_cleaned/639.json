Obviously the first represents the fulcrum of the game: under the command of Ippo and his companions, we will have to face a large number of boxing matches to climb the rankings and become champions in the various weight categories. Between one meeting and another we will be able to watch long, very long animated sequences (in real time) that are used to show us everything that happens to the characters in the manga. With a little patience and endurance, given the not exactly excellent technical stature of the cutscenes in question, it is possible to notice the fidelity with which typical situations of sports manga ~Mitsuru Adachi~ are reproduced on the screen: meetings in bars, evening walks (complete with characteristic noises), verbal challenges with opponents and so on. It is really a pity that the developers have not made these ~non-interactive~ sections more compelling, perhaps thanks to a technical realization that is up to the task. Even the fact that the numerous speeches are simply textual (in English) and not even spoken contributes to making these interludes boring, so much so that one almost immediately skips them to proceed to the meeting of the case. The second game mode, the tournament, allows us to organize a knockout competition of variable difficulty and highly customizable, both because of the high number of characters available (each with its own characteristics), and for the complete control it is given to us on matches: it is possible to act on some parameters that tangibly condition what happens in the ring. Victorious Boxers 2 offers a simulation approach rather than an arcade one, with the fighters facing each other without the aid of energy bars. Game mode [C] Our Hippo is the perfect breed. still winner! By the way, &ldquo;Ippo&rdquo; a great name... Hit! Finding the right moment to land a blow is not an easy task. simple. It's You can control as many as seventy boxers! [/C] Combat system As anticipated at the beginning, Victorious Boxers 2 offers a simulation rather than an arcade approach, with the fighters facing each other without the aid of energy bars. This lack forces us to resort to a pinch of strategy and to ~sacrifice~ numerous encounters to familiarize ourselves with the control system and shots before reaching awareness of what happens in the square. With the four primary keys of the Dual Shock 2 it is possible to deliver jabs and hooks, but the same blows are modified (and transformed into uppercuts) if one of the back keys is held down simultaneously. The blows also change according to our position: if we throw a right hook immediately after dodging in that direction, the punch has more power. In some cases, and with some characters, it is also possible to use a special move, in this case a sort of ~bullet time~ which allows us to have full control of the fight for a few moments, in order to be able to place a winning shot. This type of punch is very complicated to obtain, as an unfavorable position or the opponent's arms often prevent us from obtaining a full impact, and it is no coincidence that a few deep punches work much more than dozens thrown badly. This is the key to solving clashes: dodging effectively is really difficult, so you have to try to prevent the enemy from hitting us well and find the right moment to place blows. Depending on the character we command, our resistance to throws varies: the technical KO generally occurs when we go down three times in a round, but once we run out of energy we end up not getting up even on the first throw, perhaps after having spent two or three rounds beating them up. In this regard, it must also be said that the game has a very particular difficulty setting: some opponents are truly formidable; others, perhaps stronger on paper, turn out to be easy targets for our direct right. In any case, the number of fights is really high and keeps you busy for a good number of hours. [C] The guard, unfortunately, is; far from effective. One of the very rare CG sequences! Sometimes it also happens to do training sessions... [/C] Technical realization As already mentioned in the speech on the cutscenes, the graphics of Victorious Boxers 2 do not cry out for a miracle. On the contrary, it turns out to be decidedly sparse and not up to the current productions for PS2: although the polygonal models used for the fighters show a good levelof detail, the same cannot be said for all the rest: the sports halls and arenas that form the backdrop to the fights are bare and dull, with a horrendous audience (of ~silhouettes~, in the true sense of the word) and repetitive in forms. During the animated sequences there is greater attention to detail and the scenarios are decidedly more varied, but the final result is still insufficient. The sound commentary reflects in many ways what happens for the graphic sector: the music is anonymous, while the effects are decidedly inappropriate. More than a boxing match, they look like they belong in a movie with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill! The typical noises of slapping in B-series productions can be distinguished Comment It is very complicated to formulate a ~right~ judgment for Victorious Boxers 2. It is a technically poor title, which however offers a respectable level of challenge and a mechanic that rewards experience and strategy, with an eye towards the alertness of reflexes. Considering the competitive price (this product belongs to a budget line), it is certainly a recommended purchase if you like boxing games, bearing in mind however that it pales in front of the best exponents of the genre. Pros: Many opponents to face or use in tournaments Engaging game mechanics Simulation approach, which rewards strategy Cons: Technically mediocre Boring animated sequences Difficulty not always well calibrated Based on the manga ~Hajime no Ippo~, published in the 90s in Japan but still unpublished in Italy, Victorious Boxers 2 is a tie-in that does not disdain the simulation approach to the genre. The story behind the game faithfully follows the events narrated in the comic, with the protagonist (Ippo Makunoichi) and his training partners facing dozens of matches to reach the top of their category.", "date": "2006-01-24", "grade": null}
