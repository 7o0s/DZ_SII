{"name": "Judgment", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/judgment-recensione.html", "text": "Judgment, the long-awaited Yakuza spin-off subject of this review, stands as an experiment of great importance for SEGA. In fact, we are talking about the first recent production by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio which includes a double audio track, with dialogues in Japanese and English subtitled in Italian, which breaks down the now historic language barrier that has unfortunately kept many users away from the extraordinary adventures of Kazuma Kiryu. Secondly, as mentioned, it is a spin-off that reuses the well-known fictitious scenario of Kamurocho (inspired by the Kabukicho district of Tokyo) to tell a completely new story, written by Toshihiro Nagoshi himself, with new characters very well characterized, a perfect direction and many twists and turns. The protagonist of the game is Takayuki Yagami, a lawyer who decides to leave the profession following a traumatic event: three years earlier he defended a boy accused of murder and managed to get him acquitted against all odds, but the same person then committed a heinous crime. With his reputation ruined and disappointed by his naivety, Takayuki left the law firm where he worked to open a small detective agency together with his lifelong friend Masaharu Kaito, a former Yakuza with gruff ways but a noble soul. The two make ends meet by accepting any type of assignment, moving in a gray area far from the rigidity and bureaucracy that govern the courtrooms ... until a particular murder case does not capture their attention: there is a killer at Tokyo killing its victims by gouging out both their eyes. Setting: Kamurocho has never looked so good After years of very pleasant experience with the Yakuza series, we can say with full knowledge of the facts that the brand boasts a great protagonist beyond its main characters: the Kamurocho scenario. As mentioned, it is a setting inspired by real places, which over time has undergone numerous changes and enrichments, arriving at the appointment with Judgment in its best form. In fact, the latest version of the Dragon Engine runs at 30 frames per second and on PlayStation 4 Pro it struggles a bit in some situations, but it is a small price to pay for so much atmosphere, so much beauty and a absolutely unprecedented degree of interaction. Previously closed places can now be explored freely, several buildings have practicable stairs to climb up to the roofs, visible due to the drone that is part of our equipment in the game and which in several cases we will have to use to identify certain people who are perhaps on the second floor of a building, closed in his office. All the activities are accessible in a transparent way, without loading, and this time they have an achievement system that encourages, for example, to try all the dishes on the menu of every single restaurant, play with all the coin-ops present in the inevitable SEGA Clubs (in this case Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Puyo Puyo, Motor Raid, Fighting Vipers and the shooter Kamuro of the Dead, as well as the usual UFO Catcher), earn a nest egg in the secret casino playing Blackjack or Poker, do a few games of Mahjong and shogi, two swings at the battling center or a darts match. At the headquarters of Takayuki's agency there is also a real pinball machine, while the karaoke bars and strategic mini-games based on the management of cabaret clubs or on the conquest of territories with your own gang of thugs are missing. Not bad: from a certain point in the campaign onwards, you can improvise as a host and entertain girls and/or ladies looking for male company in a real dating sim for a fee, participate in competitions between drones and try a sort of game of the virtual goose that includes many prizes and challenges to be overcome by force. However, this abundance only represents a part of the Judgment experience, the more frivolous and carefree one, if we like, which however manages to translate the reality of a visit to Kabukicho or the narrow alleys of the Golden Gai onto the screen in a surprisingly faithful way (here called Champion District). Shooting in the evening, with the many illuminated signs reflecting in the puddles (the game makes use of screen space reflections) and the people walking around, is fantastic. Something is inevitably lost during the day, but the developers have been able to play with the lighting system to give a certain depth to the landscapes even during the day. Gameplay: Like Yakuza, more than Yakuza? Judgment shares setting, graphics engine and gameplay with the Yakuza series: it's like all the charactershad already been replaced leaving the basic mechanics intact, including the traditional structure that mixes an engaging and impactful narrative, acted in the cutscenes with conviction in both Japanese and English (a very nice surprise), with exploration and combat sequences. On the street we will not fail to meet the usual hangers-on, shady guys, bullies and assorted criminals who will challenge us to a duel and which we will be able to take down using two different fighting styles: that of the Crane, more agile and devoted to acrobatics, designed for melees; and that of the Tiger, more consistent and able to open any guard, ideal for one-on-one clashes and boss fights. An abundance of objects can be used as improper weapons: from traffic cones to signs, passing through the inevitable bicycles, and once the fury bar is filled we will be able to activate devastating special moves which on the one hand recycle a lot of finishers from Kazuma Kiryu's repertoire, on the other they introduce new, hilarious and/or painful contextual actions. Orphaned since he was a boy, Takayuki had to learn to defend himself from a young age and that is why he masters martial arts, but as a fighter he is very different from the aforementioned Kazuma, probably less strong overall but capable of bouncing off walls to launch ferocious attacks , perform somersaults and pirouettes that make the duels truly spectacular, although perhaps a little less consistent in terms of impact performance. However, we are talking about nuances that are placed in a framework of excellence, which increases the degree of challenge in order to make each battle more devoted to strategy and slow down the release of capabilities that make life too easy for us. In fact, forget the very rapid boosts for attack and health, but above all welcome the so-called mortal wounds: if an enemy were to hit us with a weapon or with special techniques, a part of the energy bar will become unusable and to restore it in its entirety we will have to necessarily use a first aid kit or visit a clandestine doctor who works in the sewers. It is no longer possible to use the numerous drink vending machines located along the roadsides, but the restaurants and convenience stores will certainly be right for you if you want to fill your stomach and recover your strength: an important novelty for an aspect of the experience that only has recently been enhanced. In any case, the differences with Yakuza are obviously not limited to these elements: Takayuki is a private investigator and various unpublished activities have been created around his profession for the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio series. Assassin's Creed-style stalking, the creation of photographic evidence that is somewhat reminiscent of the first Dead Rising, the analysis of finds similar to Batman: Arkham but on a two-dimensional basis, the chase sequences with quick time events a la Shenmue, the aforementioned explorations with the drone, minigames for picking locks and electrical devices, multiple choice questions during interrogations or common interactions with NPCs, the recognition of very similar suspects and not least the Phoenix Wright-style mechanism where you have to select the right test to prove a thesis. Not all of these activities are equally pleasant, for example in the early stages of the campaign you find yourself stuck in a room looking for a code and it takes some time to figure out how to get it, but fortunately these are small parentheses that affect the desire for a general renewal of the gameplay. Of course, one shouldn't expect too much from this experimentation: the tools available to the protagonist are called up during specific situations, investigations that proceed in a linear manner and which therefore present the various minigames as simple puzzles, sometimes a bit trivial, which have the only intended to further support the element of storytelling, which also remains central to this spin-off. Playstation 4 trophies Judgment includes 47 Trophies: some of them are obtained simply by completing the chapters of the campaign, but most of the achievements are linked to the secondary activities of the large sandbox at our disposal. There are objectives related to interaction with restaurants and shops, others that are unlocked by completing minigames, still others by raising the level of friendship with the various PGNs present in Kamurocho. Structure and technical realization We were talking about Takayuki Yagami's investigative profession: not only were the new gameplay mechanisms just described created around it, but also an unprecedented way of intendo the side missions. In fact, if in the role of Kazuma Kiryu it happened to come across some strange character by chance and then follow his story by deciding to help him, in Judgment there are different ways to access this type of optional stories, for example by obtaining specific assignments indicated in our hideout or assigned to us by friends and acquaintances. Don't be afraid: the taste for the absurd and the traditional Japaneseness of the situations are not lacking even this time, and so you will happen to chase a toupee that flutters through the streets in order to bring it back to its rightful owner, catch a dangerous thief of panties, escort a woman and her daughter to defend them from an apparently abusive husband, take revenge on a bar owner who defrauds her customers by dramatically inflating the bill and threatening those who don't want to pay, help a restaurant owner free himself from the threat of a mafia clan and so on. We note the great care taken in the realization of these subquests, which unlike some episodes of Yakuza are never too short and trivial, therefore they have something to say and remain well impressed. Moreover, they contribute to substantially enriching a structure that can offer over 70 hours of content between main and secondary quests, and which you will hardly be able to exhaust in its thirteen chapters in less than half the time, even if you leave out the bulk of the collateral activities. In short, we are talking about an extraordinarily full-bodied experience, which will keep you company for a long time and which you can approach without fearing anything even if you have never played an episode of Yakuza before. Indeed, considering the narrative independence of the game from the adventures of Kazuma Kiryu and the aforementioned presence of Italian subtitles, as well as the double audio in Japanese and English, Judgment stands as the perfect title to get closer to this fascinating universe and visit the streets of Kamurocho, as mentioned never so suggestive, detailed and full of possible interactions. Graphically, an extraordinary enrichment and finishing work has been done which makes us turn a blind eye to the fact that the developers have reused a setting that has already been seen over and over again. In terms of effects, the Dragon Engine has never been so sophisticated and almost all the characters boast a very strong aesthetic characterization, thanks obviously to a well-done motion capture and with great attention to even the smallest details. There are some recycled animations, see for example several special moves, but otherwise the assets of Yakuza have been renewed a lot and it becomes clear after a short time. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent: with a great atmosphere, perfectly calibrated to the situations, stylish and captivating when necessary.", "date": "2019-06-20", "grade": "8.4"}
