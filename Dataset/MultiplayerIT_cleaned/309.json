{"name": "Ace Combat: The Belkan War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ace-combat-the-belkan-war.html", "text": "Take off! The game structure of The Belkan War does not differ from that of the other episodes of Ace Combat: an animated introduction, which in this case uses scenes filmed with real actors instead of using the excellent computer graphics seen in Ace Combat 5 (unfortunately) , plunges us into the serious atmosphere of the conflict, in which we will play the role of protagonists. By accessing the Campaign mode, a detailed briefing will show us what to do mission by mission, with an account of the air and ground objectives, as well as the strategic significance of the entire maneuver. At this point we will be able to decide to take the field, after having selected our aircraft among those available and having equipped it with a primary and a secondary heavy weapon; or we can enter the hangar and use the money earned by completing previous missions to buy new vehicles and new weapons, unlockable and available for purchase as you progress through the game. Once in flight, Ace Combat: The Belkan War does not differ at all from the other episodes of the series: the control is precise and, within limits, sufficiently realistic, with the possibility of turning both in the traditional way (by tilting the plane) than through yaw, less fast to perform but important in situations where you need to be precise in framing the target. Situations that will not fail to present themselves after a few stages, and which in fact differentiate TBW from its predecessors: you will meet some really strong enemies, who will always manage to evade your attack maneuvers and who will often put you in difficulty, so much so that knocking them down will produce excitement unprecedented in the series. [C] The indications on the screen give us a complete picture of the situation. As usual, in Ace Combat the planes are reproduced in an exceptional way. Inside the hangar there is a You can buy new fighters and new weapons. [/C] Control system and missions As anticipated, the control system of Ace Combat: The Belkan War is characterized by great precision. The commands are the usual: left analog stick to tilt the plane in the four directions, right stick deputed to the pilot's gaze only, primary back buttons used to accelerate and brake, where the secondary ones are deputies to yaw to the right and left. The main buttons of the Dual Shock 2 control weapons, while the Select button equips the main or secondary weapon. Finally, the directional cross is used to give orders to your flight companions, who unfortunately will only rarely be able to impose themselves on the enemy. The game starts with the first-person view and on-screen prompts, but you can switch between a view from inside the cabin and one from behind the plane. The latter significantly changes the approach to the game, which takes on decidedly more arcade contours and lends itself to a somewhat different experience. Namco developers have invested heavily in building a realistic and convincing storyline, which motivates the player and gives meaning to the missions; but it is also true that the game can be tackled without listening to a single word of the briefings, given that generally it is enough to eliminate all the objectives (in some cases by escorting a friendly vehicle) to successfully complete each stage. However, the possibility of sometimes choosing the mission is nice, in a sort of crossroads procedure that increases the replayability value of the product. Technical realization This new Ace Combat is aesthetically unchanged compared to the fifth episode, which however could boast of animated sequences of exceptional quality, replaced in this case by a few filmed scenes and many (useless) graphics. A step back in this sense, then. For the rest, the photorealistic quality of the backdrops remains, quite defined, as well as the impeccable realization of the planes. During replays, the graphics are embellished with a ~glow~ effect that adds more appeal to the polygonal models. As far as the sound sector is concerned, it is composed as usual of excellent music, which effectively underlines the action and gives drama. Unlike the speech, which is rather flat although characterized by a good level of acting, with sentences in English and subtitles in Italian. Nothing else to report. [C] The mode for two players in split screen. The quality of the seabed & egrave; a distinctive feature of Ace Combat for years. Probably The Belkan War is; the episode more challenging of the saga. [/C] Comment We are faced with a good episode of Ace Combat, characterized by a technical realization equal to that of Ace Combat 5 but renewed in terms of the challenge, which in some cases proves to be really demanding. In this sense, The Belkan War is completely new and brings new situations into being, such as the frantic search for an enemy who manages to escape our attacks and who knows exactly when it's time to fire. The large number of missions, planes and weapons available do the rest, together with a multiplayer mode with split screen (no online) that will not fail to satiate your appetite for challenges with friends. However, episode zero of Ace Combat also plays the role of ~alarm bell~, given the low degree of innovation compared to the other titles in the series: Namco must necessarily commit to renewing the product for the next occasion possibly on PS3, so as not to be reduced to copying itself. Pros: Technically sound In some cases very, very addictive Large number of missions, planes and weapons Cons: Very little new No online play Lack of animation sequences Usually the episode ~Zero~ tells the background of a story that perhaps has been developing for some time, through several chapters. This is also the case for Ace Combat: The Belkan War, set in the mid-90s of an alternate reality to ours (but not that much) in which a principality manages to strengthen its army secretly and later declares war on all nations neighboring, to expand their territory. We are part of a peacekeeping force, with the task of liberating the occupied areas through eighteen missions marked by breathtaking dogfights.", "date": "2006-10-30", "grade": null}
