Developed once again by Traveller's Tales, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian takes up the mechanics already seen in the first episode, however alternating the exploratory phases and puzzles we were used to with purely action sections, such as the one that opens the game and shows a furious battle between the army of Narnia and the Telmarines. At first, therefore, we will not find ourselves controlling the Pevensie brothers, but a well-assorted group of creatures of clear magical origin: a minotaur, a centaur, an elf and a gnome. We will be able to switch from one character to another by simply pressing the Triangle button when we are close to a companion, and use the rest of the Dual Shock 3 controls for offensive maneuvers, for special abilities and for interacting with the environment. After the first combos, it will be clear that the goal to be achieved in each stage is not the annihilation of the numerous enemy troops, but the resolution of distinct sections, which can be accessed by activating switches or opening doors. In this case, the special abilities that each character is equipped with will come in handy: the gnome can use a grappling hook to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, the elf can use a bow to hit opponents but also ~switches~ placed at improbable heights, the minotaur can jump on the backs of giants to control their movements, etc. Each scenario is full of silver fragments to collect, as well as keys: a special indicator will show us how many we have at any time, because we will often find ourselves faced with chests that can only be opened if we have the ~requisites~ to do so. Each of them hides bonuses and extras that can be accessed from the start screen. After the first combos, it will be clear that the goal to be achieved in each stage is not the annihilation of the numerous enemy troops, but the resolution of distinct sections. The return to Narnia After this first phase, we will find the Pevensie brothers on the beach that the magic horn has chosen as the point of arrival for their return to Narnia, and we will have to explore their caves in search of the magical objects and weapons that Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy possessed before returning to their world. In this case, the exploratory elements and above all the puzzles firmly re-emerge, which, as in the first episode, must be solved by using the various characters and their characteristics in the best possible way. We will have to resort to torches, light fires and activate numerous switches to regain possession of our arsenal, preparing ourselves for the events that will occur later and which will see the four brothers join Caspian and his faithful subjects to organize the assault on the troops of Miraz. The developers have included a large number of puzzles to solve, just like in the tie-in of the first film, and there is no shortage of variety: in addition to the various buttons and switches, we will find ourselves attracting wild beasts to open passages in the forest, we will have to overcome sections with a certain timing and find the best way to destroy enemies seemingly out of reach. The latter stages of the game pick up on the earlier ones, in the sense that battles rage again involving hundreds of soldiers on screen at the same time. Even in that case, however, our goal will be to resolve isolated situations so that our troops can get the upper hand. Technical realization The producers of the game were keen to show the number of characters in motion during the action phases, and in this sense this tie-in turns out to be quite spectacular. Analyzing the graphics in more detail, however, we realize that the models of the soldiers are far from extraordinary, that the fixed view (it is not possible to rotate it, only ~move~ it a little in the four directions) too often represents a strong limit and that there are numerous problems affecting the rendering of polygons. The action is fluid as long as the scenery remains still, after which there are quite dramatic drops in frame-rate and some noticeable image tearing. Inside the caves, the lighting effects suffer from interpenetration with the environment: if you approach a wall with a torch, it passes through it and with it its light. The action phases and the combat system suffer from a general lack of sensation of impact: whatever the power of a combo (and fighting on horseback should be the best at this juncture), you don't have the feeling to really hit the enemies, also thanks to a collision detection that leaves something to be desired. As for the sound sector, we have fairly good quality music and effectsa, accompanied by a good dubbing in Italian. The presence of numerous sequences taken from the film, clearly in high definition, will surely delight Narnia fans. Comment The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is basically a decent tie-in, whose mechanics resume what was good with the previous episode. The inclusion of a certain number of action phases, on the scenario of spectacular battles, was a must in order to make appropriate use of the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 3, which however remain largely underexploited, given the quality of the polygonal models but above all the presence of a fixed camera (very limiting) and problems of various kinds (drop in frame rate, tearing, interpenetration, etc.). The combat system appears immature and confusing, unfortunately, and beating dozens of opponents simultaneously does not produce particular satisfaction, it does not return the necessary sensation of ~impact~ typical of fighting games. The exploratory phases and the puzzles show a very different cure, fortunately, but the adventure is still too short and simple to please experienced gamers. We are therefore dealing with a product dedicated to the youngest, therefore, who will be able to relive the emotions of the film but without expecting too much in terms of fun and involvement. Pros Well done puzzle sections A large number of extras to unlock Great for young movie fans Cons Too short and easy Technically below average Inadequate action stages", "date": "2008-09-16", "grade": null}
