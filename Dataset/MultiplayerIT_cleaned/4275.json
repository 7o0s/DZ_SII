But the graphics are certainly not the strong point of the Metalhead title, which maintains the deformed style of the first chapter by focusing the spotlight on the evolution of the gameplay, on the humorous style and on the more concrete innovations concerning online multiplayer and extensive customization. Homebase Jack! The caricature graphics, the slides and humorous animations are an important part of the identity of Super Mega Baseball 2, a title that in some ways recalls some feature films in computer graphics by Dreamworks, but they are not indicators of the depth of the gameplay. The players, it must be said, move a little faster than a human can do in the flesh, but the physics are realistic, the jumps are not extreme and the pace of the game closely resembles that of a real baseball game. Super Mega Baseball 2, despite the high-sounding name that recalls some old Japanese glory, is a real baseball game, certainly not a simulation like MLB The Show but still capable of satisfying both the casual player and the enthusiast. Even the first of the two, however, must take the time to learn at least the basic rules that revolve around a playing field divided into two parts. The most important one, called diamond, owes its name to the position of the four bases that delimit it and which can be occupied, proceeding counterclockwise, by the attacking team. For this to happen, the batter, who is positioned on home plate, must be able to make a valid hit, preventing the pitcher from hitting the catcher's mitt and making a strike. If the batter suffers three strikes he is out and risks ending up there even by missing the ball or causing it to go out of the valid playing area several times. If, on the other hand, he manages to hit the ball correctly, he can run towards the base that is on his right and can occupy it unless the opponents catch the ball he has just hit on the fly or fail to throw it to one of the defenders occupying the base towards which she is running before I can catch up with her. All this, which includes various other mechanics such as feints and bunted balls, revolves around whether or not the runners are able to complete the full circle of the diamond, obtaining a point each each time they reach the starting area which is not by chance called home base. And it is a difficult path unless a batter manages to hit the so-called home run, the queen move of baseball, which sees the batted ball leave the field of play allowing all runners in the field to score without the opponents being able to anything to stop them. In any case, however, once three strikers are eliminated, the roles of the two teams are reversed and when both rounds of attack are concluded, an inning is closed, the unit into which baseball games are divided. Xbox One goals Super Mega Baseball 2's thousand points are tied to a wide variety of objectives including online activities, campaign, customization and gameplay mastery. Some achievements require more time and patience to be unlocked, but the bulk of the points up for grabs depends on the player's skill level, both in hitting the ball and in defeating the artificial intelligence at the highest difficulty levels. A diamond in the rough The duel between offense and defense is the most representative moment of baseball, at least in the popular imagination, and it is also in Super Mega Baseball 2, with the player who finds himself cyclically covering the role of pitcher and hitter. In the role of the first we find ourselves on the pitching mound, an area located exactly sixty feet and six inches from home plate, and before throwing the ball we can choose which type of pitch to make, going from the more direct fast ball to the slower and less predictable one. curveball. Once the approach has been chosen, which can be varied by applying different modifiers with the directional cross, all that remains is to decide the position of the cursor and counterbalance the automatic movement that occurs while we load the launch with the appropriate key. The aim is to pitch as little centrally as possible without leaving the strike zone, and the approach taken by Super Mega Baseball 2 makes the pitching dynamics much more fun and varied than they are in the vast majority of baseball titles out there.nts. And the same goes for the serving phase, with a position indicator that automatically moves towards the ball, even if it can be influenced by the player to alter the trajectory, and suggests when it's the right time to press the key to hit it. When this happens, the challenge moves to the rest of the field and, as often happens in baseball games, the action keys of the pad, arranged in a rhombus, correspond to the bases of the diamond, allowing us to choose with a click which one to direct the ball towards if we are in defense or a specific runner if we are in attack. But this approach isn't as intuitive as it might seem, as it collides with less than perfect responsiveness of the controls, with the not always consistent behavior of the artificial intelligence and with the need to choose a specific player or charge a power bar to launch the ball as fast as possible towards the desired position. Over time, however, the problems fade into the background, leaving us with a gameplay that gives us a lot of satisfaction and enhances substitutions thanks to an excellent morale and fatigue management system. Throwing the runner towards a base at the right moment or stopping an opponent's action on the line are important moments that in Super Mega Baseball 2 can give as much satisfaction as hitting a home run, and this is undoubtedly one of the most evident indicators of the commitment made by Metalhead in the development of a title that maintains a perfect balance between simplicity and realism. All topped off with a difficulty selector that allows you to calibrate the challenge to the millimeter, from complete customization that compensates for the absence of any license and from the online novelty that also includes the cooperative in two against the CPU. Too bad for the too many similarities between the few stadiums available and for the cross-play which, as usual, doesn't work between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but these are minor notes for a title that stands a step above the first chapter and earns a place in the sun in the panorama of baseball titles.", "date": "2018-05-08", "grade": "8.5"}
