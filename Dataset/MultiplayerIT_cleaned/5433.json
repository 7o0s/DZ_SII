Usually, however, you go to Milan or Rome during the day, heading towards an office with a few test consoles/PCs where at most you have the possibility of interviewing a developer after having tested the game in question (often the interview takes place via Skype or similar programs). It rarely happens to see particularly pompous or luxurious events in our area, therefore, much less if the title in question is a game for tablets or mobile phones, in spite of the money that goes around in the field. So imagine our amazement when we met in La Spezia on the deck of the legendary Amerigo Vespucci, to try out a simulator for mobile devices called Marina Militare Italian Navy Sim. We know that it is not easy to distract the mind from the length of the title, but we are still talking about a game completely made in Italy by RORTOS, with the approval of the Italian Navy, and capable of at least partially overturning our preconceptions on mobile gaming. In fact, it seems that there is a lot of market for simulators in this sector and that among the developers there are very few teams able to compete with this Italian software house. We got on the Amerigo Vespucci to try out the new RORTOS simulator: here is our review Surfing on land The choice of the Amerigo Vespucci, in addition to being suggestive, was certainly not accidental: in fact, the latest RORTOS simulator even allows you to navigate with a virtual version of the splendid school ship, which has just celebrated its 85th anniversary and has always exported the beauty of navigation around the world. However, the game is not focused exclusively on ships: it allows you to control various aircraft, including a Harrier and a couple of helicopters, the use of which is divided into various missions. The mix of available tasks includes firefighting, maritime control missions (such as transporting casualties or releasing buoys), night search missions with infrared vision and classic landings on aircraft carriers or airport runways. A decent variety of options, which is supported very well by mechanics that mix simulation with arcade flying. In fact, most of the vehicles are controlled with precision through a mixture of touch and gyroscope controls, and in particular require certain values to be precisely adjusted using levers clearly visible on the screen. We are certainly not faced with the complexity of a Flight Simulator, but we are still talking about a much deeper system than those to which mobile titles have accustomed us, which, moreover, is structured in a clever enough way not to cancel the fun in favor of a unmanageable mass of factors to manage. There is a continuous search for absolute mathematical precision, but there is also a bit of healthy euphoria for the maneuvers and sensations transmitted. The control system of ships, as it should be, differs substantially from that of helicopters and aircraft. For example, the Harrier has the ability to land vertically, while helicopters need to precisely manage landing power. I am on a boat, and on a plane In particular, with ships you will often find yourself using the game time acceleration command, given their slow maneuvering, while you will hardly need it aboard a fast and agile jet fighter. It's, in the end, a nice mix of systems, losing some verve in the absence of lenses, but managing to hook an enthusiast with ease. In addition to choosing the vehicle and the mission, the game even allows you to select the weather conditions, with the possibility of using those of the moment (they are obviously based on the weather in real time). The main flaw lies in the fact that a large part of its contents are not free, since the price for each scenario - compared to the average of mobile titles - is high. For heaven's sake, we appreciate the fact that part of the missions and the basic scenario are free: they allow users to get a precise idea of the product and later decide whether to spend some money on it, but each scenario costs 2.99 euros, and in full can buy for about 7 euros. Justifiable prices first of all because on mobile the simulators of this quality are practically zero. Furthermore, Italian Navy Sim is not without technical flaws: on a couple of occasions a bug prevented us from leaving with serenity from the aircraft carrier on which ourtro Harrier, because this sank into the track at the beginning of the mission, while on mid-range mobile devices the game trudges to say the least, becoming rather tiring to control. In short, on the recent Apple tablet tested on board the Amerigo Vespucci the command response was excellent, while on our Samsung Galaxy S5 the simulator, while working, was much more difficult to manage. Its partially free nature is also useful for evaluating the actual performance on the hardware at your disposal. Tricolor skies The developers' race for realism has led them to use very precise satellite scans in order to be able to field credible maps of Taranto, La Spezia and Catania. This is a mobile title, so expect a lot of blurry ground in flight, however the care taken in reproducing the three-dimensional models of the ships and aircraft of the title is undeniable (at least if you compare them to the average of mobile video games). The RORTOS seem to be proud of it, because in the title there is a 3D gallery for each vehicle, which allows you to observe the models in detail. The only graphic element to slightly out of tune, overall, is the wind, which is indicated very clearly with blue vectors during navigation but does not blend particularly well with the realism of the maps. The last little problem is related to physics: in the water the ships behave well, and in flight there are no shortcomings whatsoever, but on landing the impacts are ~rubbery~. It always comes back to the question of partial simulation, but a little more weight in our opinion would help the immersion of the player. Having said that, there is nothing similar to Marina Militare Italian Navy Sim on the market, and the company has achieved this result after years of work, born from the love for simulators of their CEO Roberto Simonetto (apparently he started working on this kind of projects for pure passion, and that after having had a success exceeding all the wildest expectations he decided to put together a real team of developers). The final goal of RORTOS - and of the Navy in this case, which seems to support them completely - is to spread the passion for ships and flying throughout our peninsula, a goal that they have already largely achieved by placing millions of simulators all over the world. The latter video game seems to be the most refined and interesting of their now substantial lineup, and who knows it could not be a starting point for even more ambitious works. What is certain is that the house is already experimenting with new technologies, given that the simulator supports Google Cardboard in a discreet way. Such a title adapted to VR could be a huge success for those who prefer low-cost mobile viewers to Oculus and Vive.", "date": "2016-07-04", "grade": "8.0"}
