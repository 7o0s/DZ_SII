In fact, Assault Horizon reigns unchallenged among fans of this particular videogame trend, even more so thanks to the evident involution of Tom Clancy's HAWX (which with the second episode has taken a step back, not to laugh at) and tie-ins like this Top Gun : Hard Lock, which unfortunately doesn't go beyond the exhumation of some memories for the nostalgics of the 1986 film. Developed by Headstrong Games, the team behind the excellent The House of the Dead: Overkill but lacking specific experience with flight simulators and the like, the game is set in a political fiction scenario in which the US Air Force is faced with a series of threats to the safety of its positions. The protagonist of the fifteen levels that make up the single player campaign calls himself ~Spider~ and is practically a modern version of the late Maverick, who has now passed through the ranks of instructors (we will also see him in some sequences, at least on board the his fighter): reckless, undisciplined but with an undoubted talent, the pilot will find himself fighting some intense battles against mysterious raiders who seem to respond to the directives of the Russian army. Accompanying him on the mission will be the faithful Deadeye, less skilled but always punctual in support, especially when the hostile planes will overwhelm us in number and firepower. Assault horizon After completing a short tutorial that illustrates the control system and the various functions of our fighter, we will be able to listen to a briefing and then leave for the mission on duty. Let's say immediately that the surrounding elements of Top Gun: Hard Lock are unexpectedly well taken care of: the game has a good dubbing in Italian and the original music of the film underlines the salient phases of the action, with the unmistakable theme played with the guitar electricity to accompany our return to the aircraft carrier. The problems of the product created by Headstrong Games are mostly structural: the stages always offer us the usual progression, with a simple reconnaissance that turns into a more serious matter when hostile aircraft burst onto the scene, followed by still others and possibly by sea troops or fixed turrets to target us. The multiplication of threats should help make the action spectacular and frenetic, but the exaggeratedly arcade approach of the gameplay, with an overabundance of quick time events peppering the dogfights, undermines the enjoyment of the experience, which ultimately results inconsistent . The aircraft we fly does not stall and the handling of the turn appears simplistic, which does not convey any feeling of ~weight~. The ~close aim~ has been implemented, a feature that seems to be the most popular in this type of game, but despite this, the action does not take off and the solidity of any Ace Combat chapter appears light years away. Stay with him! Top Gun: Hard Lock gradually provides us with a fair amount of really existing planes and three different modes, given that the single player campaign is supported by a sort of survival mode, in which you have to face increasingly numerous hordes of enemies, and from both cooperative and competitive online multiplayer, although unfortunately during the tests we had many difficulties in finding someone for a game. The game natively supports the Xbox 360 controller and the control scheme is quite simple, with only the left analog stick responsible for turning, the triggers to increase or decrease the speed, the back buttons that activate the flares or switch between air-to-air missiles. air to air-to-ground ones and, finally, the central buttons that are used to operate the machine gun (A), launch the missiles (B) and enter Hard Lock mode (X). The right analog stick is called into question for evasive actions (moving it horizontally) and to resort to a useful boost (moving it forward), a solution which, however, does not prove to be very comfortable during firefights. Instead, it is necessary to operate both sticks during the numerous quick time events we mentioned above, following the instructions that appear on the screen from time to time. There isn't much to say about the technical sector: the PC version is almost completely devoid of advanced options for scalability, ergo it does not differ from what is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 beyond a higher resolution and frame rate . The surface of the sea roselta well represented and some nice things have been included, such as the view that gets ~wet~ when we pass near the water, but in general the level of detail and the visual horizon are poor and the scenarios appear rather desolate and similar to each other .", "date": "2012-04-25", "grade": "6.0"}
