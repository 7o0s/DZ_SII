One of the best features is that you can challenge human players via the Internet or LAN, as well as on the same pc. Facing another person obviously adds to the fun, even though the CPU is doing just fine too. The avatars are then about thirty and it is also possible to customize them. The various types of game then allow for ever-changing competitions and it is very interesting to switch from a classic cue to an Italian 5-pin for example, in which you have to be careful not to give away points to your opponent. Longevity will increase even more! Shh! SILENCE! The sound sector is discreet and suitable for the type of game: the noise of colliding cues and balls gives a good idea of billiards. Different speech for the surrounding music and the non-existent ambient sound: the former are repetitive and in most cases they immediately get boring. Due to the noise of the occasion, Italian matches are usually played in silence, but something more could have been done depending on the playing areas. For example at the bowling alley there could be some background noise. The same goes for the players, who will never talk. Match hit! How can we fail to mention (speaking of billiards) the legendary match between Fantozzi and the director-count Catellani? Defeat would have ensured the hapless accountant would reach the top, but his wife Pina's tearful look turns him into a champion! The blustering of Fantozzi in question is stupendous, made of impossible shots and phrases of circumstance (here used to title the various paragraphs). [C] Crucifix in the mess hall! [/C] Effect return with central ball! After a debut in the field of adventures Artematica, an all-Italian software house, comes up with a billiards simulator created in collaboration with Gustavo Zito, four times world champion. The title allows you to choose different variants of this exceptional discipline, also satisfying those looking for something specific such as Snooker. In total we find eleven specialties including Italian 5 pins, Goriziana 9 pins and double, 8 ball, 9 ball, 8-15 ball, Carambola, etc. For each there is a brief explanation of the basic rules (even if there were a few more details). A fundamental element in a simulator of this kind is the physics of the spheres: which it must be said, performs its task very well. Once a shot has been made, we also have the inertia that makes the balls move to the millimeter and the possibility of making spin shots with parables and banks. In terms of playability it can be said that in a few minutes the controls are already masterable (thanks also to the trajectory indicators that can be activated and deactivated); it is possible to hit the ball by regulating the power with the mouse! It will be up to us to evaluate the situation, the shots to take, etc. The game is immediately usable to all and allows extensive customization depending on the type of challenge desired. In the career mode you find yourself busy facing a series of opponents who, once defeated, will reward you with bonuses such as levels, opponent profiles (which have RPG-type skill values), participation in tournaments and the final challenge with Gustavo Zito ! It is also possible to carry out training sessions, quick games and the excellent multiplayer. the game is immediately usable to all Royal triple 3-in-a-row returned with a dot! Graphically, the comparison with the most modern titles is unequal. After all, we are not talking about a billion-dollar production but in any case the game lets itself be watched, even if a greater outline cleaning would have been appreciated. The characters are crude and certainly not animated grandly, when you need to move the cue they soar in flight by taking a step that magically transports them to another part of the table. All in all, the locations are varied, ranging from the private club to the bowling alley, as well as the professional room, with an alternation between full and bare but overall sufficient environments. The shadows and balls are well done, with ambient reflections on them and with a good number of polygons; if you deactivate the characters you will have a photorealistic whole. Mention for the creation of the interface, with the indicators in the right place; depending on where the cue is pointed, it is possible to see the trajectory of the shot and the indicated ball, and to follow everything from six angles that can be rotated and zoomed at will. Warning: activating anti-aliasing causes text display errors (which will become incomprehensible) and people. Let's hope for a patch. I Play 3D Billiards is primarily a budget game that fully fulfills its task: to offer a complete billiard simulation accessible toall both in terms of the level of difficulty and the financial resources available (the title is sold for 20 euros). Sure technically you can't cry out for a miracle but in the end the playability and above all the multiplayer make up for this lack. Recommended for anyone who likes a few cue games or wants to explore the rules of other ~billiard~ disciplines. Pros Different types of game Immediate playability Guaranteed longevity Cons Poorly made characters Boring sound Some graphical bugs", "date": "2005-09-27", "grade": null}
