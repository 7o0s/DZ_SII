The script was repeated with Outlast by Red Barrells, a Canadian company founded by Philippe Morin (Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune), David Chateauneuf (Splinter Cell: Conviction, Assassin's Creed) and Hugo Dallaire (Army Of Two). The million views recorded by the Youtube counters on the teaser trailer pages is a valid indicator for measuring the levels of expectation created on the title announced in October 2012 in Montreal. The purpose of ours is to arouse strong emotions, such as to remain alive even after the game session: for this reason the choice fell on the survival horror genre. The story, frankly trivial and specious, is told without the help of expensive cutscenes, but relying only on the annotations of the assault journalist Miles Upshur, who sneaked into the dilapidated asylum of Mount Massive, in Colorado, recently reopened by the multinational Murkoff Corporation for research projects. It is a pity that the methods used are not exactly orthodox and that the poor souls trapped in the mansion, subjected to all kinds of psychic experiments, have turned into frightening and elusive war machines. Above all, it is a pity that our darling did not take advantage of the wide possibilities offered by this State of the USA (one of the most liberal in matters of arms trade) and decided to venture into the corridors of the terrible complex equipped only with an infrared handycam whose indispensability will soon be evident not only to orient oneself in the many dark meanders in which to barricade oneself to save oneself from the attacks of the neo-zombies, but also because certain clues relating to the story are noted in the notebook only after they have been captured by the eye of the video camera. Outlast is a good survival horror, but with the names involved, the bar was higher Don't open that door or rather, close it The first few minutes are enough to take the measurements of the essential game interface: the left mouse button is used to act more or less violently on the doors and to collect objects (including the saving stylus batteries), while the right one is delegated to a massive use of the dewatering recording tool, the zoom of which is regulated by the central wheel. The absence of HUD is not felt and, indeed, plays in favor of identification. When an impaled soldier, exhaling his last words, manages to bring the unconscious Miles to his senses, it will be too late and the reporter will find himself imprisoned inside gloomy rooms smeared with blood and furnished with human remains (the inevitable severed head in the toilet ): the aim is to emerge unscathed without attracting too much attention to the harassing guests of the mansion, perhaps trying to understand what experiments could have led to the incredible situation. A task easier said than done: every single ravine can in fact hide a maniac ready to put a strain on the player's coronary arteries. The structure of the game is so scripted that one wonders whether it is correct to categorize it as a video game or rather as an interactive experience. Unlike Amnesia: The Dark Descent, to which the kids of Montreal owe more than something, in Outlast there are no puzzles to solve, but a simple series of tasks to complete in sequence, with the classic ~find-the- key-and-open-the-door~ to be the master. The only obstacles that stand between the journalist and the way out are ~some~ guests of the asylum, whose behavior is well defined: in most cases it will be sufficient to discover the path they follow to avoid entering their radius of action, perhaps hiding inside lockers or under beds, and then stealthily sneak towards the next objective; in others it will be necessary to flee trying to reach, in the shortest possible time, positions inaccessible to the enemy. These situations are extremely adrenaline-pumping at first, thanks to the brilliant possibility of looking over your shoulder while continuing to run in the opposite direction and to the presence of obstacles to avoid in Mirror's Edge style, precisely coordinating the commands to jump and duck, and above all closing all the doors behind you to slow down the advance of the maniacs on duty. However, the search for the ~right~ path, often made difficult by the lack of lightingaction, may require several attempts during which the fear effect inevitably decreases its charge. The tension, on the other hand, always remains at high levels in the slow exploratory phases, in which the expectation for something to happen frequently culminates with the classic jump on the chair. The risk of getting lost in the labyrinthine building is however reduced by the presence of numerous closed doors or rooms that are unreachable from time to time. The dedication to the cause of the development team is commendable which, to make the experience more credible, relied on the advice of an association dedicated to helping people really suffering from psychiatric pathologies: it will thus happen to come across other apparently disinterested survivors in the presence of the reporter... but until when? Curiosity Outlast will be one of the forerunners for the new Sony console: the release is scheduled for the first months of next year, but the programmers have not promised any differences compared to the PC counterpart. Curiously, by selecting the joypad as the primary peripheral, the Xbox 360 controller icon is displayed. The version we tested was affected by some bugs that required resuming the action from the previous checkpoint because the events weren't correctly triggered; however, considering the linearity of the game, we expect answers very quickly. From a performance point of view, no problem reaching high frame rates in full HD and with all the details at maximum with the test configuration; however, considering the engine, it is realistic to believe that with the requirements recommended by the developers it is already possible to achieve the best visual performance without slowdowns. Good fundamentals, but little originality The artistic direction has cleverly worked on the foundations of the horror genre, relegating the player to darkness for a good part of the title and ~dirtying~, through the ~graining~ effect known from the times of Silent Hill, the camera shots whose use is practically constant even in illuminated areas. By activating the infrared vision, the exploratory pathos reaches its peak and on more than one occasion it will seem to live a scene from the film REC; in the end, the result is an involvement so satisfying as to forgive the lack of originality in the choice and construction of the fictitious psychiatric hospital that is the scene of the story. The audio sector, characterized by an excellent dimensional positioning, not only plays a key role in the success of the horror atmosphere, but is also essential for the purposes of the actual gameplay. Every single step is accompanied by a crunch that makes you fear that you have been heard by someone or, even worse, that you have not heard some noise coming from afar; Upshur himself underlines his anguish with a perpetually panting breath and with the inevitable curses that contribute to raising the rate of terror. The dynamic soundtrack, composed mostly of environmental effects, is another flagship of this survival. For the graphic system, Red Barrels went on the safe side by relying on the tested third version of the Unreal engine which made it possible to create a visually decent title, although something more was expected from such renowned programmers. Fortunately, as underlined above, the quality of textures (average) and animations (far too robotic), which penalizes the performance of the asylum's guests, takes a back seat precisely because of the continuous play of light and shadow that surrounds the protagonist . The level of difficulty, which cannot be selected, is within the reach of those who are able to bear the emotional stress to which they are subjected between one checkpoint and another; however it must be admitted that, once you get used to it, it won't be that difficult to get the reporter to the end credits: the tour of the Mount Massive villa can take just over five hours, after which it will remain etched in the player's memories a certainly pleasant title, but not as memorable as in the intentions of the programmers.", "date": "2013-09-05", "grade": "7.5"}
