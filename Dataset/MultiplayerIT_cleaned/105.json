Coinciding with the release of the film in theaters, the inevitable tie-in for PlayStation 2 also arrives (also available for PSP, Nintendo DS, GameBoy Advance and PC), which proves to be interesting in terms of structure and game mechanics. The strength of the trio Arthur is a boy who ends up being transported to the world of the Minimoys (tiny beings who live in the vegetation) in search of the treasure his grandfather told him about, which would allow him to pay off the family debts. Once he assumes the ~appropriate~ appearance, Arthur is trained by the little Btamche on what his possibilities are now that he finds himself miniaturized. Also together with Princess Selenia, he will form a trio who will have to face a large series of obstacles and threats, represented by the evil Acolytes, creatures who aspire to capture all the Minimoys. From the early stages of the game it is clear that the alternating use of the three characters is the basis of the gameplay of Arthur and the Minimoys: to open doors, activate mechanisms, move large objects and even to save the game it is necessary to combine the actions by Arthur, Btamche and Selenia, in a crescendo that leaves more and more space for solving puzzles and finding switches in order to continue the adventure. Characters As mentioned, you have to alternate the use of the three characters depending on the situation. In some cases it is simply a matter of ~numbers~, for example when two switches must be activated at the same time for a door to open, in which case the third character continues and the other two stand still pressing the switches until they are allowed to to get around the obstacle. In others, everyone's different abilities weigh: Arthur is an excellent climber and therefore can reach areas closed to Selenia, who has the ability to fight with a knife and can use it to eliminate obstacles on the way. Finally, Btamche has a throwing dagger useful for ranged attacks, which can be ~charged~ and directed towards seemingly unreachable enemies. These skills are also part of the offensive set, as they reflect the characters' ability to inflict damage on enemies, within a not very sophisticated combat system but which is enriched as you proceed with new functions in perspective both of attack than defense. In this sense, the energy bar of Arthur and his friends is made up of a series of elements that can be restored by collecting the dragonfly eggs found within the locations. Technical realization Apart from the various animated sequences, some of which are taken from the actual film, Arthur and the Minimoys on PS2 is surprising for the definition of the graphics, both as regards the main characters and the locations. The level of detail, in general, is quite high and most of the textures are well done, but the stages show a certain ~forced~ linearity that takes away several points from the desire to see ~what comes next~. Arthur, Selenia and Btamche are well drawn and animated, and there is a big difference compared to the realization of the supporting actors and above all of the enemies. The real problem, however, lies in the uncertainty of the graphics engine, which tends to trigger where the action becomes more chaotic. In terms of sound, the game boasts an excellent dubbing in Italian, of professional quality, which makes you turn a blind eye to the quality of the effects and music, which in fact leave no mark. Comment Arthur and the Minimoys is an atypical product, as it takes up the mechanics of a classic (prematurely forgotten) like The Lost Vikings in which you were in command of three characters with different characteristics, which you had to alternate to overcome obstacles or solve puzzles. All of this works all too well in this tie-in, which is split between phases of (really poor) action and an endless series of puzzles that involve exploring the scenarios, moving objects and flipping switches. We are dealing with a well-made game, in some situations quite engaging and certainly suitable for those who will be able to appreciate the film. Pros: The concept of ~trio~ is interesting. Excellent dubbing in Italian. Good level of graphics realization. Cons: Combat phases without depth. Frequent uncertainties of the graphics engine. Not very varied locations.", "date": "2007-02-08", "grade": null}
