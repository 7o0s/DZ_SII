{"name": "Another World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93660-another-world-fuori-da-questo-mondo.html", "text": "Version tested: iPadIt is not easy to review a title that since the day of its first release on the market, way back in 1991, managed to carve out a space in the Olympus of video games, earning the title of cult video game during its long life made up of conversions, remakes and reissues. Eric Chahi is the name to remember: the historic designer who, together with his musician friend Jean-Franois Freitas, was able to bring into the world the Another World we are about to talk about in just two years of intense development. An action adventure like no one had seen before that became a source of inspiration for many Western and Eastern designers thanks to its incredible mix of narrative, cinematography, music and immersion. A videogame that broke an incredible number of barriers which, in those years of great changes in the sector, seemed to castrate the possibilities of the videogame medium. The game never had a real sequel despite the enormous critical acclaim and excellent sales on the market and Eric first found himself involved in the extremely difficult development of Heart of Darkness and subsequently decided to disappear completely from the sector to return in 2011 with From Dust and with this remake of Another World developed on iPhone and iPad in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary. We will try in every way to judge it with a clear mind, keeping away the emotional strength of a title that has never left our memory as gamers. A decidedly atypical gameplay The game focuses on the incredible adventure of a scientist, a certain Lester Chaykin who, grappling with a quantum physics experiment that went wrong due to a lightning strike, finds himself projected into another world hunted by wild animals and soon captured by a ruthless indigenous population embroiled in a civil war for control of the planet. Lester will soon find a friend whose history of imprisonment will intersect with that of the physicist and together with him will try to reach salvation by fleeing from the asperities and difficulties of a world he does not know. The plot of Another World is only hinted at, implicit: there are no dialogues to listen to or texts to read and the only non-interactive sequence is the initial one while the small elements of the story will have to be captured and understood by the player by observing the interactions with the characters and what happens in the background. In terms of gameplay, the game belongs to the genre of action adventure with different elements of puzzles, exploration and with a discreet focus on fighting; all in a scrolling system with fixed screens where the characters and elements that move on the screen are polygonal and side by side with rigorously hand-drawn static backgrounds with an enormously evocative charm. The great peculiarity of Another World is its being completely devoid of HUD or on-screen interfaces and in fact forces the player to experiment, to try to understand initially even just how to control the avatar, then to study the scenario and the path of game to try to figure out what to do. An extremely avant-garde stylistic choice that has never been fully replicated by other video games even today. In the era of super tutorials and on-screen indicators, this element can clash with the need for today's player to have everything clear from the start and without great effort and can risk throwing him off balance, sometimes even making him feel frustrated. In the game you die continuously (it is no coincidence that there is a nice achievement that is earned by dying 100 times) and you go on with deadly trial and error shots, repeating small steps several times before adequately understanding what you need to do to move forward . There are even sections where the consequences of an unsolved puzzle can only be experienced several screens away a bit like in the old graphic adventures that longtime players will surely remember. Not to mention the fights: Lester will soon arm himself with a simple pistol that allows him to fire a laser shot, create a protective shield that lasts a few seconds or load the weapon and launch a super shot capable of destroying enemy shields. Obviously the same also applies to enemies and it is essential to point out that a single successful hit leads to the death of both the protagonist and the other humanoids. We are getting old To make the life of the younger gamer who discovers Another World on Apple systems for the first time easier, there is a rather permissive and abundant checkpoint system that will greatly dampen the frustration associated with the constant deaths. Alsoand the work done on the difficulty level moves in the same direction thanks to the introduction of the normal value, decidedly simpler than in the original game thanks to the reduction in the number of enemies, their reaction time and the implementation of some automatisms in the control of the character. Then there is the difficult level, identical to what was experienced 20 years ago and the very difficult level which represents an additional challenge that we would like to recommend to all readers who have already played and finished Another World in one of its dozens of versions. It should also be borne in mind that the title can be completed in less than an hour on the first pass and, subject to the numerous repetitions due to death, the second time probably will not take more than half an hour. The other important addition for this version naturally concerns the implementation of the touch that goes alongside the classic commands via virtual d-pad. Touch control of the protagonist works well for most of the game with only two exceptions. At the beginning where the lack of an in-game tutorial leaves you slightly displaced with respect to the available commands (there is however the possibility of consulting help from the initial menu) and during the most intense fights where it is necessary to make the protagonist turn on the spot very often but instead it will often happen to make him run in one direction leading him to certain death against the shots of the enemy's laser guns. In short, there is a significant reduction in precision in the more chaotic sections. It is however something you will get used to very soon but we are convinced that BulkyPix, the developer, could have done something better in this regard. In technical terms, it is interesting to note that Another World for iOS allows you to switch on the fly between the original low-resolution version and the new one that is much more defined and with more artistically refined backdrops simply by sliding two fingers on the screen. We have already seen the feature in other remakes and it represents a simple tinsel that you will forget very soon. Side note regarding the translation: the title is entirely in Italian but there are numerous localization errors fortunately only in the menus, given that the game, as previously written, does not offer in-game dialogues or texts.
