Let's get on board, put it in first gear and go. Do you hear the roar of the engine revving up? Feel the adrenaline of speed racing up your spine? Do you hear... we're stuck? The road is full of mud. The road is mud. It is clear that we have taken the wrong approach and that if we do not understand the game in front of us we will literally go nowhere. Let's start again from the garage. This time we take a truck with a trailer. We detach the trailer, change the wheels, fit a winch and go! Mud, you won't get us this time! Let's proceed calmly. Instead of accelerating like crazy we try to go slower to avoid the wheels digging the ground and starting to skid. Yes, this approach is definitely better than the previous one. A few meters and in addition to the mud we also find stones and the road, if we want to call it that, climbs up a rather steep slope. No problem: we activate the 4x4, lock the differential and off we go, up the stony hill (always very calmly), towards another garage and beyond! Spintires is more or less reducible to what was described, facetiously, just above, with the addition of the only pursuable objective: the transport of large loads of wood. We are dealing with an extreme simulator, closer in philosophy to a Farm Simulator or an OMSI than to a Gran Turismo. Yes, because here the challenge is not given by the competition with opponents, real or virtual, but by driving off the road itself, the bearer of problems that traditional racing games never take into consideration and which instead in Spinteres are the fulcrum of the whole experience. You'll understand by yourself that it's not a game for everyone, one of those who delude themselves into being pilots. Spintires wants to do one thingand it does it very well indeed. Curiosity Spintires and Kickstarters Spintires is one of many titles that was given its right to exist after a successful Kickstarter campaign. The developers had asked for forty thousand pounds to make it, but they got more than sixty thousand. It was certainly not an exploit like those of Broken Age or Pillars of Eternity, but Kickstarter still represented an excellent driving force for the developers, which helped them keep interest around the project high and score good sales after launch despite being a niche product. Casual or hardcore The title of Oovee is not very subtle in terms of options. At the beginning of each game you can only choose the map to face, among the five available (it seems that more will soon be added), and whether to experiment with the hardcore mode or try the casual one first (if you want you can also play in multiplayer, collaborating with others for the transport of wood). Now, don't be fooled by the two words, because in Spintires they take on a very different meaning from what is normally given to them. Let's say that the casual mode is still considered prohibitive for most players, given that the driving model does not change much compared to the hardcore mode. Simply, in hardcore mode you cannot use the differential lock with the automatic gearbox, you consume more petrol and you cannot recover the vehicles by selecting the garage. The rest remains the same, including mud. Choosing the map you can start running (so to speak). Here we encounter the first real flaw of the game. Spintires saves games automatically, with no option for the player to create custom save points. Too bad it doesn't allow you to save on more than one map at a time, with the obvious result of nullifying all progress with each change of scenery. As soon as you enter the game, you find yourself in the first garage, where you can see the fleet of vehicles available (they vary according to the map and new ones can be unlocked by reaching other garages). Selecting them, it is possible to customize them by changing the tires (the basic ones usually give bad results) and adding useful tools, such as a winch, which can be used to get out of the bogs by tying the cable to the trees, various trailers and so on. Once the vehicle has been chosen, it is advisable to access the map and set the destination on the GPS, which does not work as one might expect. In fact, the navigator does not tell us the road we have to take to get to our destination, given that in most maps there are no real roads but paths. More than anything we can use it to have a visual reference on where to go, setting various checkpoints. In short, it has more the function of a compass than a satellite navigator. The rest belongs to noi. Spintires is an extreme off-road vehicle simulator that will leave you stuck in mud Mud and trees It is important to talk about the graphics engine of Spintires for its being a simulation. The accuracy in the reproduction of certain real dynamics needs graphic and physical tricks that the more traditional titles hardly take into consideration. Spintires is not beautiful to look at, but it has some arrows that would make many Indians happy. The most obvious is the terrain deformation technology, which perfectly simulates the various conditions and interaction with vehicles. Wheels skidding on mud actually dig into the ground and vehicles that are too heavy actually sink into the softer ones thanks to a very accurate physics simulation. The importance of the relationship between the terrain and the vehicles is underlined by the game camera, positioned laterally by default so that the wheels are always in view. For some it could be a problem, given that sometimes it makes the road barely visible (you can move freely, but you never have a very clear overall view, especially with larger vehicles), but in other cases it is a necessity to understand how act to save yourself from the stall, without having to go back to the garage (in casual mode) or without having to use another vehicle with a winch to pull the stuck one out (hardcore mode), perhaps resorting to the help of other human beings if you are playing online. The damage system is also well simulated, with the vehicles suffering from it by touching the rough terrain or crashing into the objects of the scenario. The effects are different based on the type of impact. For example, trees cause more or less damage depending on their size and the speed of the vehicle at the moment of impact (the smallest ones can easily be knocked down), while tipping over will have catastrophic effects regardless. Some flaws of youth So far we have described how much good Spintires can offer, but we do not deny that it also has angular sides, probably due to certainly not enormous production values. For example, it is true that there are five maps, but it must be said that they are always made up of the same elements. A little more variety, for example with the possibility of driving on icy maps, or with the addition of atmospheric agents such as rain or hail, would not have hurt. The day-night cycle, which adds the need to turn on the headlights when the sun goes down, is there, but it's not enough. The same goes for the objectives: it is true that being able to take the loads of wood and bring them to their destination in decent times, without running out of fuel, is a big undertaking, but that's all and it would have been nice to have something more to do . We have already dealt with the problems of the saves and the camera in the other paragraphs, while we have not mentioned that support for the steering wheels is still missing (there is only the one for the Xbox 360 controller), which is a bit paradoxical given that Spinteres is aimed at lovers of pure simulations, those who are equipped with all the options available on the market to have greater realism. Obviously they are all known problems and the developers of Oovee have promised to remedy the remediable with future updates, but it is important to know that for now Spinteres lacks a lot of content and features that would be nice to be included soon.", "date": "2014-06-25", "grade": "8.0"}
