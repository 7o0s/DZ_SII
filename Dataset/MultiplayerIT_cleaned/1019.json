{"name": "Recensione: Playboy The Mansion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-playboy-the-mansion.html", "text": "Game elements The context of Playboy The Mansion is therefore Hugh Hefner's villa, the native environment of the bunnies and palace of the king of twentieth-century eroticism. To recreate the environment, the iterations with the bunnies and the life of Hugh Hefner, a management engine decidedly similar to that of the Sims was chosen, but the artificial intelligence and the interaction possibilities are decidedly more limited. The title is clearly divided into four different parts. The home life of Hugh Hefner, who we impersonate, sees us engaged in courtship or business relationships with an incredible number of well-disposed bunnies, while the parties we can organize in the mansion determine expenses but also prestige and certain advantages depending on the invited guests . The third, important element concerns the furnishing and enrichment of the rooms of the house, which must reflect an excessive lifestyle and at the same time entertain guests and tenants. a management engine decidedly similar to that of the Sims has been chosen, but the artificial intelligence and the possibilities of interaction are decidedly more limited Game elements The last segment of which the title is made up concerns the printing of the Playboy numbers, which mark our successes and represent the goals of Playboy The Mansion. In addition to economic management, printing a Playboy issue allows us to photograph the bunnies as we please in an attempt to create a magazine that is also commercially successful. Hefner's world The social relationships that support the structure of the game are, unfortunately, rather limited. Seducing is far too easy for Hugh and even guests melt at his personality. Pleasing the guests of the house is a small and repetitive task, which does not even come close to the game structure of the old Sim Park. Convincing a girl to become a bunny has something satisfying, as well as winning her over and convincing her to jump on our mattress, but the fun doesn't last and soon the skits presented to us become rather boring. More important are the relationships with guests who are our contacts with the world. Politicians and lawyers are obviously important, but even more are the representatives of the trends of the moment who are able to help our popularity in the world. what's the best way to please a guest than to present him with a charming, sweet and helpful bunny? Hefner's world In a favorable period for cinema, for example, it is desirable that a Hollywood star be present at one of our parties. And what's the best way to please a guest than to present him with a charming, sweet and helpful bunny? Unfortunately our guests will react to little else, and like our staff and the bunnies they will just like and use the elements of the house or simply ignore them. Social synergies Taking into account Playboy's popularity, invitations, money and press, the Playboy superstructure results in a fairly complex management title, even if its separate parts are extremely simplified. The furnishing of the house itself influences both the satisfaction of the guests and the desire to be invited by increasingly important personalities and the presence of important guests influences the sales of the magazine and the approval of the other guests. The title then takes shape and provides us with a certain number of elements to keep an eye on, which includes the hiring of Playboy staff and the acquisition of increasingly competent and productive collaborators. It is also possible to make our writers increase their skills using the home library or increase the happiness and productivity of the staff thanks to the irreplaceable bunnies. The joint seems to work and also in this case the iterations between one element and another are interesting, but the elements themselves, like the relationships between two non-player characters, are so simplified as to always lead to the same reactions. The title then takes shape and provides us with a certain number of elements to keep an eye on Social synergies We are also offered the possibility of taking photographs and personally creating the cover of Playboy, but there is no link between the skill with which the images are taken and the sales of the magazine, so this element too, in the long run, becomes an accessory cumbersome. The furnishings of the house, on the other hand, seem quite varied and branched and the numerous extras that we will unlock from month to month will help us to personalize the house. Unfortunately the decor is limited exclusively to the historical reality of Playboy and there will be impossiIt is possible to radically change the look of the house and perceive it as our own creation. Among the unlockable extras there is no shortage of secret interviews, real playboy covers and famous songs, which, all in all, helps to increase, albeit slightly, the longevity of the title. Technically The graphic aspect does not differ much from that of The Sims even if the number of animations is significantly lower. The bunnies, which we can dress as we like, sway and react by flirting just as the imagination suggests, but they lack details. Blondes, blackberries, brunettes do not vary in height and shape and do not have animations related to their character, an element that could have really justified the courtship or preference for one girl rather than another, beyond the job or the color of the eyes. On the other hand, the guest models are quite numerous, starting from politicians to film and music stars. The furniture is a strong point that starts from the photos of stars and passes from vintage posters, to arrive at sports equipment, video games and gizmos of dubious use, and, despite the constraint to the tastes of Hugh Hefner, it is decidedly varied and detailed. The soundtrack, by buying extra on extra, expands and gradually becomes a strong point of the title, and the sound effects, from the excited squeaks of the bunnies to the objects scattered around the house, have no gaps whatsoever. Comment Playboy The Mansion looks like a clone of The Sims based on the deeds of Hugh Hefner, king of twentieth-century eroticism. But the artificial intelligence is extremely reduced and incomparable with the Electronic Arts title, and very little of erotica transpires except for some very little evocative digital topless. The Mansion works when it connects these elements to the management system that guides us through different missions and different objectives. Like many titles of this generation Playboy The Mansion neglects the heart of the game and enriches the outline; an enthusiast could therefore find what he is looking for, but those who want a complete and demanding game will find themselves faced with a title unable to satisfy him, with many truncated potentials and simplified in every element. Pros: Rich reconstruction of the Playboy world The joint between management title and life simulator is a good idea Extras and furniture not to be missed for fans Cons: Rich in details but not in variations Extremely simplified gameplay Limited artificial intelligence Everyone, or almost everyone, has read or glimpsed some number of Playboy, it is undeniable, as it is undeniable that articles have never been the backbone of the most famous erotic monthly ever. Yet even the printed words have constituted a large part of the success of a popular magazine everywhere and capable of capturing both transgressives, deluded romantics and even part of puritanism, probably contributing to the formation of the current concept of ~artistic nude~ almost as much as the legendary French postcards of the nineteenth century. Fifty-two years have passed since Hugh Hefner, aspiring cartoonist, gave life to his American dream and ignited the erotic dreams of millions of passionate readers. But in the transition from drawing to glossy paper he did not lose the gift of imagination, given that for half a century the sweet life made up of dressing gowns and bikinis, dry martinis and crowded swimming pools flanked the Playboy centerfold, creating the illusion of an elitist eroticism and clean, capable of defeating even the most difficult moralism. Poised between pin-ups that conform to the American dream and transgressions, Playboy has overcome depressions, crises and scandals, up to the heart attack that forced Hugh Hefner to abandon the direction of the magazine, then passed into the hands of his daughter. After that, between competition and the internet, the problems increased, sales decreased and eroticism changed. Playboy The Mansion, as was to be expected, refers to the golden years of the magazine, years in which even a Hollywood star would have made false cards to attend a Hefner party, to visit his villa and above all to meet the bunnies who populated it, true icons of desire.", "date": "2005-03-02", "grade": null}
