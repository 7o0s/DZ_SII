{"name": "Citizen Sleeper", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/citizen-sleeper-recensione.html", "text": "Gareth Damian Martin is a videogame author in the purest sense of the term, because not only does he create his works in an almost perfect solitude, thus determining their greatness and limits, but what he does is always critical of the medium and some of its its more established forms. In Other Waters, his first game, it was conceived precisely as an antithesis to the concept of aggression that often dominates video games, even the seemingly harmless ones. In the Citizen Sleeper review we will see how Martin has matured this discourse, albeit in a completely different context. Game mechanics The character is more than his skills Citizen Sleeper is a narrative role-playing game with survival elements in which you play a sleeper, a replicant with a robotic body owned by a multinational corporation who escaped to The Eye space station, a frontier place full of outcasts of all kinds, founded by idealists after the collapse of a huge galactic conglomerate, the only place a fugitive can try to be free. Consider that sleepers do not enjoy the same rights as humans: they are created by copying part of a living individual's mind into a mechanical body. Furthermore, the multinationals equip them with a security system, called programmed obsolescence, which kills them if by chance they get out of their control. After all, they are their investment and they do with it what they want. With no memories and being unable to go anywhere else, the initial purpose of the sleeper created by the player, by simply choosing one of the three available classes, is therefore to understand how to survive. There are essentially two resources to take into consideration: the condition bar, made up of twenty blocks which decrease after each cycle, i.e. when the sleeper is sent to sleep at the end of the day, and the energy bar, linked to nutrition, formed from five blocks that descend at the rate of two at a time. The two bars are connected to each other: once you run out of energy, your condition worsens faster. The latter is linked to another mechanic, that of dice: the higher the condition, the more dice you receive at the beginning of the cycle to use to perform actions. Having many dice means being able to do many more things, whether they are working to repay a debt and earn something, or discovering details of some particularly interesting character. They are also the main way the story progresses. The value of the die (from one to six) determines its effectiveness, i.e. the ease with which it allows you to perform a specific action. Each action is also influenced by the character's specializations or skills, which can make life easier or more complicated under certain circumstances. In total there are five skills: Technique, Interface, Endurance, Intuition and Interaction, which can be increased by assigning skill points when available. Indeed, let's say better: that they are determined by the style of play. agency The characters have very rich backgrounds These very simple rules, which recall some board games, are used to delve into what is a multifaceted and very articulated title, which leaves the player truly free to decide his path, without forcing him in any way, but only by suggesting paths through the so-called Impulses, i.e. a mission system designed more as a series of tracks to follow, than as the classic set of actions to be performed in a certain sequence to obtain bonuses. The beauty of such simplicity lies in the way in which the whole system ends up vanishing, so much it becomes automatic and much is helped by a simple and elegant user interface and by an essential but very effective graphic style, made of an elementary 3D for the space station and very well done art for the various events and characters. After the start, a bit slow, we therefore find ourselves following our own path, rotating the Eye to access the actions that interest us. We also realize that we are in a highly dynamic environment, in which the stories and characters evolve following interesting paths, when not exactly emotionally intense, and which create a deep bond with the player, who feels more and more involved in this community. The Eye space station There are so many possibilities, so much so that the whole experience can be lived several times with the certainty of always being able to do something different and discover unpublished details about the station and about ourselves. Of course, there are some fixed problems to deal with, such as the bounty hunters sent by the multinational that owns us to try to recover its investment, but even in similar cases the idea is always to tfind ways to cope without going out of our way. Going forward in the game, the available actions become so many that it is practically impossible to perform them all and you have to start choosing. Precisely in these choices, which presuppose leaving something by the wayside, lies the strength of a work that presents itself as profoundly different from any other role-playing game, both in its assumptions and in its execution. Gameplay Citizen Sleeper is a peaceful game To underline the uniqueness of Citizen Sleeper, let's take the characters: the scenario initially seems quite typical, so much so that on more than one occasion we think we are faced with mere stereotypes, that is, types already seen and reviewed in other titles. The reality, however, is very different: the first approach shows only the most superficial part of the characters, who reveal a highly multifaceted and human nature with the deepening of their personal history, that is when you come into contact with them through actions. The gameplay soon becomes something completely different from what it initially seemed and it does so subtly, through its game mechanics, not by virtue of some revealing video: the survival part is overshadowed, i.e. it becomes secondary because it is easily satisfied thanks to the large number of resources available. The improvement of material conditions therefore allows us to change the focus of our research, which is no longer aimed at staying alive, but at giving meaning to life itself. The whole is, in the author's intentions, a representation of capitalism on the one hand (the struggle for survival by accumulating resources) and post-capitalism on the other (the search for a free and peaceful existence, outside the power of capital) . The player is free to choose his path In this sense, the metaphor is so self-evident, and rendered so well through the systems that regulate the game, that it is magnificent, but at the same time cumbersome. It is probably inevitable that this is the case, but in certain moments the game almost seems to want to convince the player of his thesis by forcing it as much as possible from a rhetorical point of view, which somewhat reduces the charm of the discovery, because it becomes clear where everything wants go to parry. Of course, it must be said that in terms of writing it is a cut above many much more famous titles, which perhaps boast many screenwriters in the credits, but at the same time it is naively direct in proposing its theme, so as to anesthetize it a bit, making it lose effectiveness.", "date": "2022-05-16", "grade": "8.8"}
