Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. ~Which came out first?~ This is certainly the question that many users will ask themselves after trying Running With Friends, the new freemium developed by Eat Sleep Play (the authors of the recent Twisted Metal for PlayStation 3, not at all) for Zynga, which really looks a lot like Subway Surfers ( here's the review to refresh your memory, just in case). It's basically a clone. Of course, both games belong to the same vein and therefore it could be said that Subway Surfers in turn was clearly inspired by Temple Run, but in reality there were very marked differences between the title developed by Kiloo and Imangi's blockbuster Studios, for example the exclusive use of the touch screen for controls (rather than a mix of gestures and accelerometer), the clear division of the route into three ~lanes~, the presence of obstacles of a certain type (such as vehicles speeding on which you can jump or the barriers to slide under) and, above all, a gameplay with the right timing, with the action that does not immediately become very fast but leaves us time to take the measures well, to adapt mind and hand to the situations that away show up on the screen. The same elements that we find in Running With Friends, with the addition of Temple Run-style ~crossroads~, the possibility of destroying some objects (mainly crates, barrels and bales of hay) and some nice shortcuts from time to time. Raging bulls In the end, there are two aspects that are actually new in the experience offered by Running With Friends: firstly, a structure based on asynchronous multiplayer, which involves a challenge with another user (to be recruited on Facebook or randomly) at each game , to see who manages to cover the greatest distance out of a total of three attempts; secondly the setting of Pamplona, which offers a damn good pretext for the protagonist's race, which is located in the middle of the famous ~Encierro~, the traditional running of the bulls through the streets. The influence of the aforementioned Subway Surfers is felt right from the start, but this does not detract from the quality of the Zynga production, which can count on fluid and colorful graphics, really pleasant to see (apart from the drawing style of the characters, frankly horrible), as well as on an impeccable touch control system, extremely reactive and precise even in the most agitated moments. The ~additions~ to the formula created by Kiloo, in this case the changes of direction and the multiplayer setting, undoubtedly constitute an added value and ultimately we can speak of an evolution rather than a mere copy (but whether it is of a clone is beyond doubt, we reiterate it). Getting the jump on the back of the bulls that are ahead of us on the course, collecting stars, the general variety of situations are all elements that combine to draw the picture of a free title (moreover without particular IAP) which would really absurd to give up. Running With Friends is a shameless clone of Subway Surfers. A very well done clone, though.", "date": "2013-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
