{"name": "Tony Hawk 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawk-3.html", "text": "Warm up the wheels under your skate... The first thing that will be required of you in Tony Hawk 3 is logically to choose a skater to get on his skate and start from a stage. At the beginning you will be able to choose from over twenty skaters and in the present modes you will find levels created specifically to give you endless hours of play and fun and this is certainly one of the most important things that invite you to purchase the title. The longevity of a title is an essential element for a normal gamer. You will definitely be playing Tony Hawk 3 at least until Tony Hawk 4 comes out. The core of the game is in the Career Mode. Each level consists of various tests that you will have to complete in order to go to the next level. Among these tests you will find some already seen in previous episodes such as Tony Hawk for GBA such as scoring 500,000 points or finding and collecting the letters that make up the word SKATE. The major innovation inserted in the gameplay consists of the possibility of making ~reversals~ in your performances. If you are making a movement along a handrail, you can cleverly go back by resuming the line of movement and making your score soar. The evolutions and the support points on which to carry them out have increased by 100% in Tony Hawk 3 and you can reach very high scores if you learn to use your character ~diligently~. The advice I can give you is to always start playing with the same character in order to understand all the secrets and movements of the latter. If you play starting the game each time with a different character you will not fully appreciate this great title. The game levels are very unusual. The settings are spectacular and often based on real-life locations. Each level has such a large area that you can open an open-air cinema in it, and you can also discover new and exciting secret locations as you wander around. The gameplay of Tony Hawk has remained almost unchanged from Tony Hawk 2. However, the skaters are highly customizable. You can choose the clothing that best suits your skater from a vast assortment of shirts, pants, shorts and shoes. The skates are really beautiful, made with a myriad of colors and equipped with wheels that offer different levels of grip. The create-a-player mode offers the possibility to create your own skater from scratch by choosing the face, skin color and hair cut and color as well as height and weight. If all this wasn't enough, think about the fact that Tony Hawk 3 also includes a multiplayer mode. Through the system-link you can play up to four players without having to use the annoying split screen mode. There are a total of five modes that support multiplayer mode. They are: Trick Attack where you have to compete with your friend in making the best performances that will also give you the highest scores. In Graffiti Mode you have to brand everything with your color. Your opponents will be busy doing the same in the same area. In Horse mode you have to try your hand at the classic game of horses, but using the skate! In the Slap! instead you have to pat your friends; whoever has more slaps on the back than the others at the end of the time wins. In King of the Hill you have to run in search of the crowns that will make you King of the Hill. Finally Neversoft has included a nice park editor mode, which will allow you to create your own and unique training ground. There are about fifty pools, handrails, steps, ramps and trees that you can use to create your world. You can also invite your friends to your world to compete and see who gets the highest scores. A new world to discover! The game moves and runs at a speed of 60fps in most levels. There are some slowdowns that are especially noticeable at the beginning of each level. However, the slowdowns do not affect the overall good workmanship of the game. The game levels are vast and well detailed. The characters have complete animations that take care of every movement especially with regard to the most demanding evolutions on the skateboard. Sometimes you won't know whether to keep an eye on the joypad for a good performance or drool in front of the screen at the animated show that's unfolding in front of your eyes. The settings are full of pedestrians and cars that emerge from all sides. Extreme sports games usually give you the feeling of being alone in the world. Tony Hawk 3 instead you will seebirds flutter in the air, passers-by react to your passage and cops catch robbers on the streets of Los Angeles. The soundtrack features a mix of effects that are well suited to the atmosphere of the game. The music will excite you and will entice you to perform spectacular jumps and wonderful performances for your eyes and those of your friends. In conclusion I have always been a fan of the Tony Hank series even if portruppo of some titles I have not yet managed to learn all the techniques and to reveal some mysteries. However this third episode that arrives on XBox really impressed me because it combines truly incredible graphics with simple and effective gameplay. The game deserves the full attention of the players and satisfies all the voices who wanted it before its release as one of the best games available at the European launch of the Microsoft home console. Pros: The traditional control of the Tony Hawk series is always the best Lots of characters, each with their own personal technique Thrilling environments, with all the credentials to excite even those who try their hand at a ~virtual~ skate for the first time Lots of game levels for healthy and endless hours of fun Cons: Graphic slowdowns especially at the beginning of the levels, but we consider them as defects only if you want to be really fiscal Maybe we will notice some relevant defects when we compare this game with a possible Tony Hawk Materials: Tips XBox Welcomes the King of Skate! It now seems only right that every successful title is destined to appear on all existing consoles and the same also happened with this third installment in the Tony Hawk series. however you must not think that Neversoft has prepared the usual heated soup for you. In this third episode of the series you will find over 20 characters, each with his own personal technique, different and new game modes, levels created with obsessive attention to detail, as well as secret levels and characters created only for this XBox version. And if we also include a noteworthy soundtrack, it all suggests that we are faced with a real masterpiece. But let's go step by step...", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
