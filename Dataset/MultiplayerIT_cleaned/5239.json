Real sport is quite another thing, bringing a whole series of rules and tactics into the field that make everything extremely complex and spectacular, but in a video game it is possible to go back to the origins and bring the challenge back to the simple bases that perhaps characterized the beginning of this particular activity: essentially trying to put the ball inside a basket, therefore. This is what we are asked to do in Head Basketball, the new game by D&D Dream Corp. for iOS and Android, which continues what appears to be a real craze for the team in question, namely proposing simple interpretations of the most popular with characters with huge heads and rather basic physics to support all the game mechanics. From the same manufacturer also comes Head Soccer, which is practically the same thing but transported into the world of football and which also closely resembles the football mini-game present in Rayman Legends, although the formula perhaps finds its best application in the context of basketball. On a 2D field seen from the side, two players face each other head-to-head (it is appropriate to say this, since they are mostly heads) trying to throw the ball into the opponent's basket, using pushes and jumps to direct the bouncing ball anywhere right inside the right circle, and making sure you score more points before time runs out. It is, in fact, a slightly more accurate reworking of a similar game that is quite widespread in the flash browser game field, but in this case everything is enriched to the point of becoming a real downloadable title for mobile platforms, with lots of of free-to-play model and micro-transactions. Head Basket contains everything in the title: head and basket, the basic elements of the game Head game Obviously Head Basket has little to do with real basketball, except for the presence of a ball and two baskets. You find yourself facing a single opponent within various exchanges with different graphic features, with the possibility of pushing with your hands or hitting the ball with your head, when stationary, moving or jumping. The angle and speed with which we hit the ball determines a reaction, with trajectories that derive from a basic but rather functional physics engine, despite the fact that it sometimes presents rather bizarre behaviors. Touching the ball and completing the actions loads an energy bar which allows you to release the special ability, or rather a particularly powerful blow which, if not countered properly, is practically unbeatable. Beyond the simplicity in the general dynamics of the game, which is ultimately a plus, this very intense use of special abilities which in most cases are difficult to counter becomes a rather weak point in the gameplay, together with the strong randomness of which the whole game system is pervaded, considering that the physical management of the ball is not too convincing and makes its trajectory uncontrollable. In short, chance seems to govern the order of things a little too much in Head Basket, and this combined with some incomprehensible rebounds can undermine the fun, rather unleashing frustration, in the poor governance of the game action. A more precise direction to the progress of the game can be given by increasing the skill and characteristics of the player, only that in this case the classic mechanisms of microtransactions intervene practically immediately: the objects in the shop have very high prices and seem to clearly push towards the purchase of credits with real money, probably to compensate for the free distribution of the base game.", "date": "2016-10-13", "grade": "6.6"}
