What unclean sadness). The sword of fire can give great satisfaction Unhappy jokes aside, the title of Crazy Viking Studios is really foaming at the mouth. Born as an act of love for the coin-ops of the eighties and nineties, especially for that Rastan Saga of Taito that brought more than one player to their knees, Volgarr The Viking is a programmatically impervious platform game that wants to test anyone who has the audacity to buy it and start a game. The plot, quite useless, talks about a kingdom to save, Odin, the knights of Asgard, Pegasus' lightning and... no, there's something not right. The only certainty in this liquid world is that our mighty warrior has been awakened to make meatballs of enemies with his mighty sword. Everything else is superfluous. Volgarr must advance through the two-dimensional levels slicing lizardmen, giant spiders, fishmen, armored giants and all the rest of the bestiary that divides him from the grand finale, while jumping over chasms and traps, climbing ropes and chains, and using his throw to create platforms from which to perform mighty leaps. There is no shortage of treasures and power-ups to collect. It is around the latter that all the gameplay was built. Crazy Viking Studios has made a number of very smart choices in terms of character development. Our bearded hero starts out with a wooden shield that can withstand two attacks (of any type). The first upgrade that can be found in the various chests scattered throughout the levels is an indestructible shield that allows you to counter practically any attack (very useful against various arrows and bullets, which often cannot be dodged but only blocked). Bosses must be defeated using the right tactics The shield also has the advantage of allowing a shot loaded with the secondary weapon, the very useful spear we mentioned earlier. The second upgrade is a helmet that makes Volgarr more resistant to attacks, effectively giving him an extra life. When hit while wearing a helmet, the dappled armpit hero loses his helmet, but not his indestructible shield. The last available power-up (among the regular ones) is the fire sword, which doubles the damage and increases the range of the base weapon. If you are hit with the flaming sword in your hand, you lose it along with the helmet. By opening more chests having already all the upgrades you get more valuable treasures or magic spheres that give access to secret levels, reachable after defeating the bosses. Speaking of pure game structure, it is inevitable to bring Volgarr to Rastan again. Each level is in fact divided into two parts, the first set in an exterior, the second in an interior. At the end of each level there is a boss, i.e. a particularly tough enemy who must be killed by studying the correct strategy to adopt to counter his attacks. The rest is pure skill. Volgarr the barbarian Recently difficult video games are accused of having bad design. Sometimes that's true, sometimes it's not. Difficulty can be a feature like any other, if well implemented, the important thing is to be aware of what you are facing and know how to choose. For example it is impossible to point the finger at Volgarr The Viking for the challenge it offers. It is true that it is not a title suitable for everyone, but it is equally true that the developers have never hidden their intentions, not even when they presented the game on Kickstarter to seek funding. Volgarr is a rough guy even underwater (he has waterproof sweat) Their aim was to re-propose coin op game mechanics in a videogame shell that recalled the titles of that golden age. Of our own we can say without fear of being contradicted that they have succeeded. In short, if you are looking for a comfortable product to spend a few hours with, look elsewhere. Less successful is the visual aspect. The problem is not the pixel art graphics, but the fact that there have been games with similar stylistic ambitions but better made. Mind you, if we take it for what it is, Volgarr isn't bad to look at. It simply has some limits in the sharpness of the image and in the pure design of the various elements (especially some scenarios are not beautiful). The soundtrack is much better. The few accompanying songs are splendid, reminiscent of some well-known cinematic soundtracks of films from the nineties (whoever finds the moment ~inspired~ by Rambo wins a bambolina by Pierpaolo Greco) and the sound effects are also beautiful, reminiscent of those of the coin-ops of the eighties. Sometimes a sword and a shield aren't enough to save one's life, as Volgarr teaches", "date": "2013-10-22", "grade": "8.0"}
