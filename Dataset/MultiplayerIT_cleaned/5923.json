{"name": "Potion Permit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/potion-permit-recensione.html", "text": "The independent Indonesian studio MassHive Media - already author of the turn-based RPG Azure Saga: Pathfinder, released four years ago - was among the protagonists of the last Wholesome Direct 2022 with the trailer for Potion Permit. Perfectly fitting for the relaxed tones of the event, Potion Permit had us immediately interested thanks to its delightful pixel art and its non-trivial theme: the protagonist is a budding pharmacist and to continue in our career we will have to fight monsters, find the right cure for the sick and earning the trust of the inhabitants of Moonbury. After many hours in the company of the title developed by MassHive Media, we are ready to tell you what we think in our review of Potion Permit. Moonbury, here we come! The cover image of Potion Permit It often happens that we treat the protagonists of our favorite video games with concoctions of various kinds and medicinal potions, but have you ever wondered how these are produced? Certainly there is behind the skillful hand of a pharmacist, an expert connoisseur of the products of the natural world and their properties. Potion Permit looks at the pharmacological art of past centuries, when the pharmacist was also a doctor, a botanist, and perhaps a magician and alchemist, holder of all-round knowledge. After a short editor to build the aesthetics of our character, we witness the conversation between the head of the Medical Association of the capital of a fantasy world with the protagonist, sent to the distant island of Moonbury to represent the association. As the train pulls into the station, we meet the mayor, his wife and other locals, all gathered in the local pub to welcome us. Not everyone is happy with our arrival: one of the themes that will follow us throughout the entire adventure immediately emerges - which can be completed in about twenty hours - namely the need to gain the trust and respect of the citizens of the island. Yes, because there are some dark secrets in the Medical Association's past work at Moonbury. Exploring the green expanses of the island in search of ingredients for potions, we will discover that some plants have become extinct, and we will find strange craters that regurgitate a mysterious purple liquid. It is evident that a real disaster has occurred, and this is the reason why the initial conversations with the inhabitants are often cold and detached: on the island there is a strong distrust towards anyone who comes from the capital. We need to roll up our sleeves and prove our worth, starting with Rue, the mayor's daughter, sick and in need of care. We have followed with interest the events of the citizens of Moonbury and the developments of their relationships with the protagonist, thanks to a good level of writing and a character design that manages to give life and panache to all the supporting characters of the adventure. However, once the vicissitudes of the small town were over, we felt little incentive to continue with the work of pharmacist. Just a little sugar and the potion goes down Pharmacological art is at the heart of Potion Permit We said that the pharmacological art is central to Potion Permit: everything revolves around the study of new recipes and the finding of ingredients in the ecosystems of the island, to then apply our knowledge to the diagnosis of patients and, finally, to their treatment. You are introduced to these mechanics - the beating heart of the gameplay - through Rue, who has been ill for months, who has not benefited from the treatments offered by the sorcerer Matheo, hostile to everything that is vaguely related to the world of science. patient is the diagnosis: based on what the patient says, we focus on examining a part of the body in pain to find out what is wrong. Everything takes place through very simple mini-games, such as pressing the buttons in time, or repeating a certain key sequence. Well, a first mole of Potion Permit is right here: the mini-games are soon repetitive and trivial, unable to offer even the slightest degree of challenge, and it's a real shame. Once this phase is completed, the pharmacist will be able to identify a cure, and at this point our trusty cauldron comes into play. One of the Potion Permit minigames Contrary to the diagnosis mini-games, the Tetris-like game aimed at ~building~ potions can be said to be really successful, fun and stimulating. The ingredients - herbs, mushrooms, but also stones and bear skins - must be used taking into account the shape assigned to them for the purposes of the composition of the concoctions, respecting a maximum of usable elements and being careful to cover exactly the contours of the potion in question. A game of joints, therefore, which in its simplicity manages to involvemanage the player, especially in the case of more advanced potions. Once the work is done, one can go back to the clinic to apply the appropriate treatment to the patient. Carrying out these steps flawlessly will allow us to heal him and increase the trust of the inhabitants of Moonbury towards us, allowing us to find out more about them, to undertake missions assigned by them and thus continue in the Potion Permit plot. Leaving the sick to their fate will mean losing prestige in the eyes of the community, which will find itself forced to turn to Matheo, who is always happy to snatch a few patients from us: the best strategy is to dedicate ourselves to the sick in the early hours of the day and make them our priority, a task that is made easier from the proximity of the clinic to the pharmacist's home. An adventurous pharmacist A moment of meeting with the characters of Potion Permit It's easy to think that Potion Permit is all here: diagnosis, elaboration of the right potion, patient care. This is not the case: as also happens in Stardew Valley - albeit with a more imaginative thrust and with strong fantasy implications - even in the title signed by MassHive Media there are exploration and combat sessions, aimed at finding ever new resources and materials for our potions. There is a coincidence (functional, of course, but a little curious at first) between the harvesting tools and the offensive ones: hammer, sickle and ax are used depending on the situation to split rocks, cut basil stalks and draw wood from the trees, but they are also instruments of death for the poor beasts that we will find on our way. We say ~poor~ because the AI of the enemies is certainly not the brightest, and the cheapness of the treatments at our disposal - foods that can be purchased at the local pub - combined with the often low levels of HP of the opponents will make them cannon fodder to be exterminated mercilessly. In a video game that speaks of values such as respect for nature and looks with concern at its unruly exploitation by man, mercilessly killing hundreds of wild animals with the same sickle with which we collect wild herbs generates in the player, in the long run, a certain sense of perplexity. Potion Permit exploration Furthermore, the material collection sessions soon turn into a real effort, thanks to the request for immense amounts of money, wood and rocks to upgrade your tools and to discover new areas of the game world. Of the three, the simplest to earn is undoubtedly money: just play simple mini-games (very repetitive, such as diagnostics) to help out at the post office, church or police station and be rewarded daily for our ~hard~ work. As for wood and rocks, we will have to cut down an infinite number of trees and give hammers right and left, and a strong sense of repetitiveness will be inevitable. That's a pity, because the gameplay loop of Potion Permit is effective and pleasant, capable of generating a spiral of pleasant activities, interspersed with pleasant interactions with the inhabitants of Moonbury, which closely reminded us of Stardew Valley. As mentioned, however, Stardew Valley drew lymph and vivacity from fantasy and supernatural elements, while Potion Permit remains, in the long run, too prosaic and anchored to pressing and concrete needs - look for jasmine, chop wood, kill the bear - to stand out the flight. Joy of life in pixel art The artistic direction of Potion Permit reserves some surprises And to say that the artistic direction does its best to convey a sense of beauty: the work of MassHive Media reveals a deep knowledge of pixel art and a strong talent for building a coherent world from an artistic point of view. In this sense, the design choices of Potion Permit reminded us of Eastward, another oriental production title, among the brightest of last year from an aesthetic point of view. Technically, we had no problems with the test configuration: Potion Permit is not demanding and the minimum system requirements are quite accommodating. In the period leading up to the release of the game, the team released several updates to fix some bugs that we have not had direct experience with. We appreciated the sound design, capable of making a pleasant counterpoint to the adventure, with some catchy (and whistleable in your spare time!) themes. We recommend, if possible, to use headphones for an enveloping effect; pity about some abrupt transitions in sound effects in some cutscenes and game situations. Potion Permit is not localized in Italian Finally, we remind you that Potion Permit is not currently availableequipped with an Italian translation: to better appreciate the details of the story, read the interesting descriptions of potions, ingredients and inhabitants of Moonbury - unlockable by gaining their trust and carrying out missions for them - it will be necessary to have a good knowledge of the language English.", "date": "2022-09-22", "grade": "7.2"}
