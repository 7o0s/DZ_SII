It reminded me a lot of a Namco arcade game in which you had to pedal (really) and fly around with a propeller tool looking for balloons (...sorry but at 01.47 in the night I don't remember the name) and it also made me think to the sections of Spyro 3 on Psone in which you play with the airplane, same slow game mode, I say slow because Sky Odyssey is not a frenetic product like Wipeout, the sensation of speed is never very high even using the most popular airplane models powerful (I hope this is intentional and not a limitation of 3D engine). Graphically, the game isn't bad, with well-crafted models and various scenarios, but the orchestral music certainly deserves the highest rating. The physical behavior in flight which also varies according to the climatic conditions (if you want to pass one meter from a mountain you will also have to take into account the wind factor) is well done, in my opinion, the real gem of the whole production. Sky Odyssey is part of that category of games where the beauty comes once you become familiar with the control system. The raytraced presentation is nothing special, the entire game was developed to reside on DVD media. Control tower, I'm running out of words As written a few lines above, before buying it you have to take into account that the game setting is very ~nice~ and not at all ~angry~ a kind of ~CHORO Q~ of the air (Penny Racer in the Pal version) with a playability nice but a far from eternal longevity on the contrary .. sometimes it touches peaks of real frustration due to the excessive difficulty of some missions. The feeling that the game is a demo with ~something incomplete~ and that Sky Odyssey 2 will probably be improved leads me to write that this title is only recommended for fans of the genre who were anxiously awaiting a simulator for Ps2 or whoever wants to a different game.. the real strong point of the product, which is not ugly but not a Killer Application either. Control tower, I'm running out of words Pros: Well done and uncomplicated control A different game Cons: Some flaws on the game structure Some missions are too hostile The airplane game The first flight simulator has finally landed on Third Place, finally even today's consoles have the strength to move entire landscapes in three dimensions.. has the Cross team managed to exploit all this and create the killer that many have been waiting for? I remember seeing a clip of this game a long time ago.. it was talked about since before the Playstation 2 arrived in Europe, so I must admit that I was very curious to find out how this Sky Odyssey from Sony Japan came out that dares to challenge the glorious simulators on pc.", "date": "2001-05-05", "grade": null}
