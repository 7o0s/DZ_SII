In the early 1990s, developer Greg Johnson had a vision that led him to create one of SEGA's most popular Mega Drive titles, ToeJam & Earl. It was an isometric action-adventure game in which the homonymous aliens, who crashed on Earth by mistake, had to deal with the antics of the earthlings while trying to fix their spaceship. Johnson must have remained very close to this concept because Doki-Doki Universe, the first title of the small software house HumaNature, revolves around it. The result is a sort of cross between an adventure and a puzzle-game that doesn't fully convince from a gameplay point of view, but of course there's more... Doki-Doki Universe is a meaningful experience, but as a game it's a bit disappointing The robot who knew how to love Despite the artistic style chosen - the absolutely peculiar one of the Chinese designer I-Wei Huang - the first images of Doki-Doki Universe are absolutely brutal, especially if you love animals. The protagonist, a little robot who responds to the initials QT3, is abandoned by a little family leaving for the holidays on a small asteroid, together with a balloon that practically becomes his only friend in Cast Away style. Through the simple but direct animations of the characters, we understand that the family has promised QT3 to come back for him, and of course within a few seconds we understand that decades have passed since that moment, and that QT3 has never stopped waiting for his masters. Alone. In the space. Like a dog on the side of the highway, come on, the parallelism is clear. It is immediately clear that Doki-Doki Universe hides something very particular under those rough lines that draw its characters. QT3 is soon joined by an alien tasked with returning him to the original factory to ~reset~ him, nullifying his personality in order to put him back on the market. There is a way out, however: to demonstrate that you understand the human soul. Then begins a journey around the galaxy: QT3 will have to visit the various planets and relate to their inhabitants. Each planet is unique in its own way, but the character and behavior of the characters all refer to absolutely... earthly psychological themes. On the planet Ert, for example, QT3 will have to discover the concept of ~pride~ and help a scarecrow to fix a big mess: he has forgotten the birthday of a chick who, in turn, does not want to admit in any way how much this hurt him. It is a real chain of events: the other inhabitants on the planet all need help, but only by solving their problems in the right order is it possible to reach the conclusion of the mini-plot, completing all the various ~quizzes~ along the way. ~. PSVita trophies 11 bronze, 2 silver and 1 gold trophies can be unlocked. Moreover, it is quite simple: just complete the various quizzes proposed and the related mini-plots. Interactions with various characters and some particular actions are also rewarded, as well as the collection of various collectibles. Communicating is important Each Doki-Doki Universe character has their own tastes: there are those who like the color red and those who hate animals, for example, and everyone particularly appreciates a certain type of greeting. QT3 can simply wave his hand (just slide your fingers horizontally on the rear touch pad) or make a polite bow (slide your fingers vertically on the back of the console) or even send a kiss to his interlocutor (a circle on the rear touch pad). If addressed to the right character, a greeting will earn us hearts, also making us more likeable. With certain characters, the situation is completely opposite: they will appreciate you only if you are rude towards them. Increased the hate or sympathy index to the maximum, we will receive a gift that contains a decoration for our home planet or a so-called ~summonable~, practically a kind of sticker. The summonables are also obtained by solving the problems of the inhabitants or moving the elements of the seabed with the fingers on the touch screen: they allow us to satisfy the requests of the inhabitants and consequently unlock even more objects. A character might want to have breakfast, and we'll have to find a sticker that represents a cup of milk. Soon, Doki-Doki Univese turns into a chain of quizzes, as the game itself calls them, which must be solved to unlock the objects necessary to satisfy the various ricask. The idea is simple, the stories of the various characters are often very touching and the freedom of choice granted to the player is scrutinized by a kind of psychologist who will try to explain the reason for our decisions. Something, however, is not working. The touch control system is very inaccurate, which makes it quite frustrating to greet the other characters or satisfy some requests, such as the grieving little man to console with a hug by acting on the rear touch pad. The problem is easily stemmed by playing Doki-Doki Universe on PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 (it's cross-buy and cross-save) also because the PlayStation Vita version is undermined by inexplicable and annoying clicks of the interface and screens. Beyond the technical flaws and the rather useless function that allows you to send messages via Facebook with the stickers unlocked in the game, the real problem of Doki-Doki Universe is repetitiveness: the first quizzes already show almost everything the game has to offer, and however deep its meaning may be, it is not easy to appreciate the gameplay that underpins it when it risks becoming boring within a few minutes. The overall duration, however, is quite small, although several paid DLCs have already been announced with new quizzes and planets to explore.", "date": "2013-12-16", "grade": "7.0"}
