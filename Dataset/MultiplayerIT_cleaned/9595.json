With the advent of PS3 and, above all, of PSN, SingStar then had the opportunity to improve and enhance itself, thanks to the interaction capabilities that the free online network set up by Sony was able to offer to the large community. Support for PlayStation Eye also meant that a multitude of users created an online profile linked to their SingStar and were able to publish, as in a sort of musical ~Youtube~, amusing videos of their personal singing performances. However, thanks to the advent of Move, and the consequent SingStar Dance, all the new Lady Gaga or the improvised Backstreet Boys kept at bay so far can finally give free rein to their desire for unbridled movement. Singing and dancing, what a passion! SingStar Dance is therefore the latest incarnation of this long-lived series of party games produced by Sony; however, if all or almost all the other available episodes (with the exception of SingStar Guitar) can be considered as simple update data-discs, it is here that the dance revolution appears for the first time, finally capable of expanding and modifying the gaming experience. Therefore, without creating a new IP, the only brand theoretically capable of capturing the ~long wave~ of dance could only be SingStar; this operation, while bringing the right amount of novelty, has not changed the philosophy of entertainment that revolves around this historic series. The software that drives SingStar Dance is in fact formally identical to that of all the other previous episodes: from the initial menu, you can choose how to approach the game between the classic single player, cooperative or competitive multiplayer and training, without forgetting the usual general settings both technical and game. However, the real novelty occurs when a song is selected: in addition to choosing to perform it in singer mode, in fact, if the system recognizes the presence of at least one Move, dance mode is also enabled, for a theoretical total of 4 player engaged simultaneously. Naturally, it is possible to vary the number and type of participants in the session as desired: for example, 2 players can play with a singer and a dancer, or 3 players with two dancers and a singer or vice versa; however, it is not possible to impersonate 4 dancers or 4 singers. If you decide to face a dance session in 2 then, the classic cooperative can be accompanied by a sort of ~pas de deux~ mode, in which the dancers have the opportunity to interact with each other during the choreographies (no aerial grips though, fortunately). Playstation 3 trophies If in possession of any episode of SingStar for PS3, SingStar Dance is limited to adding to the list of 35 standard trophies present only six new achievements, linked exclusively to the performances of dancers. In case of first use, however, it will also be possible to unlock all the classic trophies connected to singing performances, for a total of 41. Follow the trail From the point of view of the gameplay linked to the sung part, there is nothing new to report (apart from obviously the tracklist, which we will discuss in the appropriate box): the faithful mechanics of the series remain, with the video text to be sung indicated by the classic blue and red colors and the score indicator with synthetic judgments positioned on the side. The situation regarding the management of the ballad part is different: after a short calibration, which almost literally recalls that of Sport Champions in terms of simplicity and movements to be performed (and which should not be repeated after each song, despite the possibility of repeating it if you want to let friends of different body types appear), they will appear on the right of the TV up to two nice characters, dressed in a manner appropriate to the song, who will begin to dance. The task of the players will be to follow the various choreographies as far as possible, paying attention to the movements of both the digitally-guided dancers and those of any dance partner, in order to avoid amusing but extremely dangerous clashes of limbs! PlayStation Move, as we know, is generally very precise in recording every movement and also on this occasion the peripheral proves to be up to the situation; however the particular nature of the game, which provides for the theoretical movement of the whole body and certainly not of just one hand, emphasizes some gaps in the gameplay mechanics typical of this type of detection.Although in fact the reference dancers suggest very varied and articulated movements, in attempting to execute them it is not always possible to verify their actual correspondence, precisely because the legs and the other hand are not actually traced by the software; in any case, the masterly precision of the single constantly monitored hand partially manages to make up for this deficiency, thanks also to a brilliant trick linked to the colored LED present on each Move. In fact, from the light of the controller a trail emerges on the screen, which precisely marks the movements made: comparing the trail (and not only the position of the luminous ball) to the movements of the dancers thus makes the detection much more reliable. The precision required when performing a dance will vary according to the level of difficulty, which can be set as for the sung part in easy, medium and difficult. Little to say instead on the technical front: the title, if played in the dance version, shows the PlayStation Eye shot as a video background of the song, while if used in the ~old way~ it will reproduce the videos of the chosen songs according to tradition. However, a particular warning should be addressed to those who intend to use SingStar Dance on a small television, perhaps a cathode ray tube one: the game hud, especially if you are facing a session with 4 players, is particularly rich in information which all together they cover a large area of the screen; this condition could inevitably make full use of the game's potential difficult. Tracklist, SingStore and Upgrade of previous songs The SingStar Dance disc contains no less than 30 songs, all obviously very lively and divided between immortal classics (just mention ~I will Survive~ by Gloria Gaynor or ~Girls Just Wanna Have Fun~ by Cindy Lauper) and pop hits of the last years, with the likes of N Sync, Shaggy, Backstreet Boys or Jamiroquai. Naturally Lady Gaga and her Poker Face are not missing, a song that has become a sort of permanent presence in similar productions, as well as the Black Eyed Peas (~Shut Up~), Pitbull (~I Know You Want Me~), Outkast (~Hey Ya!) and many others. The game also allows access to the SingStore, which is obviously the same from which it is possible to make purchases using any other SingStar release. At the same time as the release of the dance version of the franchise, however, in the store a new section has been created, in which it is possible to choose the songs to purchase based on the type of use (sung and ~played~ for SingStar Guitar, sung and danced for SingStar Dance). While the price of a single ~simple~ song is remained unchanged at 1.49 euros, the upgrade to make it danceable (or playable) costs an additional 50 cents.Through your personal account, the system will show you if there are any upgrades available for your previously purchased songs. it is constantly expanding but, it should be remembered, for exclusively singing use the same properties apply as always, including the well-known possibility of changing the disc inserted without leaving the game (also using the PS2 versions).", "date": "2010-12-03", "grade": "7.8"}
