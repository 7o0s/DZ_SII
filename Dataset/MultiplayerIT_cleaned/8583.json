{"name": "Un Arkanoid tutto italiano", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101658-wooopup-un-arkanoid-tutto-italiano.html", "text": "woOOPuP was developed by Bedroom Studio, already authors of Orbitroid and Avatar Orbitroid, for Microsoft's digital delivery platform and is now available in the section dedicated to Indie Games. Bedroom Studio are very Italian and they develop from Genoa, it is a company that in addition to developing videogames deals with IT on a widespread level, let's see how they approached the videogame genre this time and what woOOPuP deals with in detail. Do you know Arkanoid, the historic brick game in which we had the task of managing a single cursor to bounce a ball against blocks located at the top of the screen with the aim of destroying them? Simple and ingenious at the same time, remember that it was the 80s, it didn't take much to make it a real must and in reality it still is, given that it is possible to find it in many mobile phones equipped with a minimum of multimedia applications. This long premise is just to indicate that woOOPuP is essentially a celebration of Arkanoid, a new clone with redone and colorful graphics. Just the graphics are one of the components that stand out in the Bedroom Studio product since it is really accurate and has a seventies look, with the right amount of psychedelia and a very good clean image. 50 levels The game is structured on the basis of 50 levels that can be unlocked as you progress, these are often interspersed (after obtaining good combinations of destruction and various points) by bonus levels which are actually an opportunity to ~refuse~ for a moment and try to bring home as many points as possible. But be careful, in case of distraction the loss of a life will still be counted and could cause the definitive game over. Once the levels have been unlocked, you can start your games from your favorite stage, without necessarily having to start all over again, an intelligent choice on the part of the developers and which leaves a good deal of freedom to set up the game sessions to your liking . It is clear that to score points it will be necessary to start the challenges from the first stage but the fact remains that due to the way it has been set up it is really difficult not to be able to see all the 50 levels available, which would certainly have been more frustrating by constraining the I always start from the first pattern. The gameplay works perfectly with many power ups that certainly won't let you get bored, including magnets and machine guns with which to enrich the cursor. Fluidity is always guaranteed and a little confusion is created only with some special effects with many balls in action on the screen at the same time, here in these cases it is a bit difficult to manage the cursor but it is still a good show. The commands always respond with the right reactivity, perhaps only in some stages, those with the blocks closest to the bottom of the screen, patience is put to the test since the reaction time is really minimal. So all right? In reality one cannot be dissatisfied with woOOPuP which does perfectly what it was created for, entertaining without too much effort and effort. However, the only real criticism that also invalidates our judgment is the not too much variety of the stages and above all the lack of originality, we are in the presence of an Arkanoid clone which, however, takes little of its own to enrich a dated but already is valid.", "date": "2012-04-20", "grade": "7.0"}
