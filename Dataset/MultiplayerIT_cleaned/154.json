{"name": "Dynasty Warriors Vol.2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynasty-warriors-vol2.html", "text": "Dynasty Warriors Vol.2 is a stark hack'n'slash Space halberd! (more or less) Dynasty Warriors Vol.2 (this is the complete title of the game) as previously announced does not deviate from the cornerstones of the series: the game structure remains a naked and raw hack'n'slash, where you will impersonate the hero of the moment who, armed of his favorite iron, he will make his way through whole armies demonstrating superhuman fighting skills. Taking a step back, the main mode of this Dynasty Warriors is represented by the Musou, nothing but the story mode, in which the player will have to choose between one of the three legendary dynasties present (Shu, Wu and Wei) and consequently between one of the characters belonging to it. Each character will obviously have his own characteristics and fighting style on paper, on a practical level on the battlefield all characters are equal: the only differences to ~weigh~ are the length of the weapons, with the heroes equipped with spades and sticks a little less powerful but with a much wider range or with faster and more lethal swords. One of the parameters that effectively alters game strategies is represented by the ~command~ parameter, a number that represents the quantity (and quality) of usable allied force on the field. Once the deployment and virtual alter-ego have been decided, you will be catapulted into battle following short, absolutely disconnected and meaningless dialogues, which fail to give a single thread to the story by providing honor as a preferential pretext for battles. The battle scheme is represented by a map divided into small square areas, colored red if not yet conquered and blue if already under friendly control. Within some areas of the map, particular red icons representing the presence of an enemy general on the ground will also be signaled; the presence of the supreme commander will instead be signaled with the same red icon but with a white border. Within each micro-area, a separate battle will take place, which will be overcome either by demoralizing the enemy ranks (substantially reducing the number of enemies, bringing it down to zero units) or even more simply by attacking particular sensitive targets ( such as enemy generals) to force them to retreat. Each battle will have particular victory and defeat conditions: the former will usually be associated with the defeat of one or more enemy commanders, while the latter will be linked to the survival time of one's allies, a special counter (whose seconds can be increased by unlocking particular objectives) which will mark the time available to the player to bring the campaign to a victorious conclusion. One billion inhabitants within reach of 16:9 The big, substantial difference between the home versions of Dinasty Warriors is represented by the breadth of the settings: if on ps2 you actually had the sensation of moving inside an immense battlefield, on PSP the arenas are mere handkerchiefs of land often and willingly represented in a repetitive manner, with dull textures and forgettable architectures. What comes out of it is a sort of series of mini-fights lasting a few minutes in which all you do is move continuously, mowing down enemy soldiers in an attempt to increase your kill counter, the bar for special moves and that of the musou (temporary condition of immortality). At the end of each campaign, depending on the actions performed in battle, the ~story~ will take on a particular branching (the choice of one branch rather than another is often dictated by which of the two enemy commanders one is going to kill on the battlefield), until you reach a total of five different chapters. Also at the end of each chapter, based on their progress, the player will be given the opportunity to increase the skills of the officers, increasing their level, thus improving their skills; the same goes for the mounts (also unlockable during the campaigns, one of the first is - for example - the elephant) which will increase in skill depending on how many kills you make on the battlefield using them in the first person. In addition to the Musou mode, it will be possible to undertake the free mode, a useful option for becoming aware of the game's commands; the Camp section will allow you to exchange officers with another owner of the game (there are more than three hundred in total), to check the status and equipment of each character in the game and to change the background of the home page with the game menu. Finally the multiplayer mode (only and exclusively ad hoc, or with a UMD of the game foreach player) offers a series of ~mini-games~ of classic fighting game heritage, with a sort of time attack, a survival mode, a battle royal and a kind of ~hot potato~ (pass me the term, it's child's play and the name I think varies from region to region) in which a player is in possession of a bomb that he can pass to his opponents simply by knocking them down like any enemy, when time runs out the bomb will do its duty and one unfortunate player will be out of the game. One billion inhabitants within reach of 16:9 Completing the game is difficult, more than for the non-effective difficulty of the game, for the frustrating repetitiveness with which everything takes place One billion inhabitants within reach of 16:9 According to Koei's plans, to have the total vision of the events on which Dinasty Warriors Vol.2 gravitates, it would be necessary to finish the game (and therefore complete all the ramifications) with all the characters present from the beginning and which will subsequently be unlocked. The undertaking is difficult, rather than for the non-effective difficulty of the game, for the frustrating repetitiveness with which everything takes place: the fights offer no starting point and the strategies do not change one iota whether you fight on horseback, against a soldier or a commander; graphically it remains light years away from the home versions and presents itself as an indistinct jumble of settings with a pseudo-Chinese flavor; and finally the story: it should play a role of primary importance to link the various sections of the game, entice the player to continue the adventure and discover what the other crossroads hide, and instead it limits itself to offering a few rambling dialogues that speak of honor offended, betrayals and a few other clichs. Dynasty Warriors presents itself to PSP owners in one of its perhaps less successful forms, missing the cornerstones of the series such as the characterization of the settings, the plot and that classic gameplay model that over the years has made it recognizable with your eyes closed. Koei has tried to direct its efforts towards something more attractive for a portable console, partially succeeding. Fans of the genre and of the series will surely be able to enjoy a few hours, strong doubts remain about all the other video game lovers. Probably if you have to try a title like Dynasty Warriors it is better to look at something blacker, bigger and with two pads with wire connected on the two front doors. Pros: Obviously designed to allow short games Definitely long-lived Many unlockable elements Cons: The strengths of Dynasty Warriors on consoles are missing Graphically just enough Repetitive For once, let's start a review with a riddle with clues, obviously the answer is represented by a video game. The series was born on Playstation, is set in ancient China in the age of honor, swords and blood; and, last hint: the genre of the game is the classic Hack'n'Slash, endless armies are fought relying almost exclusively only on their own extraordinary forces and on the help of a small army of faithful. If you haven't gotten there yet, it's because perhaps there isn't a single answer to the question, since the days of the first Playstation, many Dynasty Warriors have virtually trodden the lands of Sony by alternately being appreciated and mistreated, up to this second portable experience. Will the war heroes be able to carve out a place in the already crowded list of PSP titles, the task seems difficult for Koei's favorite godson, perhaps this time swords, halberds and spades will not be enough to win the hearts of gamers.", "date": "2007-01-24", "grade": null}
