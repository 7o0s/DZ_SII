{"name": "Floppy Knights", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/floppy-knights-recensione.html", "text": "The genre system is a cornerstone of the video game industry, just as it has always been for any branch of entertainment. However, when these genres consolidate into settled codes, it often happens that unpublished hybridizations are used to find new and lively solutions, just as we see in this review of Floppy Knights. We usually see RPG variations that take roguelike elements, dungeon crawlers and create mixed intermediates of various types, but recently cards have also begun to be increasingly taken into consideration for these particular videogame experiments. The solution proposed by Rose City Games is particularly original and also works very well: it is a question of taking the typical turn-based strategy structure and varying it a bit with the insertion of cards and the ~deck building~ dynamics that derive from these and the result is a good mix between the reasoning of tactics and the chaos of the randomness of the cards, combined with a progression system that is still present. The story is very simple: in an enchanted world dominated by magic, the protagonist Phoebe is a rebellious girl who is totally fascinated by technology and looks with contempt on the magical arts. This puts her in an embarrassing situation especially for her parents, who would like to see her routed towards some quiet employment or in the study of magic. However, Phoebe has a winning strategy ready for her life: winning the Gadget Contest organized by the nearby town and thus being able to earn everyone's respect, as well as a nice nest egg with which maybe she can go live alone and remove her parents from the embarrassment of a wayward daughter still at home. And what is Phoebe's brilliant idea? Not so much her sentient mechanical arm Carlton, which with its artificial intelligence would probably be enough to win her the Nobel Prize (if it existed in this world), but the invention of the Floppy Knights, or fighters and powers that spring from old floppy disks, elaborated by Carlton to become strange beings halfway between vegetables and toy soldiers. Turn-based and card combat Floppy Knights, a cutscene with demonstration of Phoebe's invention Phoebe's idea is therefore to present her Floppy Knights at the Gadget Contest and win big for manifest superiority, but the road to get to the contest is long and strangely full of problems. In fact, as soon as our protagonist leaves the house she finds herself having to cross a map full of stages, each corresponding to an increasingly demanding fight, which only enriches the protagonist's business plan. Combining the useful with the profitable, ours sets out to solve the problems of various inhabitants of the vicinity by carrying out the fate of quests, each linked to a series of strategic clashes on the field, obtaining in exchange various coins and also additional cards to put in the Floppy Knights deck. The clashes take place on a map made up of boxes, precisely following the rules of turn-based strategy. The closest examples are probably Fire Emblem and Advance Wars, titles also referred to by various solutions in terms of interface, so if you have experience with these you will find yourself quite comfortable in this game. Floppy Knights, the strategy map of the game However, what upsets all the standard dynamics is the presence of the cards, which in fact profoundly modify the classic gameplay of the strategic: this not so much in terms of the actions to be carried out, which remain substantially the same between troop movements, attacks, defense and conquest (each linked to the specific statistics and abilities of the individual units), but rather as regards the availability of these actions, which depends on the extraction of the cards at each turn. To give a practical example and particularly widespread in game action, the movement of the ~troops~ does not occur by default every turn, but it is necessary to use the appropriate card and the same happens for various other options considered standard in the strategic, such as the deployment of units and the use of special attacks. Only the direct attack with one's service weapon and within the expected range of the character is guaranteed in any case, but everything else depends on the ~hand~ of cards that is drawn from the deck each turn. Strategy and deck builder together Floppy Knights, the management of the deck of cards This mixed structure forces us to deal with a greater quantity of variables: there are not only the typical strategic parameters to take into consideration - here, however, particularly stringent as in Fire Emblem, considering that a precedence in the attack often means the victory of the battle - but also the randomness of the moves that are randomly taken from the deck from turn to turn. For this reason, the challenge rate is quite high even in the first clashes, immediately requiring great attention to the moves available and the range of action of the enemies. However, it is not just a matter of chance, of course: the very concept of deck building is based on a deeper strategic setting, focused on the construction of the combat deck. We must prepare the card endowment in order to have a fair amount of units to deploy (which increase in variety and power as rewards as the levels progress) and balance attacks and powers with a good assortment of movement-cards, essential for being able to do anything in battle. The construction and management of the deck therefore becomes a fundamental element of the gameplay and a section in which you will have to spend some time to reach the right degree of competitiveness. In addition to the selection of cards to be included in the deck, which also includes the choice of one's ~captain~, i.e. the most important floppy Knight of the army, on whose survival the fate of the battle is played, it is also necessary to devote oneself to card crafting, which actually takes place in a very simplified way through the spending of the money collected on more or less expensive types of cards. Floppy Knights, a moment of confrontation The flip side of the coin, in all this tactics, is precisely given by a certain cumbersomeness of the system. Despite the facetious and laughing look, which recalls 90s cartoons and illustrated books for children, the whole system is rather heavy, with often long and complex games. The rhythm is always very staid, moreover the impossibility of canceling the last operation carried out represents a certain additional difficulty that could have been avoided in favor of a more dynamic and permissive system. Between Advance Wars and Saturday morning cartoons Floppy Knights, a cutscene The characterization chosen by Rose City Games manages perfectly to create a splendid atmosphere, positioning itself halfway between the comic look of Advance Wars and the typical ~Saturday morning cartoon~. This cheerful style underlines the rather surreal story of Floppy Knights, which presents itself as a sort of modern fable between a coming-of-age story and a picaresque, but all set on a parody of modern times, starring an eccentric and nonconformist girl intent on emerging in a society too set on ancient values, overturning their certainties. At the end of the day it's a story that doesn't take itself seriously at all, but which still has some interesting ideas and features characters that it's easy to get attached to with remarkable speed. The production is obviously limited in terms of resources invested and the cutscenes are largely static, with the story being told through rather brilliant dialogue.", "date": "2022-05-30", "grade": "8.0"}
