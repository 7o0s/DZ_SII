{"name": "Kirby: Mouse Attack - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kirby-mouse-attack-recensione.html", "text": "A matter of principle The premise that once again gives Kirby the opportunity to show off all his impressive potential is probably the most ridiculous, in a positive sense, ever to appear in the history of video games: on a quiet and sleepy afternoon in Dream Land, our little pink friend is about to sink jaws in a tasty piece of cake when it - Zap! - the cake disappears! But the ball is endowed with fine investigative intuition and wastes no time (really, not even a second!) to reach the conclusion that it is nothing more than a new, evil, sadistic and perverse plan by King Dedede, his penguin-esque arch-nemesis history, whose blasphemous and diabolical goal is evidently ... to eat it himself! And so the time comes for Kirby to embark on a new, epic adventure through eight worlds divided into various levels, at the conclusion of which, after facing a thousand and a thousand unspeakable trials, he will finally be able to get his hands on his hard-earned snack. Sure, probably when you get to the end of the cake it will be reduced to a pile of rancid and smelly matter, but what does it mean, it's the principle that counts. And don't laugh, we could quote you wars that started for much less... It's just a pity that, soon, ours will realize the terrible mistake: this time King Dedede had nothing to do with it, and it was a gang who stole the dessert of intergalactic thieves, the Squeaks, who led by the perfidious Daroach will infest all game levels from now on. Oh God, that doesn't save the innocent Dedede from taking his usual dose of blows once again, but we, good-natured, will turn a blind eye and won't quibble about the gratuitous violence exercised by the apparently innocent pink hero. After all, good old habits should never be lost! Treasure hunt Those who have even the slightest idea of what Kirby's platformers were up to The Dark Design will have no problem imagining what they will be faced with once the DS is turned on. The fundamental ability of the character, which is basically almost completely harmless, is to suck up enemies and swallow them (and this will also be rendered in a childish and colorful way, but if you think about it, it's a death worthy of a survival horror! ) to appropriate their attack capabilities. There are several, over twenty, in Mouse Attack, and if many are already very well known to fans of the series, you will find a couple of totally new ones, and in general a decent update work a bit on all the skills, with new moves and etc. In addition, Kirby can inhale anything and, instead of swallowing it, hold it in his mouth like a pelican and then spit it out to eliminate another enemy creature or an element of the scenario; finally, the last of the peculiarities of the character is that of inflating excessively to float placidly in the air, which is equivalent, in the end, to the possibility of flying far and wide across the game worlds. As you can easily deduce if you are already familiar with the series (and if you don't have it, trust me!), no significant innovation has been made to the nice sphere: and this is where the touch screen comes into play, the use of which is all in all quite sparing but quite effective. In fact, the lower screen displays none other than Kirby's belly, who this time will have the possibility of storing up to a maximum of five objects, including skills (but only those that in the game world are imprisoned in a bubble), which can either, simply, be used later at the most appropriate moment, or, and this is the real novelty brought to the game formula, be combined with each other to create more effective objects or completely new abilities! Even the game scheme does not change: we are still in the field of the most linear and simple 2D platformers that exist. Treasure hunt Even the game scheme does not change: we are still in the field of the most linear and simple 2D platformers that exist. If your goal is simply to get to the end, the commitment required of an average experience player is objectively very low, even if the level design and game situations are on average very interesting. But it would be a shame to limit ourselves to just this: Kirby's attraction lies on the one hand in experimenting with the various skills available and all the techniques they offer, a possibility now also fueled by the fact of being able to combine two different skills together with the consequent eagerness to experience everything and more, on the other hand above all lies in the presence of various secrets, materialized here in treasure chests present up to a maximum of three in each level. If you want to complete the entire collection, 120 intotal, then the challenge, above all mental, reaches very stimulating levels: mind you, you will never appear before you, unless you are completely new to 2D platforming, an insurmountable obstacle, but understanding the road to take or the skill to use to get to that specific chest definitely feels good! Among the chests, moreover, there are some bigger and presumably more valuable ones, only that as soon as you grab one of these, a Squeak will appear: thus begins a battle with the bosses, characterized in an original way both by the actual fight, which also bears of moderate difficulty, or from a chase that will see you busy reaching the end of the level before the thief catches you! And what do these blessed coffers contain that so tickle the lusts of possession of the marauding mice? Of everything! From new potential to be exploited during the game, to very nice extras such as the possibility of coloring Kirby, puzzles to compose, music player with which to listen to the motifs of the game and so on, up to real secret levels! And then, completing a game 100% is always advisable, you never know what might happen after the end credits... Dream lands To make the playful experience more pulpy and complete, there are the beauty of 3 (three!) mini-games, unlocked from the beginning, all centered on the stylus and touch screen, to be played alone to beat your own records or in multiplayer, up to to four players not necessarily each with their own game card; the proposed challenges are interesting and fun, but objectively with all the party games that are on the market today, we hardly see you busy organizing an evening with friends in the name of Kirby Mouse Attack multiplayer... Let's simply say that for those who wants there is, but his absence would not have taken away a tenth from the final judgement. Technically speaking, Flagship have clearly recycled the assets of the two GBA games: sprites and background elements are more than simple dej-vu, which isn't necessarily a bad thing given the high quality (there are backgrounds that are beautifully designed and as evocative as those by a 2D Square artist, just to mention the top in the field), but it will leave a bitter taste in the mouth of those who want to see the DS hardware always put to the whip. Here the two ARM processors are limited, compared to the ancestors on the GBA, to display more sprites and effects on the screen while maintaining fluidity stable. Without infamy and without praise, and we are finally at the conclusion, the sound: the usual nice little tunes and the usual nice effects, which for centuries have been accompanying the characterization of Kirby and his world. If you have never digested the sweetness of the Hal mascot, it will certainly not be Mouse Attack that will make you change your mind... We certainly wouldn't have been offended if Hal and Nintendo had offered us the same concept of The Dark Design again, perhaps with all the additions and implications of the case; however, we have to make the best of a bad situation for this full return to the origins of the character, and in hindsight it is not even a great effort given that Mouse Attack easily stands on the same, very high average quality a bit of all its predecessors. There isn't much to say that can't be said about any other Kirby: buy it if you love the character, buy it if you want a simple and relaxing but also intriguing and stimulating challenge, buy it if you are fasting on 2D platformers and want start. Only think twice if you're bored with it by now: the few innovations due to the touch screen are nice and well implemented, but far from revolutionary. Pros Tested structure Always interesting level design Kirby's world is crazy and sweet as always! Cons Very little news Isn't it boring for you? The Dark Design, Kirby's first and up to now only adventure for Nintendo DS, is even considered by many players as the best playful experience on the two-screen laptop: in addition to the proverbial mastery in creating always interesting and fun game situations , a large part of the success of the title was due to the basic idea that exploited the touch screen far and wide, with the player who essentially had to create, drawing them on the screen, the platforms necessary for the pallet to continue. It would therefore only have been a good and right thing to resort to the same scheme for the new appearance of Kirby on DS, a scheme which was however very little used later by other products, but no! With Mouse Attack we return to the ancient concept that appeared since the days of the NES, and the Flagships return to the helm, a team that, not surprisingly, also signed the two Kirby apparsi on GBA.", "date": "2007-07-27", "grade": null}
