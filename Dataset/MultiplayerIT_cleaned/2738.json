Quite rare qualities in the context of the fighting game genre, it is no coincidence that a year after its release, the latest fresh chapter winner at the recent Game Awards, which probably represents the qualitative summa of this new path, continues to arouse a strong interest both in the public of enthusiasts and in that made up of more casual players. One of the reasons that prompted the developer to create a new special edition also for PlayStation 5 and Xbox One Series X | S entitled Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, which in addition to a significant technological update, introduces support for cross-play between console players current-gen and last-gen, and all DLC released to date, starting with Aftermath, up to all 37 fighters, including the recent Rain, Mileena and Rambo, previously featured in Kombat Pack 2. Cosmetics Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, you will have understood from the introduction, is in fact the definitive version of the game of NetherRealm Studios. Therefore, without going too far in the description of the modalities and the more subtle facets of the Activision production, for which we refer you to the review of the original version, let's go straight to the heart of the matter, or to its peculiarities. On a strictly visual level, Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate keeps all its intrinsic qualities unchanged, presenting a cosmetic that leaves no room for excessive regrets despite the fact that there is no clear break with the past generation of consoles. The excellent polygonal models of the on-screen characters are almost unchanged, detailed and provided with sets of fluid and realistic animations, the title appears visually more defined, cleaner with the dynamic 4K resolution, and with a system of lights and particle effects that seem to enhance thanks to the hardware power of PlayStation 5. Even the scenarios, already well characterized and defined from the start, obviously gain in depth and detail thanks to HDR, which as is well known allows you to view a richer range of colors, brighter whites and very black deep. All this is corroborated by the excellent solidity of the framerate, practically nailed to sixty frames per second, without ever an uncertainty. As for the audio sector, nothing to complain about with regard to the effects and musical accompaniment, with songs able to adequately follow the evolution of the various meetings. The work done on the Italian dubbing is also commendable, for the most part well recited even during the fights. So if we want to find a flaw in the PlayStation 5 version, we have to look at the lack of enhancement of the exclusive features of DualSense. From this point of view, it is a pity that, for example, the adaptive triggers have not been exploited to transmit, depending on the mapping, the sensation of weight when blocking or grappling, or the haptic feedback to ~feel~ a well-aimed blow, given or received. Next-gen Fatalities In our examination of the NetherRealm Studios title, we have obviously not forgotten the gameplay, or rather, the ~effects~ on this aspect of the game in the transition to more performing hardware. In this sense it must be said that if the playability is the same as always, beautiful, deep, varied, with the devastating X-Ray, the Brutalities to mutilate the now annihilated opponent, the Crushing Blows and the Friendships, it is also true which in this edition takes advantage of the ~generational leap~, thanks to the power of the console, which guarantees greater fluidity to the game. Not that Mortal Kombat basically sinned in this sense, but on PlayStation 5 everything is still much more fluid and ~fast~ at 60Fps, with loading times reduced to the bone. With this Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, we anticipated it in the introduction, three new heroes also become available for all game sessions. The first is Rain, illegitimate son of the god Argus, the Protector of Edenia: he is a versatile character, with his powerful attacks and his ability to cover distances easily thanks to the powers of the water element, which make him more ideally similar to Raiden than to the other ninjas on the roster. The second, Mileena, is a ~physical~, aggressive fighter: her Sai daggers and the power of teleportation provide some strategic options that can make her extremely dangerous in any type of attack. Finally, the third is one of the figsure icon of world cinema, namely John Rambo. The former Vietnam veteran does not unbalance the relationships within the roster, but he is capable of being dangerous both from medium and long range, especially thanks to his AK-47 and powerful bow. Finally, as far as online is concerned, there is an important novelty, namely the possibility of being able to use the personalized variants of the characters also for competitive multiplayer modes, both classified and tournaments. Until now, in competitive play, gamers could only use two pre-set variants for each character. Quite an interesting introduction, because together with the Krossplay function, for now limited to current-gen and last-gen PlayStation-Xbox users in random games and designated online rooms (which work quite well in terms of netcode and matchmaking), it enriches the multiplayer game experience and, at least on paper, makes fighting against human opponents even more uncertain and different. Even if the function needs to be tested in the long term.", "date": "2020-12-11", "grade": "9.0"}
