{"name": "My Animal Centre in Australia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-animal-centre-in-australia-recensione.html", "text": "We will all remember that wonderful phase of our life when our strongest desire was to become a veterinarian. In Australia. In short, perhaps not for everyone, but the veterinary profession has certainly always exercised a certain fascination on those who, as a young or very young person, have shown a certain interest and passion for the world of animals. My Animal Center in Australia is in fact a game certainly aimed at a rather young age group, who has not passed the first period of adolescence, probably aimed at a female audience and fascinated by the idea of being able to take care of poor sick or wounded, stimulating that innate maternal sense that little girls normally tend to show. Australia, the background on which the game is set, helps to make the game more original, thanks to an exotic touch and the presence of local animals, mostly little known to us. In fact, the game manages to differ from the large number of simulators of professions that are present on the market right now thanks to its informative characteristics, which allow learning in some form by playing. in a remote location in Australia. Our task will naturally be to take care of and restore health to the animals that will be brought to us, mostly by local gamekeepers. Some of them will need to be hospitalized to reach full recovery, which will naturally involve the need to feed them, keep their enclosures clean, play with them and, of course, to have the necessary structures to be able to accommodate them adequately. A typical day The game offers us all the elements present in the ideal management of a veterinary clinic, starting from the purchase of furniture for the office, the laboratory and our apartment, at the back of the clinic, up to setting up the enclosures for the animals , naturally passing through the purchase of food and veterinary instruments, essential for the diagnosis, treatment and convalescence of our unfortunate little friends. Every action we take will take time away, of course, which will decrease as we gain veterinary experience. One of the details that we shouldn't overlook in this regard is the purchase of veterinary books, specific by level and by species, which will allow us to improve our skills in caring for the animals that will be brought to us in the clinic. This is certainly the most interesting part as regards the intention of giving the game an educational component: reading books on Australian animals, in fact, will open up some very interesting cards that will allow us to learn a series of basic notions about animals themselves, on their environment, their development and their habits, giving us the opportunity to stimulate and nourish our curiosity towards species that we certainly do not usually encounter in our gardens. How many things to manage! Oh yes, the life of a veterinary clinic isn't all cuddles and rubs, there are a thousand things to think about and, above all, a budget to make ends meet. The game, in fact, actually also has a management part that should not be underestimated. The money we will earn by healing the animals that will be brought to us must in fact be invested wisely in the purchase of medical instruments that will allow us to improve our ability to diagnose as well as in books, to learn how to cure the various species and, very importantly, in the construction of pens for convalescent animals. All this is managed through the stylus and the touch screen, with a simple touch of the same we can in fact move from environment to environment and within them, as well as within all the navigation menus of the veterinary interface. In the latter we will have the opportunity to enjoy a general summary of the situation of the clinic, including the state of health of the veterinary surgeon herself, which we must not overlook. The symbols of the animals in the interface instead represent the level of education of the veterinary surgeon with respect to a specific species, if it were not sufficient, animals belonging to that species cannot be treated by us. The same happens, of course, if we do not have a specific enclosure to house them, books and enclosures therefore become the fundamental basis from which to start our clinic. Once these two essential requirements have been met, the first injured or sick animals will arrive at our clinic. . To cure them we will have to firstto carry out a correct diagnosis, using the tools in our possession and touching, with the selected tool, the animal's body displayed on the touch screen, following a series of points that will be indicated to us on the screen. Information on possible diseases and related therapies will thus be displayed, so that we can proceed to a diagnosis. A wrong diagnosis will of course not contribute to the reputation of the clinic, so we will have to choose wisely. How many animals in my pens One of the most important parts, to be managed, is related to the care of the animals that will be present in the clinic's enclosures, i.e. the animals that have needed a convalescent stay in order to be able to recover completely from their pathologies. Through the use of the stylus we will have to remember to check their status bars and their needs. Mainly, the things we will have to look after are reduced to the basic needs of animals, without however neglecting their need to play. Feeding animals naturally means having the right food for each species, so we will have to worry about always checking that there is enough in our warehouse. We can then pet them, bearing in mind that animals alone in their enclosures will need more affection than those in the company of other animals of the same species. As for the game, in addition to buying a series of tools for their entertainment, we must bear in mind that the fences themselves will be richer in equipment the more they will be enlarged. Finally, the last (but not least) thing we need to pay attention to is the cleaning of the enclosures themselves, if we don't take care of keeping the environment in good hygienic conditions we will naturally be penalized by the collapse of our guests' health. Comment If seen as a product intended for a very young age group, My Animal Center in Australia is certainly a title worthy of consideration. In addition to having a series of elements that make it complex enough not to be particularly repetitive, but at the same time not too much to be frustrating for a little girl, the game has the advantage of boasting informative / popularizing elements on the animals present in the area Australian, thus stimulating the natural curiosity and desire to learn in a streamlined element such as a game can be. The presence of various modes, including one with free play, also allows you to pick up and resume the game even with long pauses for breath, without losing interest. A game definitely to be recommended especially to young girls who have shown a certain interest or passion for the animal kingdom. be repetitive", "date": "2007-12-17", "grade": null}
