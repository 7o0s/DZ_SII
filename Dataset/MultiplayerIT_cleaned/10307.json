Although it was not accompanied by particular trumpet blasts and was not actually a product suitable for all types of palates with obvious technical shortcomings, the game turned out to be a good representative of its genre thanks to its game mechanics, original and in able by themselves to constitute the real reason to evaluate its purchase, to the point of pushing the developers to announce three expansions for future times, the first of which is precisely the one we are talking about here. It's raining men As perhaps already suggested by the title Ranger, the new add-on created by 1C temporarily leaves the main story linked to the Elvens to focus on Humans, in particular on the figure of this Cornelius. Sent by his Order to help Derrick Pfeil in the war against Duke Alivarez, the figure of Cornelius helps to improve the subdued plot of the base game a little, making the player more involved in the evolution of what is narrated in the new campaign, completely separate from the first Elven Legacy. The ranger himself is also one of the new heroes available within the game, thanks to which (as we are now used to seeing in products of this type) it is possible to count on special abilities and upgrades compared to normal units on the field: also from this point of view the introduction of Cornelius manages to make the heroes more useful and fun to control. Taking a look at the game mechanics we can see a lowering of the difficulty, a little too high perhaps in the first episode even at the lowest level, which contributed to making the game not really suitable for all types of users. Dumb elves If on the one hand we find progress in the construction of the plot and characters, as well as in the management of the game mechanics, on the other it is unfortunately necessary to recognize a further decline in the certainly not excellent technical sector seen in Elven Legacy: the graphics engine of the 2005 seems to be even more aged than it was previously, while unlike the first chapter the voices of the characters have completely disappeared, leaving their words only readable through the subtitles. In reality, even in the old game the quality of the dubbing was certainly not high, so the decision can be welcomed with some favor, even if obviously we would have preferred the voices to be present and improved. But from an expansion that is more than a simple add-on, and which above all costs not even 10, you certainly can't expect the moon.", "date": "2009-12-16", "grade": "6.8"}
