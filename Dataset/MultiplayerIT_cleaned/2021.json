{"name": "Peter Pan: Legend of Never Land", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/peter-pan-legend-of-never-land.html", "text": "The return of Captain Hook Peter Pan: The legend of Never Land is a game whose plot was substantially derived from the film shown in Italian cinemas during 2002. The story tells of the usual struggle between good and evil personified in this case by Peter Pan and Captain respectively Hook: the latter has concocted a diabolical plan that will allow him to steal Peter Pan's treasure kept in the Rock of the Skull. To distract Peter Pan from the custody of his treasure, Captain Hook first concentrates his forces on the project of taking possession of the fairy dust, an element that allows Peter Pan to fly. Furthermore, all the fairies are kidnapped by Hook's henchmen and are transported as prisoners to various parts of Neverland! As Peter Pan you will have to quickly recover the stolen fairy dust as well as save all the fairies in order to prevent Hook from putting his shady hands on your treasure. A vacation on Neverland! The gameplay structure of Peter Pan: The Legend of Never Land is very similar to that found in other adventure games, first of all Crash Bandicoot. Once you have become familiar with the commands you can make your character perform many movements that will help you in most cases to overcome the most hostile obstacles. The brave Peter Pan dressed in green tights looks like a perfect gymnast thanks to the myriad of jumps and somersaults that he can easily perform. However, if necessary, you will also have to turn into skilled swordsmen, having to draw your sword to save the kidnapped fairies and recover the fairy dust. All of what has been said so far obviously takes place in a fantastic place, the beautiful Neverland. The developers have worked very hard to reproduce the wonderful settings that form the backdrop to the Disney adventure and it must be said that they have succeeded very well, so much so that, in this summer period, the view of the island as well as represented in the game would make anyone think of being able to spend their holidays there. Unfortunately, Neverland remains the property of Peter Pan and his friends and it is unlikely that ~the eternal child~ will turn into an unscrupulous entrepreneur, contaminating the nature of the island with the progress of the modern era. Defend your treasure from Hook's clutches Peter Pan: The Legend of Never Land, unlike the versions produced for PsOne and GBA, is presented as a title aimed at an older audience of users thanks to a very varied gameplay and the presence of obstacles and enemies equipped with an AI that raise the level of difficulty to complete the game. Since the adventure game sector is so saturated, Peter Pan: The Legend of Never Land can only be considered a more or less valid alternative to the various Crash Bandicoots and company that have dominated the genre charts for years now. Will the magic and charm released by Peter Pan and his friends be able to capture the interest of your mind? You will only find out if you buy the game! Pro All the characters from the Disney film By finding and recovering the various treasures you will be able to access the videos taken from the film Graphics in perfect Disney style Cons Unconvincing alternative to other titles in the genre You will not play it a second time The boy who never wanted to grow up If it were possible, no human being would ever want to get out of that typically infantile dimension in which it seems that everything is due and any act committed is free from any responsibility. So Peter Pan is not entirely wrong when he claims he never wants to grow up, remaining forever an ~eternal child~. However, to satisfy his desire, the young Disney hero in green tights had to be content with living in a place unreachable by mere mortals, the mysterious and wonderful Neverland: this island that in the past could only be reached thanks to the imagination developed by the mind of man it can now be visible to all with the help of modern technology and above all in this case by the PS2. The fantastic world of Peter Pan will come to life in your living room thanks to the power of Sony's 128-bit console.", "date": "2002-09-04", "grade": null}
