Not even sixty days have passed since the official announcement of Enki by Storm in a Teacup, that the software house has recently achieved the publication of its second effort. After showing up in May with Nero on Xbox One, the Roman team had already then shown that it wanted to speed up the time to get back on the market, taking about a month to unveil its new project in conjunction with E3 2015: an ideal bridge between the Los Angeles fair and the GamesCom in Cologne then led Enki to slightly anticipate the German event, thus landing as Nero on Xbox One, but also on PC through Steam. For Storm in a Teacup it was therefore a full-fledged debut on the latter platform, which we used to try Enki. Game that represents a quite radical change of course in terms of setting compared to Nero: the magical atmosphere disappears in favor of a horror-tinged experience. Thirty minutes to escape from a serial killer's lair: comes Enki from Storm in a Teacup! Out in thirty minutes As Enki's protagonist, we wake up in a dark cellar, hearing footsteps disappear. In front of us, a human skeleton suggests that we are not there for a holiday, making clear the very inhospitable intentions of the person who brought us to that place. After deciding that it is not appropriate to sit idle, a series of puzzles will stand between us and freedom, the final goal to be achieved while crossing the rooms that are part of the place where the landlord serial killer kills its victims. The match has a precise maximum duration, given that at the beginning of each escape attempt a thirty-minute countdown starts, corresponding to the time it will take for the murderer to return to complete his work with us: as many times as we die in an attempt to escape and are therefore forced to return to the initial scene in the company of the skeleton, with the possibility of exploiting what we learned previously to try again to open the final door. Hence the description of Enki as a ~repeatable experience~, along with the fact that the items needed to complete the adventure are found in different locations each time. Apart from keys and other objects positioned in one room rather than another, however, there are no major differences: the places therefore always remain the same, as well as the position of the secondary objects that serve to understand a little more about what happens in the basement, also giving the possibility to unlock one of the six endings with their collection. In terms of duration, Enki can count in practice on a low hour of play, depending on the player's ability to solve the few real puzzles, which is accompanied by an exploration activity to look for what is needed to continue . The player also has an inventory at his disposal, but its use is reduced exclusively for the purpose of carrying around the essential elements for escape, since the secondary ones cannot be collected. After reaching freedom for the first time, one realizes that the aforementioned half hour is more than enough to run away, especially for the most savvy users and experts in the genre: a greater random component would have helped a lot, as well as adding a few more rooms to the serial killer's lair. In light of all this, it becomes difficult to find the desire to go back to the wolf's den to see an alternative epilogue, also because this is summarized by a newspaper page without the addition of particular animations, movies or dialogues. No fear The word horror with which Enki is presented can perhaps mislead those approaching this title, given that the gaming experience focuses much more on the atmosphere than on the actual scare. The problem is that the suggestion lasts the time to open some doors, before realizing that there are no real dangers around: however trivial, the addition of the serial killer to our research once the first door is opened for example, it would have helped to maintain that emotional commitment which instead flies away. Instead, the choice to give the protagonist the ability to make very short running shots, perhaps to increase the drama of the action when the counter is close to zero, makes you smile. Even if Enki focuses on the atmosphere, there is still some moment destined to make the player jump on his seat, an exaggerated way of saying in this specific case: the gimmicks devised by Storm in a Teacup are always placed in the same places, or they are rather predictable in the case of randomly generated ones, a confebut that the above repeatable experience is confined to too few elements to fit neatly under this term. From a graphic point of view, Enki can count on a sufficient level of attention to detail, even if the evaluation varies between the rooms we find ourselves visiting. In terms of pure visual performance we are on good levels: the only comment we feel like making concerns the frame rate, which in some cases drops in an apparently inexplicable way. The real problem in the technical field, however, is represented by the limited possibility of configuration offered by the menus, in which it is only possible to set the resolution of the game and the level of antialiasing: not much for a user like the PC one, used to having many other possibilities. As for crashes and other major problems encountered elsewhere, maybe we were lucky but even trying the game on Windows 10 we didn't encounter any. Another note we have to move towards the sound, too lacking as a support to the game experience: during the escape you feel the lack of some melody that accompanies the action, underlining its most intense moments, while the presence of some repeated audio effects it helps to lose the suggestion in a short time, as described at the beginning of the paragraph. Among the various languages, we note the presence of the Italian one: however, these are only texts, since there is no spoken language. Those who prefer the controller to the combination of mouse and keyboard can count on support for the Xbox ones.", "date": "2015-08-11", "grade": "5.0"}
