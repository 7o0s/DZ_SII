The astronaut's desperate maneuvers avoid a fatal crash. The ship is beyond repair but Selene gets out alive. Welcome to Atropos. Welcome to the review of Returnal, the first PlayStation 5 exclusive after the launch triptych consisting of Demon's Souls, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Sackboy. Ah, there would also be Destruction AllStars but let's ignore it. An infinite cycle Selene regains her senses, comes out of the smoking wreckage and is welcomed by the alien sacredness of a Templar cluster that extends, labyrinthine, between jungle and sky. The exploration soon leads to the encounter with the first enemies: biomechanical creatures with a luminescent heart and tails of repulsive tentacles. Still dazed from the landing, after a pale attempt at defense, Selene succumbs to the blows of the creature. His last piercing scream evokes apparently random images: in rapid sequence a house in the fields, a forest from above, a starry sky and, after a very long second of silence, again the desperate maneuvers with the ship on fire, the crash on Atropos and her coming out battered from the smoking wreckage. Everything starts all over again but with a significant detail: Selene remembers everything about her previous life, about having fallen on Atropos once already, and of course about how she was fatally shot as soon as she tried to get away from the wreckage of her spaceship. The horrible evidence is that Selene is not only lost on a decidedly hostile alien planet, she has also somehow ended up stuck in a perverse time loop that prevents her from the most comfortable and reassuring escape: death itself. Every time she falls off a cliff, is torn apart by the iridescent blasts of Returnal's bestiary, or is burned by a laser, Selene is forced to relive the moments that brought her to this accursed planet. The positive aspect of the story? To try to get out of it, Selene has an infinite number of lives available. A changing world Returnal: the structure of the planet Atropos will change every time we come back to life, guaranteeing surprises even after many hours of play Another detail to take into account: every time Selene dies and comes back to life, Atropos undergoes a mutation. Some areas change places, others disappear to make room for new structures, new traps, new resources for what is a constantly changing labyrinth, although mainly assembled with the same ~pieces~. Even the bestiary evolves: new creatures will enter the playing field, and others will leave to temporarily end up on the bench. Then there is one last feature that is essential to know before approaching Returnal: when Selene comes back to life, she will lose everything she has collected up to that moment, but with some very important exceptions. If the energy drops to zero, you have to say goodbye to the weapon used, to the powerful relics found, to each bonus collected; the precious ether, the upgrades to the suit necessary to advance in the game, some skills unlocked through very rare infocubes to be collected and processed in the appropriate machine and very little else will remain in Selene's pockets. It's not like starting over every time, but it's not that different either. Naturally Returnal hides several surprises, otherwise to finish the game there would be no other solution than to do it in a single session and without ever dying, which is possible but only with exhausting dedication: the bosses at the end of the level/biome for example no longer go addressed, and certain particularly long passages must be completed only the first time, while in the following we will find ourselves waiting for a much more comfortable and faster teleportation. Roguelikes, roguelites... Returnal: each weapon found may have more or less random modifiers capable of totally changing its shot. And the more you play the more new modifiers will pop up. The most attentive will have already understood that what we are describing is nothing more than the typical roguelike (or roguelite, slightly more permissive nuance), a genre that in the last ten years has conquered more and more audiences and, through infinite variations on the theme, surprised many times the video game industry with unexpected ~million sellers~. Supergiant Games' Hades is perhaps the most recent and successful exponent, but Returnal is the title that will be remembered (and thanked?) For bringing roguelikes into the spotlight usually dedicated to the so-called Triple A. But when the budget soars, both the opportunities and the risks increase: the latter, in the case of Returnal, could lead to an opportunistic watering down of the roguelike mechanics, particularly sadistic towards the players, flattening the experienceuntil it is completely damaged. Luckily for us, things went differently: the Housemarque had full mandate, exploited to create a cynical experience at the right point, able both to laugh at the player's failures and to reward him, often just when he is about to let go of the pad defeated and exhausted. Calculated risk Returnal: at each cycle we will find new opportunities and new risks waiting for us, a characteristic that will always make us feel on the razor's edge but almost never crushed by the difficulty Others will notice links to From Software's ~Souls~, and it's useless to deny it because they exist. The big difference between the two concepts is precisely in the approach to this absolute difficulty that distinguishes the gameplay: in Miyazaki's games you have to be extremely methodical, memorize the position of the enemies which, like every aspect of the proposed challenge, is immutable, while in Returnal to be rewarded is the continuous ability to adapt. Each run, each attempt to reach the goal that is always clearly indicated here on the map, is characterized precisely by constant strategic choices designed to build a temporary build that is as performing as possible, and to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the exploration of new zones worth the risk of new battles. A further layer of strategy is provided by the various upgrades that we will find during the exploration: the uncommon relics granting net bonuses, while the parasites are small alien forms clearly visible on Selene's body which simultaneously grant an equal bonus and malus. Then there is the concept of curse/malfunction that gives the game even more depth: certain trunks that are usually very profitable, variants of resources that are usually benevolent, some effects caused by parasites, can cause a malfunction of the suit that can be resolved by exceeding a certain try it, this too is different every time. Curses and misfortunes Returnal: you need to know how to adapt, move, to get the better of the enemy waves of the Housermarque game Imagine that you have just survived a huge battle against dozens of aliens; up to that point everything was going well but now you find yourself well equipped but with minimal energy. There is energy nearby but this is the type cloaked in a curse which in this case, the game informs us, has a very high chance of hitting our suit. In a different situation, we could have easily done without collecting the dangerous but healthy crystal, but in this we have no choice and we thus get a good dose of revitalizing but also a breakdown that halves the damage of the weapons when we shoot on the move . To resolve the failure, the proposed challenge ranges from killing a pre-established number of enemies, to finding particular keys to be used on some doors and chests; but you can also rely on any objects or certain functions of a parasite. The malus of the parasites cannot be repaired, and they remain as long as we have the parasite on us; the parasites can detach themselves after having fulfilled their function, removed through consumables or through a rare contraption that converts them into ~money~. These tentacled creatures can increase adrenaline and its bonuses faster, and at the same time damage Selene every time she decides to pick up an item. Naturally these joints are random and can give rise to very interesting situations, with builds capable of self-feeding energy despite the large penalties that afflict it. Ether and Obolites Returnal: The different end biome bosses are all very well characterized and extremely fun to deal with We talked about money, but it was just for you to understand. In Returnal we can define two different elements as currencies: the obolites which are also quite easy to find, and the ether which is rarer but persists between deaths. With the obolites we will be able to buy many different objects, such as medikits, dolls capable of bringing us back to life and so on; while with ether we will be able to use DNA compilers that will work as quicksave, purify cursed objects so as not to risk damage, exchange them in obolites in case of need and other very important things that could shore up a particularly promising run. There would be other very interesting gameplay elements to talk about, for example the fact that in the map it is possible to distinguish the main areas from the secondary ones, in order to decide a path in line with our needs; the presence of several teleporters so as to reduce backtracking when necessary; no less interesting would be to delve into the system linked to adrenaline or to competence dshe weapons. But perhaps this is not the role of a review, which must analyze the success of all these elements, rather than examining them under a microscope. Glory and dust Returnal: after all, each cycle is a small epic story made up of many choices and great battles. Perhaps it is much better to say that these elements, all together, contribute to making every attempt to defeat Returnal a small extraordinary epic made up of many different unexpected events, traps, millimeter victories, fundamental discoveries. However, each single run may prove useful for the next one, perhaps because we will have collected more ether than expected, or perhaps because we will have unlocked new secondary functions, also persistent, of the various weapons included. More simply, our ability to read every situation is constantly increasing, allowing us to recognize and react to the alien threat with ever more effectiveness, and to better understand where to look for the most useful resources. From this point of view, there are roguelikes that do better, manage to give more concreteness to every single ride to glory; in Returnal there are several moments in which one will feel a little too firm and without much room for improvement on the horizon, but it is precisely a sensation, to which in any case Housemarque could have countered with some interesting expedient. And it could have been done better also to balance the game more carefully, in order to avoid a progression that proceeds a little too in fits and starts: net of the possible differences dictated by chance, Returnal presents two large segments more problematic and amusing than others, which instead appear less demanding and consequently also less interesting. Spade swords, grappling hooks and galoshes Returnal: Selene's sword is a staple item, and the first major permanent upgrade we'll find. A good randomization of the elements is not enough to convince a video game enthusiast to repeat the same segment even dozens of times. To achieve this, you must ensure that each attempt is interesting and, above all, fun. Returnal is incredibly fun: so much so that when you explore you miss the battles and when you fight you miss the exploration. It is a whole that gives no respite, also thanks to the various permanent upgrades that revolutionize the approach that the player may have maintained for hours. The sword, for example, guarantees access to new areas, at the same time it allows you to exploit a melee that in certain runs, with certain bonuses, can even become predominant over the most important firearm; even the grappling hook gives access to previously unreachable areas, plus it adds an unexpected mobility that completely transforms the approach to battle. Then the weapons are beautiful, the many variables that totally transform the feeling. Even just moving Selene around the screen is extremely pleasant, given that the controls are lightning fast in terms of reactivity, clocks in terms of precision. Laser geometries Returnal: These strange spheres not only flood the screen with shots, but every few seconds if threatened they also generate laser rings that will propagate through the surrounding area. Enemies attack up close, threaten from afar, encircle effectively, and surprise in waves. Their main feature, however, is that of pouring hundreds of bullets onto the screen, geometric beams of lethal light, which must be avoided in choreographed war dances. It is here that the experience of Housemarque emerges with arrogance, where in short the legacy of games such as Super Stardust HD and Resogun is stronger. Don't expect exaggerated things, like certain Japanese shoot'em ups, because in Returnal the situation never gets really unmanageable. Its difficulty is given more by the large number of threats that erode a little of Selene's energy with every lightness, than by the enemy capable of annihilating you with a single blow. The feeling is that of being constantly on the razor's edge, rather than grappling with a suicide mission, with no escape. Keeping interest alive in the most difficult cases is the hope that the next run will be the right one, the one where resources outweigh the threats, where the god of randomness will allow us to get our hands on a more powerful weapon than usual, on a interlocking of power ups that will pave the way towards and beyond the next boss. Usually, such a run follows an exponential growth of Selene's skills which will make it quite easy to overcome large portions of the game. To give you an idea, when it happened to us we beat two bosses without dying, while to reach and take down the first one we died about thirty times.
