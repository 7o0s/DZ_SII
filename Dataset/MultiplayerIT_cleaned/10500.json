Regardless of which name strikes you the most, Inscryption is one of the best games of the year and an indie adventure not to be missed. Find out why we think so in our Inscryption review. Voyage The door of the Inscryption cottage What is Encryption? That's the question many are asking, especially if they know the weirdness of Mullins' previous works (The Hex and Pony Island). The most direct answer would be: it's a card game. We think, however, that it is an incorrect answer, or rather, an extremely partial one. Most of the hours spent in Inscryption will be spent playing cards, true, but these are only the means, not the end. In fact, we shouldn't approach Inscryption as a rogue-lite deckbuilding (it is, but it's not... complicated), but as an adventure. Even more precisely, an adventure based on a great mystery whose existence, initially, we won't even know. We will be the player, perhaps the avatar of the protagonist or perhaps spectators of events that have already occurred over which we have no power. The story is administered on a regular basis during battles and during more exploratory phases. It is a narration proposed with a dropper, made up of details, foreshadowing, but also of secrets to be discovered by playing. Despite having concluded the journey conceived by Mullins and having understood its narrative core, we still have doubts about what is really hidden in Inscryption, but they are positive doubts, the ones that make us think and rethink what we have seen and the characters we have met, for whom in the end we felt a great affection. We were even caught up in nostalgia, as if we had always known them, when we realized that we had now reached the finale and were therefore ready to say goodbye. The strange beings that populate the world of Inscryption initially seem like specks placed there to advance the plot, but they expand incredibly as you continue. Nothing is random, even in the very early stages, when everything seems simple and clear. It would be an insult to Mullins to try to give you concrete examples of what will happen in narrative terms in the advanced stages, given that one of Inscryption's goals is precisely to surprise the player every three by two, changing the cards on the table (metaphorically and literally) and taking ideas already presented and expanding them in a surprising way. We therefore ask you to take our word for granted: this journey is to be experienced. Hut The Inscryption game map At this point, however, we offer you some concreteness, telling you a few details about the starting point of the work. Inscryption is a card game, literally. In the narrative world of this video game, Inscryption is a retro card game, of which Luke - content creator of a YouTube-style platform - is passionate. The young man finds a floppy disk in which there seems to be the only copy in the world of a video game based on Inscryption. No one has ever heard of it and there is no information on the internet. The sequences dedicated to Luke are in live-action, in the form of video recordings that document his journey to discover Inscryption. The actor who plays the man has done a great job in terms of his acting. While his screen time is very short, Luke's presence (and details of his past, if you're good enough to find them) is entertaining and engaging. One of the Inscryption puzzles The focus, however, is on the video game on the floppy disk, which takes us to Leshy's hut, a shady figure who has imprisoned us and forces us to play with him. In his dark house, we will have to play cards and at the same time find out how to free ourselves. The room in which we find ourselves is full of objects and small puzzles, more or less simple to solve. The environmental puzzles are closely connected to the card game and in order to continue on one side you have to make the right moves on the other. The quality of Inscryption is also linked to the fact that each step is suggested in a clear but never too direct way: understanding what to do and seeing the results is satisfying and never frustrating. The whole adventure is very fluid and in the more than 12 hours it took to get to the end credits, we never got stuck or perceived that the game was pulling the string with a certain playful sequence. Cards The Inscryption game board But how to play cards in Inscryption? Again, it would be unfair to give you too many details and it would also be complex given the enormity of rules that will make up the card game at the center of the game. Initially,as we explained to you in our test, the game will be based on the Beast Cards, animals that must be played on a board. Some creatures can be played right away, others will require you to sacrifice Beasts already on the table. The cards have two stats, health and attack, and on their turn they strike in front of themselves: if they attack an opposing creature, they take away its health, but if the box is empty they do direct damage. When you deal enough direct damage, you win the fight. The balance of the games is defined in such a way as to make these battles fast enough: two rounds played perfectly or, on the contrary, completely wrong moves are enough to win or lose in an instant. The adventure in the hut is also almost a D&D session, with Leshy acting as Dungeon Master, putting on masks to interpret NPCs and bosses, and telling us what happens on our way. In addition to the clashes, there will be a way to get new cards, face luck-based mini-games, upgrade cards, merge them, sacrifice them and so on. The creatures then have many effects, such as the ability to fly, attack multiple times, eliminate each enemy in one blow, activate effects on death and much, much more. It's all very clear and immediate, but it's extremely layered and dense. The effects also expand as the adventure progresses. All this, however, is only the beginning, because the mechanics of the early stages are only a quarter of what awaits us at the end. Inscryption continues to add rules and propose something different: it does so without making us feel overwhelmed by the news, allowing us to learn how to take advantage of every advantage offered to us. The game - every few hours, sometimes every half hour - introduces something different that changes the structure, but at the same time it does so while remaining itself. The end result is a very refined balancing act that particularly impressed us. World Leshy's cottage in Inscryption is dark, but there will be surprises Inscryption also aims to surprise us from a visual point of view. On a technical level it is nothing special, but - and once again we don't want to tell you exactly how - over and over again the game surprises you with sudden register changes. As already mentioned, there are also live-action sequences, which mix with the game in all its forms, in specific stages of the adventure. It is therefore also a journey that does not leave us unsatisfied graphically, thanks to a skilful variety. The soundtrack is also excellent, which accompanies each phase, giving us chills in the most tense moments or giving us energy in some more open phases. Finally, we point out that the game has texts in Italian.", "date": "2021-10-18", "grade": "9.0"}
