All using the well-known free to play sales system which, as we will see, is perhaps the only slightly out of tune note of a fun and well made product. Fins, speargun and smartphone The user plays the role of an anonymous diving expert, called upon to dive into the sea to recover as many treasures and archaeological finds as possible. The tone of the game is clearly light-hearted, as can be understood immediately from the captivating chiptune background melody and the colorful pixel art graphics, but this does not mean that Deep Loot is a brainless title. On the contrary, it doesn't take much to notice that the play system offers a depth that goes far beyond the average of endless runners with which the Monster and Monster work still shares some basic mechanics. The aim of the game is in fact to collect all the riches that can be identified before one's oxygen supplies run out, forcing the protagonist to go back to the surface: despite this time limit, Deep Loot must be tackled with a strategic attitude rather than with a action attitude, a sensation confirmed by a whole series of playful elements. Starting with the control system, which is closer to the world of puzzles, with the user simply having to tap on the screen to tell the character the contextual action to perform, be it moving to the desired point, opening a chest, attacking a enemy with your laser rifle or destroy a block using the drill provided. Considering that every movement made by the protagonist consumes air and that the other inhabitants of the sea (some aggressive, some not) move in conjunction with the player, it is clear how Deep Loot the tactic plays a much more important role than the speed of execution. All this, combined with the fact that the scenario is generated randomly for each game, also brings the title closer to the roguelike category, yet another proof of the originality of a title that is difficult to catalog with a trivial label. Deep Loot is an original and fun title, but the free to play system limits it a bit Like many other free to play games, Deep Loot embraces the repetitive factor making it an integral part of the gameplay and indeed using it as an engine to be able to continue. Progress in the game is structured like a cycle: you dive, accumulate riches, spend the money earned to upgrade the protagonist's equipment and start again trying to reach even deeper and more precious treasures that allow you to obtain the better upgrades. Unlike similar products, however, the early stages of Deep Loot are not particularly welcoming for the player: the limited abilities of the protagonist allow him to be able to stay underwater for a very short time, precluding the possibility of accumulating satisfactory quantities of loot and thus paving the way for a really long and tiring grinding process. The alternative is to spend real money to be able to immediately unlock at least the mid-range of available upgrades, which allows you to immediately face Deep Loot as it deserves to be played: let's not talk about crazy numbers (indeed) but you can't hide a certain disappointment for such a penalizing mechanism for novice users, to the point that perhaps it would have been better if the product had been marketed as a paid application without this kind of barriers to entry. It must be said that Deep Loot does everything to be forgiven, not only with the aforementioned audiovisual pleasure but also with the large amount of content it puts on the plate: the scenarios always offer new surprises, there are many upgrades to choose from (divided into consumable and non-consumable items) and for lovers of more demanding challenges there are a whole series of collections of treasures to complete by collecting the pieces that appear randomly in the various games.", "date": "2014-11-07", "grade": "8.0"}
