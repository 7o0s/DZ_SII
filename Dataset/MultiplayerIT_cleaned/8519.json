However, the group of heroes and ~villains~ of the American company has also given life to one of the most successful videogame mash-ups in history, the result of the encounter-clash with the protagonists of the equally vast Capcom universe. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is in fact the second title of this successful saga, which has actually reached the ~third chapter and a half~ on the main consoles (we have in fact reached the Ultimate version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3) but which was chosen for the debut on the coveted and potentially multimillion-dollar iOS platform. The reasons that led to opting for the second edition of the historic game instead of the more recent third must certainly be sought both in technical issues, as it was impossible to think of reproducing the same performances and above all the same effects as Marvel vs Capcom 3 in hardware not specifically intended for gaming, and for reasons of practical expediency, given that the target of iPhone and iPad players often does not coincide with that of traditional consoles and is therefore perhaps more accustomed to playing titles from a few years ago. Classy retro gaming Despite the recent revival, playing Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 therefore represents a return to the past, a sort of retrogaming that is certainly not remote when compared, for example, to titles such as Pacman, Space Invaders or Tony Stark's favorite, Galaga (the first publication dates back to to 2000 for Dreamcast and arcade cabinets) but still anchored to an era in which video game standards were different, especially at a technical level. This is because the developers have chosen a ~nature~ republishing approach, i.e. original to the saga: no HD remastering, no graphic upgrades or bonuses included, absolutely unimaginable support for the new Retina Displays of iPhone and iPad. The result is therefore exactly what it was 12 years ago even if, net of the huge square pixels present almost everywhere and the low definition of the sprites (actually rather poor even for the time), it is still today able to give hours of healthy entertainment to the sound of heroic blows. The merit is in fact the perfect combination of an intuitive control system, the many charismatic characters and the historic gameplay that enhances the show without sacrificing too much technique. The left virtual stick, traditionally assigned to the movement, behaves very well both on the iPhone and on the iPad; on the small screen of the phone, however, there is the clutter of the fingers on the controls that occupy a large piece of the game view, a problem in this case made even more evident by the very low resolution that adapts precisely to the Retina Display. The choice of action commands can be of the normal type, with 6 buttons with weak and strong kicks and punches in addition to the two separate buttons for the tag system, or simplified with 4 buttons, in which in addition to the two classic buttons for punch and kick, the unique icon of the tag system and super combos and a special command to perform the characteristic blows of each character automatically. In this second case, to activate the change of your fighter, you will need to slide to the right on the Tag icon, while to activate the supers, simply slide downwards. The slide on the left then activates the interesting move, also taken up in the recent Skullgirls, which literally throws a character out of the stage forcing the opponent to change in the running even against his will. The complete roster of characters boasts even 56 wrestlers, some of them true legends such as Captain America, Ryu, Hulk, Wolverine, Venom etc; However, 24 of these must be unlocked later. The remaining 32 must then be used to accumulate points, winning in the main Arcade mode but also in local VS (unfortunately only via bluetooth) and in a sort of Time Attack. With the proceeds in terms of points you can thus buy the missing fighters in the shop but also new clothes, colors and image galleries. No Room for Graciline Gods Despite the slightly vintage air, the furious blows exchanged in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 still feel topical: in fact, the combat system is always highly appreciated, intuitive and certainly devoted to maximum spectacularization. The combos are not very difficult to perform but this does not mean that the frantic pressure of the keys can guarantee an easy victory in every situation; on the contrary, chaining dozens and dozens of hits will be a skill that solor the most savvy player with several hours of experience can boast. Obviously those who buy a title from this series already know at the outset that they are not holding the fighting game prince of technology in their hands, however they can be equally certain that they have obtained a fun and moderately challenging product, the right mix to avoid the typical frustrations that arise in facing the most difficult levels of Street Fighter or worse The King of Fighters. Having already mentioned the technical aspect, which remains on average for a title with over a decade behind it (while remaining very fluid in terms of framerate in this version), all that remains is to express the great disappointment at the absence of an online mode via Game Center, the true soul of every self-respecting fighting game and above all the only valid reason to replay it countless times.", "date": "2012-05-24", "grade": "7.5"}
