{"name": "Motorsport Manager Online", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motorsport-manager-online-la-recensione.html", "text": "After three very successful chapters, it is natural to have excellent expectations even for a spin-off that starts with slightly dubious assumptions, so we are preparing with great interest to evaluate the new Playsport Games effort with the review of Motorsport Manager Online. Why do we talk about dubious assumptions? Because after three excellent chapters that have followed the standard formula of the premium game, i.e. with the traditional price to pay to obtain a title complete with all its features and the possibility of playing offline, the inevitable online chapter has arrived, distributed as free- to-play with micro-transactions and the premise is therefore not the best, considering how games structured in this way usually end up. It must be said, however, that Motorsport Manager Online has such solid foundations that it can probably also support some deviations from the correct formula imposed by tradition, even if in the end the question remains open as to why this solution had to be resorted to instead of bet on a Motosport Manager 4 with possible online multiplayer mode. To get an idea of what the series in question is, we refer you to the review of the first Motorsport Manager on PC and more precisely to that of Motorsport Manager Mobile 2, a much closer title to this new one in structural and conceptual terms, having been developed especially thinking about mobile platforms. It's about building and managing a racing stable by controlling everything from the design and technological improvement of the cars to the administration of driver contracts, from the strategy to be adopted in the race to the minimum practical decisions to be made during the races. All things that the series manages to put on the screen particularly well, referring in many respects to the tradition of MicroProse 90s simulations, with that mixture of depth and immediacy that allows you to easily get close to it but also requires a certain study to be able to control every aspect. Motorsport Manager Online largely recovers the mechanics of the previous chapters but also tends to simplify them, probably to make the game more accessible to a wider audience such as that of a free-to-play multiplayer, but in this general dynamization it also loses part of its historical identity of simulation, as well as introducing the inevitable drifts of pay to win, although the phenomenon is not too marked. From the laboratory to the day of the race Compared to the previous chapters, Motorsport Manager Online goes beyond the scope of Formula One alone, allowing you to also manage cars belonging to Formula E or Stock Cars: the result is that in multiplayer races it is possible to find the various car categories all together in the same race , which is somewhat strange and may make simulation purists frown, but it is clear that this game intends to interpret the genre in question a little in its own way. If nothing else, the new introductions determine a minimum of variation also in the aesthetic characterization of the vehicles and give greater freedom of choice to the players. In any case, it's a question of choosing a name and a symbol for your team to launch yourself into the glittering world of motor racing, whatever category you choose. In principle, the game action is divided between the management of the car and the drivers and the action during the race, but in any case the gameplay focuses only on the managerial aspects, without ever providing the possibility of directly controlling cars. The technical parts, inside the workshop, make it possible to improve the performance of the vehicles through the improvement of the various pieces and the application on the two cars of the team: this is where the classic mechanisms of prolonged waiting to have the pieces ready come into play, which can be reduced by spending the in-game currency (obviously increaseable through the purchase with real money). The research and development department is set up in a more linear way than seen in the previous chapters, with a rather pre-set evolution of the car, in which the management of expectations counts above all rather than the choice of which technical solutions to adopt. Similarly, the negotiation with the pilots is mainly focused on the expense: with a notable difference that emerges in the results as the cost of the pilots increases. It is easy to understand how all this structure easily leads to the typical pay to win dynamic in an essentially multiplayer context, although it is still possible, with a lot of patience and dedication, to be competitive even without spending a fortune. During the race, the gameplay looks very similar tothe one already appreciated in the previous chapters: it is a question of standing at the wall and affecting the race by choosing the behavior of the drivers, the use of the engine, the use of pit stops and the type of tires to use during the race. The strategy is very important: it is possible to adopt a more aggressive approach and a greater exploitation of the engine but with the consequence of wider and faster consumption of tires and petrol, therefore it is always necessary to learn how to dose resources and also exploit the more relaxed profile in order not to run into breakages, empty tank or lack of grip for finished tyres. On this front, the gameplay has remained the very valid one of the classic Motorsport Manager Mobile and the thing is positive, with the addition of greater involvement given by the presence of human opponents on the track and constantly updated rankings.", "date": "2020-10-23", "grade": "7.2"}
