{"name": "Costume Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81980-costume-quest-dolcetto-o-scherzetto.html", "text": "Version tested: PlayStation 3Until a few years ago, Halloween was not properly celebrated in Italy, at least not as in America, where it has been a tradition for much longer. Nowadays, even in our neighborhoods it is not uncommon to come across children masked, almost like in Carnival, as monsters or vampires or other monstrous creatures. Maybe they still don't ring our apartment building, starting with the usual ~trick or treat~, but that too will happen as soon as possible. A pot full of boiling oil will do the trick. But let's not digress, let's go back to Halloween, the evening before All Saints' Day, in which supernatural forces have easier access to our dimension. Did you know that Halloween costumes were originally used as a disguise to make spirits and monsters believe they were like them, in order to avoid trouble? Well, four children are about to discover that it's not just superstition... Sisters, monsters and other amenities The protagonists of Costume Quest are Reynold and Wren, although in reality at the beginning of the game you will be given the possibility to choose who will be the star of the adventure. There is an affectionate rivalry between the twins and Halloween night seems like an excellent occasion to insult each other more than usual, but also to go around the houses of a typically American neighborhood, knocking on doors to get the bag filled with sweets. Unfortunately, however, Reynold and Wren end up running into a real witch, Dorsilla, and her henchmen. Wren (or Reynold, if you have decided to play as her little sister) will be kidnapped and you will have to face a thousand vicissitudes to save her and the whole world from Dorsilla's inscrutable plans. In short, the story of Costume Quest is a very simple fairy tale, enhanced however by excellent dialogues and jokes, completely in Italian, which elicit more than a smile, thanks to the little protagonists and the companions who will join them during the adventure. The story, of course, is surreal, as is the inexplicable way in which the children manage to thwart the forces of evil, transforming themselves into gigantic manifestations of their customs. In any case, the artistic style of Costume Quest never takes itself seriously: halfway between a comic and an episode of The Simpsons, the characters are outlined with essential and somewhat grotesque lines but the three main settings in which the story are rich in detail and detail, perfectly capturing the spirit of Halloween thanks to the dark colors and gloomy, if a bit repetitive, music. Nothing that makes you cry out for a miracle, indeed you turn up your nose at some slight drop in frame rate during the exploration of the isometric locations, but the care placed above all in the fights, thanks to spectacular animations and almost cartoonish sequences, makes up for the repetitiveness. Playstation 3 trophies Obtaining the twelve Trophies of Costume Quest is far from difficult. Divided into 7 Bronze, 4 Silver and 1 Gold, the Trophies simply require you to complete the game, quests, recover and wear the various costumes and goodies and other simple activities that do not require particular effort. RPG in disguise The aforementioned fights occur when our heroes come face to face with Dorsilla's henchmen, knocking on the door of the wrong houses or crossing them during their wanderings. At that point the battle follows the structure of an old-style turn-based RPG, where the player can only attack (or occasionally use some kind of special shot) or flee. The pace of battle is a little more frenetic due to a QTE-like mechanic that invites us to press the right button to boost our attack or receive less damage from enemy shots, however the clashes are extremely basic for most of the game, requiring a slightly more tactical approach in the case of a few bosses or the very tough final fights, in which choosing the right costume really makes the difference. In fact, the costumes can be recovered during the adventure and worn by the three main characters to vary their fighting style: for example, the robot costume allows you to attack with considerable power, while the special move of the Statue of Liberty costume restores the health of the team. However, the clothes are not only useful in battle, but are in fact necessary to solve some environmental puzzles and represent the most intriguing feature of the game; the superhero costume, for example, allows you to cross dark places thanks to the light emitted by his lightsaber, while the knight costume allows you to raise the shield on your head to pass waterfalls. The game then develops through the resolutionction of various optional and main quests, through which it is possible to obtain new costumes or access new locations. The main quests turn out to be quite inspired and nice, the secondary ones, on the other hand, are fairly monotonous and repetitive, recurring in the same way in each of the three districts we will visit.", "date": "2010-11-02", "grade": "8.0"}
