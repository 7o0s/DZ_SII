The graphics of the game let you look but it would be embarrassing to make a comparison with the titles of the last year (forget Gran Turismo 4). The cars are equipped with fictitious reflections, not in real time and this immediately catches the eye especially in the tunnels, where trees and the surrounding environment are seen reflected despite being indoors (it seems to see the old Need for Speed 3 !). Beyond a few decent builds, the cars all show a plasticky look. The color palette is very variable, as are the graphics of the buttons and writings, giving the production an unserious and very childish look, evidently to please the younger ones, to whom the title seems dedicated. The tracks are made in a fluctuating way, with the circuits set both during the day and at night in the most diverse places; unfortunately no one excels over the others and the surrounding world is often equipped with few polygons (therefore houses and objects reduced almost to parallelepipeds). There are practically no animated objects apart from the beautiful leaves flying between the trees. There are three views, one on the asphalt line, one from behind and one just above the car; here too little has been done: there are no rear-view mirrors and you can only see the car from the front without being able to see your opponents (perhaps because you don't need to work too hard to beat them?). The sounds of the cars differ (and God forbid!) depending on the model, with louder rumbles on trucks and large-engined cars. There is some rare ambient noise as the tires and brakes do their job. The soundtrack consists of more or less rock songs that are absolutely forgettable and become hated after a short time. A car radio or the possibility of choosing the songs would have been appreciated but instead nada. Also bordering on annoying is the female voice that tells you that the choice has been made (yes, if you press something you will hear things like: Audio!, Video, Options) and if you win or, unfortunately, even if you lose. Two is better... Surely the game goes up a few points if played in company: the available options only include split-screen and LAN; it is not possible to play on the internet. At least two of you will run with a human opponent and the challenges become more interesting than against the sad AI. The network offers more fun with the limit of six participants (even if you don't feel much pleasure in playing games without damage...). Final comment Ford Racing 3 is a game you could accept a long time ago. Monotonous arcade driving, decent graphics but below 2004 standards, lack of bite. Of course there are dozens of Ford models but, as for the title dedicated to Mercedes, this is a factor that will make the few fanatics of the car brand happy, compared to the mass of virtual drivers who prefer to compare cars from different manufacturers. In addition, the production appears to be dedicated more to the very young (given the factors above) than to all the others and the full price certainly does not encourage purchase. Recommended for those with young children and for those who are content to play occasionally without worries. Pros: 55 Ford cars, from historic to concept Variety of environments Colorful graphics (kids will love it!) Cons: Boring gameplay Non-existent damage model Forgetful sound One man, one empire The film ~Ford, a man, an empire~ published by Universal has just been released on DVD and sees the actor Cliff Robertson in the role of Henry Ford, the elderly owner of the automotive giant who retraces his life. This title was produced for TV but is still a faithful biography of the character. For those who want to know the history of an empire. Return of the Ford... The third edition of the series dedicated exclusively to Ford cars reaches its third edition. And unfortunately the Razorworks programmers did not capitalize on the previous (negative) experiences. The game consists of an arcade in which you compete with practically all the models of the American company in different types of competitions, from races with vintage cars to trucks and SUVs. Initially one or two cars per category will be available, with which you will have to win the different races in order to unlock new tracks and cars. The game mechanism is very simple: choose a vehicle, a championship and win, STOP! Unfortunately the driving is among the most boring ever seen: braking is useless, at best you let go of the accelerator and you manage to tackle all the bends; sporadic use of the handbrake. The competitions differ according to the cars which, depending on the class (spiders, SUVs, trucks, etc.) require a different (but not too much) driving style. To vary a po' we tried to alternate simple races with things like ~stay on the ideal trajectory line to win~ and with an evaluation of the skids and drifts (such as Project Ghotam) which provide a possible turbo that could also be done without . The AI is the usual soup with the addition of a zig-zag effect that seems to afflict the opponents. These go about their business without particular behavior. In most of the races there is no competition and it is difficult to make serious mistakes that compromise the victory, above all because of the monotonous and undemanding tracks. In some there are even shortcuts that prove to be useless or impractical. Finally, there is no model of damage for cars or for the environment (except for cones or some barriers): crash and you won't see a scratch, even worse if you hit those front walls that usually block the vehicle: the reaction will be that of a rebound that will put him back on track with the only loss of a little speed.", "date": "2005-04-11", "grade": null}
