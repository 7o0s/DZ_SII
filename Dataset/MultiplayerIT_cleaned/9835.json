{"name": "Gravit atomica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80174-gravity-hook-hd-gravita-atomica.html", "text": "Thanks to some minor projects in Flash and on the iPhone, the Texan developer Adam Saltsman, known to most by the nickname of Atomic, had already made himself known in that thick creative undergrowth that is the community of independent developers. ~Video games are a frontier,~ Adam likes to say when someone asks him why he decided to develop them. ~I can sit behind my laptop for a weekend and do something that affects a lot of people.~ The words are not chosen at random, since it was undoubtedly Canabalt that brought him to the attention of the media and a much wider audience of players, a frenetic, original and damned stylish arcade, created by him in order to demonstrate the capabilities of his framework Flixel, but which has given birth to a line of games in which the goal is always the same: to jump over obstacles and try to get further and further away. The same concept underlying Canabalt and all the titles that have emulated it is also what feeds Gravity Hook, a Flash game that hasn't achieved as much success as the previous one, but which shares both its purpose, to advertise Flixel, and destiny, or the arrival on the iPhone and iPod Touch thanks to the porting made with Semi Secret. This time you play a small robot who, using his grappling hook to cling to floating bombs, must try to push himself as high as possible without detonating the dangerous bombs. However, it should be specified that Gravity Hook HD is not, as one might mistakenly guess from the name, a simple high definition version of the original game, but expands its mechanics so much that it offers a very different experience in the end. A matter of luck? As if it were Atomic's trademark, Gravity Hook HD has an outrageously simple structure: by touching one of the floating bombs, the player is able to extend his grappling hook and slowly drag himself towards it, while being careful to hold on to another bomb before finally reaching it, or it will explode. The closer you get to the bomb, the stronger the upward thrust, increasing both the speed of your ascent and the chances of blasting to smithereens. If Gravity Hook had only one type of bomb, its high-definition version spice it up by introducing four different obstacles: in addition to a green sphere, absolutely harmless and useful for accumulating the initial thrust, a red one is introduced, which it explodes when touched, and a metal one, which plummets downwards if the player is held on for more than a couple of seconds. The most common type of bomb is the purple one, dangerous only as long as you hang on. The final experience is, as already mentioned, so different from the original as to lead the developer to insert the first Gravity Hook as an unlockable extra, obtainable by reaching at least 500 meters in height. In this way, even those who have not played the Flash version are able to appreciate the progress made both in gameplay and on an audiovisual level: the graphics have in fact been completely revised, with greater attention to detail and various touches of class scattered around here and there, while Daniel Baranowsky, already composer of the music behind Canabalt, has reworked the original theme and put on a fabulously dynamic and excited soundtrack. The fact of having to quickly switch from one sphere to another almost gives the impression that Gravity Hook HD has been designed especially for the iPhone touch screen interface, much more instantaneous than the classic mouse. Yet, while on the one hand the game offers much more elaborate and intriguing gameplay than the original, the player's skill will soon have to collide with his luck: obstacles appear in completely random positions, while as you go up they increase the number of deadly red bombs. An unfortunate disposition of one or two of these devices is therefore enough to no longer have any safety net. Then boom, game over. Both in Canabalt and in the original Gravity Hook, the result of a match is linked solely to the ability to maintain concentration and steady nerves, but in Gravity Hook HD this is not enough, and a bad position of the bombs is able to screw even the most skilled of the players.
