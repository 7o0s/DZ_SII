The fifth chapter has no particular links with the first two episodes, while it represents a sort of second half to the story told in Dracula 4 - Shadow of the Dragon, which in turn maintains a weak link with the third chapter of the saga. And here's the joke: if you've played 4, maybe you won't feel like spending another fifteen euros on a game that adds nothing more to the experience already made, at least in terms of quality. Conversely, if you've arrived now, and haven't played Dracula 4, you'll miss many of the references scattered throughout the game, and you'll have to settle for a somewhat obscure summary. In short: these two games should have come out as a single final chapter of the saga, and then perhaps they would have made sense, also in relation to the full price at which they are sold. So instead we are left with the feeling that the good things underneath Ellen's story have remained mostly unexpressed. Anyway, let's get to the point. Restorer Ellen Cross finds herself in New York with what should be the painting depicting the face of Dracula, an original from Vambery's collection. Unfortunately, the excitement of this success collides with the terrible news that the drug she takes to treat her chronic illness, the only one that allows her to stay alive, has just gone out of production. This event is interesting because it forces Ellen's personality out into the open. In the moment of maximum fragility, the brilliant restorer of the Metropolitan Museum finds the strength to say no to the possibility of shutting herself up in the clinic just to lengthen her existence a little longer. Instead he takes the last pillbox and accepts the challenge: he will die, no doubt, but living his life to the fullest and according to his own wishes. He therefore sets to work on the picture, which has been obscured by a cross traced with tar, and thus has his suspicions confirmed. The painting depicts the face of Count Vlad Tepes, who immediately strikes her with a look that makes her uncomfortable, almost as if the eyes painted on the canvas were alive and could see her. Not a bad start, even if it's just one of the many hastily abandoned ideas to conclude the story in a few hours. But let's not get ahead of the times. The discovery of the painting brings back an old acquaintance of Ellen, Adam Stoker who, after a night of passion, disappears together with the painting. Soon after, a mysterious cult knocks on Ellen's door, and she finds herself on her way to Istanbul, in search of the truth and Count Dracula himself. Dracula 5 only gives us a glimpse of its potential: too short and gaunt to leave a mark Still lifes At the beginning of the game there is an atmosphere of seductive mystery, to which is added the anguish of Ellen's illness. We ask ourselves questions about how his adventure will end and what the power of the painting is. The first minutes of the game are also those in which we meet the director of the museum and a colleague of Ellen, who open a window on her personal life. Unfortunately these narrative tracks are immediately abandoned by Microds. After the first dialogue with the director, it is impossible to access his office again and, when our colleague informs us that he will leave the common room, it is enough to leave and then re-enter to discover that he has vanished like a ghost. That's what Dracula 5 characters are: ghosts. They make a very brief appearance, always in environments devoid of animation and life, say what they have to say and then disappear forever. This applies both to the secondary characters, such as the guardian of the basilica, as well as to the counterfeiter Yanek, a key figure in the adventure, at least for his links with the fourth chapter. As we have said, the scenario does not help, since they are all static images, some too bare, which convey a sense of desolation, like the furniture of an old house belonging to a remote era, when its owners were still alive. A real pity: a greater presence of narrative sequences and dialogue, or even simple exploration, would have done this adventure a lot of good, just to make us feel part of a breathing world. Instead Dracula 5 is a short sequence of dead environments, almost deserted, crystallized in a form that seems to never change again. Some screenshots, such as Ellen's apartment in New York or Yanek's house in Istanbul, are at least carefully drawn, but the others, especially those of the flooded basilica and the exteriors outside the count's retreat, are stark and superficial. Moreover, the visual rendering is antiquated, out of time. The plot, on the other hand, is by no means dull, on the contrary, there are referencesJuicy historians who we are convinced will enthrall the public of gamers with new conjectures, who have already seen and killed vampires of all forms and origins. Once again, however, you can only peek at the script that holds the game up, without ever having the pleasure of going to the bottom and discovering its secrets. If we then separate Dracula 5 from the first part of the story, the one narrated in Dracula 4 - and we have to do it, given that the two games are sold separately - we are left with a few hours of gameplay which seem more like the summary of an adventure that has never been released, remained in head of the developers without it being able to spread its wings and take flight. The count likes them intelligent In Dracula 5, a lot of time is spent solving puzzles or completing mini-games. At the beginning, the balance between adventure and puzzle is discreet, but we must bear in mind that in a game that lasts a few hours, the beginning is a very short phase. Then the puzzles become more and more insistent, until they border on the ridiculous: to access the count's lair it seems that it is also necessary to be an electrician, since someone has apparently tampered with the lift in the most muddled way possible. On the other hand, Dracula himself does not allow us to come into his presence until we have proved ourselves capable of solving a series of difficult puzzles. It goes without saying that verisimilitude is lost in this sort of puzzle Olympiad, but at least some of the puzzles are original and well thought out. However, we preferred the moments where Ellen had to clean up the painting or print the map at Yanek's house (with the exception of the abstruse path of the blood in the machine) because the obstacles were part of the plot. Again the problem with the game is its shortness of breath. If the puzzles had been diluted and alternated with dialogues or moments of peace and exploration we would have faced them without reaching the end with shortness of breath. Also because the tension drops a lot after the first hour, and consequently the urge to rack your brains to find out how the story proceeds. Another element that let us down is Ellen's health management. There are set times throughout the game where his health drops. In those situations we have to take medicines, individually or mixed together. There are three types and they are limited. Also, until we experiment with associations, we don't know whether taken in a certain order they are good or bad. The idea is very interesting, but only on paper, because in reality, unless we experiment at random or swallow pills to no avail, we will never run out of our dose. Finally it's easy to guess what the harmful combinations are, so the health thing is reduced to a side element that ends up being just a nuisance, since the screen starts flashing red as soon as Ellen loses some energy. The same goes for the ending: what's the point of leaving the player free to make a choice that no longer changes the course of the adventure, moreover knowing full well that only one alternative is coherent and sensible compared to all the revelations had up to that moment. If you wanted to insert crossroads, then it was better to do it during the journey, when the situation would have evolved in an unpredictable way. Maybe it's another game idea that evidently failed to grow as it should have, and by now it's too late, because Dracula ends his story here and closes himself in eternal silence, sheltered in his underground lair. What happened to Ellen, however, we leave you the pleasure (or boredom) to find out for yourself.", "date": "2013-12-31", "grade": "6.0"}
