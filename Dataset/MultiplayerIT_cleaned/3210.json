And as you will be able to read in our review of Romance of The Three Kingdoms 14, Koei Tecmo aims precisely to strengthen this position by focusing on a traditional game system, but always of great depth, and on a historical setting full of charm. All enhanced by a simplified set of commands and a handful of new options that aim to make the experience more fluid, within a well-tested game formula that in itself allows for few variations without the risk of distorting its nature. Between tradition and novelty Romance of The Three Kingdoms XIV is set during the era of the Three Kingdoms, one of the most important in the history of China. In the game it is represented through seven basic scenarios, which include real events such as the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which started the peasant revolt that marked the definitive decline of the Han dynasty, then marking the beginning of the era of the Three Kingdoms, the struggle for dominance between Yuan Shao and Cao Cao (the Battle of Guandu) and the beginning of the northern campaign of Zhuge Liang (Chu Shi Biao). The player's task, as fans of the series already know, is to select a general, a faction and then embark on the conquest of China and the unification of the Three Kingdoms. You can therefore choose whether to follow the entire historical event, or to start from a year and from a scenario of your choice, real or fictional, as well as possibly intervening on a whole series of options useful for personalizing your experience. In this sense it is even possible to disable the natural and historical events of the period, which otherwise are triggered by satisfying certain conditions in battle. From this point of view we point out the excellent character editor, through which you can create the leader of your dreams. From the name to the appearance, up to the specific skills in the military, political, and management fields, through the settings you can intervene on practically all the fundamental traits of the officer. However, there are over 1,000 ready-made generals, each with its own individual appearance and characteristics that directly affect tactics, human relations and the way to handle each situation. The pace of the game is obviously reasoned, and mastering it means investing a lot of time in it. The action develops entirely on a single rather large three-dimensional map, divided into hexagonal grids: the pitched clashes, the strategic advances or retreats, the conduct of the various components that make up the management of a kingdom and the communities that make it part, everything takes place on it. In this sense, this chapter re-proposes the popular ruler-based system of chapter eleven, but embellished with a wider range of movement options thanks to the type of grid that allows more freedom of action and requires you to conquer an area piece by piece . The automatic phases of warfare (once the orders are given the operations carry out themselves according to the assigned tasks), include everything from siege with battering rams and catapults, to water battles with a variety of different assault ships up to to duels that can ~snap~ between the best officers in the field. The art of diplomacy and deception The experience is therefore varied and always different, also thanks to a vast assortment of tactics and the possibility of approaching events by planning practically everything. Between one round and another there are several orders that can be issued, some of these can be political moves useful for weakening the opponents, for example causing dissent between two other factions or reducing the development and public order of a managed region from the enemy. Or secure goodwill by offering a gift (gold, supplies, or special goods) to a rival clan to start a potential alliance, or to your own officers to increase their loyalty. The latter two are among the most important aspects of the game because they offer a range of really interesting options that can literally change the fate of a campaign. In the first case, a very important role is exercised by diplomacy, enriched in this edition by new functions. Maintaining good relations with neighbors or making friends with some rival factions can in fact prove to be determined to achieve certain objectives and avoid wasting useful resources. Improving certain relationships allows you to concentrate your war efforts elsewhere, without in theory having to worry about possible interference from third parties or discovering the rear. Indeed, thanks to the new partners yesthey can get benefits like the ability to cross their territory, maintain supply lines, and even have extra military support. In the second case, that relating to links with one's officers, the choice of the ~right man in the right place~ to control and develop an area is fundamental. Therefore, care must be taken in evaluating their skills but also their character traits, to avoid the risk that some are inadequate in a certain context or difficult to control. Indeed, once an area has been conquered, an officer can be appointed in charge of promoting the growth of the territory in terms of commerce, agriculture, recruitment of men and so on. During each turn, this ~responsible~ supervises the area that has been assigned to him and increases the forces present in the area. More friendly commands As officers gain successes and begin conquering cities, the Imperial Court will grant them a Royal Rank which will provide them with various skill advantages, which along with other factors will positively affect diplomacy, optional strategy development for troops and on the speed and dynamism of carrying out certain actions, with attack objectives settable by province and campaigns executable thanks to a single order. In short, nothing is left to chance, also because the level of challenge is calibrated upwards, thanks to a good artificial intelligence that gives a lot of trouble in relation to the type of difficulty chosen to play (there are three, the equivalent of easy, medium and difficult), but also to the degree of development of the opposing factions during the game. In fact, each of them has prepared and powerful generals, territories, resources and the appropriate military capabilities that allow them to grow exactly like those of the player. Obviously a title of this kind should be played with mouse and keyboard to be enjoyed at its best, but thanks to a series of tricks it is all in all ~comfortable~ to manage even via pad, at least when there is no more action to be performed. Compared to the recent past, the button mapping has been improved, and the on-screen interface has the controller keys clearly visible that indicate which one to press to make a certain choice. In the same way, the analog stick allows you to juggle quite fluidly between the various menus and on the portions of the map. Going to close our review of Romance of The Three Kingdoms XIV, let's take a look at the technical aspect. The game has a couple of bugs, but one in particular is really annoying, to the point of making us lower the final grade by half a point. We are referring to the absolutely random appearance (in the sense that it does not seem linked to a particular event or moment of the game) of a black screen that blocks everything forcing you to reset and reload from the last save. Moving on to something else, the graphics do not differ much from that of its direct predecessor: it is cured, but does not however cry out for a miracle for polygonal detail and texture quality. Plus buildings and structures tend to repeat themselves too much. On the other hand, the two-dimensional representations of characters, dialogues (subtitled only in English) and environments, and the computer graphics scenes are very beautiful. Good in intensity and acting, even if incomprehensible, the dubbing in Japanese and Chinese, as well as the soundtrack composed by Masako Otsuka and Hideki Sakamoto, perfectly suited to the historical context. Finally, the quality of the audio effects is normal.", "date": "2020-03-05", "grade": "7.0"}
