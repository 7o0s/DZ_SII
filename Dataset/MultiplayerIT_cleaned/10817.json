{"name": "NecroVision - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/necrovision-recensione.html", "text": "Necrovision is a strange first person shooter. If we had had to judge it from the first few minutes we would undoubtedly have panned it, both because of biblical loading times, ranging from one minute and forty seconds (timed) to load a single level, to forty-five seconds (also timed) needed for a quick load in the event of death, both due to a very badly calibrated difficulty and some macroscopic and frankly avoidable design defects. That is, the developers have tried to render the frenzy of a trench battle fought during the First World War, but have only succeeded in creating a chaotic jumble with enemies that seem to appear out of nowhere to attack the defenseless character. The wild respawn is the rule and the first weapons that can be found, slow and not very powerful, do not help to untangle the shapeless skein that seems to envelop everything, with the player weighed down by sudden and unexplained deaths, whose annoyance is accentuated by the aforementioned times of loading. And yet, making the effort to keep going, you manage to get something out of Necrovision and you can also re-evaluate it for what it is, that is a classic and very linear FPS, which focuses entirely on the physicality of the firefights and on the narration. In fact, the narrative side is highlighted right away, with long dialogues to listen to and river letters to read to try to understand what is happening on the battlefield, where German soldiers are becoming hungry zombies and where they make their appearance strange screaming infernal beasts and some aspiring competitors of Big Brother, which certainly do not contribute to the intellectual enrichment of the infernal hordes. Letters and punches To be more precise, the keystone is the shotgun, or the arrival of ~serious~ weapons that allow you to bring order to chaos by literally sweeping it away. When you start making zombies and humans fly around the screen, shooting them in the head or in the body, and when the blood starts flowing copiously (don't tell the Moige, please), you can understand the true nature of the game and we lets himself be carried away by the brutality of the action, heedless of the ridiculous jokes of the protagonist, who seems to have come out of a Z-series American film rather than the historical conflict that marked the beginning of the short century, and heedless also of the narrative pretensions which, despite the pomposity didn't produce much. In fact, the honeyed letters found in the middle of the mud can be skipped which is a pleasure and the Germans who speak with a Fantozzi-like accent (could it be a problem of the Italian edition only? Otherwise very well translated) give an involuntarily ironic touch to the whole, also because all the Germans seem to know English by heart and, indeed, write their letters precisely in the Albion language. Here, Necrovision blossoms when it stops taking itself seriously and becomes exaggerated, ahistorical and, in a certain sense, absurd, or when it loses the pretension to shock with the realistic representation of the conflict and allows you to face dozens of enemies head on out in rapid sequence, when the enemies get back to their feet after a point-blank shot to the abdomen and when a boss appears who splits half a level by spitting some drool on us. In short, at the beginning it seems to be faced with a kind of bad Call of Duty and instead we find ourselves playing a decent Painkiller clone with gusto. The usual zombie problem Unfortunately, despite the overall reassessment, the flaws remain. Thus it is not difficult to notice the artificial intelligence nothing of the enemies, justifiable for the zombies, less so for the soldiers, who fit and enchant each other in the most disparate situations, or who attack as desperate in situations in which it would be better for them to shoot from behind a cover. In fact, it's not healthy for anyone to bayonet a man armed with missile launchers, especially if he's just slaughtered hundreds of your cronies. Even technically there are obvious problems. Overall we are faced with a good job, but many ingenuities emerge, such as badly done animations or frankly ugly three-dimensional models. On the other hand, the yield of the weapons is remarkable, which give the impression of really hurting, thanks to a series of effects that underline the hits that have been hit, giving that sadistic pleasure that only smashing heads and tearing off legs can give. The soundtrack isn't all bad either, with well-crafted accompanying music and adequate sound effects. The only negative note is represented by the voices that break the atmosphere a bit, perhaps because they are too present and invasive, including that of the protagonist. In short, to conclude,it should be noted once again that an Eastern European production manages to have its say, despite the many corners to be rounded off and production problems. Probably, in a very few years, titles capable of rivaling American and Japanese products in terms of actual production quality will also arrive from those lands. For now, let's settle for some decent games. Comment Necrovision is an interesting product in more than one way, which however gets lost in the details and in a decidedly forgettable start. Too bad for the many defects, more or less relevant, including the unbearable loading times, otherwise it would have deserved something more. If you manage to postpone it is able to give several hours of entertainment.
