{"name": "Clive Barker's Jericho - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/clive-barkers-jericho-recensione.html", "text": "This is not Undying Let's remove the poisoned tooth immediately and let's not talk about it anymore for the rest of the review, because we know that many will scan themselves on this: Jericho is not Undying and does not even remotely try to be. So much Undying was set on tension and fear of confrontations, where the enemies always seemed to have the advantage over the character, perpetually low on ammunition (at least for the first half), so much Jericho aimed at pure gore and frenetic action, putting the player as a group of heavily armed characters with exceptional powers. The comparison ends here, because basing an entire article on an impossible overlap would end up biasing the evaluation. So know that apart from the author's name and some underlying themes, the two titles have little or nothing in common. Language problems The plot of the game is very simple: in the role of some members of the Jericho team, a group of professional fighters who deal with the world of the occult, we are called to stop the return of the Firstborn, the most powerful creature created by God who lives locked up in a parallel dimension. Jericho isn't Undying and doesn't even remotely try to be Language problems To be slightly more complicated is the plot, with characters whose role is not well understood until the end, time travel, megalomaniacal deities who do not understand well if they want to conquer the world or if they simply want to destroy it and with the insertion of the usual Nazis who could not miss (no nazi no occult, just to paraphrase a well-known commercial). In short, fans of Barker's baroque horror will certainly be satisfied, given that his ~writing~ is there and it shows. But only if you play in English. Don't misunderstand, Italian is among the selectable languages; pity that the dubbing is one of the worst in the history of video games and that it reaches the level of Half-Life 2 and, for the true connoisseurs of poorly done dubbing, of the much older Nocturne (but also Rune). Why start talking about the game starting from the dubbing? We'll explain it to you right away. We are facing a horror / splatter title in which the characters pronounce important sentences and try to express concepts in a profound way (they are facing a threat to the survival of the universe, not a game of Scala Quaranta). Language problems Now, imagine the effect of a professional actor, with his voice set and contextualized, pronouncing a phrase like ~I will tear your soul out and make it burn in hell~ following the correct diction and intoning it dramatically. Imagined? Well, now imagine the same sentence recited in an atonal way, without following any diction and, above all, with the tone of a boy who imitates an adult by making a falsetto voice and in which it is possible to recognize one of the Italian regional accents. Well, let's say that spoken English corresponds to the first description, while spoken Italian corresponds to the second. Now if the game was Tetris there would be no problem. Unfortunately in Clive Barker's Jericho the characters talk continuously, not only in the numerous filmed sequences, but also during the action itself. The atmosphere is degraded and some sequences, which should be intense and dramatic, are ridiculous. Travel friends Having faced the serious task of commenting on the dubbing, let's try to understand what works and what doesn't work in this product with great ambitions. The beginning is dazzling: after a few introductory film sequences you find yourself running towards a spectacular sand typhoon in the company of the whole team. In the first part of the game you control only one character, with which you can get familiar with the controls and other aspects of the game. The other characters will not be usable until the end of what we can consider a long prologue, when there will be a big twist (one of many foreseen by the plot) which will allow us to ~enter~ any of the members of the Jericho team (the sentence is not incorrect ... but you have to play to understand what happens and we do not want to spoil the surprise for anyone), for a total of six usable characters, whose potential will be revealed during the adventure. In fact, each character has two weapons and two occult powers that make him absolutely unique. For example, Black has a sniper rifle that can also fire explosive bullets, a spirit projectile that he can guide in subjective directing it against targets and telekinesis with which he can get rid of heavy obstacles such as rubble or wooden doors. The six characters are divided into two teams, selectable in multiple waysQuite intuitive: you press a button, select the team and then select the character you want to lead. when playing a video game in which the narrative illusion is fundamental the developers come to mind, there is something that did not go as it should Travel friends The others are controlled by the CPU which, despite the possibility of giving orders by the player, will use them autonomously, managing them according to criteria that we can define as ~bizarre~. At the beginning it is not easy to realize this because the enemies are few and they go down quite quickly; going forward in the mission however, it becomes clear that the artificial intelligence is not, shall we say, brilliant. Especially when the fighting gets heavy and there are many monsters to kill. In short, sometimes we found ourselves the healer of the group in front of everyone while in other cases our men stopped shooting, for no one knows what reason, while the enemies were still around distributing death and destruction. Other times however, the AI proved to be quite reactive and sketched out a good tactical wit showing that it can survive even without the player's direct intervention. Swing the swing But Jericho is see-saw in so many areas, not just the AI. Take for example the firefights, which are the real core of any self-respecting FPS. Unlike more recent shooters, enemies don't just hang around the map waiting to be slaughtered. The levels are very linear and the firefights are distributed with a ~hot spot~ system, i.e. at a certain point certain monsters will activate and start attacking like a torrent in flood often appearing completely out of nowhere (basically they are demonic creatures ). In reality this system is present in many other games, only here it appears ~revealed~. In short, the pattern that is repeated throughout the game is: walk, some dialogue, hot spot (generally with cover for the Jericho team), another walk, another hot spot and so on. Although some shootings are very fun, it is also true that some forcing could be ~smoothed~ by distributing more roaming enemies and, above all, by opening the levels more. The latter are, like the fights, extremely contradictory. Magnificent in some cases (the level of the templars is creepy and the sequence of the ghosts of children is anthology), repetitive in others, they often have naiveties in the design that were to be avoided. the levels are very linear and the firefights are distributed with a system of ~hot spots~ Swing the swing Two out of all: the excessive use of powers and the excessive presence of invisible barriers. The first problem is very simple to describe: every time you have to use a power, a text appears on the screen that tells us when and where to do it. The question is not only that in this way one is helped even in the face of the obvious, but above all that if one moves one step it is no longer possible to use the power. For example, when it is necessary to move rubble with telekinesis, it is possible to do so only when the appropriate writing appears; in all other cases, even if you are still in front of the movable objects, using the power will have no effect. The second problem concerns the level design itself: is there a step that you shouldn't go down? Well, the developers have certainly placed an invisible barrier in front of us. In some cases the barriers are disguised as railings or small obstacles, which still do their job (even if not being able to jump over a pebble isn't nice); in other cases, unfortunately, you find yourself walking empty with nothing in front of you and you understand the mystery: the developers didn't want us to go any further. Here, when playing a video game in which the narrative illusion is fundamental, the developers come to mind, there is something that did not go as it should. Miscellaneous and possible Don't run away. There are other considerations to be made that cannot be overlooked. Let's go back to the firefights and some collateral aspects that they bring with them. There are no medkits or ammo to collect in the game. Bullets are automatically reloaded at each checkpoint and health also restores itself over time. When a character is about to die, red ramifications appear on the screen, which are the only indicator of their current health status. When a character dies, the game doesn't end but you automatically switch to control another Jericho still alive, who can heal other team members in critical condition. Game over only occurs when all characters are dead. They make an exceptionnor the interactive film sequences which, inspired by the old Dragon's Lair and the various laser games that derive from it, or by the more recent Tomb Raider Legend, are simple event films in which you have to press the right button at the right time in order not to die, in this case definitely. These sequences are distributed in fixed points of the levels, but they can also start in case some monsters grab the character directly controlled by the player. From a technical point of view, Clive Barker's Jericho stands out for many highs and some lows. The special effects are splendid, as are some textures (especially the blood ones). Some levels are majestic and feature a visual richness rarely seen elsewhere (did we mention that the templar level is gorgeous? Yes? Repeating it doesn't hurt). Others are bland and uninspired. Luckily the former are more numerous than the latter. To be excellent are the models of monsters and characters that impress with the richness of detail and for their being ~disgusting~... in a good way, of course. As far as the sound is concerned, we have already talked extensively about dubbing, the music, on the other hand, whatever language you select to play, is of excellent workmanship and seems to come out of a Hollywood horror action film. In general they manage to underline the different moments of the game well, guaranteeing a faithful rendering of the emotions brought into play by the plot. PC - System Requirements PC owners, please read the hardware requirements carefully. The recommended requirements are essential to be able to set the details to the maximum, even if the average details do not disfigure. The video settings configuration menu is rather poor and between one level of detail and the next, there is a significant leap both in terms of performance and image quality. Minimum Requirements Operating System: Windows XP/Vista Processor: Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce 6600 / Radeon X1600 DirectX 9.0c DVD Player Recommended Requirements Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or Athlon 64 X2 RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 or Radeon X1950 DirectX 9.0c Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Clive Barker's Jericho is a very ambitious project that needed to be refined better. Sublime in some moments, crude in others, it is full of contradictions in the realization that undermine the global judgment. Many will probably love it, especially if they love a certain genre narrative and a certain imaginary. However, there are flaws and many others will find them unacceptable in a production of this calibre. In short, you are warned. We also reiterate the fact that, played in English, Jericho is a different game than the Italian version. Let's therefore assume that non-English speakers could also remain indisposed from not being able to enjoy the game to the fullest. Pros Intricate and well-written plot Good variety in characters to drive Some levels are great Cons Italian voice acting is demeaning Invisible barriers are annoying Sometimes feels too piloted", "date": "2007-10-22", "grade": null}
