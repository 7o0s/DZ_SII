The game takes up exactly the story told in the feature film already seen at the cinema, playing the role of the heroine Merida intent on saving her mother transformed into a bear, with the help of the three little bear brothers throughout the adventure. Bow and sword fights, spells, spells and a few riddles are the basis of Rebel, a game that uses Kinect on Xbox 360 and Move on PlayStation 3, but is also available on Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS. What a red pepper! The genre to which Rebel refers: The Brave can be framed halfway between the adventure and the Crash Bandicoot-style platform. The framing of the camera is in fact fixed, not modifiable, perhaps to make the game even easier to manage and also suitable for the little ones, but the view is completely three-dimensional and sees us move both horizontally and towards depth. A short initial level teaches us to fight with the sword and the bow, as well as to enhance spells and skills by exchanging coins in the appropriate shops scattered everywhere. There are therefore two types of attack: the melee one, carried out with white weapons, and the one at a distance through the bow. The arrows we shoot can be enchanted and each different power-up, which we can choose during the game without pausing, serves us to face enemies of different types. For example, there are some that can only be defeated with fire blows, while others have no effect. The fights are very fluid and run smoothly by setting the game to medium difficulty, but for the more veterans we recommend selecting one or two more degrees of challenge to make the game more exciting. In the shops you can also buy new skills (such as flying attacks and combos), or healing potions useful for recovering when we are at the end of our strength. At the base of the game, in addition to the fights and the growth of the character, there are also sporadic riddles to be solved using the three little bear brothers. In particular levels, by commanding our traveling companions one at a time, doors or levers must be unlocked which allow us to proceed in the adventure with some very nice logical quizzes that are within everyone's reach. It is a question, rather than squeezing the brains, of trying and trying again a few times until the solution to continue is found. These phases, non-invasive, are in fact moderate and modest, appearing on average once or twice for each level and thus managing to ~break~ the pace of play which would otherwise always be the same. In other phases we even have to ~dress~ the role of mother Bear, in which her special attacks are useful for defeating large hordes of enemies. Interaction with Kinect (or Move) does not take place in the game but during three parallel mini-games based on archery, which are actually quite poor because the delay in responding to our actions makes them particularly frustrating and unplayable. Speaking of ~how~ the Ribelle game is made, we must point out a general flatness of the details, probably due to the parallel development on less powerful consoles and from which low definition textures and fairly primitive polygonal models are imported. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is beautiful, and the Disney experience in this field could not be otherwise seen, and the interlude sequences that explain the story as it progresses. In general, Rebel is an enjoyable title that runs off pleasantly, without frustration or difficulty, suitable for both children and adults who, however, will have to turn a blind eye to the technical realization. Ultimately, Rebel: The Brave is a very simple game that will delight those who hate titles that are too complex, confusing and often frustrating. The adventure is enjoyable for everyone thanks to special framing and auto-aim aids that make it easy but not simplistic. There is to earn coins, upgrade the character, fight and solve puzzles, all seasoned with the classic ~touch~ Disney.", "date": "2012-10-04", "grade": null}
