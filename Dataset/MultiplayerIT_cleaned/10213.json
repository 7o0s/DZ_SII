The pages light up, the words come to life and the creatures belonging to the world of fairy tales become real. And it also happens that some magical mice are clumsy enough to mix up the spells and create a small disaster: the little girl ends up getting lost in the book and her stuffed bunny, now able to move and talk, is the only one who can find her and bring her back At home. The plot behind Plushed is simple, therefore: in the role of the aforementioned rabbit, we have to explore nine different stages and pass a large number of tests to save our mistress. During the game we will have to deal with the most disparate creatures, who will agree to help us in exchange for a small courtesy. In the second stage, for example, we find ourselves helping a frog whose eggs have been stolen by a huge snake. To recover them we have to shake a ~pizza tree~ and collect its fruits, then use them to open the snake's jaws and enter the huge tunnels that form its stomach to collect the eggs. This pizza thing is an operation that proves to be necessary on more than one occasion, see also the oysters that once ~fed~ close and allow us to use their shell as if it were a trampoline. An imaginative system of ~switches~, in short, which bears the task of making the action as varied and interesting as possible. Jump what passes you Beyond the ~adventure~ elements made up of collecting objects and interacting with certain characters, Plushed looks like a classic-type platformer, which focuses entirely on the particular graphic characterization and provides us with a functional control system even if often limited. No virtual d-pads: just two arrows at the bottom left of the screen to move left and right respectively. The use of objects is governed by the same principles of immediacy: just touch them there from the inventory and drag them where we need them. To jump you simply need to touch the touch screen, although unfortunately this often proves to be inaccurate. The update to version 1.1, however, has fixed some big problems: the jump has been made higher and you no longer incur instant game over as soon as you are touched by an enemy, but you have three ~lives~ , after which you start again from the last checkpoint (also a recently added element). Nine stages appear more than enough for an average duration of the product, certainly able to entertain us for a few hours, and they are accompanied by a mode consisting of some short but nice minigames, which are unlocked as we get good scores. As mentioned above, Plushed bases its charm above all on the graphics, created according to a very particular and impactful style. The design of the characters, the use of colors and a whole series of visual solutions combine to create the typical ~fairytale~ atmosphere which in many ways also characterizes the excellent Braid for XBLA. The stages are very well differentiated, with some elements of parallax scrolling to give a sense of depth and a fluid and stable frame rate. The use of colors is excellent, while the animations do their job in a decent but far from spectacular way. Finally, the sound sector is limited to the essentials and unfortunately does not offer an accompaniment that is up to the situation. The tested version is 1.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-02-04", "grade": "7.5"}
