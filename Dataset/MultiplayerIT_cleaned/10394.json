For the occasion, even the original actors were called to lend a voice to their digital alter egos: it was an opportunity to review and hear from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, the last two also screenwriters of the video game. After being released on each console, Ghostbusters: The Video Game also lands on the Nintendo portable, offering mechanics designed specifically for the console along with the verve that characterizes the franchise. Will it be enough to make a good product? Miniature Ghostbusters While the versions for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were made keeping a realistic and faithful look to the films, the Wii port proposed the same mechanics in a cartoonish graphic context, an obvious compromise to meet the technical limits of the console. Well, Ghostbusters on Nintendo DS is instead a practically new approach in terms of gameplay, combined with the same stylized look of the Wii version. For this edition, the developers of Zen Studios have preferred to divide the story of the game into missions, exactly as in the other versions, interspersing them with optional mini-quests necessary to keep the reputation of the Ghostbusters high among the citizens of New York. If on the one hand this choice extends the duration of an equally rather short title, on the other it turns out to be a misstep due to the repetitiveness of the gameplay: in fact, the missions are limited to reaching a location on board the Ecto-1 to clean it up from the presences ghostly, return to the base once the mission is completed and start another practically identical one. The in-car sequences are truly awful but thankfully short: control is fuzzy and fuzzy, while the 3D engine has a tremendous fogging problem, which obscures the car's surroundings within a couple of metres. The next phase of the game is different, but not too much: while in the other versions the user plays an unnamed recruit and collaborates with the original Ghostbusters, in this edition we instead assume direct control of the four heroes. Or rather, one at a time: the rest of the group is managed by a rather incomplete artificial intelligence and it is possible to issue orders by touching the portraits of the characters and the related icons that represent actions such as moving or attacking. And here we stumble upon other problems. Beautiful and ugly In reality, the basic mechanics of Ghostbusters is incredibly simple: the stylus allows you to direct the traditional proton flow towards the ghosts to capture them and drag them onto the traps that we will place by pressing the relative key. That's all. The intuitiveness of the control system is certainly a plus, considering that we will repeat these actions for the entire duration of the game, catching dozens of ghosts for each mission: although it soon becomes repetitive, it remains an enjoyable gameplay until you reach the final stages and the situation becomes decidedly more complicated in the presence of numerous enemies at the same time. It should be emphasized that during the missions large amounts of money are raised which can be spent on upgrades between one stage and another, to upgrade the equipment and acquire new skills. In reality, the play structure is so simple and linear that you don't feel any need to expand your offensive repertoire: visiting the Ghostbuster barracks just for the purpose of improving your equipment soon becomes superfluous. And when the going starts to get tougher, it's hardly better equipment that can save us from the main problems plaguing the action, especially slow animations and inaccurate reading of our touch-screen inputs. Furthermore, the close-up view from above tends to focus on the character we are controlling and to ignore the surroundings: it is a pity because first of all the three-dimensional locations are really well done and detailed, and secondly because you end up losing sight of the ghosts that bombard us beyond the limits of the screen, leading us to attack haphazardly in a fit of anger and frustration.
