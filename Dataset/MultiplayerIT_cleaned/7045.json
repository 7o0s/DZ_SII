{"name": "Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-recensione-di-unoperazione-fallimentare.html", "text": "Blade Runner is one of those enlightening games, a classic that plastically showed the expressive potential of the videogame medium in the narrative field and beyond. It was a traditional point-and-click adventure, at least on paper, but with a very discreet choice system that led the player to different endings depending on his behavior. Westwood Studios, remembered by most for its real-time strategy (Dune 2, Command & Conquer series) actually had a lot of experience with adventures, having created the three chapters of the Kyrandia series. So Blade Runner was in fact the attempt of some experts to make the genre evolve, so as not to make it wither commercially (something that LucasArts and Sierra also tried to do, although they followed different paths). It's hard not to love it for how it took up the atmospheres of the film and lowered them into a more elaborate and very advanced, conceptually and technically, playful context, while still telling a completely new story. In fact, it really hurt to have to write this Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition review and give the vote you find at the bottom of the article, because this masterpiece deserved much more. At least he deserved to be left alone. The adventure is always that The charm of Blade Runner is still all there Nightdive Studios is an expert software house in restorations. It takes the games of the past and modernizes them in controls and graphics, without distorting them. So far he has made few mistakes, because he has always combined respect for original works with the desire to make them usable for a modern audience. However, Blade Runner was a more complicated affair due to the way it was made, between pre-rendered backdrops and FMVs, and the loss of the source code, which forced the developers to rebuild the game in their own engine, the Kex. It should also be remembered that we are talking about a title originally released only on PC and which therefore took the presence of the mouse for granted. The task of bringing it to consoles was therefore doubly difficult. Honestly, given the general difficulties and the final result, such a massacre could have been avoided and no one would have been offended. The game is always the same: a point and click adventure that sees us take on the role of Blade Runner Ray McCoy who, starting from the strange killing of some animals (a luxury item in the narrative universe created by Philip K. Dick) by two replicants, i.e. artificial human beings created to take care of the most menial and dangerous jobs and destined for a cycle of very short-lived, he will know their world and will end up taking sides in a certain sense. Couldn't we have done more? More than going in search of objects to use or combine, as in normal graphic adventures, in Blade Runner the player carries out real investigations, using the tools available to McCoy, following the game events that take place in real time. At the time of the first publication, ie in 1997, it was very well received by critics, who acclaimed it as a masterpiece; less from the public, unfortunately, which didn't make him have the expected sales. It was a big production by late '90s standards, with dozens of motion-captured characters and Hollywood actors in the cast, including some from Ridley Scott's film of the same name. The film's expensive licensing, aforementioned source code leak, and mediocre sales made it nearly impossible to see Blade Runner return in a commercial release. Instead, in 2019 part of the team that develops and manages ScummVM achieved the feat of reverse engineering the game code and make it run practically perfectly through the beloved tool. Then Nightdive Studios announced that they would make an improved version, which was also postponed due to the aforementioned problems. Unfortunately, in the end they succeeded in putting something together and launching it on the market. The ScummVM version By purchasing Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition on Steam or GOG you will also receive the ScummVM version in the bundle. Here, play that one if you want to ~legally~ discover this masterpiece, because it is superior in everything to the Enhanced. But be aware that the developers have not received anything for their work. Nightdive has every right to use its license as it pleases, but it could certainly give credit to those who have worked passionately to preserve the game. At least he could warn the team that he would use his work. ~I've seen some filth that you humans couldn't imagine~ McCoy, what have you done wrong? The merits of Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition arearehard to say. We are only reminded of the fact that it is now playable tooand on consoles via controllers. Listing its problems could instead be really exhausting, firstly because it hurts to see a classic treated in this way. But starting from the main menu, which seems to have been created by a novice amateur with a free tool and which replaced the original menu, which instead was contextualized within the game world and had much more personality, actually helping to immediately enter the adventure, there is almost nothing that works and that makes you appreciate the existence of this edition. Having to draw up a ranking, the biggest problem is certainly the graphics, which have been worsened rather than ~Enhanced~. Of course, now the images are clearer and have a higher resolution, but evidently the system used to widen the backdrops didn't work in the right direction, given that countless details were lost. Furthermore, the contrast between the characters and the backdrops has become truly unsustainable, due to the disappearance of some effects that helped to amalgamate them. In some cases the glance is really bad, such as when you go to the White Dragon, where the characters in low resolution seem alien elements compared to the setting, a real punch in the eye, where in the The rendering of the original edition was and is excellent. Play the original if you can The work done on the videos was also mediocre, passed from 15fps to 60fps and enlarged for the occasion, which unfortunately appear uglier than those of the ScummVM edition, a real stone guest of the entire operation. As with the backdrops, a great many details have been lost and the overall effect is... Boris-like. Someone during development must have yelled ~smarmella~ and here is the result. Lost details, altered colors, materials that almost seem to have been modified... it's almost like crying. However, the problems are not limited to the graphic aspect, because there are also bugs and glitches that spoil the atmosphere. For example, in some situations the music jumps mysteriously, such as on McCoy's balcony where the Blade Runner Blues is cut off cleanly, ending up ruining one of the most intimate moments of the game. Problems also in the controls, both with the mouse and with the gamepads., which respond awkwardly to player inputs. A final note also deserves the absence of the excellent Italian dubbing of the 1997 edition, which evidently was cut due to rights problems and which it is hoped can be restored with an amateur patch. The scenarios are uglier than the original The substance is that Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is a sad operation, which could also have been avoided given how it turned out. Unfortunately Night Dive Studios was unable to exploit ScummVM for the game due to the open source nature of the tool, impossible to use on consoles. That said, let's imagine that the developers aren't blind and that they are aware of the final outcome of their work. Evidently, having paid for the license, they had to exploit it in some way. Regardless of the quality of the result, one might say.", "date": "2022-06-28", "grade": "4.0"}
