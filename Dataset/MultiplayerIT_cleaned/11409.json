The interesting thing is that this is not a trend limited to a few development teams, but a phenomenon that is spreading like wildfire: anyone who wants to re-propose titles like those in vogue at the time of 16-bit consoles, can take advantage of the current technical capabilities of cellphones and do something like this. A situation of this type clearly also translates into a progressive improvement of the products: the maps are getting bigger and bigger, the quests more numerous, the characters more detailed... in short, a development similar to that seen on the consoles, but synthesized in a very short period of time. The Dark Dimension: The Secret, therefore, is only the latest exponent of a genre that continues to amaze, also conquering players who have always kept away from RPGs but who end up giving it a chance in the ~reduced format~. The plot on which the game is based is certainly not the most original, but it refers to inevitable elements: warriors, magic, demons and so on. We will have the classic three-quarter view from above to move our character within numerous locations, connected to each other by a rather vast map. We will be able to interact with any person present in the scenarios, using an interface that is activated by pressing the 5 key: a range of options will appear around our alter ego, which can be rotated thanks to the joystick, which allows us not only to converse but also to make a series of other things. The characteristics of this interface appear clear above all during fights, for which the developers have chosen a non-random approach (i.e. you can choose whether and when to face an opponent): once you collide with an enemy, you will find yourself in a sort of limited area in space, in which we will have to move and attack in sequence. This is not the most sensible and intuitive combat system in the world, unfortunately, since it forces the player to carry out numerous actions to reach a single goal, sometimes even with the obligation to chase the opponent if he decides to run away. It wouldn't be an insurmountable problem, if we were faced with a very limited number of clashes... but it is clear that this is not the case, and in every RPG we have to confront numerous enemies not only for the normal development of the plot, but also and above all to level up the character. The latter can be equipped with a large number of weapons, protections and special items, to be purchased in certain shops. The assignment and equipment system is classic, completely manual. The technical realization of the game is mediocre and approximate. Not so much for the design and animation of the characters, which remain within the limits of decency, but above all for how the locations are made: absolutely spartan, with filling textures that repeat themselves endlessly and give the idea of a product a bit ~thrown out~, very little cared for. A similar argument can be made for the use of colors, which never manages to improve the situation due to always dull tones. The sound is perhaps the most successful part of the product, with a series of good quality MIDI music, which however neither add nor detract from the action.
