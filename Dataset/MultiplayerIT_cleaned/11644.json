{"name": "Megacity Empire: New York", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/megacity-empire-new-york.html", "text": "Let me be clear, we have nothing against the sacrosanct possibility of resuming previously seen gameplay, especially if the final result turns out to be valid as in the case of this latest Gameloft production. Megacity Empire: New York is in fact a game that undoubtedly lacks originality, but which can count on a particularly appreciable realization from practically every point of view. There are two game modes, divided into ~free~ and ~missions~. The first is the classic one of Sim City: you have to choose the area in which to build your city and then start from scratch by setting up roads, offices, residential and commercial areas, green areas, police and fire stations, school buildings, power plants and water and so on. For anyone who has had the opportunity to play the precursor to Maxis it will be very easy to get into the gameplay of Megacity Empire; the objective is fundamentally to manage the different aspects of the inhabited center by evaluating a whole series of factors linked to each other; and so it is important to keep crime low and provide the services to entice new residents, but at the same time it is also necessary to take into account the environmental impact in order not to see pollution soar. But the will to build and expand must also be held in check in the face of the limits of one's budget, far from infinite; going bankrupt and therefore at game over is not difficult, and it is consequently essential to take the step no longer than the leg. Possibly in difficult situations the hypothesis of raising taxes can be considered, with however the inevitable discontent of the population. These just described are just some of the features of the Gameloft effort, which deserves credit for being able to bring a good portion of the atmosphere and charm of Sim City to mobile phones, alongside an intelligent and easy-to-read menu structure. Hence, a game of Megacity Empire can last a few minutes or whole hours, without ever losing tone or depth. And as we said at the beginning, there is also a particularly stimulating mission mode; divided into 15 individual challenges, it puts the player in practice facing already built cities in which problems must be solved or objectives of increasing difficulty must be achieved. A variation on the theme therefore that appears well studied and in any case perfectly integrated with the gameplay. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, the production of the transalpine team is particularly valid on the graphic front; the various buildings appear well detailed and made with care, and above all the metropolis appear to be alive, always on the move and constantly animated. Similar compliments cannot be made to the sound side, really unfortunate and composed of a handful of effects so irritating as to immediately push the player to switch to the certainly preferable silence. PRO Very funny Great graphics Good longevity AGAINST No originality Bad sound", "date": "2008-02-01", "grade": "S.V."}
