{"name": "In prima linea", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85789-men-of-war-assault-squad-in-prima-linea.html", "text": "In some ways similar to Company of Heroes, Men of War is less detailed in some graphic elements but richer in terms of troop management. Far too rich at times with petrol to use to refuel vehicles, bullets to collect and calibers to manage depending on the objective. As in Company of Heroes troops automatically duck when under fire and respond appropriately to sudden situations, but enjoy a more varied AI, soldiers move while maintaining cover when moving, enemies cling to positions from defend with all their strength and each unit or vehicle behaves specifically based on strengths and weaknesses. This, combined with a deformable terrain designed to allow bypasses and ambushes, gives a more realistic feeling than the competition at least in strategic terms, thanks also to the enormous number of units, weapons and vehicles faithfully reported from reality to the game code. Furthermore, the product developed by Best Way offers much greater control over the units which are over 50 and can be ~guided~ individually by developing very complex attack strategies. The individual control mode, in fact, allows you to transform a unit into a sort of hero controlled directly by the player who can move with the arrow keys and aim directly at the desired targets. This is perhaps the most peculiar of the distinctive elements of Men of War and is an extremely fun feature, although it is not always advisable to leave your troops in autonomous mode to dedicate yourself to it. The secret of offense is a good defense However, despite the novelties, the heart of Men of War: Assault Squad remains the points model, which characterizes all modes and allows you to spend the points earned by conquering positions to ~buy~ reinforcements. And the center of the gameplay remains the covers which this time are even more relevant given that Assault Squad is focused on ground troops. In any case, the gameplay, although faithful to the series, is enriched by two new units, by evident aesthetic improvements and by a more refined artificial intelligence, and these improvements are clearly reflected in the overall rendering of what happens on the field of battle. Even the physics of the units helps the few aesthetic flaws and during the explosions it produces credible and dramatic dives. But the infantry has also improved in many other respects. Now it is more difficult for our troops to go crazy due to pathfinding bugs and also the opponents are more credible and above all more attentive. Among other things, the improvement of artificial intelligence is reflected in the behavior of the battlefront, which moves and animates credibly even by letting only the CPU-led units fight. The most successful mode is undoubtedly the Skirmish which allows up to four players to tackle long single or cooperative missions. With the difficulty maxed out, collaboration becomes necessary and every conquest feels incredibly satisfying. In short, Assault Squad is based on the use of materials that can be spent in a very varied way, such as MGs or mortars, but vulnerable and that we must use with reasoned tactics, for example to eliminate the opposing heavy machine gun without too many losses, especially in the initial stages. And in the wise use of heavy weapons, in the secondary phases of the missions, in order to eliminate armored enemy vehicles and positions. Once a position has been conquered, it is necessary to defend it as even the opponents, often in large forces, have reinforcements available. But since the points guaranteed by the conquests allow you to call other soldiers into the field, the task is not the most difficult, unless you miss an attack and find yourself discovered during an offensive by the enemy. To complicate things, however, there are secret weapons that can turn the tide of a fight in no time at all, although, for example, a pair of machine guns from a fixed position are able to effectively neutralize the call ~conscription~ which allows the Russians to invade the camp with a veritable army of light infantry. Not just skirmishes But the Skirmish halfway between single player and cooperative is not the only novelty, although it is probably the richest mode. The focus of this expansion, which is almost a sequel given the amount of maps and content, are the multiplayer modes that obviously allow you to acquire ranks and climb the rankings. The multiplayer, which works via a simple and quick server selector, offers a total of 37 maps ranging from 1vs1 to 8vs8 and allow us to challenge andcooperate with an already experienced and fierce community. The modes offered are very different from each other and allow you to make the most of the peculiarities of Men of War: Assault Squad. Assault Zones is the more classic mode with the capture of key zones that grant points to acquire new troops and must be maintained to win the game. Compared to Company of Heroes, reinforcements are less expendable and this further increases the competitive dimension of the clashes. Frontlines instead takes us along a battlefront with one side to defend and one engaged in the attack. Each front has a time limit to prepare after which a real war begins, often fought by hundreds of units which are guaranteed by a rather generous starting point base. The preponderance of the infantry in Men of War: Assault Squad creates the illusion of actually being on the front line and for lovers of realistic situations this is perhaps the most satisfying mode. But in this case the vehicles are more present thanks also to the greater availability of points, although the preparation time makes the battlefield dangerous for motorized units who will have to deal with traps, mines and specialized infantry units. In addition to the basic modes, we also have the possibility to customize each type of game and Best Way has also included a very simple editor that allows you to quickly draw rather large and complex maps. Obviously we don't find the same possibilities as a complex system like that of Starcraft II, but simplicity is often even more important especially when the goal is not to create mods but to better balance the maps. Great but not perfect In terms of aesthetics and the physics engine, however rich, Men of War: Assault Squad does not yet reach the top, despite enjoying significant improvements. The explosions, the impact of the blows and the detail of the troops and the animations of Company of Heroes are still unique in the gaming landscape and have been unbeaten for the past 5 years, with the possible exception of Dawn of War II, also from Relic, but different details such as the detailed architectures and the reflection of the planes in the water of the rice fields of Men of War: Assault Squad however underline a high care for staging. Furthermore, the number of units and the vastness of some maps cannot fail to impress and when it comes to the destructibility item, which as we have anticipated also includes the terrain, Men of War defends itself very well with a convincing destruction capable of also generating new shelters for our infantry which must never be in the open. The numerous maps range between very different climatic zones. The area of the lakes and the Soviet forests, the desert and the oriental rice fields are characterized not only by the architecture and type of terrain but also by the vegetation and environmental colours. The vegetation then, in addition to being as varied as the structures ranging from the vineyards to the enclosures for the animals, is rich and responds to stimuli such as shocks and explosions. Furthermore, the numerous stretches of water are produced in dozens of reflections in real time which further enhance the aesthetic rendering and distract from the not exceptionally modeled units. Unfortunately, the deforming ground still causes some problems for the artificial intelligence and in some cases the physics of debris and vehicles is lower than that of the competition, as is the feeling of control over the troops, above all due to a marked latency in the response of the commands. Furthermore, if the total destruction of the buildings is essential to recreate the war theater it is not always beautiful to see and there is room for various improvements also for bullets and explosions. Among other things, even if the numerous troop management options are undoubtedly realistic, the focus of the title is on action and some management elements can be distractions rather than pleasant additions. For example, the need to refuel vehicles adds almost nothing to the gameplay and forces you to look at elements that could be kept, but in the form of automated animations. Obviously the idea is excellent and could be exploited even more effectively, perhaps by introducing infirmaries and supply structures to defend. Although this peculiarity should probably be exploited in single player mode which would further lengthen the timing of the games and transform an annoying task into a game element. Finally we found that in multiplayer the engine suffers a lot by jumping from 10 to 50 frames per second. Generally the title is still playable but it is undoubtedly aa symptom of poor optimization.", "date": "2011-03-02", "grade": "8.5"}
