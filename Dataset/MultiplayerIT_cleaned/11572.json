{"name": "Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-riders-zero-gravity-recensione.html", "text": "Zero gravity From the start screen of Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity it is possible to try your hand at the usual single races, selecting a character from those available and a circuit on which to race. This is a recommended way to familiarize yourself with the control system, but it is also true that the ~story~ has its own tutorial that introduces us to the commands step by step. In this case, the events are told through animated sequences (mainly in real time) and then flow into the races, which must necessarily be completed by crossing the finish line first. The starting system is the same seen in the first Sonic Riders: a light indicator lets us know when to start running so as not to run into the electric barriers, then the character jumps on his board and launches himself into one of the many vertiginous descents scattered around the tracks . The speed that we reach in this first phase is the ~standard~ one, and by itself it can hardly guarantee victory: to increase it, we will have to pass over the usual accelerators (also present in the form of small ~vortexes~), get the acrobatic maneuvers right (i.e. the you jump from one platform to another) and use the new features introduced in this sequel in a sensible way. The first clearly refers to the title of the game: by pressing button 1 on the Wii-mote, our character will cause a sort of gravitational vacuum all around, capable of lifting nearby objects and then quickly ~shooting~ us forward. It is a maneuver to be used in particular moments, for example in the presence of very tight curves, which would normally slow down our ride a lot. The second novelty is represented by a bar located in the lower part of the screen, which once filled allows us (by shaking the controller) to take flight for a few seconds. In this way we will be able to recapture our opponents or gain a good advantage over them, depending on the position, with the only problem of having very limited maneuverability: our character will not be able to change trajectory, crashing on the walls of the track in presence of curves. The Wii version The game is available for both PlayStation 2 and Wii, and the Nintendo console can count on different configurations for the controls. You can use a GameCube joypad for a ~classic~ approach, or put the Wii-mote horizontally like in racing games. Unfortunately, the second choice does not prove to be as valid as hoped: even if you tilt the controller a lot in the presence of tight curves, you inevitably end up crashing. Similarly, adjusting the trajectory becomes a complicated and cumbersome operation, capable of making us lose any rings to collect, objects and ramps. If desired, it is even possible to use the d-pad of the Wii-mote to direct the character, which only confirms a situation of absolute confusion on the part of the developers, who have not been able to adjust the game parameters to adapt to motion detection of the controller. Tested with a normal joypad, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity seems to have the exact same feeling as the first episode, without any particular changes. Collecting the rings found on the track is equivalent to earning money, which you can then spend on buying faster boards or even vehicles. There is a multiplayer mode in which up to four players can participate in split screen, but there is almost no online. ~Almost~ because it is not possible to challenge someone using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, but there is a ranking on the net that stores our performance and compares it with other owners of the game. In this sense, it was reasonable to expect more. Technical realization Unfortunately we are faced with yet another product for the Wii that is not capable of exploiting the capabilities of the console in the best way. We have a solid frame rate and without uncertainties, but everything else is decidedly subdued: the polygonal models of the characters are the same as in the first Sonic Riders, and the tracks show a horrible blur effect that makes the textures less defined than they already are. All the interactable objects present on the track are rough and approximate; in general, the number of polygons on the screen is not very high, quite the contrary. The sensation of speed, essential for such a product, unfortunately disappears for most of each race and is found only when the character begins to fly. The design of the slopes is discreet, with some stages more valid than others but united by a general lack of innovative ideas: everything tastes like ~already seen~, there are no particular surprises in thetrack structure and direction during the ~predetermined~ phases is average. The sound is rather poor in terms of effects, but boasts good quality techno music, capable of accompanying the action in the right way without getting fixed in the head. Comment The first Sonic Riders didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the ~futuristic~ racing game genre, and this sequel unfortunately fails to do better. The novelties in the game structure are few and not all guessed: competing only against robots that are all the same (rather than with other characters in the series) deprives the races of any interest, while the possibility of taking quick shots (albeit with limits) makes the acceleration ramps are almost useless. The paths have an often trivial design, with an annoying blur effect to invalidate the definition of already not very exciting textures. There are no particular ~surprises~ or exciting moments, but above all we have a very approximate control system, which on the Wii uses the controller horizontally without detecting its inclination with the necessary precision. In short, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity turns out to be a very uninspired product, recommended only for fans of the blue hedgehog who do not already own the first episode of the series. Pros: Good number of modes available Stable frame rate Multiplayer for four players... Cons: ...but no online game Bad control system Annoying blur effect on tracks", "date": "2008-03-12", "grade": null}
