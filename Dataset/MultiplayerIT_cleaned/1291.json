{"name": "Thief: Deadly Shadows", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/thief-deadly-shadows-2.html", "text": "Factions An important novelty of this third chapter are the factions into which the villages of the crumbling citadel in which Garrett lives are divided. Each district will have, more or less, a subspecies of clan organized to dictate the rules. It will be appropriate for Garrett to create the right friendships in order to be able to move around rather quietly within the city walls, doing favors in order to enter the good graces of the shady 'owners'. Going around without too many eyes on you will also serve to replenish the loot with authentic muggings from the purses of the unfortunate poor. Just be careful not to get caught red-handed: the robbed will begin, as logic dictates, to draw the attention of the guards who will do everything to throw us in jail. I'm Teo Hood: I steal from the poor to give to the rich... Uhm... No, it wasn't like that... In a Middle Ages perfectly poised between fantasy and the most classic stereotypes of history, we will take possession, as mentioned, of Garrett: a skilled thief who, like all his most illustrious colleagues, has the 'habit' of stealing every precious thing that comes his way within range. A typical plot of the era in which Thief: Deadly Shadows is set will be the backdrop to our looting: full of intrigues and ambiguous situations whose narration will however be somewhat unusual. In fact, apart from the introduction by Garrett himself at each level, the story hidden in each NPC will be at the discretion of the player who, between an eavesdropping from behind the door, a peek at a tome and a furtive passage through a conversation , will be able to make a more than complete picture of the situation. We will therefore be able to read the annotations of the protagonist on a particular situation or character, in a special menu in which we can also see the objectives of each mission. Objectives that will vary in difficulty depending on the level in which you want to play it, as well as the AI of the enemies. The beginning is rose water, with an internship tutorial suitable for practicing the less accustomed to the genre. Basically this new Ion Storm production is a classic stealth action, which draws from the prequels without distorting their essence. We will find the mechanical eye that allows Garrett to zoom like a digital camera and the perfect thief's kit, useful for opening otherwise inaccessible trunks and doors. Among the weapons we will have at our disposal a truncheon, a dagger and a bow equipped with normal and elemental arrows with which to be able to carry out both the canonical sniping actions, but also to be able to take advantage of their special qualities to develop under cover stratagems of all kinds. A water arrow will be able to extinguish a torch located in a central area of a room, just as a chaos arrow hurled at a point diametrically opposite to our position will be able to distract surveillance. The game mechanic is basically simple in concept, but damn complex in its execution. It will be necessary to hide in the shadows of every ravine to be able to slip like a snake between guards and locals, wearing only the cloak given by darkness to be able to access everywhere. In this regard, the light detector could not really be missing, which will have the task of signaling how much Garrett's position is illuminated. Obviously the darker the sphere at the foot of the screen will be, the less visible we will be. Becoming aware of the above, a warmongering approach with the Ion Storm game is almost useless; either for the impositions given by the game concept, or for the disparity of armaments between the protagonist and his tormentors, clearly in favor of the latter, or for a neglected and minimized combat system to the core. Double-edged sword therefore: that if on the one hand it pushes the player to enjoy the game in the fullest of its essence, on the other it leaves no diversions to the stealth action. The game mechanic is basically simple in concept, but damn complex in its execution. I'm Teo Hood: I steal from the middle class for Argh What was it like?!? Equipped with a fairly accommodating console-PC hybrid control system, Thief: Deadly Shadows is slightly unskilled in some specific actions: clinging to a window using the same jump key is an impractical and quite imprecise compromise, as is the selection real-time view of a weapon through a convoluted and slow gear system. The game menu is also in the name of lack of practicality: too messy and not very intuitive. Instead, the AI of the enemies has been rather cured, which will always act following very specific logical procedures, even if the same thing cannot be said of the physics applied especially to corpses. In fact, if the objects with which Garrett will interact will react substantially in line with the basic laws of physics, thecorpses thrown to the ground will have decidedly stupid reactions: in fact, it will happen to throw a body to the ground seeing it writhe and recline like a foam puppet. From a graphic point of view, the Ion Storm title certainly has a good appeal, with well-finished backgrounds both as polygonal modeling and as textures, with excellent bump mapping implementation on most of the latter. Garrett also cuts a fine figure, from the top of a high number of polygons and all in all convincing animations. On the other hand, the realization of the NPCs fluctuates, which most of the time disfigure in the presence of a paradoxically too well-groomed protagonist. Definitely above average light effects which, in addition to fully performing their duty by giving the game that visual surplus, are also fully convincing from a purely playful point of view. Unfortunately the graphics engine hesitates, although partially justifiable for the workload to which it is subject, with an unstable frame rate. Last line for a dubbing in Italian that doesn't exist, it would have been a gem to be able to hear every single murmur in our beautiful language. Textual translation instead present and impeccable. Comment Thief: Deadly Shadows is certainly a noteworthy production, even if far from the trappings dictated by direct competitors of the genre. Unfortunately, on some occasions there is a certain disregard for details which, added together, manage to divert full attention to a valid and important game. The medieval atmosphere full of intrigue created by Ion Storm involves from the start, as well as the carefully refreshed game mechanics without deviating too much from the predecessors. Ultimately, Thief: Deadly Shadows stands out as a valid alternative to the latest generation stealth and is a real boon for lovers of the genre and gothic. Have you ever thought of yourself as a chameleon? Try to follow the reasoning below, the inevitable result of a too hot day. In video games we are used to bobbing from dress to dress, from era to era; just like the chameleon mentioned above, which out of pure spirit of survival tends to blend in with the colors of the surrounding environment. Now the question inevitably arises 'Marzullo style': is the video game a source of life or is life the source for the video game? During your meditation on this aberrant question, bearing in mind once again the hot day that has gripped the writer, we will do nothing but take off our designer clothes to put on the rags of a furtive medieval thief. Logically we are talking about the return of Garrett, the undisputed protagonist of the Thief saga who, with this new episode, reaches the third chapter. Ion Storm collects the heavy legacy of a brand that has entered history, the last generation, for having laid the foundations for one of the most popular genres today: stealth. So Thief: Deadly Shadows enters the amphitheater of this generation bringing with it the imposing burden of a tradition born way back in 1998, the year in which Sam Fisher was still in the womb of its creators and Solid Snake was preparing to see the first gleams of the world.", "date": "2004-06-10", "grade": null}
