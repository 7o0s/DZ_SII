We already asked ourselves this at the time of the announcement of the No Matter Studios game, which took place in the now distant 2015, when it was still called Prey for the Gods, without the vocal added at the request of Bethesda. Successfully funded on Kickstarter the year later, the title entered Early Access on Steam in 2019 and we got to try it twice over time, finally going to verify the mechanics of this peculiar action survival and its possible ability to offer an online experience with the great ambitions of the authors, determined to bring atmospheres similar to those of the masterpiece directed by Fumito Ueda to PC. In short, a lot of water has passed under the bridge and we have finally got to the point: are we faced with a bizarre and limping clone or a work that not only pays homage to a great classic but also manages to bring out its own personality? We tell you about it in the review of Praey for the Gods. History Praey for the Gods, the light that points to the next colossus Barely hinted at, the story of Praey for the Gods tells of a world covered in ice and doomed to extinction, unless someone reaches a place on the edge of the known lands: an island on which huge divine creatures move, which seem somehow connected to this calamity and must therefore be found and eliminated. on their gigantic body and activating a series of seals. They will be exhausting battles, at the end of which the warrior will find herself dragged by a mysterious wolf at the foot of a regenerating fountain, while in the sky a column of light will indicate the next objective. Gameplay Praey for the Gods, a glide sequence Praey for the Gods is one of those games that don't get lost in chatter, as indeed Shadow of the Colossus did (here the review of the remake), and which therefore must be understood with practice rather than with tutorials. Our character can move freely within the scenario, although having to submit to the limits of a stamina indicator which prevents her from running or gliding indefinitely and which decisively characterizes the phases of climbing on the fur of the giants. clash with the first titan, which takes place practically immediately, introduces us to the mechanics of a clearly derivative combat system, in which, as mentioned, you have to climb monsters and activate seals to kill them, trying to resist when the creatures try to throw us away. These are peculiar boss fights as they incorporate a sometimes non-trivial puzzle component: identifying the weak points of the enemy on duty is not always easy, and in the same way we must memorize their attack patterns because certain blows can eliminate us instantly. Praey for the Gods, the first behemoth There are some good ideas, see the possibility of using the grappling hook in a bullet time which allows you to recover apparently desperate situations - especially when you are about to fall into the void - but also various uncertainties on the controls and interactions front, which unfortunately they give rise to episodes of great frustration when one is killed because perhaps our character did not cling when we asked him to do so. The clash with the gods hidden within the scenario clearly represents the fulcrum of Prey for the Gods and is in fact the best part of the game, which however also tries to invent an open world with some annoying threats to eliminate and secrets to discover. However, the result is sketchy and uninteresting, also due to the inevitable repetitiveness of the assets that characterize the snowy setting. Survival elements Praey for the Gods, a part of the map and the interface The differences with Shadow of the Colossus emerge more than anything else in the survival elements, which however turn out to be a bit weak: the hunting sections, useful for obtaining meat and other resources, are rendered on the screen in a very approximate way, and in general the he obligation to feed, rest and shelter from the cold most often represents an extra complication that one would do without. the four available. There are, in fact, three differentyou preset to regulate the survival component: in the first case this element has little impact on the gameplay, in the second case the mechanisms are all active but without exceeding, while with the third preset all aspects are exasperated a bit on the basis of hunger, tiredness and cold. The equipment is also linked to the survival component: swords, maces, axes, bows and even the fundamental grappling hook are subject to wear and tear and therefore can break when we use them too much. At that point we will need certain resources, mainly wood, to repair them or build new ones: a system that the developers have simplified at the suggestion of users, given that it happened to find yourself in key situations without fundamental objects for progression.Playing with incidence of the survival aspects on ~medium~ we had some headaches only in the coldest and windiest areas of the map, as well as obviously when we had to dive into the icy water for a few quick swims. However, finding caves in which to take shelter, light a fire and rest is not so immediate, and in general having to stock up before a battle proves to be a boring task. Colossi Praey for the Gods, one of the giants of the game But let's go back to the giants, undoubtedly the protagonists of Praey for the Gods. Also in this case the design is often derivative and not very original if you already know Shadow of the Colossus, but this does not mean that a good job has not been done in the staging: they are gigantic creatures that move as such, their apparent slowness turns into speed and reach when they try to hit us, and a good job has also been done on the animation front. Compared to the Early Access version, the game has received two more giants and a new, spectacular ending: a truly exciting that occurs after the elimination of the seventh titan and that will see us climb a huge structure attacked by new monsters, in this case wrapped in flames, while in the sky moves a last flying creature menacing to be killed. Graphics and sound Praey for the Gods, the seventh colossus As far as the technical sector is concerned, Praey for the Gods inevitably feels the weight of the many years of development and of an old-gen connotation, which however can give visually very interesting sequences in certain cases. To think that such a job was done by just three people is incredible, but it is precisely the limits of production that raise the greatest perplexities, especially when you come across some glitches. Unfortunately, the optimization has not been improved compared to our last ones test, which means that you have to reduce the density of the furs and the quality of the shadows a bit to be able to run the game at 4K and 60 fps with all other effects maxed out using an RTX 3070, despite a polygon count that is anything but how extraordinary. Nothing to say instead for the sound, which can count on convincing effects and a truly evocative soundtrack.", "date": "2021-12-27", "grade": "6.5"}
