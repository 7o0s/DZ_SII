Far from it: before Spielberg and Jackson got their hands on it, there were five film adaptations of his adventures, ranging from stop-motion to animation to live footage. Similarly, we are not dealing with his first video game: from the prehistoric Tintin on the Moon for Commodore 64 to the more recent Tintin in Tibet, there have been several opportunities for fans to relive their idol's deeds electronically. What should change today is the ambition of the two products: if behind the Computer Graphic film there are the heads of the two directors/producers perhaps best known at the moment, behind the video game there is Ubisoft Montpellier, the team that gave away none other than Beyond Good and Evil. Let's go and see if, at least from the playful side, the premises correspond to the results. Rackam's Crab Secret The film, and consequently the video game, is based on three of Tintin's best stories, published between 1941 and 1944: ~The Golden Crab~, ~The Secret of the Unicorn~ (which in English was published as ~ The secret of the Unicorn~, hence the title of film and game), and ~The treasure of Rackam the Red~. Without, if you don't already know the strips, taking away the pleasure of discovering the plot in the cinema (which the video game does without too many compliments and in a rather slavish way), it is enough to know that they are very important moments in the adventures of the young journalist of the adventure, as, between mysterious parchments, seventeenth-century ship models and a spectacular treasure hunt, it tells of Tintin's first meeting with Captain Haddock, a fundamental character of the entire Herg universe. The formula chosen by Ubisoft to tell this story is actually a little mistreated nowadays, after having given us immortal pearls in the past: we are faced with a 2D Platform Adventure, which closely resembles, also for some settings and for the taste for animation halfway between realistic and choreographed, jewels like the very first Prince of Persia and Another World. In practice, in the role of Tintin for most of the time, but also in those of other characters such as Mil, the likeable and highly intelligent fox terrier who always accompanies the Belgian journalist, the player must face a series of levels in pure Platform style, where, however, there will also be numerous puzzles and a whole series of bad guys to put out of action. These three main ingredients of the recipe of The Secret of the Unicorn are certainly declined in a more than worthy way, although it is understood that the game was developed on the one hand with a not exceptional budget of resources and time, on the other with an eye with regard to the younger audience: the platform solutions are never too difficult or ingenious, the puzzles always work on the same two or three basic concepts and the clash with the opponents, which later would seem to require great skills in the puzzle solving and stealth, it can however often and willingly be faced openly, as in any anonymous scrolling fighting game. However, this ~lack of ambition~ must not distract attention from the fact that, although it does not aim for who knows what levels of excellence, the basic formula of the game is well rendered, it is pleasant, fluid, never frustrating, ultimately very suitable for young users and not unpleasant for the more savvy, who will be supported above all by the great atmosphere of the whole which, as we will see shortly, is the real flagship of the product. The 3D effect As usual, Ubi calibrates the 3D effect slightly upwards but, unless the need to operate the appropriate lever slightly causes you an intolerable annoyance, this is not an insurmountable problem. The 3D gives the game an even more particular feeling, enhancing the depth of the beautiful settings and making the most spectacular animations even more evident; also, as seems to be clear in every 3DS game by now, playing without 3D activated decreases the brightness. A valid addition, therefore, at the price of, we seem to grasp a slightly lower frame rate even without having official data available. In Haddock's dreams To the basic concepts summarized above, Il Segreto dell'Unicorno accompanies two variations on the theme. The first is in the form of ~interludes~ to be addressed along the main story: for example, we have to drive an airplane, impersonate Mil in search of the master, or immerse ourselves in the seventeenth century and face the pirati, with cannon and sword shots, in the guise of an ancestor of Haddock (the latter two phases on the lower screen with the stylus). These are indeed less successful levels than the rest, quite monotonous and ends in themselves, but their brevity saves them from ruining everything and indeed, they are in the end welcome interludes in breaking the rhythm of the not very short adventure here and there. The second ~variation~ instead takes the form of a real alternative mode, which also includes cooperative multiplayer for two players, unfortunately only locally: in ~Tintin and Haddock~ we face a whole series of platform levels set in none other than dreams del Capitano, where the goal is to reach the end in the shortest time and by grinding as many points as possible, records which can then be compared with other players via StreetPass. This mode reaches levels of quality that are sometimes even clearly superior to the main game, based as it is on a greater emphasis placed on the puzzle component and on the collaboration between the characters, equipped with different characteristics and possibilities, all essential for reaching the end of a level : could, by gameplay and realization, form the foundation of an entire game, and we hope Ubi takes note of the suggestion. Furthermore, the dreamlike setting has allowed Ubi artists greater freedom in designing backgrounds and composing the level design, which leads us directly to the question of the graphic / sound sector and the atmosphere in general, a rather important point in a tie -in. Well, here the task has been completed if not perfectly, almost: the settings, exotic and adventurous, are faithful to the film and are extremely evocative, in this very assisted by the music of John Williams perfectly reproduced by the small 3DS. Even the graphics do their job: polygons and details abound and the version for the Nintendo portable doesn't seem at all different from the one for the major consoles, but above all the animations, fluid, realistic and at the same time spectacular, amaze and remind up close the film; just from the animations, however, sometimes ~broken~ and interrupted out of the blue, you can glimpse the not huge budget available to the team. The story is told in a very nice way, with the scenes of the film transformed into a virtual comic book to be read cartoon after cartoon and sure, it can be a bit strange to see a Tintin with such a realistic face, while instead the other characters fully respect the caricature trait of Herg, but it is a choice of the film and the programmers could not help but respect it. Also on the ~Atmosphere & Immersion~ side, finally, texts and dialogues that reflect, even in Italian translation, the playful lyricism of comics, always halfway between ~high~ opera and children's product.", "date": "2011-11-01", "grade": "7.0"}
