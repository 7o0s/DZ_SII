{"name": "Daymare: 1998", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/daymare-1998-recensione.html", "text": "Daymare: 1998 is the classic title that the review writes itself, in the sense that it is exactly what it promised to be: a dispassionate tribute to the Resident Evil series, starting from that second chapter that gave it the there, in all the senses (in fact the game was born as an attempt to remake Resident Evil 2). In reality, the game setting is a mixture between the classic survival horror mechanics and the Resident Evil 4 setting. So the action is framed from the shoulders of the protagonist (or protagonists, in this case), visible from three quarters and very close up, but most of the game is spent sipping the ammunition of weapons (pistols, machine guns, shotguns pump and so on) and to combine objects in order to be able to heal from wounds received by one of the many creatures that try to kill us. The plot tells of a research center located near the village of Keen Sight, where a chemical leak turned all employees into bloodthirsty zombies. In reality this is only the first part of the story, which unfolds over several episodes, where you visit the surroundings of the research center, and puts you in the shoes of three different characters: an elite soldier with very few scruples, a pilot of helicopters with even less scruples than him and a ranger with some medical problem. The events that led to the crisis are told by the many documents that can be found by exploring. The peculiarity is that the essential ones can be read directly in the game, while others provide codes that must be entered on a website to access the content. In general, the texts are long and give a lot of information about what happened: perhaps too much in some cases, so much so that, net of the twists and turns, some of the main facts are revealed with a little too much haste by writers who are too eager to make us understand everything. Gameplay and interface Where Daymare: 1998 gives its best is in the atmosphere, well-kept thanks to a skilful construction of the scenes and a shrewd use of the lighting system. During the gameplay, internal and external environments are visited, all represented in a dark and dramatic way, whether they are the aforementioned research center, or a contaminated lake village, or even a forest. It should be noted that the sequence of areas from which the game is composed looks like a long chain of citations of different titles, citations of which the entire game abounds, including movie posters, references in documents and so on. Also noteworthy is the study of the interface which, as already mentioned in the preview phase, is completely diegetic to the action (we repeat the word diegetic because you seem to have liked it a lot), that is, it is entirely internal to the game world. If desired, some elements of the hud can actually be activated on the screen, so as to always have before one's eyes the amount of ammunition loaded in the weapon being held and other information that could be useful to novices. In general, however, everything is managed through the interfaces of the devices worn by the protagonists, to which the complete management of the characters and the information collected is linked. In terms of actual gameplay, Daymare 1998 mixes exploration and shooting in a similar way to what we saw in Resident Evil (amazed?). Basically the enemies are all very resistant, especially if you play on the highest difficulty level, and force you to consume a large number of bullets to be shot down. With some weapons the situation improves (see shotgun), but in general ammunition management is one of the key elements of the gameplay. If you want you can shoot in the head and save a few shots, but to do it you have to learn to aim well and, above all, be able to predict the movements of the enemies, who between shots and oscillations don't particularly care about getting their brains perforated. So, where possible, it's better to save shots and run, instead of killing everyone. Speaking of enemies, let's say that we are faced with the classic zombie army, with some that are more evolved and stronger than others. Here Daymare 1998 shows more than a few limitations. Honestly, however, we don't feel like making comparisons with the recent Resident Evil 2, because we are really on two production levels light years apart. Let's say that the guys from Invaders Studio managed to do well with what they had available. There are no particularly original creatures and some moments that leave their mark are missing, such as that of the carnivorous plant in Resident Evil or that of the alligator in Resident Evil 2, but some compromises are more than acceptable given the overall construction and the care placed in other elementsyou. The bosses are less tolerable, some really anonymous both in appearance (they are the first encounter with enemies stronger than the basic ones who then return throughout the adventure) and in the attack patterns. Basically they limit themselves to attacking head on, with the player who is forced to always use the same tactic to bring them down: run away, turn around, fire a few shots, run away again. With the final boss it goes a little better, in the sense that it is the strongest of the bunch and offers a slightly different challenge, but otherwise this aspect is undoubtedly the most sacrificed ever. Other game mechanics Among the most interesting finds of Daymare: 1998 there is certainly the care placed in the weapon reloading system, which requires some attention in order not to get into trouble. Basically, if you reload the weapon quickly, the magazine inside the weapon ends up on the ground, replaced by the new one. To avoid this, you need to reload more slowly by holding down the relative key. Obviously you will understand that in the most agitated situations we tend to adopt the first solution, sometimes even unconsciously, in the throes of frenzy. It is a small trick which however contributes not a little to increasing the tension of some moments and, at times, to favoring escape rather than combat. Another important gimmick is that of the chases. There aren't many of them (a couple in the whole game), but they are quite challenging. Unfortunately they are not anticipated and the first attempts to overcome them inevitably end in our death, because we don't quite know what to do. Not bad, given that a few attempts are enough to move forward. In the gameplay there are also some puzzles, without mysteries inspired by the classic models of the genre, including codes to decipher by observing the environment, objects to move and so on. It's never impossible to figure it out, but we imagine that some modern users, accustomed to games that finish themselves, may have some difficulty.", "date": "2019-09-17", "grade": "7.5"}
