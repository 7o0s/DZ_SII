{"name": "Ratchet &amp; Clank: Armi di Distruzione - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratchet-amp-clank-armi-di-distruzione-recensione.html", "text": "If we had to indicate a symbolic developer of the first year of life of PlayStation 3, the choice could only fall on Insomniac, the one that first and perhaps most of all communicates best with Sony's hardware. Not happy with having packaged probably the best launch title of the console, today it also offers the debut of the Ratchet & Clank series, which has seen many excellent episodes born on the younger sister. The suffix is ~Weapons of Destruction~, and never before have programmers indulged in creating weapons that are as useful as they are original and fun. Shoot what happens to you Those who have gotten to know Ratchet & Clank in the past will have little trouble familiarizing themselves with the characters and mechanics that make up the game world. Ratchet seems to be the only survivor of the Lombax race, and this time his antagonist has the appearance of Emperor Tachyon, exponent of the Cragmites once defeated by Ratchet's own progenitors. Fido traveling companion is Clank, handyman shoulder who supplies most of the gadgets to the main protagonist. The story is told through the usual excellent sequence of jokes between the various characters and, although well developed, it serves as the usual pretext for the ride between the various planets, extremely detailed and above all diversified from each other. Formula that wins does not change therefore, and also in this chapter the predominant part is dedicated to the fights, with the platform sections bound to the role of supporting actor. Tracing the path taken with the previous episodes and if we want also from Resistance, Insomniac has indulged in equipping the main protagonist with some of the most bizarre and fun weapons ever conceived in a video game. In fact, Ratchet has the usual wrench as a basic attack, he can perform the double jump with the X key and glide with Clank's propellers. With L1 you activate the first person mode and with the triangle key you can quickly access the selection of one of the weapons or gadgets available. For a total of more than thirty, coming from the previous chapters, such as the fusion bomb, and unpublished such as plasmabeast, which releases some gelatinous masses that transform and attack enemies, lightning ravager, which allows you to throw a whip of energy or even the nanoswarmer, who installs defensive turrets that attack opponents from a distance. Among the funniest is certainly the discotron, a sort of mirrored disco ball accompanied by enthralling music that makes enemies dance, giving time to eliminate them. As if that weren't enough, each weapon has five levels of automatic enhancement, which are reached simply through use, and can be improved by spending crystals (called raritanium here) dropped by certain types of enemies and chests, using a hexagonal grid that can increase magazine width, distance achieved rather than damage dealt. With the bolts that are obtained from any object or opponent on the playing field, it is possible to gradually buy missing weapons and devices or armor upgrades. Insomniac has therefore done an excellent job in trying to diversify the gaming experience as much as possible and suggesting the player to use as many gadgets as possible, especially thanks to the level design and monsters, some of which are much more susceptible to certain types of attack than others. others, or even when to overcome certain points it is necessary to use devices such as the heli-pad to lift some submerged grates or platforms. Game planets often have multiple roads to explore, and the presence of shortcuts or platforms for rapid movement completely avoids the risk of boring the player or getting caught up in useless passages with intense backtracking. Which in reality is left solely to the choice of the player, who after acquiring the various skills during the adventure, can choose whether to go back to one of the many worlds to find the golden bolts rather than the holograms for the weapon final or still explore previously inaccessible areas. Lombax, where are you? No forced repetitiveness but rather freshness and variety therefore, also thanks to the arenas that return (twice mandatory), to the numerous mini-games or to the sections with the ship, fast and fun, to arrive at the return of the sections with Clank, who can face some levels inaccessible from Ratchet together with the Zoni, robotic creatures invisible to others and which help the cute little robot to levitate, manipulate objects, recharge exhausted energy sources and so on, for a pleasant diversion from the control of the main character. Dulcis in fundo, in the title we also find one of the milesori implementations of the motion sensor of the Sixaxis pad, which is exploited in many occasions such as gliding to avoid traps or enemy bullets, using the robo wings to fly in the game scenario, participating in some mini-games such as decrypting electrical circuits and finally with some weapons, such as the tornado launcher or the geo-laser. There are obviously some flaws, however, and it is due to the rather low difficulty that is found for a good part of the adventure. In fact, using the various weapons, one rarely dies in a passage more than once and indeed entire sections are passed without a shot being fired. Also noteworthy is the absence of any multiplayer component, mentioned in the last few chapters and which here perhaps would have found more fertile ground, due to a decidedly better developed online platform than that of PlayStation 2. Instead, the plate of extras is rich, such as from the Insomniac tradition, with the possibility of acquiring skill points under certain conditions (a sort of objectives) which cumulatively unlock sketches, films, skins and new options. Once the game is finished for the first time, you also access the mode called challenge, which allows you to replay with a higher level of difficulty (which we would not have minded seeing available immediately) all the weapons acquired so far and new upgrades, in a completely similar to what was seen in Resistance. Lombax, where are you? We have deliberately left the technical sector for last, also because it is a real joy for the eyes and ears. Often and willingly the realization of the worlds, so diversified from each other, leaves you speechless, with soft lines, rich details and a use of bright and captivating colors. Leaving aside improbable comparisons with Pixar films, even the animations are part of the positive aspects, especially those of the main protagonists. The beauty is that everything moves with an impressive fluidity, so as to place Weapons of Destruction directly in the very first places of the most graphically beautiful titles available today. The soundtrack is no different, with personalized tunes in each world and which often recall noble cinematographic productions (think of the world of pirates, with music that closely resembles the Pirates of the Caribbean) and the dubbing, completely in Italian which it is very valid especially in the interludes, as usual hilarious and well done. Comment A pleasant mix, beautiful to look at. It is this Ratchet & Clank on PlayStation 3, which maintains the cornerstones of the series and offers excellent level design, variety, replayability and expandable weapons for all tastes. It won't make you change your mind if you don't particularly like the series, given that even this chapter doesn't differ too much from the previous chapters in terms of mechanics, but there are very few real flaws to be attributed to this latest production of Insomniac, which also shines for as regards a technical sector at the highest levels, colorful and impactful, certainly among the most valid on the square. Second center out of two therefore, Weapons of Destruction is currently the best exponent of the genre on PS3 and probably of the series, do you think it is little?Pros Detailed, fluid and colorful graphics It is a pleasure to play and replay, good level design Numerous and out of range weapons head Cons Level of challenge often low Very few original ideas", "date": "2007-11-12", "grade": null}
