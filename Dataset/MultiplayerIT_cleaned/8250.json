Warriors yes, but delicate Only recently available in Europe, Hana Samurai: Art of the Sword is actually a game that is almost a year old under its belt, having been released in November 2011 in Japan and February in America, with the slightly different title of Sakura Samurai: Art of the sword. The reason for the different publication times will remain a mystery understandable only to marketers; the two Western titles, on the other hand, with their references to cherry trees, flowers and blossoms, take us straight to the spirit of the product which, far from being a realistic representation of cruel and violent feudal Japan, rather dissects its more delicate, fairy-tale and elegant. All this without renouncing a vein of comedy that recalls many manga and anime on the subject, and which in a videogame key can find a very illustrious antecedent in the Ganbare Goemon! series, whose episode for Game Boy is among other things available right on the 'eShop. Once the download is completed and the game has started, for example we are faced with a simple but spectacular introduction, which with a style halfway between ukyo-e (Japanese prints, one of the most distinct forms of art of the Rising Sun) and the anime, and underlined by a very successful musical composition always with a Japanese theme, tells us the essential premise: in a part of the world that years ago lived happily and in harmony, now violence and hatred, and all this because some time before the princess Cherry Blossom, daughter of the gods, was kidnapped by unspecified evil forces. Over time the population has ended up forgetting that era of well-being; all except for a solitary Kappa, an aquatic spirit, convinced that one day a warrior will manifest himself capable of freeing the divine princess and restoring peace to the world. Needless to say, you are the unlikely warrior, a young samurai who one day runs into the likeable Kappa who, without too many ceremonies, entrusts him with the arduous but very important task and teaches him the fundamentals of the art of the sword. The 3D effect For those who have been playing 3D action games since the 90s, stereoscopy, which should also help determine distances more immediately (there is an entire minigame based on this concept) will not be of any practical help. Even for this type of player, however, the 3D effect is the usual pleasant addition that gives a greater sense of depth without, this time, affecting fluidity. It must be said that sometimes the developers have lingered a little too much on the ~three-dimensional~ exasperation of certain elements (the broadswords that the bosses point menacingly at your face, for example) and this seems a little out of tune with the spirit of serenity oriental that permeates the entire product. It's not a country for geeks However, the short tutorial proves to be fundamental, and in fact it cannot be avoided: Hana Samurai: Art of the Sword is an action game in no way comparable to a classic hack 'n' slash  la Samurai Warriors, just to mention a famous representative of the genre. The heart of the game lies in mastering not the moment of the blow, but that of dodging, as the opponent will be vulnerable only and exclusively during or immediately after his attack. In this way, even with a very simple control system (one key for dodging, one for hitting, one for parrying, to be used with care because it could make the sword unusable, and one for the special hit that can be performed after filling the classic barra) the developers have managed to create a gameplay that is a mixture of action and strategy and which above all requires reflexes and precision at the highest levels; not only that there are different types of enemies, each with his own weapon (simple sword-wielding warriors, ferocious, very skilled ~bad~ samurai, soldiers equipped with long spears up to the fearsome ninjas who show off shurikens and various devices in the strictest respect tradition), but each of them will be able to attaattack you in various ways, with a slash from above or to the side, slowly approaching or running towards you, delivering a direct blow or feinting to try to displace you. Although actually very little extended, three large areas for a total of thirty stages, the journey of our anonymous samurai may prove to be much longer than expected, and this by virtue of the difficulty that very soon reaches noteworthy levels and which in occasion of the three boss fights (epic, in particular, the last one) requires extreme dedication and attention, worthy of the greatest classics of the genre; for example, the first two Ninja Gaiden of the polygonal era come to mind. It is not only the difficulty that makes the 7 Euros required perhaps even too little, but all the RPG-like features added to an already solid base system of its own: each dodge performed with the right timing, for example, bestows a precision point, the whose count is reset when you are hit or when one of our blows misses; these points, in addition to constituting a record in themselves, can be sold in the villages, which then present numerous other opportunities such as overcome mini-games which can be accessed to a new special shot, shops to buy different types of objects, expert gunsmiths to repair or make the katana more powerful, inns to regain strength and a whole series of little ~secrets~ that recall, in a small but elegant way, the exploration of the villages of the Legend of Zelda saga. And we probably couldn't give this game a more welcome compliment. The Cherry Orchard Art of the Sword can therefore be long enough, without ever becoming frustrating: slowly, by applying oneself, all obstacles will be overcome, in perfect Zen spirit. And once it's finished? Well, how about a hard mode, where you'll have fewer lives and the enemies will be tougher? The attention to detail behind this game is also evident from the aesthetic aspect: the graphics are perhaps the weak point of the whole, more suitable for a Nintendo DS than for a 3DS, even if this is already less true for characters, decidedly richer in detail than the landscapes; the fluidity is then impeccable as are the beautiful animations of the protagonist and supporting actors, animations which are also indispensable to the game system by indicating which attack you are about to face. But it is from the point of view of style that Hana Samurai surprises and conquers, starting from the beautiful introduction we have already talked about to continue with characters who manage to be comical and graceful at the same time in their representation; not to mention the music, a really well done mix of traditional Japanese instruments and more modern techniques. Paradoxically, but not so much, we understand what Hana Samurai: Art of the Sword is in its secondary mode, which does not involve any playful interaction. It is a garden where mighty cherry trees make their presence, which are completely bare at first, and which fill up with wonderful flowers according to the steps you take with your Nintendo 3DS in sleep mode. Once covered? Nothing, you contemplate them. Looking for the serenity needed to face a new, difficult game session.", "date": "2012-10-18", "grade": "8.7"}
