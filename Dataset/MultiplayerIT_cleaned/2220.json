{"name": "Virtua Striker 3 ver.2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-striker-3-ver2002.html", "text": "On the technical front Without bothering too much about the alleged demerits of a Naomi2 board exploited, for the occasion, yes and no at 50%, GameCube offers a graphics sector of a completely different respect: constant 60 fps, stadiums built with avalanches of polygons, seasoned with animated audience spectator-by-spectator (the most convincing ever) and animations partly rewritten, partly recycled, for 22 sprites boasting a lot of t-shirts and shorts in motion. Erm... I've been wanting to write it for a while: football is a fairy tale! It amazed me! Not only is it perfectly round, not only is it the official World Cup round the corner, but it also reflects the sun when playing at sunset! You will be able to play at the most disparate hours of the day and night, with the appropriate light sources, even though rain and snow are still at large... And if Oscar-worthy shading generates screaming chiaroscuro on players and greens, with a watchful eye neither the tufts of grass that will rise when the ball is impacted, nor the lines that delimit the field, midfield and penalty areas, created with textures capable of perfectly emulating the irregularity of the trace left by the chalk on the grass, will be able to escape a few centimeters high... Perhaps it is the textures that play the lion's share, although they don't denote too many filters when the camera captures them from very close up (billboards on everything)... An unprecedented pearl is the goal net (?), covered with a texture-mapping that surprisingly simulates the interweaving of fabrics used to obtain the stitches... The shots are not selectable, but everything rotates and zooms as expected! A praise to the fixed camera, located inside the door... And the remix doesn't only concern the purely technical-cosmetic side, but also a real ~thickness~ of the game, with which this sequel has been implemented. On the sidelines, not only the crowd will get excited anymore, but also the linesman, complete with a bench behind where the coach waves his arms, while your teammates get excited, in the most agitated phases of the game, cheering on their teammates on the green. By the way, the animation of the various running strikers isn't exactly superlative, even if it can be argued that we've certainly seen worse. The headers, on the other hand, are damned varied, all artfully animated, as are the throws, wonderful if made with the outside of the foot, the stops (even in a scissor kick), and the shoots! A certain basic ~woodiness~ cannot be said to be entirely lost, but it emerges above all during the various celebrations, honestly very little inspired in terms of choreography... Proposed by the various players... The play package contains the names of 22 duly registered athletes... Even if we manage to read a little jappo it is impossible for us to establish which are the authentic names and the ~crippled~ ones: Draru Priaru, it could mean Del Piero, right! No Problem: the names are entirely rewritable... And the Editor goes much further... Perhaps it's the best ever appeared in a game belonging to the same category: we can even go and edit the coach! Come on, Trap... The option is the third from last starting from top to bottom (initial screen): go to the second item and indulge yourself... I swear that everything will be damn intuitive and satisfying: and don't always have scared of those Kanji... Defects on the playful front Before each race we will be able to edit formation and form: it was damned time! Substitutions can be made at any time of the match, complete with a fourth official who will attend the various substitutions. Returning to the referee triad, it will undoubtedly be a satisfaction to see the ball carom on the referee, generating collisions that are always different and quite convincing. On the other hand, you will find the ~behavior~ of the match director less satisfactory who, perhaps in an attempt to make everything more ~simulating~, will distribute red and yellow cards with the same frequency as when Juventus or Milan play at home... Go DeSanctis ... The first matches will end up being soccer matches! Ah, I forgot, then I'll close the topic: small teams will always be penalized! Italy and Brazil, for example, can ~hit~ and illegally enter ~from behind~, as much as they like... Result: the only verbal warning from the referee! Try to do it with my Eire and you will see what happens to your nerves! Certainly your mental balance will be constantly threatened also by a generally late response from the pad, as well as by the chronic lack of movement off the ball that will characterize all your teammates: you are on the wing and theInstead of dictating your passage, your wing flees back! Bah... Don't get me wrong: the very unpleasant peculiarity of the prequel that wanted a player to ~escape~ from a easily reachable ball has been eliminated, but the general static nature of the singles will impose games with 20 strikers in a patch of land... The only alternative : long balls and ride! The passes aren't too precise, but for me this is more a virtue than a defect, like the almost total elimination of the goal from a cross from the flanks. Now even the goalkeepers are throwing their weight into it, since they'll be doing absolutely hands-on interventions... After various game sessions in VS mode, I also encountered a huge bug in the routines that manage the sprites... If we cut, ball to the foot, the field in horizontal lines, i.e. from one side to the other, no opponent, whether managed by the CPU or by a second player, will be able to come and take the ball away from you (!?)... That is, if I score a goal and start to cut the field horizontally, indefinitely, the match will remain on the result of 1 to 0... Perplexed? I understand... However, be careful not to repeat it with the pad: it fluctuates between 80 and 90 thousand cucuzze... Concluding... Today's best Goal... Sega and soccer, women and cars, joys and sorrows. Virtua Striker 3 Ver. 2002 is a very difficult title to read, not only and not so much because this saga has always been used to seeing opinions and friendships divided, but because of its ~ambiguously~ arcade content, but also, and above all , because it alternates notoriously avoidable defects with undeniable merits, and real pearls with equally frank shortcomings ... 64 national teams (+ very juicy extras: I tell you right away that even a certain Sonic is present in the game!), 13 different stadiums and a Road To World Cup mode complete with retirement and training match between starters and substitutes, complete a picture that has many arrows to its bow... Undeniable... How undeniable it is that some of these arrows are not sharp enough, others even blunt! Steps forward compared to the prequel have been made, very true, but I never felt like condemning Virtua Striker 2 Ver. 2000.1 since it was an arcade and should be judged as such... I would have told you at the time: it's an arcade, those looking for a simulation stay away! Here things change a bit, considering that finding ourselves faced with a playful package that is neither explicitly arcade nor fully simulation, we have on balance, on our hands, a title that everyone will like, but will not be loved by anyone ... Neither meat nor fish, my anguish does not decrease... Everyone will find it very positive at first, no one will remember it in the long term... And if we also dutifully consider, given the costs of the imported software, that on 14 March will be Konami's turn, the terms of use of this Virtua Striker 3 Ver. 2002 could be shortened again and dramatically... My advice is to wait... Evaluate them both... Choose... And good International Superstars Soccer 2 everyone... Rainbow: fantastic, wonderful, goal! Now abandoned forever, without a reason, the road traveled with the four Sega Saturn format Victory Goals, therefore abandoned forever, I stress inexplicably, the possibility of being able to contend with Konami and its Perfect-Fighting-Winning Eleven, the palm of best simulation of the entire videogame sideshow, Sega still takes refuge in the only terrain where historically it is natural for it to win: the coin-operative market... At first shy Virtua Striker, born more on the wave of the historic Virtua Racing, Virtua Fighter and Virtua Cop, which not as an intrinsic and autonomous need (yes, iron strikes when it's hot!), takes place in a sequel that is anything but colorless: Model3 shows its muscles and the product lets itself be played, known and appreciated in all salt of the globe... Pure arcade fun: the salient features of soccer are taken, spectacularized, packaged and made usable for users for 3 carefree minutes for the cost of two tokens, spent between a punch on the glass, the reproach of a manager and with the breath of a tamarro who puffs his desire to play down your neck. As much as I may consider myself a tamarro and as much as I am, on balance, a true fan of the series, I do not deny that I have always complained about the lack of a real soccer-game on the Dreamcast: yet Virtua Striker 2 Ver. 2000.1 was there, as beautiful as the sun, and it also gave beer to its Model3-powered counterpart... Bah... Another round, another race... Toshiro Nagoshi and his Amusement Vision enlist in Yamauchi's crew and after baptizing the Monkey port Ball, and the launch of Planet Harriers on mercader market, they promise us a conversion of Virtua Striker 3 capable of offering much more than what can be savored, for the usual two tokens, on Naomi 2... After all, that suffix Ver. 2002 must mean something, right? Well, Nagoshi & friends have well thought of filing a title here and there which, without a doubt, did not convince them either, in the light of a probably bland commitment, imposed by the very low investments that Sega is forced to be able/have to divert to the languishing coin market. operational... Let's also say that the original code was the basis from which to start to build a soccer-game with much more solid and convincing characteristics at a later time, or rather on the 128 bit branded Nintendo. Optimization occurred, let's say it now!", "date": "2002-03-07", "grade": null}
