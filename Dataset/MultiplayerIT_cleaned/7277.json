It is difficult, very difficult to form a precise and rational opinion on the dozen weekly episodes proposed every year, also because probably even the most serious and bigoted viewer must have burst out laughing at least once in seventeen years and because the punctual targets of the satire of the its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are sometimes so profoundly American that the sense of the jokes can easily escape us Italians. But fear not, because the children of the elementary school of cheerful South Park speak the universal comic language of bodily noises and gratuitous curses. Beyond its vulgarity, which may or may not shock depending on individual sensitivity, South Park is a brilliant critique of contemporary society that, between laughter and another, always makes you think. Having already become a video game a few times with always disappointing results, the series has tried again with an RPG signed by the guys from Obsidian Entertainment (Neverwinter Nights 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, but also several less successful titles) which has been postponed over and over again mainly for two reasons: first of all the unfortunate closure of the original publisher THQ and then, above all, the will of Parker and Stone, who closely supervised and guided the project, to offer players - and their fans! - a product that lives up to expectations. Did they succeed? No: they have outdone themselves. And so the day came when a mere TV series tie-in ran for Game of the Year... I'm going down to South Park and I'm going to have a great time... Let's cut the bull's head, since it is one of the questions that has been tormenting the forums and communities since the game was announced: we finished the adventure in about eighteen hours, completing each sidequest and finding all thirty hidden chinpokomon. Once the story has been completed, you can continue to wander around the city if you want to complete the missions left open or want to collect all the objects and weapons. The eighteen hours - which have flown, let's face it - are divided into three days during which the story unfolds: the fundamental premise concerns the mythical Stick of Truth, a simple twig picked up by the pestiferous Eric Cartman at the end of the recent episode ~Titties and Dragons ~. The children had just survived a bloody console war and had learned that even something as stupid as a trivial piece of wood was enough to play and have fun together. Which, in fact, is now at the center of an epic conflict between the king of Kupa, Cartman in fact, and the dark elves led by Kyle Broflovski: we are in the middle, recently moved with our parents. We are the Newbie of South Park - lovingly renamed Coglionazzo despite all efforts to impose our real name - and from the outset it is clear that we are not exactly ordinary children, since we make friends galore without even speaking. The development of the story is very interesting because it is anything but obvious; on the contrary, the story is full of twists and turns and the initial theft of the Stick of Truth is just the incipit of what can easily be defined as a giant episode of the series, structured more or less according to criteria more from a TV show than from a real video game. Which, for the avoidance of doubt, is absolutely a good thing: the screenplay and the dialogues were written by Parker and Stone themselves - who, moreover, lent their voices to the characters as happens with the TV series - and substantially compress into the eighteen hours of above which seventeen years of gags, jokes, quotes and events. You don't need to know South Park to appreciate the story, mind you, but it's definitely a plus and fans might as well get ready for a real evisceration of their favorite series which, while changing medium, doesn't leave out even an ounce of black humor who consecrated it, at times even going beyond those limits broken over the years. Between supernatural farts and alien threats, zombies and government conspiracies, South Park: The Stick of Truth does not miss anything, not even the social satire that made it famous, in an organic and totally self-contained storyline. Furthermore, the multiple narrative stratification surprises and amuses, with the children of South Park engaged in a real LARP (live role-playing game) that they take all too seriously in a surreal context where they are the only ones who realize the threat that is crashing down on their city: as a result, each object in the game has a description in pure RPG style and the swinks at the genre are continuous and insistent, eliciting more than a smile. Bags of potato chips become healing potions, radio antennas become magic wands, diarrhea is an anomalous status, Canada is a remote land and so on: a continuous exchange of meanings and signifiers that will delight those who love RPGs and follow faithfully the bizarre universe of South Park. Consul and censorship ~Bad news, Europe. This part is also censored for you~: with this sentence the game begins a punctual explanation which, in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, replaces some particularly embarrassing scenes, censored by Ubisoft EMEA in the European editions , the Middle East and Africa. The PC version, on the other hand, remained unharmed regardless of the territory, so we were able to view the offending scenes and play the two missing mini-games, a rhythm game and a sort of quick time event dedicated respectively to an anal probe and a fake abortion. The scenes are actually strong, however it is now useless to discuss Ubisoft's choice, with which console users will be forced to live by remembering that it is only a handful of seconds that does not affect the story or the gameplay in the slightest. Apart from this, fortunately, the console versions are almost identical to the PC one, also strong in a graphic setting perfectly in line with the television series and, therefore, anything but heavy or complex: the higher resolution achievable by the PC software offers a slightly cleaner picture, but the experience is the same. Friendly faces everywhere, modest people without temptations... We create the Novellino, our alter ego, by combining a substantial series of aesthetic elements - including hair, features, clothing and accessories - which reflect the canonical style of the series and which, moreover, we can change almost entirely at any time of the adventure thanks to the disproportionate amount of wigs, glasses and more. South Park: The Stick of Truth is, on balance, practically indistinguishable from any television episode, to the point of seeming a real interactive episode thanks to the enormous amount of speech, ambient noises and the care taken by Obsidian Entertainment in the reproduction of the traditional cutout animation that distinguishes the series. For the avoidance of doubt, South Park: The Stick of Truth is completely spoken in English, but is also subtitled in Italian and respects the local adaptation of the series, between sons of sultanas and holy Madonnas. The town of South Park has been faithfully reproduced and the large areas that can be visited, separated by short loads and fake parallax levels, are exactly those of the cartoon. Fans will find practically all the most famous locations, from the Tweak cafeteria to the police station, passing through the city hall, the lake, Lu Kim's Chinese restaurant and even Canada. Naturally, the homes of the various families are inevitable: you can enter practically any house and rummage in furniture and drawers, just like in a normal RPG, often collecting hilarious objects that we can sell for a few dollars. Exploration is essential and is one of the funniest parts of the game: we will be inundated with optional missions from the very first minutes of the game, which can often only be completed after obtaining a key or after learning the skill necessary to overcome a definite obstacle. The missions and rewards intersect satisfactorily and you never get the feeling of being lost, thanks also to the map that allows us to summarize our objectives and treasures yet to be discovered in an instant. The missions, although optional, are actually very important because they allow us to gain new friends and, consequently, to unlock some benefits that will come in handy in combat. The game menus mimic Facebook and Twitter - frequently mentioned in the dialogues themselves, moreover - and after having obtained the friendship of a new character we will receive messages often and willingly: it helps to immerse yourself in the part, of course, and we could not do anything else what a laugh when we were forced to take out the maniacal Al Gore to block his insufferable spam. The idea is appealing, but Obsidian should have worked a little better on the management of the menus and the inventory: the latter appeared to us a bit confused, limited to long lists of objects that cannot be compared and which therefore it made us suffer quite a bit when we started changing the stats and colors, why not, of weapons and equipment. The fact that the game offers dozens upon dozens of costumes (divided into headdresses, vestiti and gloves) with the most disparate bonuses and powers doesn't help: the player is pushed to collect and combine them all to satisfy a particular build or for pure visual pleasure, but the impossibility of changing them on the fly and faster makes this feature of the game less fun than it could have been. It being understood that walking around with a crown of thorns on your head, a pair of claws instead of hands and an Amazon bikini, while holding a giant fiery dildo, is as tremendously blasphemous as it is hilarious and worth every minute spent browsing through the menus. Playstation 3 trophies The large list of Trophies, Objectives and various achievements, often irreverent in turn, is inevitable. They range from spending a certain amount of money to selling absolutely nothing, passing through trophies / achievements that are unlocked simply by following the story to those that require particular actions such as ranting on defeated enemies or throwing your own at opponents. .. excrement. I will leave all my sorrows behind... South Park: The Stick of Truth is an RPG and therefore there's a lot of fighting. We said that the children of the city act out a great live role-playing game, but that doesn't mean they aren't heavy-handed and that there isn't gore and disemboweling galore: just just one of the Jew's abilities, the Circumcisaber, it consists of, well, cutting off a very delicate piece of the target to bring him to his knees in a pool of his own blood. Jew? Well yes: it is one of the four classes that will determine the skills of our alter ego, the Novellino, at the beginning of the adventure. The others are the Warrior, the Magician and the Thief; we chose the Jew because he seemed the most exhilarating and after seeing his Judeo-jitsu in action or the spectacular evocation of the Plagues of Egypt we did not regret our decision. In reality, the choice changes almost nothing, apart from the five main skills that consume PP and that can be upgraded at each level up: each class can equip any weapon or accessory, so the difference is really minimal and merely reflects player preferences in terms of special attacks more focused on direct damage, anomalous states and so on. Among other things, it is not possible to upgrade all skills to the maximum, just as it is not possible to unlock all the benefits granted by friendships, which in a certain sense pushes the player to face the adventure over again by choosing a different solution or to wait for the likely DLCs. One might therefore get the wrong idea of a rather superficial turn-based combat system, but that of South Park: The Stick of Truth, while simple enough, proved to be incredibly fun. Obsidian Entertainment went for an approach that reminded us of Mario and Luigi RPGs on Nintendo laptops, where virtually every action on the battlefield is interactive. By pressing a key at the right time you can attack normally with a single powerful blow or chain a series of light lunges, but you must always take into account the defensive posture of the opponent which could cancel our shots from a distance or in melee. The various special attacks require particular combinations of keys, like a minigame: if we don't want the unicorn called by Kenny to pierce his skull (ugly bastard!) we will have to press the keys indicated on the screen, just as we will have to repeatedly press a certain key to help Jimmy complete his song to boost our offensive and defensive capabilities. The fact of having only one companion - however interchangeable - during the fight made us turn up our noses a bit, but Obsidian Entertainment has balanced the clashes well and you never get the feeling of being at a disadvantage or needing greater control over the team: summons, for example, which include supernatural powers such as Jesus Christ (sic!) and the excrement Mr. Hankey, can be used once a day and never on bosses. The friends of South Park, however, are well diversified in terms of skills and mechanics, guaranteeing a good variety both visually and strategically: Cartman the wizard, for example, has very few life points but inflicts devastating damage while Butters the paladin can heal at any turn and get the attention of his enemies by literally pissing them off. Furthermore, each of them has a special ability that allows you to solve particular environmental puzzles, perhaps by making Stan's dog urinate on electronic devices to short-circuit them. Even at this juncture, South Park doesn't disappoint, because it's even possible", "date": "2014-03-04", "grade": "9.2"}
