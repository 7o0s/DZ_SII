To satisfy his desire, the beautiful Sylvia, representative of the UAA (Union of American Assassins), offers him a challenge: in exchange for a certain amount of money, Travis will be able to challenge the ten best killers in America and earn their position in chart, eventually becoming number one. In the scenario of Santa Destroy, a fictitious city whose neighborhoods bear the name of wrestling moves, our fearless protagonist will therefore have to work hard to raise money, pay it from time to time to the UAA and then access ten exciting fights to determine who he is the best assassin in the country. This is basically the plot of No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise, the ~remix~ version of the Suda 51 action game released for Wii in March 2008. Enhanced by high-definition graphics, the presence of some bosses taken from No More Heroes 2 (which can be tackled in a sort of ~dream mode~) and by a series of small expedients, the game alternates elements of undoubted excellence right from the start with other frankly mediocre ones, lights and shadows that find space in a typically ~old gen~ structure, with very sparse locations from a visual point of view and almost not at all interactable. Madness Gardeners No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise can be played via both Dual Shock and using a Move controller. The latter behaves exactly like the Wii-mote in the original version, so don't expect to swing in real time because this practice is only required at the end of each combo, or when you need to finish off your opponent with a blow capable of cutting his head or trunk cleanly. We carried out our tests using the classic Dual Shock, which thanks to the work done by AQ Interactive does not present any problems in the configuration of the commands nor is it lacking in particular features, given the integrated accelerometer and therefore the possibility of reloading the lightsaber when the The indicator on the right of the screen empties. At that juncture it's really hard not to misunderstand the movements of Travis, who has to wiggle his sword until it's back fully loaded. We were talking about the combat system: depending on the difficulty level selected (initially only ~easy~ and ~normal~ are available, while the ~difficult~ level locks once the game is finished), our character can take advantage of a semi - automatic, but otherwise things change little: the Square and Triangle buttons are used respectively to make low or high blows with the sword, while the Circle button allows us to punch. A charged physical attack on an opponent who closes behind his guard can cause a stun and pave the way for an increasing series of wrestling moves to be performed by moving both analog sticks: a very nice and intuitive solution; pity that rarely such maneuvers, however spectacular, are effective enough to eliminate an enemy, even a low-level one, at the first blow. At the end of a combo, when our opponent is dying, a quick time event appears on the screen in which you have to quickly move the right analog stick (or the Move controller) in the highlighted direction to perform a coup de grace. In the case of outnumbered clashes, this solution can allow us to eliminate even more enemies in one go. Finally, as regards evasive maneuvers, during the parade Travis can quickly discard to the side and therefore protect himself from attacks that cannot be parried, characterized by a golden light. The boss fights undoubtedly represent the maximum expression of these dynamics: as per tradition, you have to learn how to move and attack the enemy, then take advantage of all the opportunities in which he shows his side. And surprises are not lacking, thanks to the extraordinary direction of Suda 51, which is undoubtedly the best part of the game. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-one trophies that we can get by playing No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise. Most of the bronze trophies are obtained simply by progressing in the game, i.e. by defeating the various bosses and moving up the UAA ranking. However, things get a little more complicated for the silver trophies, obtainable by completing more specific objectives, such as collecting all the luchador stickers or obtaining a certain score in the Score Attack mode. Finally, the two gold trophies are unlocked by reaching 15 million points in the Score Attack and defeating a total of 5100 nemhere. A conversion buried in memory As mentioned above, the structure of No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise sees us wandering the streets of Santa Destroy in search of unlikely part-time jobs (cracking coconuts, collecting garbage, convincing kittens to try their hand at a speed, etc.) or contract killings, in order to raise the money needed from time to time to access a challenge valid for the UAA ranking. The map of the city is displayed in a sandbox style, but unfortunately the realization of the scenario leaves a lot to be desired and more than anything else it reminds us that this title is not only two years old, but was also conceived keeping in mind the limits of the Wii. Beyond the lack of interaction and the simplicity of the polygonal models that make up the buildings, our rides aboard Travis's tamarrissimo white scooter are accompanied by a frame rate plagued by continuous drops, in certain situations so evident as to make it difficult to drive (and the numerous invisible obstacles, in this sense, do not help). Also given the quality of the minigames that make up the part-time jobs, as well as the repetitiveness of the murder missions, what results is a very often boring experience, in which we drag ourselves (as quickly as possible) from one street to another to reach as soon as possible the amount necessary to face a new challenge and access a boss fight. The places where we can earn money stand in the way of those where we can spend it: a laboratory where we can buy new swords (there are four in all) and upgrades for them, a clothing store where we can customize Travis's appearance by buying jackets , t-shirts, sunglasses and really stylish pants, as well as a video store from which our protagonist usually stocks up on hard videos, but which also sells the most famous Mexican luchador matches (from whose vision Travis can learn new wrestling moves). Many of these objects can be equipped when we are in the hotel room where the character lives, who can only save the game by sitting on the toilet. And it is just as Travis is sitting on the toilet that a little surprise arrives: after a few hours, the system will ask you if you are tired. What seems like the classic ~anti-fatigue~ measure turns out to be a nice trap, as Travis falls asleep on the cup and dreams of fighting against some of the bosses of No More Heroes 2! And this is just one of the numerous ~artistic~ finds of the game which, we repeat, in this sense immediately reveals itself to be an extraordinarily fascinating product, imbued with a style that is in many ways brilliant.", "date": "2011-06-16", "grade": "7.3"}
