The result was as exhilarating as it was scary: to heal your team at the Pokmon Center you had to wait almost an hour, the Gym Leader of each city could only be faced once a day, while even just to start the adventure you had to invite three friends from Facebook. Obviously it was all taken to the extreme to demonstrate how microtransactions and in-app purchases would completely ruin the gaming experience. It is a concept that we have found again - albeit in a much more contained form - in Micromon, a cheeky clone of the Nintendo franchise created by the Costa Rican team Moga. Perhaps the first to not completely flop. Unoriginal and without personality, Micromon is the closest there is to a Pokmon game on mobile From Kanto to Pixekai Micromon opens with a sort of meta-story in the style of Digimon, in which the protagonist is sucked into a virtual world called Pixekai, inhabited by avatars and colorful wild monsters. Part of the interface suggests that the bridge between Pixekai and the real world is the smartphone (or tablet) you are holding, but any attempt to differentiate yourself from Pokmon ends here. In the blink of an eye, the game throws into the pot all those elements that have been re-proposed in the Nintendo series for twenty years. Starting with the old professor who gives us our first Pok... er... Micromon, passing through an evil organization called Black Root and going as far as defeating four elite opponents to become the coolest trainer of all. Seriously, Micromon does nothing to hide its ~inspiration~: creatures to collect fight, learn new skills, level up and evolve; they differ from each other in rarity, in types and elements, based on the classic rock-paper-scissors system at the base of the battles in Pokmon. In this regard, however, the developers have opted for a poorer subdivision, merging some types with unclear results: Micromon of the Normal and Special type are joined by those of Fire, Air, Water and Mineral. Among the many advantages of Pokmon was the fact that it was extremely clear in the variety of types and elements: the fact that a Thunder was Supereffective against a Water or Flying-type opponent clearly made sense. In Micromon, on the other hand, there are very forced weaknesses: according to which criterion should Fire beat Air? Aside from disengagements like this, the combat works well overall, sometimes managing to be fun and sometimes offering a demanding challenge. It is important to underline that the time spent with the game has not yet allowed us to verify the depth of the fights with complex teams and at high levels. As is known, under the guise of a simple turn-based RPG, Pokmon rewards elaborate strategies and a party of creatures grown with great attention, but obviously it is an aspect that can only emerge after dozens and dozens of hours of play and discussion with the community. Micromon doesn't just copy Pokmon's gameplay, but also some of the art style. Of the approximately 140 monsters that populate the world of Pixekai (more will be added with the next updates), a good part is limited to being a pale imitation of the creatures from Nintendo. Teratail, for example, is the failed twin of the elegant Lapras, Furan looks like a poorly drawn Eevee, while Lyco is practically Ponyta colored in blue. This doesn't mean that there aren't Micromon that are better than others, and at the same time even among the most recent Pokmon designs that are embarrassing to say the least are remembered, but what Moga's game lacks is a touch of originality and aesthetic taste in plus, with the result that most of the work done by the developers looks woefully amateurish. And this regardless of the graphic style that you may like or not. It's a shame because, although it is a rough version and with (much) less charisma of Pokmon, Micromon ultimately works and succeeds in its attempt to replicate a long-established and appreciated formula as best as possible. Finally, let's spend just a few words on the delicate issue of the microtransaction system. In theory, the game can be completed without spending a single cent on in-app purchases, but as expected, the developers have managed to make life more difficult for those who don't want to put their hands on their wallet. Remember the dozens and dozens of UltraBalls wasted catching legendary Pokmon like Deoxys, Ho-oh, Mewtwo and Suicune? Well, in Micromon avnetwork available only three attempts for each battle, which probably means having to repeat the same battle countless times. Or, alternatively, you can spend real money to buy the equivalent of the MasterBall and go without fail.", "date": "2014-08-22", "grade": "6.5"}
