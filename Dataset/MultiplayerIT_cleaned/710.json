{"name": "Mario Smash Football", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-smash-football.html", "text": "No tear gas on the pitch Tennis, golf, baseball, basketball, even snowboarding. Over the years, the now former king of platforms has become a true sportsman, a multi-athlete capable of excelling in any discipline. Yet the Europeans, and especially us Italians, have always found Mario's apparent disinterest in the national sport par excellence, football. Really all it took was a little patience. Yes because with Mario Smash Football, finally every Gamecube owner will finally be able to indulge in the whim of making a tackle that slipped on Princess Peach's knees, a hard entry on Yoshi and so on. In reality, more than football, you play five-a-side, 5 against 5. You choose a captain from the list of super-famous characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi and Donkey Kong), and then you decide which companions have next to the green rectangle between Toad, Martelkoopa, Birdo and Koopa. The game structure, of course, is the furthest from simulation there can be; faithful to the philosophy of creating games that can be easily enjoyed by anyone, this Nintendo production is also based on simple commands and a few key combinations. The development team is the same one that made the unjustly underappreciated Sega Soccer Slam; excellent credentials therefore, and above all a good experience in the genre so as to guarantee a valid result. And in fact Mario Smash Football is certainly a valid product that offers an anarchic, confusing, noisy, but (or for this very reason) extremely fun approach to football. We were talking about the choice of captains; although they are not immediately displayed through statistics or indicators, each character has significantly different characteristics once they take the field. And so Mario is balanced, Luigi is excellent in passing, Peach and Daisy are very fast, Donkey Kong slow and not much in defense but excellent shooter and hitter, and so on. The matches, as already mentioned, flow in total chaos. The rules, as well as fouls, do not exist, and for this reason the very incorrect shoulder strike (Y button) is quickly preferred to the classic tackle (button Y), to be carried out not only on the ball carrier but also on the unfortunate teammates who try to come to his aid. As if that weren't enough, the programmers have decided to insert a whole series of bonuses, which can be recalled with the X key, in perfect Mario Kart style; bananas to make your opponents slide, green and red shells to hit them mercilessly, blue shells to paralyze them for a few seconds, explosive bombs and even huge bolts to release in their blind fury. The harsh law of goal But the most important thing in football is the goal. In Mario Smash Football there is no shortage of goals, so much so that it is possible to see bicycle kicks from midfield, volleys, headers ending up in the back of the bag with incredible frequency. Yes, because getting from one side of the pitch to the other takes just a few seconds, and the changes in front follow one another hysterically. The shot, delegated to the B button, can be charged for a few moments in order to increase its power and therefore its danger; in addition, however, the team captain has an extra card, or a super shot which, if scored, increases his scores by two points. However, the opposite scale lies in the fact that not only a long loading is necessary, during which one remains at the mercy of the opponents, but it is also required to stop a sliding bar in two points, exactly like in golf games at the moment of hit. If all goes well, however, the result is spectacular, with a skit during which the character is surrounded by a colored aura, to then unleash a monstrous shot complete with a wake in tow capable of bringing the same goalkeeper into the net. The fact that the game facilitates the action with quick touches and first shots further contributes to making the matches a real, hilarious mess. And as if that weren't enough, a huge Bowser can enter the field in a completely random way, ready to spit flames on anyone who happens to be next to him. Everything perfect then? Not exactly. First of all, Mario Smash Football is clearly a title that gives its best in multiplayer games with human opponents. Up to 4 players can take part in the challenges, and once you start playing it's really, really hard to resist the temptation to spend hours playing rematches. In single player however, despite the abundance of cups and tournaments, of material to unlock and the discreet artificial intelligence, the immediacy - and therefore little depth - of the game mechanics is felt very soon.Of course, the game remains fun and enjoyable, but buying Mario Smash Football only for the single player mode means enjoying 50% of what Nintendo has to offer. As for the technical aspect, the programmers have done a very good job overall, especially in the polygonal modeling of the protagonists which is well characterized and detailed. The stadiums are also positive, all extremely different from each other in terms of setting, and the special effects are excellent; it is a pity that visible drops in the frame rate should be reported during the most agitated situations. Appropriate but nothing more than the sound. Comment Mario Smash Football is an absolutely recommended title for every Gamecube user, even if only vaguely interested in a markedly arcade football game. The Nintendo production makes immediacy its best card, allowing you to quickly give life to games where chaos, but also fun, reign absolutely supreme from the first to the last minute. This immediacy inevitably favors the multiplayer mode enormously, but at the same time making the single player one pleasant but rather limited and weak. However, this does not call into question the merits of what is in fact one of the best Gamecube titles of this Christmas season. Pros Exceptional Multiplayer Excellent graphics Great immediacy Cons Weak single player Some slowdown Sound could be improved How many times have we talked about the wild marketing of the Mario figure by Nintendo in recent years? Too many. Today let's forget it, let's forget for a moment that it's yet another product with the moustached plumber on the cover, let's pretend nothing happened. The reason is simple: Mario has finally taken up football!", "date": "2005-12-09", "grade": null}
