Often and willingly in the mobile sector we tend to underestimate the importance of the audio sector, but the Swedish developers of Senri have shown that they hold this aspect of the experience in great consideration, accompanying the platform action of their new title with a soundtrack of valuable, elegant and touching, supported by an excellent narration in English. The protagonist of the game is Leo, a mustachioed ~furball~ who has spent his life collecting gold coins... only to have them disappear overnight, taken away by a mysterious thief who could however be one of the his relatives, since the place where that fortune was hidden was known only in the family. Was it cousin Victor? Aunt Olga? Or uncle Sergei? Leo wants to find out, and so begins an exciting journey through nineteen levels (plus a series of extra challenges based on sheer speed) in the perspective of five different environments, each characterized by unique colors, situations and puzzles: from the panoramas of a forest lush in the dim lights of a dungeon, from a rocky and ancient wasteland to an evening landscape, and so on. In Leo's Fortune there is to jump, as in any platform, but the gameplay is also and above all based on the resolution of physics-based environmental puzzles, as well as on the avoidance of traps and deadly chasms, elements which replace the possible presence of enemies. Leo's Fortune is a platformer of excellent quality, full of atmosphere and with excellent gameplay Damn luck It only takes a few minutes of play to understand that we are undoubtedly facing one of the most interesting titles released this year on the App Store. Starting with the almost perfect touch control system, consisting of two invisible ~sliders~ located on the left and right side of the screen, and which allow you to move the character in one direction and the other, as well as to ~inflate~ it and ~flatten~ him using his peculiar physical constitution, so as to take advantage of acceleration on ramps and Sonic-style loops, leap to reach platforms placed at a certain height and move objects that can be useful for operating a device, drop a trolley, collect the traditional coins (which contribute to the evaluation of the final performance), open a door and so on. The ways Leo's abilities are used throughout the campaign are really funny and surprising. We're dealing with a furball, right? So why not allow it to expand to press buttons, or flatten in contact with the water to reach the bottom? There is not a single idea misused in Leo's Fortune, and in one clever move they even managed to undo the possible frustration of sudden death by placing checkpoints galore. This element inevitably affects the duration of the experience, which unfortunately only involves us for a couple of hours. Such a solid and inspired system had to be able to count on a technical realization that was up to the situation, and as mentioned at the beginning, an excellent job was done from this point of view too, with lots of handmade assets, excellent fluidity of the scrolling and a skilful use of colors and lighting, which contributes to the great atmosphere of the adventure together with the aforementioned, masterful audio sector. The purchase price, in line with the premium productions on the App Store, is perfectly adequate to the quality of the offer, moreover without in-app purchase.", "date": "2014-04-28", "grade": "9.0"}
