{"name": "Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-order-of-ecclesia-recensione.html", "text": "After having consolidated its permanence on Nintendo DS, the only console that allows the Konami series to continue on its two-dimensional path, Koji Igarashi's creature finally seems to have found the courage also to definitively leave the constraints of the now abused castle and thus discover the what is ~outside~, although the manor is still present even if it is no longer central in importance. Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia thus becomes a chapter of moderate importance within the economy of the interminable odyssey against Dracula and the like, even if in reality it soon becomes clear that things have changed more in form than in substance. And fortunately, one might say... Belmont? No, Shinoa If for you there is no Castlevania without a protagonist of the Belmont family, then prepare your handkerchiefs to dry your bitter tears; on this occasion, in fact, there is no longer a trace of the vampire slayer family and the dirty work is entrusted instead to a heroine, such as Shinoa, perfectly at ease among the undead and monsters of all kinds even without the historic whip. A well-crafted and quite intriguing character who however is debased by a truly rose water plot, which always remains on the sidelines of the action without providing particular points of interest. This is a weak point that Konami should seriously reflect on in view of the next chapters. As if that weren't enough, the in-game tutorial of the commands and the various aspects of the gameplay is practically completely absent, giving the game a clear address towards the user group who already knows Castlevania well. Having said that, what is very interesting is that together with Shinoa a new combat system is also introduced, particularly versatile and satisfying; in practice in Order of Ecclesia everything happens through the glyphs, expressions of weapons and spells that appear once the enemies have been eliminated and which the protagonist can absorb and consequently use; the beauty lies in the fact that each hand of Shinoa is associated with a key (X and Y), which can be entrusted with a different weapon. And so if at the beginning you limit yourself to associating a normal sword to both buttons, thus allowing you to perform combos by alternating the pressure of the buttons, later the possibility of experimentation increases exponentially as you increase the glyphs at your disposal, with a huge variety of different combinations to look for the most effective. All this, however, keeping an eye on the magic points bar, which is affected with each blow performed, in proportion to the power of the same; although the bar in question recharges automatically in a short time, this component provides a further strategic aspect to be taken into serious consideration. The precision of the controls, which has always been the trademark of the series, and the goodness of the level design finally enhance everything, thus making the combat in Order of Ecclesia fresh and intriguing while remaining solidly anchored to the standards that have decreed its success during all these years . My kingdom for a castle We said at the beginning that one of the most interesting points of the Konami production is to be found in the setting of the game, finally untied from the limits of the castle. Now the progression of the adventure is practically divided into levels, with different settings within a single map; this factor has allowed the programmers to offer a variety of locations hitherto unknown to the series, together with a linearity that often translates into a significantly reduced backtracking compared to the standards. A choice therefore that we feel like promoting, even if in all honesty it must be said that according to the writer this has affected a slight loss of the ~charm~ and personality that has distinguished Castlevania over the years. A turning point therefore undoubtedly useful, but not without the other side of the coin, to be clear, even taking into account the grand finale in the Count's manor. We were talking a few lines above of a trend of Order of Ecclesia such as to direct this chapter more towards fans of the series than towards ~newcomers~; a feeling that becomes a solid certainty in the face of the really high, absolutely ~old school~ difficulty of the boss fights, capable of making even seasoned players sweat the proverbial seven shirts. This choice is not particularly shared, which indeed often opens the doors of frustration for less tenacious and stoic users. From a technical point of view, however, the effort of Japanese programmers has very little to be forgiven, on the contrary; the richness of detail and the goodness of the animations places Order of Ecclesia certainly among the highest pointsof the two-dimensional production on the Nintendo DS, and the only small perplexity is left by a couple of settings that are not perfectly coherent on an artistic level with the rest and the sometimes forced inclusion of three-dimensional elements. But it's really about nitpicking. The sound accompaniment is excellent as usual, which is even accompanied by a well-made spoken word (in English). Comment Order of Ecclesia is a chapter in the Castlevania series that puts a lot of irons in the fire, shuffling the cards and introducing some particularly interesting innovations, such as an excellent combat system and the exit from the castle in favor of external settings that add variety to the formula. All this without however changing the substance, which remains extremely faithful to the dictates loved by the public over the years. It is a pity that these innovations and the great overall quality are destined to interest only the ~historical~ user of the saga; the high difficulty of the boss fights and a general lack of accessibility of the product are factors that inevitably lead to closing the doors to many people potentially interested in taking part in the fight against Dracula. Pros Great control system High quality level design Technically very valid Against Tutorial, this stranger Excessive difficulty at times Outside the castle the atmosphere is not the same", "date": "2009-01-08", "grade": null}
