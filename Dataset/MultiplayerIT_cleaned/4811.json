First of all, the review you are reading concerns the last two episodes of The Walking Dead: A New Frontier, the fourth and the fifth. In fact, we have decided to convey all the impressions and considerations resulting from the long epilogue of the Telltale series into a single text, so as to be able to advise players who are still undecided about purchasing in the best possible way. Secondly, as has already happened with all the other reviews of the Californian software house's episodic adventures, we have carefully avoided any spoilers by passing over the details and information regarding the plot. Being titles so focused on the narrative component, any consideration of characters, scenes and events simply risks ruining your experience. Having made the due promises, let's go into the details of the article by examining the two chapters entitled Thicker Than Water and From the Gallows: the first is a transitional chapter while the second represents the adequate conclusion of a third season which, concretely, is not never managed to take off. Episode 4: Thicker Than Water The penultimate episode of this third season of The Walking Dead perfectly embodies the concept of transition. It is a chapter that flies away in an instant, completely devoid of memorable moments, but also only of scenes that somehow involve the player forcing him to make important or substantial choices. Ninety minutes of long acclimatization chats, essential for getting to know some of the supporting characters in more depth, in particular Ava, David's braggart bodyguard, the brother of the protagonist, probably one of the best-constructed secondary figures also thanks to his recurring presence in several episodes. And obviously to better define the strange relationship that keeps the group that was created during the season glued, but also tragically distant. The chapter tries in vain to deepen the morbid bond of the broken couple made up of Tripp and Eleanor where we, impersonating Javier, alternately act as accomplices, friends, uncomfortable third parties or ~official rulers of snot~. In reality, Thicker Than Water never manages to go beyond conversations which, while forcing us to make the usual choices of attitude (defining them as moral decisions in this chapter is not really possible), remain superficial in the literal sense of the word: only superficial, not never making us really attached to these secondary characters and making it practically impossible to make us even want to understand their point of view. There are only two exceptions to a chapter that we would otherwise consider insufficient. First of all, an extremely well-constructed scene written by Telltale that sees Javier become a mentor and advisor, as well as the first witness, of Clementine's transition from childhood to adolescence, with the crucial event marked by her first period. It is an often taboo subject, not only in video games, which is told here with the due sensitivity and with a perfect sense of embarrassment that the writer, a longtime male gamer, would have actually felt if he had been in that moment in that place at having to have that discussion. Clementine is perfect, naive despite her incredible strength and vitality that made her survive for three long seasons despite the difficulties and tragic events that involved her without ever breaking her. It's just a pity that this moment really runs out in an instant, it slips away in a few minutes, leaving us with the feeling that Telltale wanted to insert it as a last attempt to give some depth to this third season and not as an actual addition to the story. The second noteworthy element is the ending. The epilogue of this fourth episode is where all our participation in hundreds of dialogues make sense. It is when we are faced with a tragic choice, characterized by an unexpected consequence, that this fourth chapter finally takes off thanks to a skilful mix of surprise and action that literally leaves us breathless, in front of what seems the imminent end of the walled city of Richmond. We are forced by events to take responsibility for our decisions and the actions of our supporting actors but it is practically too late: in a breath the episode ends just as it was gaining depth. Episode 5: From the Gallows The chapter opens exactly where the cliffhanger of the previous episode left us: we are in the thick of itmiddle of the action and we will have to try in every way to face what appears to be an unstoppable onslaught of the undead. Finally the walkers return to take on a thick veil, to somehow resume their role as a threat that moves all the events of Robert Kirkman's universe, rather than a simple interlude between one dialogue and the next to justify some pressure at the moment right of the correct button. It is certainly this element that probably makes From the Gallows an atypical episode compared to the custom of the last two seasons of Telltale's The Walking Dead: there is much more action, the dialogues have a greater sense of urgency, we perceive that we are in danger and everything it unfolds quickly but with incredible grace. Each element is well calibrated and the scenes flow smoothly and pleasantly before leaving us to grapple with the last, inexorable decisions. It is at this moment that everything done in the past will fall on us with interest, inexorably defining the relationship we wanted to create between Javier and Kate, which has now become a real war booty between the two loved/hated brothers and, consequently, with eldest surviving son Gabe. We will find out who will go with whom and what will be the outcome of the fragile balance of power that we have helped to create or dissolve. It is therefore a pity that, apart from the very few prominent characters who have accompanied us for all five episodes, the same exact care has not been placed by Telltale for most of the secondary ones. In particular, it made us turn up our noses to discover that Tripp and Eleanor or Ava or the small group of bosses who ran Richmond, even if they survived our decisions, are practically forgotten or left so far behind the lines as to force us not to care about them. Almost as if they had suddenly become mere extras. Eleanor in particular, after in our case we had come close to having an affair with her, practically vanished after a very short argument that turned into a moment of relaxation in an instant. No one cared about her anymore, not even the developer. And then Clementine remains. Once again she is truly the backbone of The Walking Dead's narrative strength, even in this third season where unfortunately she is too secondary an element, too kept aside in the narrative. And, perhaps, on balance, this is really the greatest flaw of A New Frontier: forcing us to command and follow the events of a group of people who only cross paths with Clementine. A handful of tragic heroes who in the end still have a self-contained story, even a positive one, but who never manage to make us forget, with great regret, what we experienced in the first two video game seasons of The Walking Dead. We would have liked to experience the deeds of the little girl who grew up among the wanderers much more, experience her maturity firsthand and, once we reach the epilogue, we are left with only one hope that we will cultivate in all the months that separate us from the inevitable fourth season: returning to having her as the protagonist because, apparently, Telltale was no longer able to draw a character of this thickness. A few bugs too many We also leave a few lines on the technical aspect of these last two episodes. While perfectly respecting what was written in the reviews of the previous episodes, we must recognize that From the Gallows, the last chapter, was decidedly dirtier than the others. The version we tested, the one actually available on the PC market, crashed at least a couple of times and we noticed a lot of animations without key frames. In practice, the characters go from one movement or facial expression to another completely unrelated. So suddenly. With a rather ugly result to see and decidedly not very credible in situations in which someone is about to die or is being chased by walkers. For the rest, what has already been said in the past applies: the game is exclusively in English, including subtitles and has an excellent artistic cut, decidedly enhanced compared to the previous episodes and the other titles of the software house, thanks to its availability exclusively on the platforms of this generation .", "date": "2017-06-18", "grade": "7.5"}
