Given the positive previous experience, it is almost obvious to check if this Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - 10th Anniversary Edition successfully manages to bring all the original contents to tablets and smartphones: it is more interesting to see if the title convinces from the point of view technical and if there have been any evolutions compared to the GTA III port. Vices and virtues Tommy Vercetti's criminal adventure was perhaps the stylistically most particular one in the entire history of GTA, thanks to an 80s setting that allowed Rockstar designers to indulge themselves with regard to the look and music of the product, which in this latest incarnation they are not affected much by the weight of the years, far from it: thanks to the recent flashbacks for synthesizers and beautiful company in the current pop scene, the well-stocked soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - 10th Anniversary Edition appears even more apt than its original release date, while the graphics compensate for the decade it carries on its back with a well-chosen exploitation of the potential of iOS and Android devices. Tested on an iPhone 4S, the title first of all showed off an absolute fluidity, practically never showing the side to frame rate drops or slowdowns of any kind. The resolution and size of the display then do their duty, making the inevitable shortcomings of the product less evident in terms of texture definition and attention to detail and at the same time enhancing the brilliance of the colours. The final effect is undoubtedly of great impact, with the neon and bright shades of Vice City that blend perfectly with the characteristics of a smartphone screen: thanks also to the stylistic peculiarities of the game, therefore, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - 10th Anniversary Edition represents an even more prestigious technical achievement than its predecessor. Notable improvements have also been achieved in terms of loading, now much faster and therefore aligned with the standards of mobile playful use: the possibility also remains to close the application and resume from the exact point where you left off, and the save screen includes two cloud slots to share progress in case you want to use another device to play. An eventuality to be taken into consideration if you have both a smartphone and a tablet, given that the control system -as with GTA III- has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the device it runs on. On a smaller touchscreen it is more convenient to use the thumbs to manage the movement and the various virtual keys, even if the latter are clearly very small in size; conversely, on generously sized displays the interface and indicators appear much clearer and more fingers can be used to better manage the situation, but with the requirement of having a support on which to place the device. In principle however - starting from the assumption that obviously playing with a pad is a completely different thing - one cannot complain too much about Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - 10th Anniversary Edition in this area, given that it could hardly have been done better: and even if the cumbersomeness of the commands should lead to a few too many game overs, the faculty granted by the title to immediately restart the failed mission largely manages to counterbalance everything. What is certain is that at the price at which it is offered, the Rockstar product represents one of the best deals currently available on the App Store and Google Play: spending less than five Euros, you take home a long and articulated adventure, full of secondary activities and above all marked by an exciting and masterfully narrated story, the latter a very rare commodity in the mobile sector.", "date": "2012-12-17", "grade": "9.0"}
