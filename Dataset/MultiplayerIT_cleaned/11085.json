The reform of the judicial system The game manual points out, several times, that the legal system represented in Phoenix Wright is completely fictitious: and thank goodness, given that we are faced with an omnipotent but essentially a bit idiotic judge, a lawyer and a prosecutor real superstars who vie for the favors of the judgment with orations and gestures worthy more of a theatrical representation than of a courtroom, with defendants always desperately ~guilty until proven guilty~, with witnesses who regularly present themselves as saints and equally regularly they turn out to be devils, and to a stubborn fixation of the whole system on evidence, the only component capable of proving innocence and guilt and overturning a sentence that seemed already written. the legal system depicted in Phoenix Wright is completely fictional The reform of the judicial system T&T does not change the winning formula of the prequels one iota: each case, there are five in all, is divided into an investigative part (which, however, is not always present) and the actual trial. In the first phase Phoenix, sometimes accompanied by his valid companions, moves from one point to another of the city looking for evidence and interrogating anyone who stands in front of him as any good American TV detective would do; in the process, however, the witnesses are questioned and counter-examined trying to reveal the contradictions thanks to the famous evidence mentioned above. All this with the classic point-and-click mechanics which, we have already had the opportunity to say in other reviews, is perfect in its simplicity, and immediately cancels that distance between the player and the game universe which is technically called ~interface ~, the time necessary for the assimilation of which, usually, divides the Masterpieces from all the other games. You don't change the winning team, it is logical, but it is appropriate to say that, if you have already played two or three titles in the series, perhaps you will begin to wonder if it is not perhaps the case to look for some other solution ... Psychic locks Phoenix Wright is not a Prince of the Forum like many others: in fact, he has a Magatama, a powerful talisman of the Japanese tradition given to him by Mia Fey, which allows him to detect a closure in his interlocutor so strong as to be represented with real padlocks. These padlocks are to be unhinged with the same mechanism for presenting the evidence of the trial, but everything remains a nice, albeit minimal and not new, variant of the classic gameplay of the series. Lots of characters, looking for a culprit The other great feature of the series, after the game system, is the universe itself in which it is set. All the characters, perhaps the protagonist is the only almost normal one, are highly characterized unlikely figures, worthy of an anime of the demented genre that was so fashionable a few years ago. Many characters that we have already had the opportunity to love (or hate) in the prequels return in all their narrative force: apart from the obvious Phoenix Wright, first of all the judge, an extremely nice but also extremely fickle gray old man, then Mia and Maya Fey , Phoenix's mentor and assistant respectively, Larry Butz, Phoenix's childhood friend, womanizer and irresponsible who, however, we don't know how, often proves indispensable to save the life of an innocent (it seems that in the fictitious country where 'the game is set the death penalty exists), nice extras such as Wendy Oldbag, the classic old nuisance and tyrant, and many others that we leave you the pleasure of discovering. An important new entry is the very mysterious Godot, inexperienced but already a strong prosecutor: everything about him, even his face hidden by a mask, is shrouded in uncertainty; it seems that he knows Wright and his main goal is to defeat him in court, but who knows why... The other great feature of the series, after the game system, is the universe itself in which it is set. Lots of characters, looking for a culprit You will have understood that with these premises the cases can only be intricate, exaggerated, often even grotesque, treated with lightness and humor even when they are heinous murders, without however renouncing a touch of drama and the necessary, and edifying, happy ending. Even in this, T&T reveals itself, if not for the stories themselves, not at all unpublished and perhaps, speaking of it as a veteran of the series, in need of a breakthrough; it is no coincidence that this time the events present themselves immediately very intricate and difficult, so tangled that occasionally collectingideas is necessary but arduous, while in the other episodes the difficulty gradually increased from case to case. And the technical part? You guessed it: it's all the same, with semi-animated manga-style screens and music that responds perfectly, and indeed contributes to creating it, to the situation. Comment In short, everything is (almost) the same: is it a bad thing or a good thing? For the experts of the series, playing Trials and Tribulations is a bit like reading the new episode of a Montalbano-like literary saga: the author is, as always, in top form, the characters, settings, dynamics and atmospheres are those that they have loved each other for a long time and give a reassuring sense of familiarity. But, perhaps, one begins to feel the need for something new. T&T is then penalized by the strange choice to postpone it compared to Apollo Justice, and by a very high difficulty right from the start. In short, it is not the ideal title to get started on the saga, that remains the first also for continuity reasons, but if you love the Capcom series, take a seat, knowing that the impact of the novelty has now vanished. Pros There is all the goodness of the series As enthralling as few games Cons Maybe it's time to renew... Intricate and difficult right from the start Those of you who have played at least a few cases of one of the now four Ace Attorneys released on DS know how tangled the plots are; well, the story of this Trials and Tribulations is too, and we're not talking, in this case (but we'll get to it later) of the story in the game: released in 2004 in Japan on the GBA as the final episode of the Phoenix Wright trilogy, T&T has followed the two predecessors in the choice made by Capcom to convert them to DS and release them from Japan, but not in Europe. Here, in fact, after the first Phoenix and the sequel Justice for All, Apollo Justice was released a few months ago, which was a sort of sequel / spin off with the exact same game system. Trials and Tribulations is only now coming out, one year after the American release, which is therefore the third game in the series but the fourth to be published in the Old Continent. All while the new title is approaching, this time dedicated to prosecutors, which promises to revolutionize the entire formula. Didn't you understand anything?
