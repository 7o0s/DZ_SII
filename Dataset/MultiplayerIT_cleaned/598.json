{"name": "Drakengard 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/drakengard-3.html", "text": "Eragon Wannabe Drakengard 2 begins 18 years after the events that concluded the prequel, and this time our protagonist is certainly not the previous Caim, but a young knight named Nowe. Raised by a dragon named Legna, Nowe is part of the Knights of the Seal and protects the same world we saved from destruction in the first Drakengard; obviously, as in any self-respecting fantasy story, the already delicate balance is upset by the arrival of a girl: this meeting will undermine Nowe's certainties, making him rebel and fight his own fellow soldiers for the just cause. The battle of Nowe will obviously be joined by other characters, each equipped with their own peculiar abilities, and his own dragon Legna, a destructive means of transport and battle. As in the prequel, Drakengard 2 maintains a cold, dark and cynical narrative setting, where the characters are the furthest imaginable from the bold heroes who have populated the many made-in-Square RPGs: the ambiguous protagonists are the most interesting element of a rather trivial plot, which unlike its predecessor does not surprise, intriguing the player just enough to make him continue, without however surprising him with really interesting twists. All in all a shame, for the sequel to a game whose strengths were a powerful characterization and a complex and disturbing plot. Winning team...? Drakengard's problem has never been the game itself: its structure was in fact quite interesting, even if certainly not original, but the various defects here and there had undermined its general enjoyment. In Drakengard 2, Square Enix should have corrected the aforementioned playful holes, making the title a good product for lovers of the genre, but unfortunately this only happened to a small extent. The problems that tragically repeat themselves in Drakegard 2 are mainly two: the extreme linearity of the missions, and their repetitiveness. Drakengard 2 plays just like the prequel, controlling Nowe or one of his three companions (interchangeable through the choice of their main weapon) in the various environments that will be the stage for copious bloodshed. Here are already the two defects of a battle-system which, being the heart of the game, should be as accurate as possible: first, the fights are reduced to a lobotomizing repeated pressing of the same button; second, in which case you are in a hurry or tired of beating one enemy at a time, you can use magic to wipe out entire enemy platoons. The repeated practice of these two possibilities of action certainly does not make the very long missions exciting, but rather extremely tedious: not even the obligation to change characters to face certain enemies, against which a certain weapon is more harmful than another, it helps break up the monotony that each mission offers in the long run. A nice diversion is represented by Legna: in open areas Nowe can call his dragon, jump astride him and vomit fire everywhere to disintegrate dozens of enemies together; on paper, Legna is the smart-bomb that gets you out of trouble, but in practice the invulnerability to magical flames of some enemies and the limited possibilities of action offered by the dragon make Legna's support less sought after than it might seem. Unfortunately, Legna is still the protagonist in the most boring stages of Drakengard 2: the aerial battles that are so reminiscent of Panzer Dragoon, and which if in Drakengard were quite pleasant, in Drakengard 2 are almost a joke, often reducing themselves to the frantic pressing of the button connected to the homing-fireball or smart-bomb, when it is not possible to shoot straight from the starting point to the end of the stage, avoiding every opponent. ... but it doesn't really change? Drakengard 2 gives the impression of being a hastily created title also through the technical sector, which can only be defined as mediocre. The first problem encountered is the terrible automatic management of the camera, which tends to constantly position itself in the most unfortunate points, making the already chaotic battles virtually incomprehensible; this, combined with the significant drop in framerate that occurs in the most agitated phases, often risks causing inopportune ~Game Over~. The rough polygonal models criticized in the prequel make their return, an unfortunate stylistic choice to make the extremely dark fantasy world in which the game is set more alienating, as well as the woody and unnatural animations. The protagonists, on the other hand, are made much better, but still give the unpleasant impression that the development team has not worked hard enough, perhaps because they are victims of the enemies/environment combination thatleaves you really dumbfounded: the settings, especially outdoors, are in fact sparse, repetitive and poorly textured. A separate discussion could be made for the closed rooms, much more convincing and detailed, but the indoor missions are so few that their presence is almost irrelevant. Fortunately, the wonderful computer graphic sequences and the soundtrack deserve a separate discussion: although slightly repetitive as in the case of the prequel, the soundtrack of Drakengard 2 manages to accompany the player in the adventure without tiring him, thanks to the excellent composition. Excellent English voice acting, by the way. It's a real pity that a promising saga like Drakengard stumbles again into the same defects of the first episode, tolerated by virtue of original elements such as the plot or the aerial battles. Drakengard 2 disappoints, those who had enjoyed the prequel hoping for a decent sequel will end up with a slightly improved version of Drakengard from a playful point of view but a little less compelling from a narrative point of view. The technical sector suffers from terrible ups and downs, and it certainly doesn't help to discover, after the game, that you will have to complete the adventure two more times, starting it over again, to know the true ending of the story. In short, a strange fall in style on the part of Square, which seems to be starting to lose interest in this project, probably engaged on the multiplatform side of the new generation, or on much more important - and profitable - productions such as a certain twelfth final fantasy. Pros A decent hack'n'slash Interesting, if trivial plot Mix of fighting game and shooter Cons Repetitive, boring and frustrating Very showy technical problems Drakengard was one of Square Enix's few forays into the field of action-adventure and hack'n'slash, a dimension that seems to be increasingly difficult given the quality of its most recent products: the mediocre The Bouncer and Musashi Samurai Legend come in mind precisely to confirm this trend. Drag-on Dragoon, known in the West as Drakengard, dates back to about two years ago: in this bizarre adventure, Square concentrates all its love for the narrative element by giving the player an excellent story... but a mediocre play system. Drakengard's sequel had promised to remedy the numerous defects of the prequel, which wasn't really bad, first of all to repetitiveness: if this has occurred, you will find out in the next few lines.", "date": "2006-03-02", "grade": null}
