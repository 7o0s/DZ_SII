Although we cannot speak of a great game design work, Grumpy Cat: Un Gioco Orrendo is in truth a fun game, which already demonstrates a fair dose of self-irony and demented humor starting from the same title and succeeds in trying to bring a smile even in the brief samples of gameplay of which it is composed. If you have had to deal with WarioWare or similar titles, you will be able to get a rather precise idea of what awaits you: the Grumpy Cat game is in fact a collection of various mini-games very similar to the solutions proposed by Nintendo in those very short bursts game starring the anti-hero mariesco, only in this case everything is centered on the famous grumpy cat who adapts perfectly to all the crazy situations in which he is placed in this title. In case you don't know the series in question, the first impact can be rather disorienting but don't panic, after a few minutes and the inevitable sense of disorientation given by the need to understand in a few seconds what exactly you have to do, the immediacy of the games emerges without problems and allows any type of user, from the child to the mature and consummate gamer, to face the lightning-fast challenges of Grumpy Cat with a stupid smile printed on his face. Despite the declarations, it seems that Grumpy Cat's game isn't exactly a horrible game in the end The hard life of the grouchy cat Grumpy Cat: A Horrible Game puts the iconic peevish-faced cat at the center of a series of very short interlocking gameplay sequences, requiring the player to perform a large number of different actions in a matter of seconds. Difficult to make a complete list of the mini-games, which are really many and grow by winning the sequences and unlocking further games, but in general they tend to be absurd actions, ranging from invented extreme sports to typical cat actions but transporting you into rather crazy, with the player who essentially finds himself touching the screen, swiping or in any case extremely fast and possibly precise movements, to reach the required objective in a matter of seconds. The problem is that in the first round it is not easy to understand precisely what is necessary to do, but even this initial amazement is fully part of the atmosphere of the game and makes the approach to the phantom adventures of the grumpy cat even more exhilarating. The mini-games are split into three different worlds which provide vaguely different settings and themes to the gameplay sequences and provide a certain sense of progression going from the garden with the classic cat-like situations, to the Grumpywood forest with the rise in popularity of our pet who it emerges in much more particular actions up to the Sports Pack which sees the cat grappling with various somewhat out of the ordinary pastimes. Each world is composed of a base of about five characteristic mini-games that expand up to 15 for each single setting by completing the sequences and unlocking new characters and stickers for use with iMessage. Beyond the hilarity that arises from these situations in which the grumpy cat finds himself, it must be said that the various mini-games are also designed to be as fun as possible, although obviously the duration and extreme simplicity that characterizes them do not offer any real depth of play. The game can be downloaded for free as free-to-play and can be played completely without spending anything: the micro-transactions concern the purchase of coins to unlock extra content or the possibility of removing advertising, which is rather recommended considering the frequency with which this appears between one game and another.", "date": "2016-12-29", "grade": "8.0"}
