{"name": "Dogz 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dogz-3d.html", "text": "Obviously, for the creation of this Dogz 3D, the transalpine house took great inspiration from that Nintendogs for Nintendo DS which literally depopulated last year, becoming one of the best-selling titles for the highly successful portable console. However, something like this was missing on mobile phones, or rather all the previous clones had adopted two-dimensional graphics (like the first Dogz itself) necessarily limited in many respects. Gameloft, on the other hand, wanted to aim higher with this reissue, choosing to use a completely three-dimensional engine, and therefore much more faithful to the ~inspiring source~. And the result is in fact decidedly convincing, to the point of being taken into very serious consideration by lovers of the ~virtual puppies~ genre. Exactly like Nintendogs, which found its major defect in a marked repetitiveness, Dogz 3D too soon tends to revolve around the same actions repeated in a cyclical way: feed and drink our friend, take him out for a run, do play and take care of its cleanliness. Certainly the effort of the programmers in trying to offer something more than a simple and trivial 100% clone is evident; although there are only 3 races with as many different colors, there are 9 places to visit, starting from the house and related rooms around which everything revolves, to move on to the garden, the beach, the stadium, the vet and so on. There are 8 mini-games, such as frisbee, swimming, tug of war and so on. We were talking about the graphic component: as mentioned above, everything that appears on the screen was made in a polygonal version, both for the settings and for the puppies. Considering the potential of the terminals on which it runs, the result is undoubtedly excellent, full of details and quite defined; in particular it is on the puppies that the greatest work has been done, thus creating realistic reproductions both in appearance and in behaviour. The biggest limitations in this respect come from the fluidity, with a low and barely acceptable frame rate even considering the slow pace of play. Finally, the sound is acceptable, which accompanies pleasant passages with almost completely absent sound effects. PRO The best of its kind on mobile Curated in every respect Pleasant graphics AGAINST Soon repetitive Not original at all Either you love it or you hate it...", "date": "2007-06-11", "grade": "S.V."}
