{"name": "Alan Wake Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alan-wake-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "The birth of the Remedy Connected Universe has laid the foundations for the event that all the fans of the Finnish team have been waiting for for a long time, namely the return of Alan Wake with a sequel that can develop the narrative structure, the peculiar atmospheres in an even more convincing way and the very solid mechanics of the first episode. When such a proposal becomes reality, the first thing to do is to relaunch the franchise: eleven years is a long time and the youngest gamers may not even know who Alan Wake is, as well as the owners of PlayStation consoles may have never tried the original game, which began as an exclusive for Xbox 360 and then landed only on PC. So here we are grappling with the review of Alan Wake Remastered, the remastered edition of the Remedy Entertainment title, which aims to make the brand known to as many users as possible before the arrival of the second chapter. An operation that is discounted from a commercial point of view, as mentioned, but which can hide some pitfalls. Is this the case? Story: Welcome back to Bright Falls Alan Wake Remastered, the protagonist about to land in Bright Falls The story undoubtedly represents the most relevant and recognizable component of Alan Wake Remastered, as well as the reason why after eleven years many players still remember well the misadventures of the American writer, who arrives in the town of Bright Falls with his wife Alice to find the tranquility and above all creativity. After having scored a series of successes, it is in fact two years since Alan Wake has been unable to write anything. Will a period away from the chaos of New York, holed up with Alice in a cottage on Cauldron Lake serve to restore his inspiration? The man fails to find out, as he immediately finds himself involved in something disturbing and frightening. A dark force seems to have crept into Bright Falls: a power that moves in the dark, makes the shadows fluid and lethal, creates frightening illusions and takes possession of people, wrapping them in their black mantle. Alice is attacked by this entity and ends up in the lake, Alan dives to save her but wakes up mysteriously aboard a crashed car. Determined to find his wife, the writer discovers that there is no cottage on the lake. Has he perhaps gone mad? Were he and Alice the victims of an illusion? Certainly the black men who attack him at night as he searches for answers are all too real and threatening, and they seem to fear only one thing: the light. Structure Alan Wake Remastered, the protagonist in the company of his agent, Barry Divided into six episodes like a television miniseries, complete with a closing song for each of them and a recap at the beginning, the Alan Wake Remastered campaign also includes the two DLCs, The Signal and The Writer (but not the spin-off American Nightmare), guaranteeing a total duration that settles on fourteen hours, where you decide to proceed in a relatively expeditious way. The structure of the Remedy Entertainment title is in fact full of secrets and collectibles that we can only obtain by exploring the scenarios far and wide, without always taking the direction indicated by the radar to reach the objective of the moment and indeed taking a curious approach towards the settings, which will reward our efforts with a thermos of coffee or a page of the manuscript, but not only. Gameplay Alan Wake Remastered, a fight sequence On the gameplay side, Alan Wake Remastered boasts still current and solid mechanics, although rather essential. The interlude sequences introduce characters and situations, after which we find ourselves in command of the protagonist in a third-person action context, committed to running in the woods, valleys, urban views while enemies emerge from the darkness as more and more cunning and dangerous. As mentioned, the dark force that Alan Wake has to face fears only the light, and it is precisely on this concept that the shooter elements of the game are based. In fact, we will have at our disposal a torch with which to illuminate the opponents up to cleave the shadow barrier that surrounds them, possibly intensifying the energy beam at the cost of consuming the batteries more quickly. At that point we will be able to resort to conventional weapons to eliminate the enemies, shooting them with pistols, rifles or with the signal rocket launcher, which in a similar context is the most effective and spectacular tool. There is also no shortage of special devices such as flares and dazzling grenades, particularly useful during the most demanding battles. Alan Wake Remastered, the protagonist hits an enemy with the torch beam Alan can move quickly, but hisStamina is low and running out of breath will affect his ability to dodge. We will therefore have to dose the shots wisely, learn the right timing to discard sideways during the fights and make the most of the scenario to survive the most consistent waves, for example by turning on the field lights or taking refuge under the beam of a lamppost to recover energy and automatically save your progress. Although united by a design that makes them all quite similar, the enemies we will face in Alan Wake Remastered offer a fair variety in terms of attack patterns, resistance, special abilities and so on. Furthermore, at a certain point, the dark force will also manifest itself inside flying objects and vehicles, creating very spectacular situations and further enriching the list of threats from which to beware. In any case, we will not spend all the time of the campaign to explore and fight: the developers have inserted some alternative sections, which, albeit in a timid way, try to propose platform elements and small environmental puzzles. In certain cases we will finally be able to drive vehicles and take advantage of their headlights and weight to possibly mow down the Possessed along the way. Technical realization Alan Wake Remastered, the character faces two Possessed We come then to the central point, the technical implementation. If it is true that producing a remaster is the easiest way to relaunch a franchise, at the same time a mere increase in resolution and frame rate could highlight the inevitable limits of an eleven-year-old polygonal modeling, designed for a much lesser platform. powerful than the current ones. It is therefore fortunate that Remedy Entertainment has not limited itself to the minimum wage for Alan Wake Remastered, and indeed has done everything possible to adapt the original graphics to current standards, replacing a large number of assets and textures in order to offering a greater level of definition and substantially decreasing the bloom effect that was all the rage at the time. In-game, the results of these efforts are excellent: on next-generation consoles the game runs at 4K and 60 fps, which also makes the gameplay more precise during fights, and the scenarios really gain a lot from the remastering work. At the same time, however, the models have remained those of 2010 and therefore appear angular and awkwardly animated. Alan Wake Remastered, one of the cutscenes that move between ups and downs However, the biggest problems occur in the interlude sequences, which have been ~cleaned up~ and adapted to the new resolutions, but show an Alan Wake with a not exactly convincing face and suffer in some cases from very evident shots. We hope that these drawbacks can be fixed with the updates. On PS5 the DualSense controller has been exploited in a more than discreet way, with a good range of different feedback depending on the situation and the adaptive triggers that make pressing the trigger more tenacious, but not to the point of making it problematic as has happened in the past with other titles. A few words in closing also for the sound sector, which we found excellent: the music accompanies the various sequences very effectively, the choice of songs is excellent and the dubbing in Italian it holds its own even after all this time, above all thanks to the solid narration of Alessandro Zurla.", "date": "2021-10-04", "grade": "8.0"}
