It is a question that has always divided the lovers of the living dead and to which Techland would ideally respond with an ~everyone~. In Dying Light you not only find the slow and clumsy bags of meat so dear to those who continue to look with the right affection and due reverence at George Romero and the ferocious stormtroopers of The Return of the Living Dead, brought to the fore more recently by 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead, but also various other degeneration of the concept. However, this is by no means a new speech for the Polish developer, who had proposed a rather varied cast of undead ever since he tried his hand at the genre for the first time, with Dead Island. What is new is the answer that Techland would give to a second, hypothetical question: ~What can I do in the event of a zombie apocalypse?~, which would be followed by ~apart from driving, basically everything~. And then another one, no less important: ~but is the dark really scary?~ to which he would reply with a ~it was already scary in Dead Island, but now it's really scary. Really~. These are the concepts that allow the latest born in the Wroclaw-based studio to distance itself from its cousin, to which it was and still is superimposed, bringing out a personality that we had already encountered quite clearly in the preview phase , and which, once the game is finished, only confirms itself. Final judgment time for Dying Light, with our super in-depth review! Apocalypse on a human scale The protagonist of the events narrated in the game is Kyle Crane, an American special agent parachuted into Harran, an imaginary city which, due to its climatic, ethnic and architectural characteristics, seems to be located in the Middle East. The crazy spread of an epidemic that has decimated the local population, turning a large part of them into the living dead, has forced the state to erect enormous walls to prevent the infection from spreading to the rest of the world. The objective of Crane's mission is to recover a file containing an incomplete cure for the evil, the publication of which would only cause further victims. Threatening to do so is Kadir Suleiman, a local politician who took advantage of the crisis to rise to power, who to cover his back and use it as a bargaining chip with which to leverage other governments has placed it in the best safe possible, i.e. the heart of the quarantine zone, in the hands of one of his faithful collaborators. Not even on purpose, the latter managed to tame the chaos by setting up a ruthless paramilitary organization, which makes the good and the bad and the bad times, while the few other survivors struggle strenuously to stay alive. It seems quite clear which of the two sides the protagonist will join. While he will be forced to learn from scratch to get by, he will still try to take home (of his superiors) the result. This is the incipit of a story that does not have many original features, neither in the premises nor in the development, animated by supporting actors, villains, twists, ~surreal~ passages and dramas that anyone who has chewed a bit of genre cinema, or even just action movies, could easily predict. The point is that originality probably wasn't even a quality Techland was looking for when it was thinking about what to tell. Despite having enjoyed the story, despite a quiet start, Crane's moody attitude which in the final bars is almost unbearable and the evident forcing with which one necessarily wants to ferry it towards a certain type of epilogue, to really fascinate us, in Dying Light, it's a type of storytelling that serves the gaming experience, the result of a truly evident effort. The important thing is the journey, not the destination, it is said in certain cases, and it is a reflection that fits very well with this. In fact, the game outlines a universe and situations in which you can believe (not credible, mind you, if you are looking for verisimilitude or internal logical rigor you have got the wrong object to pay attention to), in which you feel involved and a participant. In fact, the zombie apocalypse lives on two faces, the rotten and distressing one of the dead cannibals and that of its impact on people, places, civil habits. Two faces portrayed in an extremely vivid and convincing way. Because you will also be able to find the villain of the situation, Rais, more or less charismatic, you will be able to feel more or less complicity with the beautiful Jade, you will be able to feel more or less affection for the young Rahim, but it is impossible not to be impressed, sooner or later , from the extreme care placed in the characterization of the army of characters and the large number of settings in which one can imbattere during the adventure. It happens to meet anyone, venturing to Harran: from altruists who try to combine something constructive moved by unbridled altruism, reasoning or impulsivity to every category of braggarts and egoists, from people who have managed to place themselves in harmony with the new reality, putting feet businesses, activities or other types of new interests to another that is still experiencing the full shock of the impact with it. A colorful humanity, outlined with a no less wide palette of tones and colours, which ranges from the by now inevitable over the top guys, with their quirks, more or less eccentric and funny, to people who put real sadness on themselves, like those who they come to deny reality with more down-to-earth psychological manifestations, such as those of those who are unable to mourn the loss of a loved one, pretending that it is still part of their life. In between anything, including a cloud of quotes, teasing and easter eggs, concerning both cinema and genre literature (Zombieland and a certain ~survival manual~, to name a couple), and other video games, both others (the Destiny's loot cavern, a sign teasing Left 4 Dead) and their own (Call of Juarez's Ray McHall action figure). There's no shortage of children either, which Techland doesn't mind bringing in, again with different nuances, who see them now as defenseless victims, now as creatures in need of the most precious thing that can be offered (that is, a little our time and our attention) now another incarnation of the evil against which we must fight, now the object of the love of those who want to make them believe that the nightmare they are experiencing is all a game, like Benigni in La Vita is Pretty. A discourse that is particularly successful when supporting it is the mission design which, as we will see below also with regard to other aspects, proves to be fitting. Often, accepting a job concerning one of these subjects means getting to know him more deeply, discovering his tastes, ties, habits or secrets, in short, having the possibility of giving a direct look at his life. And the same goes for places. Harran tells the zombie apocalypse very well speaking to us in a silent but not inexpressive way of the wounds and upheavals it caused through the disorder of cars on the streets, the fortification of a bar, the further state of degradation of the shantytowns, the reconversion of a museum, the corpses piled up on the landing of a popular block of flats or the rushing abandonment of what should have been breakfast on any day, for any family, in any apartment. Lived up to expectations Techland had promised a survival open with a strong parkour component and an important day / night duality. After playing it far and wide, we can say that Dying Light keeps them faithful, almost always embodying them in the best way. First of all, the movement system: to have a better chance of survival among the dangers of enemy numerical superiority or to be able to reach him quickly anywhere, Kyle can use his marked agility and travel the territory of Harran as he sees fit. Already in the preview phase we had remarked how the inspiration for Mirror's Edge was not only clear, but had substantially some calligraphy. In fact, the game starts from those basics, adopting a control system and a set of movements that fully reflect the DICE title (crouch jump and wall run aside, respectively absent and less ~marked~): launching at speed, climbing, climbing over, leaning against an obstacle to keep going, sliding under a barrier or rolling to cushion a landing are things we've done before as Faith and here they become an ABC without which it doesn't last long. To these must be added some additions, which further expand the alphabet of walking possibilities, making it even more versatile, complete and fitting for the specific context. The first is the switch of the key to turn instantly from a tool to chain stunts to an asset that allows you to rotate your head and keep an eye out for pursuers who can keep up with you. Just like in Outlast, only with the clever addition of a slow down, thanks to which you can try to better decipher what is actually happening in a scenario of considerably greater complexity and possibly fire UV flashlight shots or thrown weapons at those who are breathing in it on the neck. Things, then, at a certain point (coinciding with the achievement of Level 12 in the Survival Skills branch) receive a further surge, and in terms of the speed of the crossings, and in those ofverticality of the practicable spaces, and in fact defensive strategies, thanks to the introduction of a grappling hook with which to reach any architectural element within a radius of about forty meters in a matter of seconds. All of this, as already remarked, works wonderfully and above all is a source of a level of gratification equal to one's desire to explore a top-of-the-class system: despite the open nature, the generous dimensions and the organic and plausible conformation of the areas in which Harran is divided (Slums and Old Town, plus some ~outbuildings~), also characterized by a certain continuity between exteriors and interiors, Techland has carefully arranged most of the elements of the scenario to be ~runner-friendly~. Roofs, railings, balconies, vans, scaffolding, electric cables, curtains, barricades, garbage bags and so on are carefully arranged within a level design that has something amazing and allows you to improvise a number tending to infinite trajectories of exploration and escape, the limits of which are written in black and white by clearly evident architectural barriers, without invisible walls or other tricks. And the picture becomes even more amazing if you think that the vastness of the environments has not been taken as an alibi to escape the implementation of basic physics and a level of cleaning and calibration of collisions with substantially every type of viable surface that ensures altogether a strong underlying coherence. To put it simply with the examples: depending on the momentum and the direction with which it is approached, a wall can be directly jumped, overcome by leaning on it with the little hand, used as a basis for an ~intermediate~ heavy tax or crossed only after a climb more or less fast. With practice it is therefore possible to instantly evaluate the next step, prepare any adjustments in approaching it or examine alternatives, in what is essentially a game within a game in which the margins for refining and discovering new little things are quite large, and therefore one does not tend to get bored too soon. The last addition of some weight is the resistance of the protagonist. Unlike Faith, who in capable hands can achieve virtually infinite momentum, Crane needs to catch his breath after a while. An important feature for a title that wants to give itself a survival imprint, placing a vulnerable character in control. A limit that can only be exceeded upon reaching Level 24 of Agility, probably towards the end of the adventure, either because of the density of the dangers, or because Kyle has grown up in other aspects in the meantime, or because he's been toiling for hours back and forth, removing the handbrake feels like a welcome, adequate change of pace. And the mission design is once again pleasing, as Techland has designed various missions to exploit this humus, proposing passages in which one must reach an area in a timely manner, escape from a collapsing building, hunt down a particularly fast creature or slip away from a sudden assault with a MG, which can not be answered in the least. An attitude that is also recognized in the face of the multitude of occasions in which real ~environmental puzzles~ are proposed, which tickle motor analysis and coordination to reach an objective, usually located inside a building or an area with limited access, or find the exit of a large room, in more linear situations proposed during an assignment or in connecting passages between areas. Promoted in physics The fact that Crane is particularly good at deflecting problems does not mean that he is totally incapable of dealing with them, on the contrary. As in Dead Island, in the game you can wield a long list of tools and melee weapons: hammers, swords, daggers, batons, machetes, crowbars, wrenches and scythes are just some of the tools with which to pass the zombies the desire to have a snack. And as in Dead Island each of them has a durability that makes them subject to wear, until they become unusable, opening up the need to repair them or find something else. And again, as in the cousin, there is also a crafting system that allows you to strengthen a weapon and above all modify it, adding tasty more or less pronounced secondary effects based on fire, electricity, impact force, laceration and contamination. By getting hold of the related Projects and the required ingredients, with exploration or trade, you can really indulge yourself by developing tools such as the Toxic Pen, a truncheon that poisons enemies, or the Constable, which makes it able to give electroshock to p", "date": "2015-01-30", "grade": "8.6"}
