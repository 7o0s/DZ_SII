{"name": "Crackdown - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crackdown-recensione.html", "text": "Password: freedom of movement David Jones confirms that the genre of games that offer great exploratory freedom are the ones most congenial to him. Crackdown is, in essence, Pacific City, an extremely large and varied futuristic city, which ranges across three large islands around an artificial peninsula on which our ~police station~ is built. Every single square centimeter of the map is obviously explorable: there are no unreachable points, all the ground that we can see with our eyes, we can also walk on. The game structure of Crackdown is as simple as it is fun in its implementation, it is mostly about killing enemies and recovering as many power-up spheres as we can find around. The latter is divided into three zones of influence, under which gangs of criminals have good and bad times. everything we can see with our eyes, we can also trample if we want Password: freedom of movement There are the South Americans of Los Muertos, the Russians of the Volk and the Chinese of Shai-Gen. Each has conquered an island of the city and keeps neighborhoods and population in check. The police exist and do what they can, but are obviously crushed by the power and numerical superiority of the mafia. For this reason, the law enforcement corporation has created a mutant super agent, us, with the task of fighting crime just as seen in the film Robocop. However, it is not a robot but a real humanoid agent genetically modified and cloned in large quantities (and this justifies the fact of dying and returning to the game every time). Initially we will be quite weak and inexperienced, but by practicing on the roads it will take very little to strengthen us and become real cyber-policemen. Our protagonist has five qualities: strength, agility, driving, fire and explosives, each of which increases in rank simply by performing certain actions. There are 21 Bosses to deal with, each with its own little story and function within the criminal organization to which it belongs, and are commanded by 3 big bosses. It is hypothetically possible to attack them without any pre-established order, but initially it is advisable to face Los Muertos, and then dedicate yourself to the Chinese and the Russians only after having properly strengthened our physical characteristics. As we continue in the story, we will receive ~reports~ live from the central which will give us more information on who still needs to be faced: messing up this order can mean playing with a disproportionate difficulty compared to our abilities. Crackdown and platforming sessions Recovering the 500 agility spheres scattered around Pacific City is not child's play, they must be conquered one by one. Initially we will be able to make small jumps and run relatively slowly. In order to increase our physical characteristics we need to do a lot of practice, managing to reach the green spheres of agility usually placed in very high and difficult to reach points. At this point Crackdown becomes a game halfway between Spiderman and Mario Sunshine. Like the first because we will find ourselves jumping from one building to another through roofs, balconies, railings, skyscrapers and houses, with a breathtaking panorama constantly under our feet. Like the second one, because a particular skill with the analog stick is often required not to fall off or to walk through narrow spaces at high altitudes. The camera is free just like in the Super Mario appreciated on GameCube, and allows you to rotate and position the view in order to always have an optimal shot. Crackdown becomes a game halfway between Spiderman and Mario Sunshine The latter works very well and never hesitates or hesitates, not even in the most difficult moments or in the most unthinkable points: when it approaches the character, he disappears to make room for a subjective view that allows us to see in any case. Collecting the small green spheres gives great satisfaction but above all it is difficult to stop looking for them: once you reach the end of a building to take one, many others will become visible and the desire to get there will be irrepressible. Many spheres can only be reached after finding the right path, because it is not always possible to jump somewhere or climb. However, the green ones are not the only spheres to be found around the city, there are other blue ones, as many as 300, which are more difficult to find. These are not necessarily placed at the top, but in ~secret~ points that are difficult to find, and are indicated only by a faint noise that we will hear once we are close to aof them. Once taken, one of these energy globules increases all our skills in one fell swoop, and finding them all unlocks an important achievement for gamerscore. Strengthen your skills There are other means to enhance the other three characteristics of our policeman. For bombs, just use them against our enemies and blow them up. However, blow up the vehicles by many more points, and we will be called to perform bangs worthy of the best Hollywood choreographer, fully supported by the stupendous havok physics. For each skill you can reach a maximum of four stars, once upgraded, the explosive radius of our mines will widen dangerously (for the opponents, of course). Using weapons instead these will become more and more lethal, and more and more distant. As far as driving is concerned, the matter is slightly more complex because driving in a simple way will not boost anything, on the contrary by performing reckless maneuvers and stunts the driving score will slowly increase. However, doing somersaults with the car, big jumps and loops of the loop is not as immediate as throwing grenades and shooting. The last skill is physical strength, which is increased by lifting objects and using them against enemies, or more easily by beating anyone in front of you with your bare hands. At the fourth star obtained we will go around Pacific City to kill mobsters by slapping them one by one. Guns, cars and beautiful women Around the city there are police recovery points, initially in enemy hands, which we will have to reach and conquer. Once we arrive on site, the station will unlock and in case of death we will be able to continue the game from one of these to our liking. Whenever we find ourselves in possession of a new weapon, we will have to take care of trying to bring it back to one of these agency offices as in doing so it will be available whenever we want it. However, the paraphernalia is not that vast, the classic pistol, machine gun, Russian Kalashnikov, bazooka, sniper rifle and little else. Some of these weapons are relatively rare and it will be better to save them to be able to use them, otherwise the risk will be to continue in the game with machine guns and grenades. On the ~driving~ front, the variety is certainly better, there are a large number of vehicles of different tonnage and driveability. the risk that Crackdown turns into a modern Carmageddon is very high They range from small utility cars to the family station wagon, from military tanks to trucks, passing through police supercars (which with 4 stars are enhanced and can also fire) up to large means of transport for nuclear warheads, easily identifiable in Russian territory. Each of these vehicles drives differently but the important thing is that the handling is very satisfying and ~physical~: the sensation is not that of skating on the road, but we will feel the different ~heaviness~ if we drive a small car or an SUV boosted. In the streets of Pacific City there are numerous timed races to face, performing them all will earn us an unlocked achievement, as well as doing all the stunt races across the roofs of houses. By killing innocents, after a while the police will start chasing us to eliminate us: the car races will be particularly difficult as the streets are always full of people walking around, and the risk that Crackdown will turn into a modern Carmageddon is very high . The physics of Crackdown Thanks to physics, the driving sessions are very lively and offer moments of pure pleasure and fun. Every object, person or explosion on the street affects the vehicle, it ~feels~ and causes a reaction. Cars get dented, go up in smoke, then up in flames and explode if abused. Most of the objects can be picked up and thrown and have very, very convincing and solid physics. For example, from the top of a building it is possible to grab a basket of pipes and pull it down the street. Once landed, these will break into many parts that will cover the road surface, on which an unsuspecting driver driving his sports car was about to pass just at that moment. When the wheel treads on a tube, the car will swerve and collide with a parked car: the violent impact will cause a series of rear-end collisions, people will get out of the car and start ranting and protesting. It is precisely the variety of these situations that makes Pacific City seem like an extremely lively city, unlike the old sandbox games. On the streets there are hundreds of people, dozens and dozens of cars, every object, person or vehicle with its own physics and behavior: the combinations and possibilities are presentso that unlimited and not infrequently, instead of playing and following the story, we'll take to the streets to do experiments to see and observe people's reactions, always extremely realistic and convincing. Artificial Intelligence and Xbox Live The artificial intelligence of the enemies, on the other hand, is not all that cunning and realistic. Opponents usually face us face to face and start shooting in bursts, regardless of our shots. Even the bosses are not particularly difficult to take down once reached, indeed, it is always a character with a multiple energy bar (usually four) and a more powerful weapon than normal. Where is the difficulty then? Well, in Crackdown the developers have certainly focused on the quantity over the quality of the opponents. Each boss to be faced is in fact enclosed inside a building well protected by hundreds of henchmen at every corner. It's not as difficult to kill him as it is to get there unharmed. Once penetrated into enemy territory, the bad guys will throw themselves at us in large numbers, and at this point some planning of the action and the best route to take will be necessary. Our character has a shield just like Master Chief's in Halo, once you've fallen down you have to take shelter somewhere Our character has a shield just like Master Chief's in Halo, once you've fallen down you have to take shelter somewhere to be able to make it active again. In cases of extreme difficulty, the ~cooperative~ option becomes almost necessary. Through Xbox Live it is possible to invite a friend of ours to give us a hand, making him enter our world. His position will always be indicated on the map by a yellow cursor, and his upgrades will remain saved for his game. Unfortunately the bosses that will be killed together will only be unlocked for the host and not for both, and this can be a small disincentive for the host. However, the fun is so high that an invitation to Crackdown will hardly be ignored. Graphics, sound and style The glance that Crackdown offers is simply beautiful and satisfying. The style used is that of cel shading, not too markedly, however, but with a small pass of black on the edges that gives it a very personal look. On objects and the city this will be very little noticeable, while on people it will be immediately distinguishable. However, what is striking about Crackdown is the polygon count and the visual horizon, both truly disarming. The city is artfully made and is full of tunnels, narrow streets, alleys, gardens, shopping centers, highways. Every single piece is well cared for and always contains a large number of objects and excellent textures. Once you arrive at the end of a building it will be possible to see the vast horizon: the sky and the climatic conditions change constantly between night, dawn, day and sunset, always offering breathtaking views. In these cases the use of a high definition television is highly recommended. Not only to fully enjoy the beauty of Pacific City, but also to be able to see in every corner some small blue or green spheres hidden who knows where, much more difficult to notice through a cathode ray tube screen. The real negative note is that there are no interiors, apart from the meager police base, and that the whole game is set on the streets of a city in which it will never be possible to visit any of the thousands of buildings. From an audio point of view, the game unfortunately does not excel in the variety of song selection. The style is acid-pop, electronic and hardrock, with some good songs but in general too few to make the Crackdown soundtrack memorable. The effects are good even if numerically not many. Cars make two sounds: tire scuffing and gas. Then there's the noise of weapons, that of objects falling to the ground and what is produced when we land after a jump. Little else. Surely a lot could have been done to make the ~sound~ of the game more immersive and profound. Comment If it is true that good morning starts in the morning, well, this Realtime Worlds will certainly have something important to say in the future of videogame entertainment. We are faced with their first creation which is an absolutely fun game and, as the English say, addictive, one of those from which you can hardly break away. As the first product of a nascent software house we are faced with a well-crafted, fun and innovative title in terms of how it offers all its elements, despite a structure that could be repetitive in the long run. Xbox Live and co-op give it quite a b", "date": "2007-03-01", "grade": null}
