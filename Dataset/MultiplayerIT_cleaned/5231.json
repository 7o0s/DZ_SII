A work that in its time saw the convergence of all the ideas that the brilliant Japanese artist has given birth to and refined over the years, and which have not only concerned aspects related to innovative gameplay for the series, but every juncture of the game, where the he imprint of the talented Japanese designer was felt through quotations, costumes, phrases and visual elements, which confirmed his great cinematographic and literary culture, among other things. Today, thanks to Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience, fans can enjoy the complete work in a special edition that includes Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and Metal Gear Online, component online multiplayer of which you can read the details at this address, plus a selection of DLC released in the past for each of the games, and 15 of currency for the Mother Base. All for 39.90 on consoles and 29.99 on Steam for PC. Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience is the definitive edition of Hideo Kojima's game Mission Impossible The collection opens with Ground Zeroes, set in 1975, which sees Big Boss attempting to infiltrate a US naval base near Cuba, within which the area hosts a prison facility, Camp Omega, which according to information held by the intelligence of his group, the Militaires Sans Frontires, operates outside the controls of international law. There are held captive Paz, the spy we saw in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Chico who in an attempt to save the girl he is in love with, was himself captured. And it is precisely to free both of them and prevent them from revealing valuable information about his organization, as well as to steal Paz's knowledge of Cipher, that Big Boss decides to embark on a solo mission. The short adventure - just over an hour - consists of a ~campaign~ set inside the prison camp, at night and in the pouring rain, with a series of optional objectives to be achieved and other side elements related to the achievement of trophies or the collection of particular objects, plus some extra missions that are unlocked. In any case, what was released as a stand-alone product at the time turned out to be fun and well structured, and could be a way for newbies like any other to practice, learn the new game mechanics (which we will talk about later ahead) and prepare for the main adventure of The Phantom Pain. Set nine years after Ground Zeroes, the title tells of the destruction of the old Mother Base, the creation of the mercenary organization called Diamond Dogs by Miller, Ocelot and Venom Snake, which has its operational headquarters in the Seychelles sea, and the need for the protagonist to leave for Afghanistan - substantial initial setting, but not the only one - for an urgent mission from which an engaging and fascinating story will then kick off, net of a few moments of tiredness. A story that is given in small doses, and which often gets confused in the sea of connection activities seasoned with missions often in photocopy, but also told with the usual skill by Hideo Kojima and his staff, with cinematic direction and shot cuts which enhance the most dramatic phases or twists and turns, with such a visual power as to inevitably strike the player, not leaving him indifferent to the events he finds himself experiencing on the screen. From a playability point of view The Phantom Pain is in some ways a bigger, more complete and ~massive~ version of Ground Zeroes: the game world is open, large and with more things to do. Here, too, the gamer is free to decide what to do, whether to tackle the main objective immediately, or to spend time wandering around the map looking for useful or secret objects, or to weaken the enemy lines of communication and thus prevent them from request ground or air support from their allies in case Snake is discovered. Free roaming infiltration If you wish, you can also return to the base, which at certain times, among other things, is mandatory for narrative needs: communication and interaction between Snake and the Mother Base takes place via iDroid, a sort of hyper-technological computer through which missions are accessed , requesting equipment in the field or upgrading the base itself. Among other things, the Mother Base is expandable over time thanks to a series of fully explorable platforms - full of goodies and mini-activities of various kinds - and departments foessential to access new weapons, gadgets and customizations. In any case, returning to the real adventure, the sandbox nature of the gameplay and the possibility of tackling the missions with a certain freedom do not mean the total abandonment of the old mechanics of the series, nor be an incentive to carry out carnage. but simply to make available to the player a greater number of possibilities to elude the surveillance of the enemies or to get to the bottom of every situation. Snake is a responsive soldier, trained for any type of battle, though he works best when operating in the shadows. In these cases he is able to run crouched, to crawl on the ground quickly, to cling to ledges and to hide behind cover, to disarm or kill a sentry in an instant using extremely dynamic Close Quarter Combat, to leave no trace behind himself and to drive vehicles. He can also count on a respectable paraphernalia, which can prove useful especially if Big Boss is discovered and the only option left is to put his hand to arms. In these situations, the action instead takes place according to the trappings of the main third-person shooters, with the enemies who almost always perform particularly effective guerilla actions. For this reason it is better to avoid being discovered and to reason, planning every move. The general approach is therefore free, but gameplay tends to reward strategy, the ability to act in the shadows rather than the assault with a white weapon which would more easily lead to premature death, encouraging the user to take full advantage of better the stealth elements of the game. Hidden in the shadows, holding their breath, as the soldiers scour the area in search of that intruder who killed their fellow soldier, the feeling of being in a real war zone is rendered convincingly. Also thanks to the discrete behavioral routines of the enemies, who sometimes sin in the lack of reaction to certain noises or in the fact that they quickly lose interest in controlling a certain area, perhaps due to a choice desired by Kojima to offer the player a hybrid approach, half between realism and fun, abandoning any desire for complete simulation. But also a respectable technical and artistic system thanks here too to the hand of Hideo Kojima and the wise use of the Fox Engine. Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience is not a remake, and therefore offers the same technical sector as the original, with a 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second, an excellent level design enhanced by an effective lighting system and day cycle /night, a good cleaning of the image and well-characterized characters both from the point of view of polygonal modeling and aesthetics. Of course, now as then, the quality of some textures that leave something to be desired does not go unnoticed, but as in the original, these do not affect the general quality of the image that much, overall. As for the audio part, the dubbing in English (with Italian subtitles) is excellent, and the soundtrack, which offers a large number of songs from the 70s and 80s or unreleased ones.", "date": "2016-10-15", "grade": "8.8"}
