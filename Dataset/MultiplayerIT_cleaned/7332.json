First you need to verify the goodness of the simulation. Yes, because we're talking about a mechanic simulator, not a first person shooter where you have to save the world. So we decided to inform ourselves properly and develop a superior knowledge of the subject, so as to be able to give a hard time to Sor Franco... or the writer's mechanic. Fortunately Umberto, as a good PC area manager, voluntarily lent us his car to do some experiments. After disassembling it, reassembling it, disassembling it again and after having sold the parts in good condition to a complacent junkyard, we are finally back to the game, ready to let good win over evil and teach wear and those damned valves a lesson. Seriously, let's establish a rule: if you don't care about the subject, forget it immediately. We will never tire of repeating that all self-respecting simulations are dedicated to a very specific audience and everyone doesn't need to like them to be considered successful or, simply, valid. In this Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is no exception. Let's also clarify a second point, going more into the merits of the game: since there are no other titles of the genre on the market with which to compare it, it becomes automatic to recommend the purchase to anyone interested in the subject (easy to choose when there is no choice). Let's get our hands dirty in a virtual workshop with Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 Never let yourself be scared Often around niche products such as Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 people gather who are very willing to help others better understand the game mechanics. This is probably due to the desire to allow everyone to enjoy the same fun they enjoy, dispelling the myth of too much complexity that would make certain products hermetic. The same is happening with Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, which boasts a very active community in which the developers themselves often intervene and where there is no shortage of really useful guides and advice. Are you sure it wasn't supposed to take off? The concept behind Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is incredibly simple: in the role of a mechanic, the player has to repair customers' cars. Each car is linked to an order with requests to be fulfilled. This is where the simulation begins, because sometimes the requests will be very specific and well detailed, while in other cases you will find yourself in front of people who know absolutely nothing about mechanics and will only be able to give you general information on car problems. As in reality, in short. In any case, the objective is to repair the car by replacing the worn parts with others that can be purchased online (don't worry, there are no micro-transactions), or to repair them in the appropriate area of the workshop. In total there are seventy-five orders to fulfill, but more are coming soon, as promised by the developers. A non-secondary aspect is the economic micro-management of the whole. Each job will earn you a certain sum, but the client will not pay for your mistakes. Consequently it is important to always know that you are buying the right spare parts, i.e. those that are really necessary. In the case of happy or wrong purchases, you easily end up spending more than you earn, with catastrophic results for the workshop. Fortunately, at our disposal there are some excellent tools to check the status of the various parts, so as not to proceed blindly. For those who were wondering, the game is displayed completely in first person, in order to give a greater sense of involvement in what you are doing. So you physically move around the workshop by accessing the computer and going around the car to act where needed. When you move on to the action, the shot descends into the detail of the selected car area and you can select whether you want to disassemble or reassemble the pieces (one mode excludes the other). This is certainly the most accurate phase of Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, because repairing means going to work on the individual components. For example, one of the first objectives requires you to repair some front brakes, which means disassembling the wheel by removing the bolts one by one (with a nice virtual screwdriver), disassembling the brakes, checking the condition of the pads, seeing if the other parts are too worn, fit the new parts and then refit the whole wheel. Until action has been taken to fully repair a mechanical failure, a generic objective will not be considered concluded. Test shots The management of the mechanical parts is very important. Each of them has its own state of wear ranging from blue (new) to redo (worn), going from green (good condition). To help in recognizing the state of wear, there are also percentages that make it very clear where to act. For example, a wheel at 75% can be maintained, while one at 5% must certainly be changed. Before doing anything, the important thing is to take the right time to evaluate the case. As already mentioned, some parts can be repaired rather than purchased. Obviously not all, but this also applies in reality. To help the player some tests have been simulated which are used to determine the state of the car: the OBD test (On-Board Diagnostics) is used to know the conditions of the engine; the Test Drive to understand the state of the wheels, transmission and steering (here you drive the car directly); finally the Path Diagnostic test, which is activated when a second garage is obtained, is an advanced check of brakes and suspensions. Testing does not reveal the condition of all parts of the car. Some parts must necessarily be inspected manually, such as the air, oil and petrol filters, or the engine drive belt. As you can easily understand, specific objectives require less thorough inspections, while generic ones require more work to find the nature of the problem reported by the customer. However, since there is no time limit, there is never the hassle of hurrying to finish a job. In this sense Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is really relaxing. At the end of the missions, you can switch to infinite mode, where you take apart cars and find problems for the sake of it. It remains to be noted that the mechanics of each car have been reproduced with excellent fidelity and that, therefore, each of them offers a different ~scenario~.", "date": "2014-02-07", "grade": "8.0"}
