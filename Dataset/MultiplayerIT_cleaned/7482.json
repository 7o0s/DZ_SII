The peak was reached with the cinematographic productions of the early 90s, after which the popularity of turtles dropped quite a bit, especially outside the USA; at least until the recent relaunch, which led among other things to the production of a new animated series for the Nickelodeon network. It is precisely from the renewed style of the cartoon that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles starts, a scrolling fighting game for Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo 3DS that arises right from the start as the poor brother of the recent Coming out of the Shadows, which also had not impressed . Alternating at the commands of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo, our mission is clearly to put a spanner in the works of the evil Shredder, who seems to have planned some dangerous attacks in various areas of New York together with his mutant henchmen. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is undoubtedly one of the worst games of the year, really unpresentable Hitting is hitting, but... The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles campaign consists of sixteen relatively short levels, which are completed within three or four hours, and is supported by a series of small extra modes that must be unlocked by collecting certain objects during the adventure. On the screen the ninja turtles do not take turns, but are all together and put a (nice) spanner in the works, given that the developers have seen fit (indeed, bad) to break one of the few taboos belonging to the genre of scrolling fighting game, or rather making the characters of the team able to touch each other and therefore to get in the way during the most agitated phases of the action. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg which involves, indeed overwhelms the collision detection system in its entirety, which is immediately truly problematic: beyond the number of blows we land using one of the four turtles (you can go from to each other by using the directional cross), the enemies often and willingly are not touched for one reason or another, perhaps because the supplied weapon has a too short range or there is some object that it gets stuck between us and the target. But they are optimistic assessments: in most cases the attack fails and amen. To this major limitation is added a second, equally serious: the lack of any sensation of impact during the fights. We can say all the bad things we want about Coming Out of the Shadows, however the previous action game dedicated to the TMNTs by Activision certainly didn't skimp on this point of view and provided us with credible beatings, underlined by a nice choreography for the combos and short bullets time that further enhanced them. All stuff that the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles completely lacks, which for a scrolling fighting game is like saying you've made a platformer without giving the protagonist the ability to jump. Xbox 360 goals The thirty-six Objectives present in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are obtained simply by beating the six main bosses of the game, maximizing all the characters, destroying the objects present in the stages and dedicating some time to the side modes, in particular the Time Attack . A whole program The technical sector of the game developed by Magic Pockets, a team that already authored the terrible Battleship for Nintendo platforms, is obviously based on the Wii version and arrives on Xbox 360 simply adapted to the new resolution. The polygonal models of the characters in cel shading aren't horrible, but their animations certainly are, and when the ninja turtles start running all together, moved moreover by an artificial intelligence of almost no value, the thing appears very clear. The action takes place in scenarios that are also dull, devoid of detail and personality, with some interactive crates or bins to collect bonuses or let your opponents end up inside. The Italian dubbing stands out for the value of the actors involved, but the lack of a direction worthy of the name is soon realized, and in fact many sentences are pronounced without the slightest idea of the context. In short, the performers found themselves with a script in hand and without the slightest idea of what was happening on the screen, as unfortunately often happens in videogame localization work in Italy. Unfortunately the rumors are the only positive aspect ofa sound accompaniment that in effects is particularly ugly and almost completely absent in the music.", "date": "2013-11-15", "grade": "4.0"}
