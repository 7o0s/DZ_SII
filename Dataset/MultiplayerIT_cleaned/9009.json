{"name": "The Sims 3: Animali & Co.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94547-the-sims-3-animali-co-vita-da-cani-e-gatti.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 Started as a daring experiment born from the brilliant mind of Will Wright, The Sims has lost the conceptually innovative thrust of the first chapter, replacing it with another type of innovation, the one more strictly linked to the forms of the gaming market and business. The series has then become a sort of galaxy in its own right of videogame offerings characterized by varied experiences, for all tastes. On the other hand, it could also be a genuine need for simulation: real life is made up of innumerable facets and the pretension of reproducing it in a video game must necessarily take into consideration so many different aspects as to make it impossible to translate them into a single product. Let's say so. The fact is that for years the main chapters of The Sims, which seems strange but basically there are only 3, have been joined by a plethora of expansions and spin-offs that have expanded the commercial universe up to an impressive amount of titles. They range from the simple addition of furniture to simulations focused on various aspects of life (work, family, travel and so on) and among these one that has been particularly successful is precisely the one dedicated to animals. This The Sims 3: Animals & Co. therefore does not come as a surprise, given that a similar paragraph with ~Pets~ had already been released for the previous chapter, of which this is a natural evolution, in line with the progress made from the basic system with The Sims 3. It comes with a dual nature: on PC, where the series has its roots and is based on a now firmly formed community, it is a classic expansion to add to the third chapter but on consoles, like the version we are evaluating here, it is a stand-alone title, that is playable regardless of the original but also endowed with a sustained price, mysteriously neutered by a large part present instead in the Windows counterpart. While the latter in fact proposes the irruption of dogs, cats and horses as a new fundamental element in the life of the Sims, on consoles we are only dealing with dogs and cats. Like dog and cat Dogs and cats are not simple furnishing elements but real co-protagonists in the game. In fact, every animal included in the ~family~ is considered a Sims, controllable at will and equipped with their own needs and aspirations, with specific characteristics in terms of body and character and even the possibility of pursuing careers. The basic structure is that of The Sims 3, therefore the starting point is the same editor of the third chapter as regards the human characters, adapted ad hoc for the additional creation of cats and dogs, modifiable starting from pre-established or creatable breeds at will by playing with genetics, mixing characteristics to form new breeds. Given the typical slightly caricatured style of the Sims, the representation of animals achieves mixed results, between well-made and nice-looking breeds and others rather unrelated to real subjects or in any case a bit rough in modeling. In any case, once you've created your pet, especially in the puppy version, it's a pleasure to see it come alive and lead your virtual existence within the world of the Sims. Dogs and cats can be controlled as autonomous entities, but especially in the early stages of the game, the bond with the owners is essential, as regards the management of primary needs, with the animals becoming real members of the extended family, connected to this from more or less strong bonds of affection, depending on the relationship we manage to establish between human Sims and their pets. As befits the classic structure of the game, social relationships and interaction with other characters are fundamental elements in the experience, therefore animals too can weave more or less strong bonds of knowledge, friendship or enmity both with other animals of different species than with other humans. Feline dreams and canine aspirations The objective mechanics that characterize The Sims 3 also persists in this spin-off, enriched by the addition of ~mysteries~, which, like real missions to be completed, add further depth to the unfolding of the virtual life of the Sims, all together to the already established ~karma~ system which adds special powers based on the player's behavior. In essence, we do not find ourselves simply satisfying the primary needs of human and animal characters, but also advancing their lives by gradually completing micro and macro-goals of life, trying to route each character on the best possible path based on to his specific characteristics and personal aspirations, well outlined within his profilo, whether chosen by the player through the editor or applied randomly by the game itself. This is true for dogs and cats as much as for humans, with the possibility of specializing the animals in real social profiles: dogs, for example, can make a career in the police and help maintain order, for example, while cats can put up a considerable ~traffic~ of mischief or dedicate themselves to ~otherworldly~ cases with their ability to establish contact with ghosts, strangely present in large numbers in the world of Animals & Co.. However, there is not a large variety of possible destinies and specializations for animals, these being essentially the possible outlets for the only two species present, with the exception of the substantial section dedicated to horses present in the PC version. Alternative experiences, strongly guided but able to open the game to situations quite different from the normal routine, are the ~mysteries~, or missions assigned by the town hall in which we find ourselves discovering treasures, learning about the history of the city, visiting places that are difficult to reach or get in touch with various characters by exploiting the specific abilities of dogs and cats, more structured quests that represent adventurous and exotic digressions from the normal passing of the Sims' days. Xbox 360 goals 50 goals for 1000 points, as per tradition. Achievements aren't very easy to unlock because they usually take time to mature the required characteristics and results, so collecting them isn't easy. Furthermore, given the theme, we note the preponderance of objectives related to the life and management of animals. Pedigree question Despite the proposition of the product as a stand-alone game, the essence of pure expansion of The Sims 3: Animals & Co. is evident in the aesthetic aspect, which in fact does not show substantial differences compared to the third ~regular~ chapter. A few updates in terms of textures and editor options that allow for greater character modulation, a greater variety in the settings and little else, for the rest it is clear that this game is essentially a fragment of the universe set up by The Sims 3. It is certainly not a negative aspect given the good levels already achieved by the series, but also by examining this aspect the impression of a half-regulation production is strengthened compared to what should characterize a new stand-alone chapter, precisely because Animals & Co. is designed to be an effective step forward in the series, but an enriched addition to the occasion of the original game itself. Obviously completely new are the animal models, which as previously mentioned are characterized by a somewhat fluctuating quality, with some well-reproduced breeds and others somewhat sketchy or unlikely, but the more patient can still achieve any result with the use of the special ~genetic~ editor for cats and dogs. The user interface therefore also remains practically unchanged, which while managing to condense all the possible options of the PC version onto the controller keys, continues to underline how the ideal configuration for enjoying a game like The Sims is inevitably the good old mouse with the keyboard. The developers' commitment in being able to offer an uncastrated experience compared to the PC version is commendable, effectively reproducing the control via pointer by spreading it between the back buttons, front buttons and analog sticks, but we are quite far from the comfort given by the classic interface of the PC version and the risk of getting lost among the sub-menus and key combinations, at least for a good first period, is very present.", "date": "2011-10-18", "grade": "7.3"}
