{"name": "Mario Power Tennis - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-power-tennis-recensione.html", "text": "As if third-party plans were less than daunting when it comes to big releases, Nintendo on Wii has also decided to jump into the recycling market, effectively postponing all the new ideas that we hope will bounce somewhere in the Tokyo offices. Partly to monetize new Wii customers and partly to catechize them, Nintendo launched the ~New Play Control~ line a few months ago which reconverts some of the classics for the GameCube onto the Wii, even if it is not clear with what criterion these are selected. In Europe Mario Power Tennis is the second title of the series to arrive on the shelves. Hair and makeup The Mario Tennis series made its successful debut on the infamous Nintendo 64 and, later, a sequel came out on the GameCube that attempted to mimic its magic, but stalled in the face of a few minor oversights that kept it away from the unforgettable. Having said that, Mario Power Tennis still had excellent cards to play, such as an impeccable technical realization, many crazy playgrounds full of traps, and a lot of game modes, including the one with Mario Kart bonuses, good for unleashing on the opponents all the power of mushrooms, bananas, and various shells. Also considering the fun and dry control system, bringing the series to Wii wasn't a bad idea, both from a commercial point of view and from a line-up point of view. And once you insert the disc, there's absolutely no feeling that the game is just a port of an older system. The graphics are on par with (if not better than) other Wii productions, all interfaces have been redesigned, and 16/9 has been integrated seamlessly. Options and trinkets are all intact, and there's little to regret given the sheer number of variations on the theme: pitching courts, courts with treadmills activated by hitting the arrows above the net, courts smeared with Sunshine mud, others possessed from the ghosts of Luigi's Mansion and so on. As if the playing fields weren't messed up enough, in some you can add your own, selecting the bonuses that will transform a tennis match into one of Mario Kart, or the rings to then have to hit with the ball. For the more traditionalists, however, there are also bare fields, without traps and tricks of any kind: only good traditional tennis. In short, the first impact with the game puts the player at ease and in conditions favorable to the noisy multiplayer fun that has become the hallmark of the ~sports~ series from Maria. The involution of the species Once you take the Wiimote in hand, however, things change, and it is not easy to tell whether it is due to the inaccuracies of the movement detections (which in any case do not affect a game) or to a feeling of ~autopilot~ almost always present during the game. The fact is that for those who had played the original version, this adaptation for Wii seems like an extreme simplification. In reality, everything would also be as before, there are the same types of shots and super-shots, but executing them with the Wiimote has a completely different flavor. We are not very far from what we saw in Wii Sport Tennis, but Mario Power Tennis's technique is almost canceled by an oversimplified adaptation. The picture that emerges is that if Wii Sport Tennis works well with the Wiimote, Mario Power Tennis had (more) reason to be with the pad. The two control systems are of little use, one with only the remote control, and the other with Nunchuk and remote control; the uncomfortable feeling that something is not right does not go away. In single configuration the game works just as expected. The character follows the ball, and we, simulating the gesture with the Wiimote, have to hit the ball. If we want to intervene on the movement of the character we can do it thanks to the arrow keys, but exceptions aside, there is never a need. With the complete configuration instead, the control of the character is entirely up to us, but thanks to the fact that the same has a rather large ~hook~ area with the ball, it seems that everything is managed by a sort of superior conscience that pilots every What. The 4 levels of control depth are taken over from the GameCube version. The first is fully managed, leaving the CPU with the burden of using the super-shots (which are earned after a few ball exchanges with the opponent), the second to choose at least when to make the super-shot, the third adds control over type of strike to be performed between attack and defense. Furthermore, with the fourth we can also decide when to dive the character to recover a distant ball. Buttons Vs Sensors In Mario Power Tennis there are different types of shots in addition to the ~normal~ one, namely the Top Spin, the Slice, the lobs and the drop shots. Game and manual explains usnot how to perform the gestures to choose the type of shot, and are the same that could be done on the GameCube by pressing the A and B keys twice. The introduction of the Wiimote has led to two changes. The first is that the character decides based on the situation (time available and position) when to start loading a shot, the second, more obvious, is that the type of shot is assigned with a gesture. A diagonal from bottom to top performs a Top Spin, from top to bottom instead a Slice. For the lob, a movement from bottom to top is sufficient, and finally, to dampen the ball, a movement from top to bottom is performed. So according to the manual, in practice, apart from the damping, everything seems rather left to chance. We play the same, for heaven's sake, but the system doesn't work properly. And if by experimenting slowly, something comes out of it, the doubt remains that perhaps it would have been better to reprogram the whole shooting system, perhaps making it more limited, but also more precise. However, you soon get used to not relying too much on the type of spin, but to angle the ball in the same way we did in Wii Sport, also because it's a safer way to score points. Comment From what is written in the body of the review it seems that Mario Power Tennis is a complete hole in the water. In truth it is only if we consider the way it has been adapted to the remote control, which is no small thing you will say, but the bad games are decidedly different. Leaving aside this aspect, Mario's second tennis episode remains a fun game capable of giving many hours of healthy fun in multiplayer, and despite the flaws in the control system and the excessive simplification in the adaptation phase, the extreme care of the package make it a valid choice to liven up entire evenings and afternoons. Buying alone is less advisable, but this applies to all plumber games other than platformers. In case you would like to try anyway, we advise you to set the difficulty to maximum, otherwise it will really seem like a minigame.
