{"name": "Grande Fratello - Il gioco!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grande-fratello-il-gioco.html", "text": "It's roottooooooooooooooooo! Big Brother is such a simple and immediate game that, almost paradoxically, it is more difficult to describe than to play. Of course, you will have to impersonate one of the shady figures who live in the most televised house in Italy. The game is divided into rounds: 4 game cycles make a day of ~real game~. At each turn we will be able to make our character perform a range of articulated and, why not, quite complex operations. The actions are basically divided into two categories: the social ones such as ~flirting~ (one can also try, if desired, to establish relationships ... um ... unorthodox with other competitors of the same sex), gossiping behind someone's back, complimenting, cleaning and anything else and the category of maintenance actions such as sleeping, eating or (at least once a week, please!) taking a shower. Depending on our choice, therefore, we will gain advantages (such as attracting the sympathy of our loved one or putting another character in the house in a bad light) at the expense, however, of other aspects that are still important in the context of life inside of the House. By sleeping little, for example, our character will risk compromising his health, while by never letting our digital alter-ego take a shower, we will instead risk inevitably lowering his charisma due to the lack of hygiene shown. In short, anyone who has played the videogame bestseller par excellence of recent years (the notorious The Sims) cannot fail to have a certain sense of dj vu. Every Thursday there will be nominations followed, the following week, by public votes and so on. If you have even minimally followed the television program, you know what we are talking about, otherwise you probably won't even be interested in learning about the game mechanics. If in a single game the title could soon get bored despite the ~rich unlockable extras~ (represented by a series of videos that draw on the archive scenes of the television broadcast), GF seems to give its best, instead , in happy and carefree Multiplayer sessions. This is because, as already mentioned, the various animations and nice jingles with which this game is dotted manage to create an atmosphere of healthy cheerfulness that you cannot help but appreciate as a group. Matter of feeling... The audiographic sector of this title certainly cannot be compared to that of the latest multimillion-dollar productions to which the Industry has by now accustomed us, however, where the budget is lacking, certain gaps have been filled, at least in part, thanks to the verve and to the style sported by the designers of Trecision. The graphic style is typical of the ~Super Deformed~ works that the country of the Rising Sun has taught us to appreciate for the past few years, while the sound aspect, while not presenting us, as imaginable, audio tracks in DTS or ambient sound effects of the latest generation, manages to faithfully transpose the light-hearted and purely Gigionesque style of the entire work. Named? Big Brother will not be remembered as one of the videogame masterpieces of the twenty-first century nor, much less, of the year 2003. But after all, the goal set by the Ligurian SoftwareHouse was certainly not this. GF, in fact, is the typical unpretentious game that simply aims to make us spend a few hours of healthy relaxation without the need to read substantial manuals or own the latest generation hardware. The price of the game itself (which can also be purchased at newsstands) turns out to be really convenient and even lower than certain titles sold in the so-called budget series. Last, but not least, all fans of the television broadcast will hardly be disappointed (without obviously expecting an even more Orwellian edition of The Sims) by a game which, with all its limitations, will allow all Floriana fans to see her - at least in the ~fiction~ - happy and content together with her beloved Luca. Pros: Competitive price For all fans of the television broadcast Fun and enjoyable in company Cons: For some it could be too simplistic Audiographically minimalist It could get boring soon Big Brother It is increasingly difficult to talk about a media event like Big Brother without falling irreparably into a more or less boorish series of clichs which, moreover, leave the time they find. For this we will avoid any comments - positive ornegative - on what it represents - needless to deny it - one of the most innovative and inspiring television formats of recent years. Trecision, one of the few Italic Software that for years has managed to make sense not only in the ambit of the poor Italian panorama but also in the European one (see the graphic adventure ~The Watchmaker~), this year did not miss the a wonderful opportunity to acquire the rights relating to the television broadcast to churn out, just in time to be released simultaneously with the cathode ray tube version, a video game without too many ambitions but still worthy of our attention.", "date": "2003-05-07", "grade": null}
