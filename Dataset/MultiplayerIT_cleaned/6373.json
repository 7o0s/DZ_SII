No? Don't worry, it's normal: the spiritual sequel to Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman doesn't exactly enjoy great popularity, also because it was one of the least publicized Nippon Ichi titles outside of Japan, which is saying something given that the Japanese developer's games are decidedly niche. The Guided Fate Paradox, then, presented itself as a kind of ~roguelike~, rather than a strategic one along the lines of Nippon Ichi's most popular franchise, Disgaea. The game, although interesting at least from a narrative point of view, hadn't completely convinced us. And the sequel, to be honest, convinced us even less. The Awakened Fate Ultimatum is a sequel we really didn't feel the need for Angels and Demons From time to time, Nippon Ichi games seem to suggest that the Japanese software house is looking for a new identity. The Guided Fate Paradox staged a supernatural comedy in which angels and demons fought around the protagonist, the new god of the kingdom of Celestia. As usual, the recurring gags and the cartoonish character design served to mask a very profound title from the gameplay point of view, an art in which Nippon Ichi is certainly an undisputed master. With The Awakened Fate Ultimatum, however, the situation has completely reversed: the story, very serious and dramatic, is the counterpart to a surprisingly simple game in every respect. The connections with the prequels are almost irrelevant to the plot, with cameos of various types bound to the post-game. The new protagonist is Shin Kamikaze, a somewhat emo student who is killed in an ambush set by some demons, despite the intervention of his guardian angel. Thanks to the Fate Awakening Crystal, however, Shin is brought back to life and transformed into the new god of Celestia, just when an all-out war between angels and demons is about to break out. As per tradition, the story is told to us through long, interminable dialogues in English, with illustrations of the characters and the place where the scene takes place as a context. Unfortunately, the length of the interludes and the small amount of illustrations that express the emotions of the various characters make the scrolling of the story anything but light, if not really boring: despite some witty jokes, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum really takes itself too seriously, delivering quite a few punches in the stomach that are sure to please fans of war stories. However, the latest title from Nippon Ichi is a constant contradiction: from the colorful cel-shaded graphics that reproduce the characters in their super-deformed versions, to the moments in which the player is forced to make moral choices which, however, have little or no effect on the evolution of history. Not infrequently we have chosen an option and discovered that Shin, in any case, prefers the alternative, deluding us about a control over the narrative which in fact does not exist or is in any case very narrow, pace of multiple endings. Playstation 3 trophies The 28 bronze, 8 silver and 4 gold trophies are unlocked in a fairly traditional way, which is by completing story missions, defeating various types of enemies and learning the spells of the various schools of magic. Platinum, of course, requires a little more effort. Gods and monsters Like The Guided Fate Paradox, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum is also reminiscent of ~roguelike~ role-playing games, and in this case the category of the various Mystery Dungeons. In a certain sense it is always a strategic one, more than anything else because the player, in control of Shin, must think about his position in relation to that of the enemies and navigate between the various skills that consume the resource called SP, many of which they affect more or less large areas of the network of movement and action. The SP pool is kind of the heart of the game, allowing you to use various abilities and cast spells. Apparently it doesn't seem like anything special, at least until Shin learns the ~Deitize~ technique, which allows him to transform into an angel or a demon depending on the backbone pressed on the joypad. The difference is easy to tell: transformed into an angel, Shin inflicts more damage on demons and mitigates more; turned into a demon, of course, the opposite happens. The transformation, however, consumes SP, and risks leaving players dry, and therefore ridiculously helpless, who do not learn to balance the protagonist's powers. On the other hand, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum is much milder in terms of difficulty: we die much less, and our defeat ~only~ involves the loss of the objects that werewe are transporting, without altering our stats, thus forcing us to replay dungeons to get dressed again. Even from the point of view of itemization, however, Nippon Ichi seems to have stripped his latest effort of all the more complex RPG components, reducing inventory and equipment management to the bone. On the one hand it's a sensible move, towards newbies, but on the other it's a definite affront to that niche of loyal fans. Furthermore, from the point of view of level design, the developer has made very little effort: the layout of the various dungeons is procedural, but they are almost all very short and linear, ideally designed to connect the narrative interludes to each other, when instead the opposite to. The real challenges await players at the end of the story and after the credits, depending on the ending unlocked, but these are sop that only marginally improve the overall offer.", "date": "2015-04-30", "grade": "5.5"}
