A few days ago we took a look at StarBlood Arena, while today we're going to discover GNOG, a 3D puzzle published under the banner of Double Fine Presents, a division of the studio founded by Tim Schafer dedicated to promoting games made by external independent teams. In fact, we find the guys from KO_OP, a group of developers from Montreal very inspired from an artistic point of view, as we have already had the opportunity to see on the occasion of the collaboration with Ubisoft for Lara Croft GO and her Mirror of the Spirits. With a lot of curiosity we therefore wore our helmet to play GNOG, even if as we are about to see the game can be easily appreciated even by those who do not own PlayStation VR. Get involved with the colorful monsters of GNOG: you won't be disappointed at all! Tap and explore The series of puzzles that GNOG offers us is divided between the various levels that make up the game. Each of them is made up of the face of a kind of monster, which actually hides a sort of box full of playful colors and shapes, as well as more or less hidden indications on how to solve the puzzles that are part of it. The moment you find yourself in front of one of these ~things~ for the first time, it is possible to be attacked by a small sense of loss, destined however to vanish after a few moments thanks to the way in which KO_OP has built the puzzles. In a somewhat different way from other titles that make puzzles their cornerstone, the experience offered by GNOG can be identified as a whole as a real flow, in which the player is invited to interact with everything that is in front of the own eyes instead of puzzling over what to do. The level design then prompts us to fiddle with all the elements that make up the monster box, using the pad keys to turn and rotate it while observing and touching the components. Of course, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't use your head to solve GNOG's puzzles, nor that there can't be moments in which you don't know how to move forward. Based on our experience with the game, however, we can tell you that it is very rare to find yourself without having an idea of what to do, and that often these moments are due to the distraction of the player who does not allow him to see a hint or an element to interact with, despite having it maybe right in front of you. In terms of variety, the GNOG levels offer a fair amount of differentiation, especially in terms of setting: in one of them, for example, you find yourself having to feed some birds, while in another you have to fix a spaceship; yet another is composed of a kind of multi-storey building. The elements with which to interact are less different, given that in most cases we are talking about buttons, wheels and levers, but this was inevitable if we consider the nature of GNOG. However, the context switch works, which makes each level a story in itself, populated by different elements and characters that the player can't wait to discover. The aspect of longevity is instead the one where GNOG suffers the most: the levels can be completed in a few minutes and their total reaches only nine, also leaving very little room for replayability if not to return to appreciate the inspired artistic vein of the game. The price could perhaps have been a few euros less, but considering the care taken by KO_OP in the design, we don't feel like making a fuss of it. We hope the arrival of other ~monsters~ sooner or later. Playstation 4 trophies GNOG offers a total of twenty trophies, all of which are bronze in type. Half of them can be obtained by completing all levels, while the remaining ten are linked to some hidden aspects. To collect them all it is therefore necessary to have a good eye, in order to notice all the aspects that the developers have decided to hide behind the monsters we find ourselves in front of. Face to face with the monster As we have already said, each level of GNOG offers its own setting, characterized by a truly maniacal care on the part of KO_OP both in the creation of the puzzles and in the technical details. Each monster is drawn to perfection inside and out of its face, with an explosion of colors and shapes capable of bringing out the child in all of us. Touching and experimenting with what's in front of you comes almost naturally, even more so when playing GNOG with the fully supported PlayStation VR. Virtual reality undoubtedly allows the player to get the maximum involvement from this title, as wearing the viewer ci gives us the ability to find the monster box straight ahead in three-dimensional space. Thus one gets the impression that it exists in reality and that one can really touch it, decisively crossing that limit between video game and real game which we imagine the guys from KO_OP aimed for in creating GNOG. Anyone who doesn't own PlayStation VR, however, still has the opportunity to see a series of particularly inspired settings, both in terms of graphics as already described, and in sound. Discovering all the parts that make up the monster piece by piece (do you know the old Mighty Max games?) is a real pleasure, accompanied by a soundtrack that adapts perfectly to the various moments. We strongly advise you to play with a pair of headphones, in order to appreciate the explosion of joy from the monster at the end of each level, who will also start singing for us in a blaze of colors. If the idea of going back to being a child to enjoy the discovery in everything you see, in short, GNOG has what you need.", "date": "2017-05-07", "grade": "8.0"}
