{"name": "Beyond Eyes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154848-beyond-eyes-il-buio-tra-le-siepi.html", "text": "It is a good period for those who have always supported the narrative potential of the video game medium: there are now several experiments and attempts to provide a deeper interpretation of the product full of alternatives, capable of probing the communication capabilities of the medium even regardless of the playful essence. A particularly evident trend in indie productions, freer from the logic of the market and able to hover towards daring and breaking solutions, now easily within the reach of console users, given the opening of these platforms to the independent sphere. The evaluation of these titles always raises a few more questions because they can hardly be aligned with normal videogame production and it is necessary to know what you are getting into when you decide to immerse yourself in a ~game~ of this kind, because often and willingly in fact there is it's very little to play. Beyond Eyes is one of these products, an expressive rather than a narrative experiment, particularly based on graphic representation rather than on the desire to tell a story: it presents a particular situation and does so with a certain force, staging the condition of a blind girl and his way of interacting with the outside world, in a desperate search for his lost cat. It is a game that stages blindness in a short story that illustrates courage, fear, wonder, fragility and strength using very few words and a lot of audiovisual material, providing a beautiful representation of what not seeing can mean, with the particular construction of the game world based on the sounds and movements of Rae, the protagonist, in her demiurgic creation and interpretation of reality starting from her own sensations as in a sort of living and iridescent watercolor. The solution is intelligent and very fascinating but it is little supported by the feeble narrative system, not to mention the gameplay component which in this case is more inconsistent than ever. A great journey Rae was a happy and carefree little girl until an accident took away her sight, abruptly changing her world. In the solitude of his new existence he finds comfort in the visits of a cat called Nani, with whom he forms a sort of strange friendship. When all traces of the latter go missing, Rae decides to overcome her fears and venture into the unknown world in search of her little friend. The game therefore tries to make us experience firsthand the great gesture of courage performed by Rae to leave the safe domestic refuge and enter the outside world, with all the fear and curiosity that can arise from an invisible reality, which can only be guessed through sounds , the memories and the imagination of the little girl. The chirping of birds, the sound of flowing water or the tolling of a bell help create points of reference in the surrounding environment, but the world around Rae is created slowly, only as the girl approaches the various elements of the scenario. It is an original and well thought-out solution, which forces us to grope around, actually discovering what surrounds us step by step in a continuous generation of painted images that do not necessarily correspond to reality (indeed it is particular to note how some objects initially imagined in one way they transform once they come into contact) but they guide us slowly towards the objectives, determined by smells, noises or memories. The pace of the game is necessarily slow, very slow, precisely because it is impossible to run blindly in an invisible reality and the discovery of the surrounding world takes place at every step, thus forcing us to enter Rae's particular perspective even at the cost of breaking the pace of the game on very dilated times, too slow for a normal game but perfectly in line with the experience that Beyond Eyes wants us to experience with extreme consistency. Beyond Eyes allows you to gently enter the world imagined by a blind character On the trail of Nani All we have to do is essentially find the way to reach the goal that leads to the conclusion of the six levels that make up the game, bringing us closer and closer to Nani each time, retracing the path that the lost cat seems to have taken. The difficulty lies in the impossibility of initially seeing the correct path to follow, discovering it only by groping through the scenario, following the sounds or reminiscences of the protagonist. Occasionally we are faced with small puzzles to solve to open the way but these are absolutely basic puzzles, the only thing to do is essentially move around the game world to build the scenario and findtherefore the waypoints in search of Nani. It is not strange that an experimental video game of this type is practically devoid of a real play structure, on the other hand it can be assimilated to a ~walking simulator~, focusing above all on exploration and contemplation. However, it should be noted that unlike indie titles of this type, which usually aim to present complex stories or particular communicative situations, Beyond Eyes has a very minimal narrative substratum and is based exclusively on the mechanism of the gradual construction of the world to bring firsthand experience of lack of vision. It's a beautiful idea that manages to align us with a disadvantaged situation by leveraging fantasy and wonder, thus maintaining a balance between empathy and the charm of Rae's changing world, demonstrating at the same time the great difficulty but also the possible richness that may be associated with this condition. The problem is that this idea fails to support the entire structure of a real game, running out of wonder in the first few minutes and trying to dramatically lengthen the effect for the following chapters. Not that the game itself is long, given that it ends (net of any further steps in search of unlockable objectives) in less than two hours, but even in its short duration it is somewhat stretched, considering that the concept could have been well also offered to the public within a more compact experience, perhaps outside the standard form of product for the gaming market. Xbox One goals Beyond Eyes contains 10 unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points, therefore very few compared to the average amount of current games. It can easily happen to finish the game a first time by unlocking only the final objective since the others require you to perform specific actions outside the standard progression, therefore it becomes necessary to go back several times to the various chapters to conquer the other achievements. The wonders of the world It is clear that the aesthetic of Beyond Eyes represents the characterizing element of the game not only from a production point of view, but also in terms of the game experience itself. Paradoxically, since it is the story of a blind girl, what appears on the screen is a real marvel, more stylistic than technical but still able to amaze and leave its mark. The sense of such graphic refinement goes beyond the desire to represent a tale in fairy-tale form and must be found, once again, in Rae's particular condition: the construction of her reality is based on the most beautiful memories of the past and generates a world which is more colorful and alive than it is in reality, making us think again of the power of sight but also of the imagination, how life can be without one, how much one can underestimate the other and ultimately accounts to the enormous value that certain things that we take for granted have. The watercolor scenarios are therefore not only an aesthetic quirk but represent the meeting point between the inner world of the protagonist and the surrounding reality, which suddenly appears around her and transforms when the senses realign themselves revealing new characteristics. In short, aesthetics is very much substance in this case and the eyes and sight are the protagonists of the experience of the game and of Rae's situation, for this reason the care placed in this aspect by the Tiger & Squid team has great importance in characterizing throughout the title, making it something like an interactive pictorial work. Also noteworthy is the audio accompaniment which acts in concert with the graphic sector, expanding the perceptions of the protagonist through a sort of continuous synesthesia between noises, sensations, colors and images.", "date": "2015-08-18", "grade": "6.7"}
