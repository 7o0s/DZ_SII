{"name": "OutRun 2006: Coast to Coast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/outrun-2006-coast-to-coast.html", "text": "OutRun always in your pocket with us The most incredible thing is the feeling of having in your hands a perfect conversion of the sequel to OutRun released for Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC. The possibility of getting into our virtual Ferrari, saying goodbye to our baby and starting the race against the clock from coast to coast of the United States, all this while we are returning home from work by train or bus, is something incredible. If they had told us this a few years ago we would never have believed it. The developers have done an incredible job to make the most of the power of the small Sony console. Sega's racing game is completely set to fight against time, our goal, in fact, is exclusively to reach the check point, everything else doesn't matter. Current gamers may turn up their noses, accustomed to other types of more advanced driving games, more attentive to physics or to different objectives than the race against time, OutRun is not Burnout and above all it is not Gran Turismo. There is only one challenge, against the hands of the stopwatch and against the traffic on American highways. Once we have mastered the power slides or ~drifting around corners~ we will be able to tackle even the most difficult tracks and we will make the blonde sitting next to us scream with joy. In the game there is no space for particular settings of our cars, just a quick choice among the Ferraris available, which will be gradually unlocked during the game, and the mode of use of the gearbox, with manual or automatic selector, then it will start the challenge immediately. The goal is therefore only one, to drive faster than the wind and time, cross the finish line before the deadline to be able to continue the race. Past and present content Within the title developed by Sumo Digital we will find the two standard versions of OutRun and OutRun SP to complete this virtual hymn to the past, and then continue with the Heart Attack Mode and Coast to Coast, excellent options for getting familiar with the system of control and speed of the Sega game. If the Coast to Coast is a race with objectives, the Heart Attack involves a race in which our stupendous virtual passenger will ask us to perform particular evolutions, such as hitting other cars, earning virtual currency and performing spectacular skids near each hairpin bend. If we satisfy her every wish we will be rewarded by her affection in the form of a high score. The main modality of OutRun 2006 is the one that foresees, as we have already explained in the previous paragraph, a constant and continuous run-up to the checkpoints scattered along the track. This could quickly bore even the most ardent supporter of racing games, but fortunately the developers have seen fit to insert the OutRun Miles, i.e. the possibility of earning points for each mile traveled on the roads in the game, a bit like the ~ airline promotional campaigns. When we have collected enough miles we can use them to buy new items at the OutRun Shop, brand new and very powerful cars and innovative tracks, redesigned or repurposed upside down. The right reward, capable of pushing the game to continue even in the event of continuous failures, yes because you don't need to win and exceed the goal, you simply need to travel many miles of American highways. A little gem Technically, the Sega game is a real walker capable of fighting on equal terms with the best racing games that appeared on the Sony portable console, we are referring to Burnout Legends and Ridge Racer in particular. OutRun 2006 can boast a very good graphic engine, with excellent polygonal models of the cars and an excellent sensation of speed, unfortunately we have noticed some decidedly inexplicable frame rate drops, because they do not occur in excited situations that could have put the engine under pressure. game. The attention of the developers was entirely focused on the excellent sensation of speed and on the design of the tracks, the management of the physics was instead tackled with ~lightness~ as an absolutely arcade-style title like OutRun 2006 Coast to Coast deserves. The possibilities offered by the PSP are not finished since there is the possibility of playing multiplayer via wireless LAN up to six players simultaneously for challenges at the height of frenzy. Remarkable, but quite impracticable, the possibility of connecting the PSP to a PlayStation 2 to unlock new content, in fact two copies of the game are required, one for each platform. Comment OutRun 2006: Coast to Coast in essence while not presenting striking innovations compared to its predecessoressor or the original coin op, the mere fact of having become portable already deserves to be taken into consideration. Lovers of the saga will not be able to do without it, as will all arcade racing game enthusiasts, the playability is at very high levels and the OutRun Shop, together with the accessory modes, extend the longevity of the title. Technically it is a little gem and certainly one of the best products on the Sony laptop. Pro OutRun portable. Technically very good. Very playable. Cons Some slowdown too much. It's a race against time... There was a time in which simulation in racing games was of little interest, the important thing was the sensation of speed and the thrill that the latter was able to convey to enthusiasts who, at the cost of spending a fortune in pennies, had to get to the finish line before time runs out; that damned checkpoint had to be passed. The memory of many hours spent in the arcade attached to that steering wheel fills us with nostalgia and the final ~blow~ was delivered by Sega finally bringing a sequel worthy of the name to PSP, the Sony portable.", "date": "2006-05-02", "grade": null}
