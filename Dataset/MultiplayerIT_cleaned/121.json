{"name": "R-Type", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/r-type.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Each videogame genre has its milestones, titles that bring new ideas and act as a link for an evolutionary ~step~. R-Type is one of those titles: made by IREM and released in arcades for the first time in 1987, the game expands and improves each of the basic concepts of shoot'em-up. On board a spaceship, on a horizontally scrolling scenario, the player must face the aliens of the Bydo Empire in their territory, to make them desist from hostile intentions towards our solar system. The vehicle can shoot small pulses of energy or hold the discharges to then launch a blow of great power, but it also has a series of upgrades (which can be accessed by destroying certain mechanisms) that allow it to increase its speed, activate the launch of homing missiles, use new weapons (characterised, as usual, by color) or add spherical ~appendices~ that have both a defensive and an offensive value. The game gained immense popularity and was ported to virtually every gaming system of the time, but the Turbo Grafx version remains by far the best. The reasons for its success are due, in addition to the innovations in the gameplay (the ~pod~, the loadable mega-ray, etc.), also in a series of graphic and sound solutions of great impact: the appearance of the aliens and the locations is clearly inspired by the works of H. R. Giger (who hasn't seen a film in the ~Alien~ series?), and for the first time huge end-of-level bosses appear, which occupy the screen almost in its entirety. A similar argument can be made for the sound, made up of normal effects accompanied, however, by brilliant music. In those years both programmers and musicians had to ~make do~ with the means offered by the media, and in this sense R-Type boasts an exceptional soundtrack, which remains in the head and which makes us nostalgic for the current lack of such significant contributions . What is it today What is R-Type capable of offering today? Going beyond its great historical value, this title for Turbo Grafx gives us the opportunity to deal with a gameplay based on the challenge and memorization of the stages. R-Type is very difficult, let's not get around it: at the time, the concept of ~vital energy~ was still not very popular, and this means that taking a single enemy hit will result in the loss of a life (and all power -up collected...). And the ~continues~ are certainly not infinite, indeed they are extremely limited. This will lead you to strive to place the pod on the most vulnerable side of the ship, to memorize the arrangement of enemies and power-ups, to invent effective attack strategies against bosses and so on. If you haven't experienced that period of video games, you will find yourself measuring yourself with something completely new and you will be surprised to find it compelling. If, on the other hand, you are an experienced gamer, R-Type will represent a welcome dive into the past, when it was possible to make a game fun and frustrating at the same time. In this sense, the decision to offer this Virtual Console title at a higher price does not speak in favor of Nintendo, but all in all the fun that one gets fully repays the expense. As promised by Nintendo, through the Wii Shop channel it is possible to purchase (using a credit card or a prepaid Wii card) a series of classic games for various consoles of the past. The latest update of the Virtual Console catalog also saw the arrival of R-Type for Turbo Grafx (PC Engine), released in 1989 and sold for the occasion at a slightly higher price than other titles for the same system. i.e. 800 Wii Points.
