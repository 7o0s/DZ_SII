{"name": "Miami Vice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/miami-vice_a.html", "text": "Welcome to Miami... It was only a matter of time and in the end even Miami Vice, the show set on the luminous coasts of Florida, found its consecration in the great universe of 16:9 celluloid. In Miami Vice we will take on the role of two agents of the Miami Vice Squad, Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs in their attempt to stop the criminal activities of a powerful organized crime boss. Our whole adventure will take place over 7 missions of increasing difficulty (plus a bonus mini-game to unlock) during which we will follow the evolution of the plot with a series of interlude sequences. Instead of moving towards a GTA-like structure, as Gameloft did with its recent Gangstar Crime City, (and which perhaps would have made the whole setting and characters of Miami Vice better), the developers have opted for a more immediate shooter . The game is set up as a classic 3D shooter, which more than Doom closely resembles one of the Sega arcade classics, Virtua Cop 2. However, unlike the Sega title, in Miami Vice, in each mission there will be only one ed single static screen, within which the enemies will appear, shady figures and drug traffickers, which we will promptly, armed with our faithful pistol and our sniper rifle, we will go to submit to the judgment of the law. Good cop, bad cop... As already mentioned above, perhaps precisely because of the attempt at immediacy, the game concept turns out to be very poor in content, limited to simple shoot-shoot against hordes of enemies that are all the same. In itself it could also be fun for the most savvy and unpretentious players, but already from the second mission, in which we will have to hit the enemies using our sniper rifle, for some everything could turn into a very very frustrating experience , due to a more limited view of the enemies, and a type of controls (that of a mobile phone) that is ill-suited to a genre in which speed and reflexes are fundamental. Apart from the perhaps slightly excessive difficulty peaks, with a little effort the game can be played without too many problems. In the graphic sector, the interlude scenes and locations (however static) appear to be well cared for, a sore point are the enemies and their animations, which in addition to being a bit ugly, also appear to be woody in their movements and not too intelligent ( the Artlife guys had done much better with the less known but excellently made Swat Missions) The audio part is all in all acceptable, however limited to a musical track that will accompany us during our game sessions; so don't expect sound effects, explosions or gunshots. As for the commands, we will control the view using all the buttons on our keyboard (so 2 will correspond to up, 8 to down and so on) while we shoot with the central button.
