{"name": "Una vita da mediano", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119414-lords-of-football-una-vita-da-mediano.html", "text": "Footballers, especially in the modern era, have increasingly become prima donnas: in addition to their deeds on the green rectangle, the most famous are often and willingly also known for their wild lives, carried on between love stories with starlets, who punctually end up on the gossip magazines, and festive evenings that are not suitable for those who want to lead a healthy life as an athlete. Lords of Football rests its foundations precisely on the arduous task of finding a middle ground between the temptations inevitably brought by earnings obtained at an age that is often too young, and the need to train to achieve career goals, winning trophies for become a football legend. It is, for the benefit of those who have not read it before, a football management developed by the Italian team Geniaware: based in Savona, but elements taken from various videogame realities, including international ones, with which the former footballer collaborated as an adviser and coach Gianluca Vialli. After a gestation period that passed not without some small problems, Lords of Football has finally arrived on Steam, where it has been available for a few weeks at a price of 24.99. We therefore have the task of avoiding the ~cassanata~ of the moment. Day and night Lords of Football is essentially divided into 2 parts, corresponding to as many phases of the day: during the day, our job is to train the members of our team, while at night we have to pay attention to their physiological desires leisure, but making sure that what are innocent pastimes do not become dangerous vices. A bit Football Manager and a bit The Sims therefore, for what has been a recurring comparison over the months that led us to the release of Lords of Football, because it fits perfectly. Let's go in order: the first thing to do is choose the team to train among the various series present in the main European championships, of which there is no official license. A practically obligatory absence of licenses: considering the forcing of Lords of Football towards the deadly sins, it is easy to imagine that no real player intends to see his virtual counterpart make stupid figures, such as falling to the ground after missing training to go get drunk. The names of the teams are thus a mix of distortion and allusion to the real ones with a bit of a vintage flavor (which team do you think Roma Magics is?), as well as those of the players in some cases recall reality (The Sphinx in a team of Milan: who will it be?). Once the first step has been taken, you end up in the real game: the various ~menus~ are proposed in the form of a map of the city that hosts the team, where our sports complex also appears. Inside, it is possible to choose which training to have the athletes carry out, differentiating the programs between the usual technical and physical characteristics that make up their profile, and then putting them all together in the appropriate tactics editor, simplified to the right point compared to Football Manager. After training, the nightlife breaks loose: the players leave the locker rooms to go to the other buildings in the city, looking for a way to satisfy their needs. Also in this case, the behaviors will respond to the player's personal profile: there is the one who wants to feed his ego by meeting the fans, the one who wants to have fun in the disco, and so on. Having taken off the role of coach, we must therefore put on those of a father, directing our pupils towards balanced entertainment, to prevent excesses from ruining performance on the pitch. To do this, in addition to the possibility of choosing what kind of entertainment to grant during the night, we also find some tools during training if the situation gets out of hand (and it will happen), such as sessions with the psychologist and the amusing punishments on the secondary pitch . We go out into the field As each day passes in the manner just described, a calendar game follows. After taking a last look at the tactics, you can choose to simulate the match or live it directly, taking advantage of a series of interesting possibilities to give directions to our players in real time. By pausing the game, you access a dynamic menu, with which in the attack phase you can, for example, tell a winger to sprint on the wing, the playmaker who to pass the ball or the attacker to shoot on goal. Same thing in the defensive phase, where you ask the whole team to fold back, or indicate to a defender a precise opponent to guard. In some cases, as in reality, the player will react latehe will lie to our requests or ignore them completely, but when you manage to get the team online with a series of indications, there is a certain satisfaction. It is important, even for matches, to maintain an adequate level of energy in the players, but not only: athletes with the most deeply rooted vices will in fact end up paying the bill on the playing field, covering themselves with ridicule in front of the cameras. The successes achieved will contribute to satisfying some objectives set by the management, thanks to which new structures and training programs can be unlocked to improve the quality of one's team. Soldier Lardball! Less is more? In visual terms, Lords of Football lives up to its characteristics and presents itself with a style very similar to that of The Sims, complete with a light accompanying music. All in all, the town that hosts the team is nice to look at, even if the various elements - including the players - don't particularly shine due to the level of detail dedicated to them. As regards instead the component of the 3D engine that moves the games, we are faced with a work that borders on sufficiency in the name of minimum effort, with few animations and some flaws in terms of fluidity of movement. Staying on the subject of animations, the ones concerning the players' vices are instead fun to see, but above all the punishments inflicted on them on the playing field, such as for example the one that sees an imaginary Sergeant Major Hartman from Full Metal Jacket punishing the current footballer because too attracted to food. The menus proposed in the form of offices of the training structure have some ups and downs, where a useful system of filters to separate the players based on different parameters is accompanied by a search for woodiness in their selection and the management of personalized programs. An unripe fruit born from a good idea. This is Lords of Football.", "date": "2013-06-07", "grade": "6.0"}
