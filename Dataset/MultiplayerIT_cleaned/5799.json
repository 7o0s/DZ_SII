{"name": "Mai da soli!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154909-gauntlet-slayer-edition-mai-da-soli.html", "text": "Released just under a year ago on PC, Gauntlet now also arrives on PlayStation 4 thanks to a whole series of changes ~above~ and ~under~ the hood that expand and diversify the previous play offer. They don't overturn it of course, but in certain situations they make it different. However, we are not talking about the game mechanics, which fortunately remained the same. The developers, namely Arrowhead Game Studios, those of Magicka, with Gauntlet have done a good job of ~rejuvenating~ the 80s arcade classic, staging a dungeon crawler with a strong cooperative spirit, all in the name of a interesting path of growth and diversification of the four heroes (five, if we consider the Necromancer DLC). The definitive version of the new Gauntlet arrives on the Sony console! Four is better! To learn more about the mechanics of the game, we invite you to (re)read the review of the ~smooth~ version of Gauntlet published last September 30th. For all those who don't feel like it, or just want a little smattering to jump into the game discovering all its dynamics level after level, simply say that we are not dealing with a simple hack'n'slash. Here are dozens of enemies attacking us at once, food to eat to restore our health, gold to collect to unlock relics and skills, and skull coins to find or sweat in battle to be reborn. Alone they barely scratch the potential of the game, without forgetting that Gauntlet can be really brutal and ruthless, given that game over means going back to the beginning of the level. It is therefore necessary to collaborate, to take advantage of the individual skills and characteristics of each hero in concert to clean up the dungeons from the various skeletons, shamans, ghosts and various creatures that infest them. The pace is extremely frantic and fast, on the other hand Gauntlet was born as a product from the arcade now thirty years ago. Arrowhead Game Studios has done a really good job in making the protagonists so immediate to use, but at the same time deep to master, and since it is impossible to have more characters of the same class in the game, it is clear how Gauntlet is not a simple button mashing but something more full-bodied and satisfying. Despite a whole series of critical issues that keep him away from the top steps of the podium. We're talking about a certain repetitiveness of the levels, all too much the same and with ~events~ that tend to always be the same. It must be said that the developers have done everything possible to remove this feeling, including traps, bosses, secret rooms, hidden keys and so on, diversifying the enemies as much as possible based on the classic Chinese morra system, but really the sense of repetitiveness is very high. Playstation 4 trophies Gauntlet: Slayer Edition rewards the player with 39 trophies. They are not particularly difficult, you ~just~ have to dissect the game properly, for example by accumulating killings and killings for each individual hero, destroying objects and things or absorbing a certain amount of damage. Obviously the toughest ones concern the infinite mode. There will be sweat here! What's new? But what are the changes of this Slayer Edition? On a technical level, the improvements are noticeable, but they certainly don't change the face of a game that we defined visually as ~average~ a little less than a year ago. More evident, however, the progress made by the much more aggressive artificial intelligence, but also and above all the new enemies, such as the skeleton equipped with a shield with a dual attack pattern: slow when in a defensive position, fast and kamikaze once who has lost his defense tool. But that's not all: numerous other enemies have gained new attacks and related animation sets. All to make Gauntlet even meaner and tougher. The customization and growth system has also been revised. Characters now have special abilities linked to their equipment, while items (or weapons) can be unlocked by spending the precious gold coins collected in the game. We now have only one slot for relics, which no longer work based on potions, but as per the textbook of good hack 'n slash they have a recharge time to be used. In short, many more possibilities. In terms of actual content, an endless mode has been included, with procedurally created levels that are increasingly difficult and the Colosseum, with weekly challenges that are different each time. In short, this Slayer Edition really wants to be the best way to play Gauntlet, probably the result of user feedback and the original vision of Arrowhead Game Studios, which for various reasons did not materializein the first release. However, the same critical issues as a year ago remain, consequently players are also warned on consoles. Never play alone, also given the extreme repetitiveness of the level design and more generally of the challenges offered by the game.
