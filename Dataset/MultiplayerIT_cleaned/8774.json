In fact, at the gates of the forest there is a fearsome army commanded by the evil Gadflow but in the shade of the centuries-old trees of Dalendarth the unthinkable is about to happen, a corpse is about to become the most important being of all. Already. Our role, at the beginning, is that of the corpse, but on the way to our rigid remains there are the gnomes and above all there is the well of souls. And here's how in a few minutes the main character becomes the first living being to return from the dead. A miraculous rebirth but not without consequences that will change the fate of all Amalur. A new world Exploration in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is progressive, in an action RPG style, with a series of locations to be discovered gradually in immense maps full of contextual quests. In many cases the missions, in full role-playing style, change according to the peculiarities that distinguish our hero and are sometimes shaped by the choices of the player who, in some cases, can perform evil deeds, perhaps to get some extra bonuses or to avoid cowardly a fight. Therefore, a strong RPG component immediately stands out, underlined by an initially almost obvious plot but gradually heralding surprises and glimpses that lead us to discover the history of an entire world. Not free like Skyrim, nor technically at the same level, Reckoning still shows off remarkable excellence in animations and characterization of creatures. Furthermore, the region in which this first chapter is set is truly immense thanks also to more credible proportions of the territory than what happens in most open world titles. What appears before us is a fairytale world with endless forests and barren expanses, trees as big as mountains and structures entirely supported by magic. The tones are often grotesque but the heart of the narrative, or the birth of a hero without a destiny, has several mature ideas and offers a different point of view. The main quest allows you to face all the most spectacular bosses and fully explore the combat system. But if you get caught up in the Kingdoms of Amalur universe all the minor details could become important. The stories that intertwine are in fact part of the immense plot written by R.A. Salvatore who will be the basis for both the MMO Copernicus and the next RPG chapters of the saga. There are also tons of side quests with reagents to collect, creatures to kill and potions to find. These are tasks that say little both in terms of gameplay and from a narrative point of view but are obviously functional to the growth of the character. Fortunately, the NPCs often follow us, allowing us to deliver the quest we have just completed without having to use fast travel and above all without having to run back and forth across the map like marathon runners. Unfortunately jogging sessions cannot always be avoided and several missions are poorly structured forcing us to travel long unattractive stretches. Fable meets The Elder Scrolls is perhaps the most apt way to define Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning even if the hack & slash-style elements and the special bosses also call into question action RPGs that are decidedly different from the Molyneux series. As a structure the title allows free movement through the various areas of the world, but the environments are somewhat circumscribed. In any case we are talking about a truly immense world full of surprises with different factions in play and skills related to dialogue such as persuasion. Combat also mixes two souls with many skills available that are mixed with combos, intuitive targeting, somersaults and instant spells integrated into the action. No jump unfortunately if not automatically where necessary and this undoubtedly puts a brake on the feeling of freedom. The somersault dodge is a component no doubt taken from the Fable-like titles, but the finishing moves for special monsters, which when well executed give XP bonuses, are a notable and spectacular addition. In addition, the combos are much richer and include dances with daggers or remote combinations with chakra so spectacular as to leave Xena stone. The combos are unlocked by leveling up through the purchase of specific combat skills and have the advantage of clearly changing the gameplay in full action style and with a variety far superior to that of a classic RPG. There are also even more peculiar powers, and capable of recalling a brspecific hip of the actions, which allow us to hook and yank a creature or be yanked by it if it is too big. But the obvious inspirations certainly don't end there. Reckoning takes the full color code born out of World of Warcraft with rare items whose name is purple and monsters with a higher level than ours denoted in vivid orange. Aim assist, for enemies For each level increase, the player gets 3 points to spend in three trees full of skills and structured in a similar way, also in this case, to World of Warcraft, with skills that depend directly on the others, stand-alone skills and generic bonuses. The spells are not found but are unlocked as skills with the result being a mix between Diablo and World of Warcraft complete with passive skills with which to enhance all the tools of a certain type such as arcane weapons, spells, edged weapons, mana cost . In addition to allowing combos of all kinds, the skills unlock special thrusts and charged shots that are useful with different types of mobs. The fighting styles are quite different and combine in a peculiar way with the different types of spells. Freeze goes for a spin with his bow and swift fae blades that turn the player into a cutting whirlwind. The hammer, which is devastating and destabilizes the enemy, can be combined with the static discharge in order to maximize the damage on a single target. Obviously the possibilities are countless with summons, massive spells and enchanted weapons that can be used from a distance and it is up to the player to find the ones that best suit his style of play. Despite the action nature there is no shortage of allies, aggro and the possibility of fleeing and there is even kiting even if it is limited to 5 arrows that regenerate automatically after a few seconds, these are still essential in the middle of the action to block the opponent's ranged skills without wasting mana. Also implemented stealth with daggers that allow you to assassinate and related skills to increase the damage inflicted by surprise and improve stealth. A mix of genres in all respects therefore with CRPG strategies mixed with third-person action mechanics. A recipe that obviously influences the difficulty, never excessive given the possibility of drawing on spells and shooting at a distance, but still superior to that of a The Elder Scrolls given that it is not easy to block enemies and considering that the shooting distance is limited and everything works based on the targeting. The timing of each weapon and each power must also be considered since the monsters are decidedly different from each other. In fact, the opponents have different types of attack available, differentiated according to the type and class of the creature, which include group tactics and healers, hit and run tactics or devastating blows. In addition to this we must take into account the level of the monster, indicated by the already mentioned color code which indicates the power of monsters and objects, and we must consider the resistances which force the player to consider a double specialization with powerful magic to hold in Serbian as an ace in the hole. Ace that can be rather ineffective if the enemy faced is of too high a level compared to ours and therefore has the possibility of often resisting our spells. Furthermore, the lack of automatic life regeneration requires careful management of healing potions and, combined with the reset of the mobs after an excessive escape, limits the extreme and not very credible guerrilla techniques (the infamous kiting). This is still possible, however, since mobs do not regenerate lost health when disengaged from the character. In addition, the magician has a healing spell that simplifies things considerably even if in the middle of the battle it is not easy to use. In any case, to further increase the degree of difficulty there is also a pinch of automatic aim applied to enemies' ranged attacks. Whirlwinds, fireballs and even the special shots of the bosses veer slightly towards the direction in which we move, forcing us to use the somersault with perfect timing. Targeting is contextual to the situation and camera and not always very precise but fluid and ~skilled~ gameplay is still possible by becoming familiar with the view which, despite zoom and automatic routines, must always be controlled by the player. Unfortunately, sometimes the enemies nail themselves on their own probably due to bugs in the artificial intelligence code. But these are problems easily fixed with a patch. To all this is also added the element of fate, a key plot point and a mysterious force that charges itselffighting and which, through the judgment mode, can be used to shape the destiny of the player with lots of bonuses to unlock. The aforementioned judgment mode can be activated by clicking the pad triggers when the fate bar is full. In this way time slows down, the character becomes more powerful and the final moves become automatically accessible since they are necessary to definitively absorb fate. It is a very useful tool that allows you to easily defeat even bosses that are theoretically out of reach for the player's level. Among other things, the final moves, even when not linked to fate, allow you to earn up to double the experience points from the defeated monster through a quick time event that asks us to quickly press one of the four main keys on the pad. Obviously in the case of final mobs the gain can become quite substantial and significantly influence the speed with which the character levels up. Not just barrel There are only nine generic skills but they perform multiple functions and cover all imaginable eventualities in an RPG starting from the reduction of the bribe in order not to be arrested by the guards up to the creation of gems. For example, the Forge skill allows you to find materials, improve the repair of equipment and create weapons and armor. Commerce, on the other hand, allows you to recover money by breaking objects, to improve the prices of traders and to sell stolen goods. The Burglary is predictably the least extensive skill with nodal points that activate the automatic opening of locks without having to switch from a Skyrim-style minigame. The skills then shape various quests, allowing us to save money and time when potions or objects are needed. Obviously it is always possible to embark on the classic quests that allow us to gain the favor of a player and which are often containers of rather useful objects as well as experience points. Alternatively there is then the path of tough men who love to grind experience killing monsters non-stop. In fact, the killed creatures reappear after a while but the feeling is that random encounters hardly give high-level weapons or armor. Alchemy is very useful given the relevance of healing and boosting potions during some particularly difficult fights. The skill works in the classic way with reagents scattered around the world and formulas to learn. Among the recipes there is also the one to increase the skills that allows you to temporarily acquire superior creation skills. For the creation of objects, on the other hand, neither minerals nor percentages are needed. The ingredients are found in loot or by disassembling found objects and sometimes a special element is needed as in the case of Fae blades. Instead of enchantments, the title includes a Diablo-style gem system; in fact, the objects, which follow a color code similar to the Blizzard title, are almost always enchanted and include one or more receipts. In addition to considering the upgrades, the player must therefore consider the gems he has available and the number of slots for the objects to evaluate their actual potential. These can have quite powerful effects capable of modifying the gameplay such as absorbing the opponent's life which allows you to save life and regeneration potions. Also in this case the skills obviously allow you to increase the upgrades but, unlike Diablo it is not possible to improvise jewelers and, as for the creation of objects, a workbench of the Arte Savia is needed to combine the fragments and create usable gems. Among other things, the weight does not exist but the inventory is limited in a generic way to 70 spaces and can be increased by purchasing special backpacks. The ingredients cannot be tasted a la Skyrim but the title allows you to experiment to discover the recipes without having to find them. In short, rather articulated even if more videogame in a coherent way with the gameplay and the action structure. The same goes for theft which is exclusively based on the number of people in a room which raises the percentage of difficulty. Among other things, this is written directly on the objects we are about to steal. Obviously theft is a crime as is the assassination but the latter can only be accomplished by activating the aggressive mode except in specific cases where the quest activates a fight situation. You will therefore not be able to accidentally kill your best friend and also slaughtering a hen will not make you the number one enemy in the world. Always in the name of simplicity, the respec with the fate weavers is immediately available who, for a fee, can reset our skills", "date": "2012-02-07", "grade": "8.7"}
