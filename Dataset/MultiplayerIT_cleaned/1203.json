Or maybe not, since there is a complex balance to be made of the many positive points and the few, but heavy, negative elements: in any case, the Tiny Digital Factory game fits into a rather fruitful niche for mobile games , which offers ample room for expansion and the possibility of appealing to a very varied audience. The game is clearly structured on the Motorsport Manager model, which is in fact an excellent starting point given the results achieved by Playsport Games, drawing practically all the basic characteristics and modifying some aspects relating to the interface, as well as obviously introducing the covered wheel cars, where other titles are based on Formula One (and similar categories). GT Manager allows you to follow the races more or less closely, with good graphic detail To better understand what we are talking about, we refer you to the reviews of Motorsport Manager Online and above all of the excellent Motorsport Manager Mobile 2, which still remains at a decidedly high quality level even compared to the new derivations of this genre. The game mechanics are substantially the same as the two Playsport Games titles in question and for this reason GT Manager can only appear derivative, but if nothing else it really starts from an excellent base, proposing it largely intact. The problem, more or less as also happened in the Online chapter of the reference series, all derives from the free-to-play monetization model, which decisively distorts the trend by clearly pushing towards micro-transactions, unless we want undergo drastic interruptions in the pace of the game, which can be detrimental to what should be the natural progression of a title like this. On and off the track The elements to keep under control in GT Manager are never too many, but enough to keep you on your toes and glued to the screen for the duration of the races, the result of a good job of simplification and dynamism applied on the basis of the broader and more complex managerial ones. The result is a game that is perfectly suited to mobile use from an interface point of view and that does not scare novices or those who are not exactly engine fanatics, and these are undoubtedly positive characteristics of the game. All this streamlining and reworking of the managerial dynamics derive directly from what we have seen in the other titles mentioned, from which GT Manager takes full advantage but it must be said that it also applies perfectly, as regards the game mechanics during and outside the races . Another factor in favor is the presence of various official licenses which significantly increase involvement, between truly existing races and the presence of various major brands in the world of GT racing such as Porsche, Mercedes, McLaren, Nissan, Corvette, Audi and Alpine. with convincingly reproduced vehicles. The more purely managerial part of GT Manager sees us act on cars, drivers and sponsors using bonus cards The management part sees us train drivers, develop and improve the cars from a technical point of view and take care of the commercial aspect of the team, dealing with sponsors and basic finance management. A large part of the bonuses and advancements are linked to the application of cards that act as modifiers and are won by winning races, but they can obviously also be purchased separately through in-app purchases, from which obviously the best and rarest elements emerge. The phase of the race is the one closest to the Motorsport Managers and sees us indirectly controlling the progress of the race through simple but effective controls: obviously it is not a question of driving the car, but of indicating to the driver how to behave by gradually selecting one option among three different speed levels, paying attention to the preservation of the engine and tyres, using three acceleration ~boosts~ for the most difficult overtaking and choosing when to stop at the pit stop to change tires and refuel. GT Manager cars are taken from reality, thanks to important official licenses It is a simple and fully functional mechanism, capable of giving a certain satisfaction even to those who are not particularly expert in the genre in question or in racing in general. Also noteworthy is the good appearance of the 3D graphics during the races, with close-up shots that enhance the details of the cars. GT Manager's biggest problem, and it's no small matter, is all in its micro-transaction system: there is obviously something to keep in mindyou that the rarest and most important cards are obtained almost exclusively through in-app purchases, furthermore the game imposes an earnings cap for each game which effectively prevents progress beyond a certain time limit, forcing you to unlock the cap with a purchase or simply wait for the stop to be removed after a few hours. Considering how the whole game is set on constant progression, such a mechanism breaks the rhythm and tends to distance rather than involve more. The other not exactly insignificant problem are the bugs: the game tends to get stuck in some situations with no possibility of advancing except by restarting the software, at least depending on the configurations. On a Samsung Galaxy S8 it was not possible to proceed within the tutorial, while no problems were found on the iPad, so these are clearly bugs that will be resolved through upcoming updates. In GT Manager, pit stops need to be carefully studied", "date": "2021-05-06", "grade": "6.8"}
