Free is beautiful, they say, and although Microsoft's service is paid for, as it should be, it is undeniable that being able to download every production in the catalog with extreme freedom, without ever further putting a hand in the wallet, incentives and not a little desire to experiment and to give a chance to proposals that otherwise we would never, ever have considered. The review of Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan will make you understand that this game fits perfectly into this case, being an RPG with platform sections released in the now distant 2021, recently rediscovered thanks to its inclusion in the Xbox Game Pass catalog. event that gave the right visibility to an undeniably intriguing and charismatic title. Precisely for this reason we wanted to play it lunge, so as to give you an opinion on the type of experience offered to warn all lovers of the genre and looking for something bizarre, colorful, original in its own way. Happy creatures and existential dramas Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan immediately captivates with its highly sought-after art design Billy lives on an island with bright colors, inhabited by cute and very sweet little animals who are always enthusiastic about having a chat and organizing some party that includes the launch of fireworks. After yet another festive anniversary, however, the dreaded Leviathan, who lay dormant on the ocean floor, wakes up abruptly, deciding that the time has come to steal the colors of this dream world, an authentic protective shell hitherto immaculate in which the protagonist and his friends had sheltered from an external and damned real world. A world which, according to the menacing words of the Leviathan, exists somewhere and suffocates those who live there with problems and responsibilities of all kinds. Pursuing his escapist nature, Billy is immediately committed to restoring order and vivacity to his world, traveling from island to island, aboard a talking boat, to free the little animals subjugated by the overbearing Leviathan and restore joy and happiness a little everywhere. This is how the islands of Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan appear before the protagonist returns the color to the scenery Although it is immediately clear that under the skin of what appears to be the plot of a product for very young people, there is actually something much deeper, and at times disturbing, Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan holds up the screenplay for almost entirety of the adventure, allowing a glimpse of a second level of reading only from time to time. Although the most shrewd players, looking for something more mature, may not appreciate the global narrative approach, the indisputable skills must be recognized when tested of the screenwriters of ManaVoid Entertainment capable of crafting an epic that offers two completely self-sufficient interpretative keys and perfectly addressed to two specific targets, one more naive and interested in the adventures of Billy and his team, the other more shrewd and capable of understanding and understand the underlying drama that is actually consumed. Rhetorical battles From the beginning of the adventure, you will be accompanied by a sort of talking fishing rod, one of the nicest and best characterized characters in Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan After all, the drama, the emotional shocks, the psychological blocks and the traumas of all kinds, are the lifeblood that feeds the gameplay of Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan, which is based on non-violent battles along the lines of those at which it was possible to take part in the never too praised Undertale, a bizarre RPG that allowed you to fight with well-placed observations and compliments calibrated to the millimeter. The weak exploratory phases on board the ship mentioned above, in fact, represent a small part of the whole. Once you have reached the island on duty, it will mostly be a matter of solving some simple environmental puzzles to clear your way up to the treasure chest, the collectible, the creature to ~fight~ on duty. Nothing particularly complex or original, even here, yet these puzzles still have the great advantage of keeping interest alive and stimulating progression both to discover yet another challenge conceived by the developers and to obtain the inevitable reward. When the clash becomes snowtable, however, Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan turns into a bizarre RPG. Instead of special attacks, choreographic moves, powerful spells, ours, first of all, will have to understand the problem, the discomfort, the paranoia that grips the opponent simply, and literally, by speaking to us. By encouraging and urging him, choosing the most appropriate response based on the character of the little monster, you will gradually discover the colors necessary to ~beat~ him, that is, to bring him back to reason, snatching him from the dullness in which he was forced by the powerful Leviathan. The excessive joy of all the characters in Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan soon becomes unnerving To return the colors, thus going on the attack after the inevitable study phase, you will have to deploy the same creatures who, once freed from the yoke of the enemy, will decide to follow Billy in his epic. At least three colors are combined with each of them and to unleash the maximum of their power, at each turn, at each move, you will have to overcome a specific mini-game. Most of the time you will have to press a combination of buttons with the right timing, others you will rely on your quick reflexes to win at the slot machine. Although the idea at first may appear innovative and interesting, the repetitiveness of these small tests in the long run ends up weighing down each battle, otherwise quite enjoyable between initial dialogues, countermoves to fill Billy's morale bar, or his ~life~ , and multipliers to be activated by playing one or more creatures for your money in combination. In any case, fans of the genre will be attracted more by the style of the combat system than by the actual repercussions in terms of depth and potential. Even during the much more demanding and prolonged boss fights, we are not witnesses of who knows what variations to the gameplay, although the greater attention and dedication required in these phases motivate enough to be seized by the desire to reach yet another super villain to defeat with flattery and colors to launch. Here is the ~battle~ field of Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviathan Ultimately, in short, the gameplay holds up quite well for all the fifteen hours necessary to reach the end credits, thanks to the sum of the parts. The platforming stages bother you from time to time due to an imperfect camera, but the puzzles you will have to face are stimulating enough. The fights are based on repetitive mini-games, but it is still intriguing to dialogue with enemies to defeat them, as well as devising effective counter-offensives to counter Billy's progressive lowering of morale. In the same way, it is fun to return to the talking boat to gradually enhance your team, giving each little creature the collectibles collected around, a practice that will unlock new colors and therefore new techniques that can be used in battle. As if that weren't enough, Rainbow Billy: The Course of the Leviatan sports a peculiar and well-kept artistic sector. Bright colours, rounded shapes and backgrounds separated by sharp strokes combine to create a sort of interactive cartoon. Not everyone will like the style adopted, but it certainly cannot be denied that it has character, nor that the graphics sector is not studied in every detail.", "date": "2023-01-16", "grade": "7.5"}
