{"name": "Elex 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/elex-2-recensione.html", "text": "Many years have passed since the end of the war against the hybrids and Jax, the hero of the first episode, has retired to live as a kind of hermit. Unfortunately, a new threat looms from the sky ... and ends right above his house (when fortune telling). Suddenly finding himself without a roof over his head, without the equipment accumulated in his previous adventures and hunted by strange creatures, the skyhands, who have also contaminated him, our hero must first find a refuge, then begin his long travel the world of Magalan, looking for allies to fight the new threat, in a long race against time and against creatures that will do anything to kill him. Is it worth taking part in his adventure? Let's find out in the Elex 2 review. From the begining The game world is vast and impervious Jax is no longer the character known at the end of the first episode. The years of solitude have weakened him, bringing him back to the first level (to put it in game terms). The difference compared to the beginning of the previous adventure is that now he has a name to spend, that is, many remember him as the hero who saved the world, which is no small thing when you go around asking for help from practically everyone. Unfortunately, for the rest there is little to do: you have to start from scratch. So you have to accumulate experience to distribute points on the various attributes: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence and acumen, which affect the usable equipment, dialogues and skills. The latter, as happens in practically all Piranha Bytes games, can only be learned from the various teachers scattered around Magalan, all of which are very expensive. Of course, it is not possible to acquire all the skills available, because you have a limited amount of learning points to invest. In this way, character development becomes truly personal and opens up the possibility of replaying the entire adventure several times, naturally choosing a completely different progression. The factions Elex 2 mixes fantasy and science fiction Another hallmark of Piranha Bytes is the lack of real classes. Jax's specialization is in fact decided by the attributes and skills developed, as well as by the chosen faction. The latter give access to advanced skills and specific equipment, as well as special missions. If you wish, you can decide to remain independent, but joining one of the factions undoubtedly gives advantages and in some ways makes the game more interesting, as well as facilitating it in the final stages. In all, Magalan is populated by five factions, which live in close contact with each other, so much so that they have economic and commercial relations: the Berserkers, to which Caja belongs, Jax's ex-girlfriend with whom he had a son, who are substantially of fantasy-style warrior mages; the Dawns, Jax's home faction, who have learned to harness the Elex like no other to enhance his gear and to unlock mind powers; the Morkons, warriors who invoke the help of a brutal god to become stronger in combat and who have lived underground, in a maze of tunnels, practically since the meteor struck Magalan; the Outlaws, still active despite being overwhelmed by the Berserkers, make a living by creating drugs that empower them in every aspect; finally the Clerics, a religious and ultra-technological faction, which uses the Elex to enhance its war machines. Note that Jax can only join the Outlaws or Clerics if he has reached level 20 within another faction (in order: the Morkons and the Dawns). Consider that each faction makes the game play slightly different, especially in anticipation of one of the endings (there are several, all related to the choices made during the game). Be that as it may, the main objective of the entire adventure is to create a force that will counter the new alien enemies, bringing it together in an outpost led by an old acquaintance from the first chapter. Progression and open world Elex 2 also has some interesting landscapes If you haven't already figured it out, Elex 2 is an open world action RPG, where you have to sweat everything, especially at the beginning. Put bluntly, it's a classic Piranha Bytes game, with the difficulty curve starting off steep and then becoming more mellow towards the second half of the game. It has been like this since the days of Gothic and for those who assiduously follow the works of the German studio, this type of experience structuring is only one of its signatures. He simply loves to make the player sweat for several hours, and then give him the satisfaction of being able to retrace his steps solvingsell all that he had left pending and face those enemies who previously seemed unbeatable on an equal footing, also guaranteeing them ever greater freedom of exploration and movement. Some may find the beginning a bit too brutal, almost survival-like, but usually this is exactly what players who loved Gothic, Risen and the first Elex ask for: they want to decode the game world step by step, to then dominate it with experience and acquired power. They want to savor it slowly, even be overwhelmed by it, to then experience the joy of being able to overcome the challenge proposed by encounters of ever-increasing difficulty and missions that allow you to discover more and more secrets of a map that can hold surprises around every corner. Of course, the sense of disorientation felt by some may be understandable, as are the criticisms of a certain basic roughness of the accessory elements, but in general those who approach Elex 2 aware of its philosophy will hardly have to complain about the progression. After all, the inspiration is that of classic role-playing games, from which Piranha Bytes has never wanted to completely detach itself. So at first Jax risks getting slapped by everyone. Exploration is slow, because you have to be careful where you go, trying not to end up in the arms of some wandering troll, some particularly nervous cyclops, or even just a raptor hunting for food. Starting gear is only enough to take down a few giant mice or mutant mosquitoes. For the most dangerous opponents, a metal tube or a makeshift bow will not be enough, but perhaps you will need to learn how to handle an Elex rifle or a large war hammer. The problem is that each weapon has precise prerequisites in terms of attributes in order to be used, so the equipment ends up following the progression of the character step by step, which must also be chosen based on the type of weapon to be used. For example, heavy weapons are related to strength and toughness, bows to strength and dexterity, and so on. You will therefore understand that the choices relating to Jax's growth are not trivial and affect many different systems, creating a considerable sense of satisfaction when you finally begin to see the first results. The game world itself is a large patchwork of biomes, each tied to a specific faction. As always Piranha Bytes has managed to create a rugged and very varied map, built both horizontally and vertically, made up of snowy areas, steep mountains, ruined laboratories, buildings placed on impervious rock ridges, impregnable fortresses and so on . The main storyline is pretty dull The return of the jetpack guarantees the possibility of exploring the various environments in practically any direction, especially after having improved it so as to have superior performance in terms of autonomy and resistance. Just the jetpack becomes the most precious of allies in the second half of the game, when you begin to be able to go almost anywhere without the risk of being mowed down in an instant. It also gives a deep sense of freedom, difficult to experience in other open worlds, to which the construction of the map contributes, full of little secrets to be discovered and things to do, including special objects, hidden areas and small narrative inserts, completely unexpected times, placed in unthinkable places. In essence, Magalan is a dense place that invites the player to explore as much as possible, avoiding shortcuts like the too many placeholders that characterize modern open worlds. As you should have understood, from this point of view the vision of Piranha Bytes is still the same and still revolves around the principles first applied in Gothic. Storytelling What will he hide? In terms of storytelling, Elex 2 is the classic game from the German studio. So don't expect refined dialogues or who knows what you find at the level of the script. Jax is the typical grumpy and determined alpha male, who relates to others in an often very abrupt way, while maintaining a certain ethics. The side characters all have their own stories to tell, sometimes accompanied by side quests to play. Some it is even possible to hire them as travel companions, first carrying out their personal missions to win their trust. The missions are the core of the gaming experience. The main one is quite trivial and serves above all as a pivot for the whole adventure, even if towards the end it turns out to be more interesting than expected, while there are some very interesting secondary ones (but also the classic fetch quests... unfortunately they never fail ), which help not only adaccumulate experience, but also to discover social and political aspects of Magalan, between the recriminations of the clerics, the underground movements of the outlaws, the difficulties of the berserkers and so on. Flying is the best part of the game Peculiar how the philosophy of progression is also reflected in the missions, with some which, although obtained by visiting the first inhabited areas encountered at the beginning of the adventure, can only be carried out after dozens of hours, that is, when a character is available adequate. For a change, even the dialogues are handled in a very classic way: multiple choice, with more options available depending on the attributes developed. Piranha Bytes has never shone in storytelling, but it is definitely good at creating living and pulsating worlds, full not only of monsters, but also of places capable of telling who lives there. Difficult to ask for much more, since a stronger narrative would probably end up breaking the gameplay too much, making it lose its fulcrum, i.e. freedom. Problems Elex II is not a game without problems, first of all the technical ones. The version of the game we tested is full of graphical glitches and performance drops, especially in densely populated areas. Here it is not uncommon to see the shadows flash, the non-player characters lose parts (the heads in particular), or witness sudden drops in the framerate, for reasons that are not well defined, or short freezes of the action for loading new graphic resources. Fortunately, the game never crashed, so we can still define it as stable, but the hope is that some patches will come out soon to fix the graphic problems, making the experience more consistent from this point of view. If glitches and graphic bugs, while annoying, are still tolerable, less justifiable is the artificial intelligence of the enemies, which is quite primitive. Basically, enemies attack Jax head on, looking for the quickest route to reach him. The problem is that in some cases they literally stand inert, even when all hell has broken loose near them. For example, we happened to attack an outlaw camp and see the furthest guards (we're talking about a few meters, in game terms) remain impassive in the face of the massacre of their comrades, and then react immediately when we get close. In other cases we've shot explosive canisters from range inside a camp and seen the survivors not flinch. That is, they searched the surrounding area for a few seconds (but for like ten seconds), and then went back to their activities as if nothing had happened, standing among the still fresh corpses. When dealing with single opponents or small groups the AI issues are less apparent, but when dealing with large groups, they become quite apparent.", "date": "2022-02-28", "grade": "7.8"}
