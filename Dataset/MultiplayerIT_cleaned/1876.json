{"name": "Red Card Soccer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-card-soccer.html", "text": "Red Card Shaolin... Take a title like Soccer Slam, skim it from its fantasy component, dress it in the beauty of 22 real players on a green field and add the grotesque madness of Shaolin Soccer, the result should come close enough to this Red Card Soccer. A title where the first rule is absolute and declared belligerence. If there were to exist referee rules coined for the occasion, the first would read: no intervention is punishable with a foul and relative admonition if exercised in order to end the opponent's life. Red Card Soccer, unlike what the title suggests, rarely punishes bone-breaking entries with expulsion (unless you set up the refereeing like Byron Moreno), it is precisely clean or simple tackles that are sanctioned, often with adding the tag. So, to get away with it and enjoy the gameplay, it is better to marry the cause of the double flying kick on the kidneys, the punch on the jaw or an always effective pure strangulation to stop the winger flying towards the cross. There are four modes available, Final Mode for a 32-team tournament, World Conquest with over 50 national teams, the inevitable friendly and the customizable tournament. The acquired licenses allow you to have all the real players available who also show off their name printed on the shirts. With this hint, we introduce the technical component of Red Card Soccer which, although it was not expected as a title capable of setting quality standards, behaves very well. The overall feeling is solid, satisfying. Well reconstructed and real stadiums such as Yokohama, Daegu and Saitama (and other absolutely fantasy ones that belong to the ~unlocking~ sphere), the polygonal models of the players are well animated and show off convincing expressions with particularly massive muscles (sometimes even too much but given the violent matrix of the game, this is a choice to exude aggression directly at first glance even if this, at times, is to the detriment of the similarity with the real counterparts). What this title excels at is the absolute showmanship inherent in the surreal animations. Relying on an intuitive control system and halfway between an arcade and a simulation that remains careful to keep a line faithful to football tactics, things are done that elicit smiles and laughs nine times out of ten. In Red Card Soccer, a sudden acceleration on the wing is accompanied by a blaze that burns the grass below, the cross sees two players pounce on the ball in Holly & Benji-style splits to hit it together with a spin-shot combo as well as , often, the action stops, the penalty area lights up, the camera zooms in showing the attacker taking the shot of the century (all in slow motion in the style of Matrix Bullet Time), the ball catches fire spinning towards the goalkeeper, incinerating him and piercing the net. The same animations of the ~foul killers~ sector are beautifully grotesque and arouse hilarity. Paradoxically, this violent freedom of intervention opens up a completely new gameplay scenario, so if the man escapes and flies towards the goal, thoughts don't go to recovering the ball but to the most spectacular way to shoot it down. To escape your fate (ie multiple fractures), it is possible to perform through the B key combined with the analog stick, a series of dribbles, double steps and high school ~numbers~, in order to keep your ankles and advance towards he carries it simply and spectacularly. All this, if tried in multiplayer, represents one of the most enjoyable experiences ever. Despite having a clear surreal connotation, Red Card Soccer also has a good and faithful football dynamic. This means that it is possible to score and good actions can be created with spectacular saves in a fluid and linear way according to the trappings of the purest tactics. A nice crossover. From the sound point of view, the effects, the screams and the background sounds are of a good level but the completeness of the sector is devastated by the inevitable, chilling commentary carried out in the Italian localization. An apathetic comment that the famous Stefano Tacconi, goalkeeper of Platini's Juevntus in the 1980s, also flaunts (we don't know with how much pride) who, joke after joke, doesn't get a subjunctive right even under torture. To be reported for aggravated injuries to the Italian language. Comment RCS can be a nice surprise for anyone looking for a title to offer to the multiplayer gods. The whole approccio is conveyed towards usability in good company, also because, despite several tournaments to be completed, the possibility of upgrading one's team and various secrets to unlock (from stadiums to absurd teams made up of dolphins and the like), the single mode tends to get bored soon enough, failing to fully enjoy the irony and taking advantage of an AI that can't compete with the healthy wickedness of your friend. It remains an ~alternative~ game to try and discover pleasantly. A good title of easy consumption and immediate playability. Pros: Immediate and fun Excellent in multiplayer Solid and well-made graphics Cons: Terrible commentary In single it can tire quickly It is well known that any Italian has dreamed in his adolescence of being able to wear the colors of his favorite team one day, hear a stadium with 80,000 people shouting his name, score the decisive goal in the Champions Cup final and when Striscia la Notizia and Passaparola exist, reap victims among letters and assorted tissue papers. Hardly anyone succeeds but the flame of the ball continues to burn, until retirement and beyond. It must also be said that not everyone can be a Maldini, a Totti or a Del Piero, there are also the vintage Gattusos and Pasquale Brunos. Red Card Soccer can be presented as the game capable of awakening the little ~gennarino~ latent in you by pushing you beyond the lawful. If you prefer a healthy entry with feet together on the malleolus to the touch of fine and the arched parables, it is appropriate to continue reading.", "date": "2002-12-13", "grade": null}
