If you too think of going there to track down Lucifer, we must warn you that we are talking about a video game, the first Black Mirror - in the English woods you would only find Tagliaferri and Pierpaolo performing rites for hair regrowth. In the world of fiction however, after twelve years, behind the mask of everyday life in the Anglo-Saxon village, the ghosts of the past are still stirring. And Darren will have to reveal them, a boy from Boston who is spending the holidays in Biddeford, Maine, a guest of his mother and hired for the summer months by a local photographer. Troubles for him begin the day a beautiful girl named Angelina shows up at the shop door. From that moment our hero will no longer be able to escape his destiny. These are the premises of Black Mirror 2, an adventure with a consistent but too dilated narrative basis. Every time the heart races after a twist (and there are many) the game slows down and loses its rhythm. It's like a spoonful of chocolate spread on a mile-long slice of bread. When you finally come face to face with the horror, the memories of your time in Maine will be far away. The supporting characters are mostly stereotypes of their respective roles, but they fit well into the story and at least incite action. Unfortunately they are also pedantic, ready to discuss any detail, with exchanges that needed to be reduced to lighten the dialogue. If only life were that easy Black Mirror II does not spare corrosive barbs on current issues, from the war in Iraq to the bigoted hypocrisy of the American (Western?) bourgeoisie. If only Darren didn't always have the same register, whether he is addressing the police chief or having to convince a maniac not to kill him, his irony would be more believable. But it's not just the story. The game abounds in puzzles, pleasant and intriguing in mechanics. Some involve a different interaction than the classic manipulation of objects, such as in the case where a pick tool needs to adapt to a lock. Unfortunately, the game always gives us unsolicited hints. It makes you want to say ~ok, thanks for the help, but if you gave me a minute I'd get there by myself~. They are aids that diminish the player's commitment, and the risk of switching from video game to video and that's it, is real. This happens because they wanted to make a simple game for everyone, a commendable intention but got out of hand by the developers. To help the less experienced, the new options were enough, such as the two difficulty levels, the diary that is updated with the objectives, and a button to access the suggestions. Even the hot-spots, identifiable with a key, disappear from the screen when they are no longer needed. An element that has not been seen for a decade in the adventures is the death of the protagonist, even if the automatic save that precedes the critical moments helps to get out of the impasse early. Even the mind wants its part The developers of Cranberry Production have focused on the visual impact, improving the graphics seen at the time of the first Black Mirror. The color palette is enriched with yellows and oranges in the sunny Maine town and then turns towards dark and dull colors for the Willow Creek village, perfectly interpreting the mood changes of the game. There are also effects such as rain and the flight of birds that embellish the beautiful game screens, among other things very numerous. Too bad for the animations of the people, woody and hinted, which degrade the performance of the splitters, who don't shine for the beauty of the vocal timbre, but at least they are committed to the interpretation. The Italian translation, on the other hand, is accurate and well executed. Even the music has a dramatic trend with frightening peaks of intensity, although it follows a score that does not take into account what is happening on the screen at that moment. However, occasionally we were lucky, and a sharp piano note pierced moments of horror, making us feel a shiver of anguish. We understand that the developers have what it takes to create beautiful adventures, and the ending suggests that there will be a third episode after Black Mirror 2. We therefore hope that in addition to the graphics, they will also strive to make better use of all the good narrative material they have, leaving the player the burden of solving alone the many puzzles that dot the way.", "date": "2010-08-13", "grade": "7.0"}
