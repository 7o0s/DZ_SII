{"name": "Il bello del petrolio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90714-feed-me-oil-il-bello-del-petrolio.html", "text": "Among the most important publishers in the iOS field, and precisely for this reason that Chillingo has been under the protective wing of EA for a few months, boasts a curriculum made up of titles generally sold at very attractive prices and characterized by qualitative values often above average, i.e. the ideal mix for a successful game on Apple devices: let's see if this happy tradition is destined to continue with the present Feed Me Oil... Oil there At first glance, Feed Me Oil might look like a World of Goo clone, mainly due to the graphic style adopted: in reality, the playful mechanics of the Chillingo product are closer to a classic of iPhone gaming like Enigmo. The aim of the user is therefore to exploit a given set of tools to guide the flow of oil from the starting pipe to the arrival position. What is striking about Feed Me Oil is above all the setting and in particular the conformation of the tanks into which to pour the black liquid: the objective is in fact always made up of one or more cavities of structures that look like large and immobile monsters, complete with eyes that dynamically follow the path taken by the player. Also noteworthy is the commitment made by the developers as regards level design: with the exception of the very first acclimatization stages, we always find ourselves faced with well-conceived and decidedly different situations, which precisely because of their heterogeneity do not never allow the user to sit on his laurels, on the contrary constantly pushing him to reflect on what to do. The good variety of tools made available to carry out the canalization work also contributes to this purpose: in addition to the more classic platforms, there are therefore rotating blades, fans, windmills and so on. Feed Me Oil rewards with particularly high scores those who manage to complete a level quickly and using the least possible number of elements, an aspect that proves to be a good incentive for replayability and at the same time the only significant defect of the production Chillingo: the solution to the puzzles is in fact one and only one, and initiatives other than the one envisaged can only lead to tragic failures or to the achievement of reduced scores. It goes without saying that this cuts off the player's spirit of inventiveness a little, and consequently can push him to use suggestions excessively, causing the game to lose much of its appeal - as well as its longevity - along the way. From a strictly technical point of view, however, Feed Me Oil does an impeccable job. Graphically, as mentioned above, the title sports a particular, colorful and certainly pleasant style, with the icing on the cake consisting of the correct application of physics to the movements of the liquid on the screen. An excellent job has also been done for what concerns the interface and the control system, with the first being minimalist but efficient at the same time and the second that shines for its precision and intuitiveness: a slide is enough to take a tool from the inventory and place it wherever you want, then use the appropriate indicators to rotate it as you like. Dulcis in fundo, Feed Me Oil is available at a very attractive price, paying which you take home three chapters for a total of fifty levels, plus a handful of bonus stages and a section intended for future downloadable content.
