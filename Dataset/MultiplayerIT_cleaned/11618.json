{"name": "Fifa Street 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-street-3-recensione.html", "text": "A sort of football Space Jam The experience gained by Electronic Arts in football games is now enormous and decennial, however EA Big, the ~rib~ of EA Sports that deals with the most spectacular and choreographic series (such as the SSX snowboard), has decided a decisive change of en route to try and freshen up his world-famous Fifa Street brand. As soon as the game disc is inserted, it is immediately clear in which direction their work has gone. Since its first incarnation, FIFA Street has represented the essence of football entertainment: feints, acrobatics, unstoppable dribbles and overhead kicks are its strong point, leaving aside the tactics and excessive reasoning of the ~classic~ football of FIFA08. The matches take place everywhere: on the street, in a garden, in a parking lot, as if to reaffirm that the fun can be enjoyed wherever and whenever you want, five players against five others like in five-a-side football, without fouls, throw-ins and game interruptions. game (except in the rare cases where the ball goes beyond the boundaries of the field). The spectacularization of the actions has been even more emphasized and deliberately exaggerated: now Fifa Street 3 players perform athletic gestures worthy of the best Neo in the Matrix, jumping on the edges of the walls and performing half rotations in the air to turn around faster. In fact, the whole game is not to be taken as a simulation, but as a football parody thrust that has the sole objective of enhancing the player and entertaining him, without frills or useless waste of time. The game controls are taken following those of FIFA08, with some due modifications. The Y button, which has always been used for through balls, makes little sense in a pitch a few meters long, so it has been used as a button to make dribbles, while with X you make quick passes to allow your teammates to hit the ball. ball in the most spectacular ways, while with A you pass the ball normally. By holding down the shot button, however, we see our player loading the shot with a sort of slow motion: in this case timing is fundamental. Holding the button too long means sending the ball over the crossbar, doing it too little instead starts a weak and weak shot. In defense there are two shots to try to steal the ball from the opponent, one of which is harder and more decisive. The game system closely resembles that of Mario Strikers, where we were required to constantly be in marking by continuously pressing the key to steal the ball, in the hope of making a mistake and regaining possession of the game. You can use the pressing button or the decisive tackle button, which however in case of missing contact will make us lose a few precious seconds allowing the opponent to escape us and go to the net. Just like in the Nintendo title, a ~Super~ system has been inserted: by making dribbles and moves with the right analog stick (perhaps combined with LB which allows you to stop the ball on the ground), a bar placed at the top is progressively loaded. Once filled, it is possible to activate the ~Gamebreaker~, a mode that allows us to play with fluency, shoot more powerfully and precisely and give more chances of success to our defensive interventions. The color of the screen turns to a light blue, the passes are emphasized by a luminous trail and it is much easier for one of our shots to go straight into the net, a bit like it also happened in NBA Jam. The game system closely resembles that of Mario Strikers The ~exaltation~ key therefore makes everything easier and even more spectacular, but it must be used at the right time, as the bar will discharge very quickly once activated. The bar, once filled with yellow, must be ~fixed~ in blue so that it does not decrease when we lose possession of the ball: to do this, simply take any shot, even outside the goal. This ~Super~ system, apparently innovative and fun for a football game, however hides some shortcomings mainly due to two aspects. The first is that to fill the yellow bar you just need to stay in defense by feinting until an opposing player comes and presses us, after which you pass the ball to a nearby teammate and continue to perform tricks freely. The second aspect is that, once you have reached a satisfactory level on the bar, just press the shot button to fix it in blue and then use the Gamebreaker. Two simple expedients would have been enough to not make the use of this idea so trivial and simple: to increase the bar only by feinting in attack and to fix it in blue with a shot on goal, rather than any one. Once you understand the mechanism, the single modeFifa Street player loses a lot of bite, folding back on itself in a forced vortex of Gamebreaker-shooting sequences. Basically you don't play football anymore but you spend all your time playing feints in defense to activate as many ~Supers~ as possible. The Fifa Street ~package~ is as usual very well finished and cared for. The graphic style has changed, first of all, veering from the search for realism to cartoon-style caricature, with strong colors, plastic animations and an effect on the players almost similar to cel shading. The game menu and the general design are totally inspired by Brazil, from the fonts used for the writing to the backgrounds that are very reminiscent of the classic colored and painted walls of Rio de Janeiro. You can choose from numerous formations, both of current and historical players such as Zico, Voller, Bruno Conti and Baresi, with the possibility of changing roles, positions, and choosing from the squad available for each team. The game environments are skyscrapers, Brazilian suburbs, a Japanese technology district and beaches, with seven courses in total, with the future possibility of downloading new ones through online services. The single player game consists of facing a series of matches, tests and challenges in sequence, to be unlocked one at a time. The matches are classic matches that we have to win by overcoming the opponent in the score. There are also time trials, in which we have to score the highest number of goals, but also particular challenges, such as the one where we are called to score 5 goals in acrobatics to win, these without time limits. You can choose from numerous squads of players, both current and historical such as Zico, Voller, Bruno Conti and Baresi Each of these events is grouped into a sub-category which can be viewed from the menus. The CPU AI is somewhat bizarre to judge, as it mostly appears random. Many shots go to the net with disarming ease, even from long distances, while other more powerful and close-up shots are easily parried by the goalkeeper. There is therefore no better method or technique for scoring, but only fate and the internal decisions of the CPU, a factor that in the long run could annoy someone, especially during the sweatiest and most agitated matches. The learning curve is very short and a few hours will be enough to reach sufficient skill to win any match, a factor that further contributes to shorten the longevity of the game. The heart of Fifa Street, however, remains as always the multiplayer, both live and over the network in ranked matches or custom matches. Watch out for the pitch! Fifa Street 3 is programmed using the NBA Street Homecourt graphics engine, which guarantees 60 fps as solid as concrete and still good detail: the various game stages are painstakingly finished and decorated, while not counting on a frightening polygonal mass . The stylistic work is therefore valuable at all levels, both as regards the general look and for the design, and finally also the graphics themselves ingame. The element that surprises the most are certainly the animations, worthy of a real cartoon. Each player has many, and some are customized based on who we are using. Despite the quantity they are always well ~linked~ to each other without any discontinuity effect that causes shots or unrealistic effects. The soundtrack, as per Electronic Arts tradition, is once again full of songs and artists such as Junkie XL, Asian Dub Foundation, Bassnectar, Excstatic, Datarock and The Tigerpicks, confirming the usual, high, production level of Electronic Arts. The sound effects are very realistic: in addition to the sounds generated by the ball slamming on the various surfaces, effective and excellently sampled ambient noises, each character speaks, gives real-time indications and gets angry when needed, speaking their own language of origin. When the ball goes out, the background song stops as if it were played on a vinyl record, and then resumes when the game restarts: a very particular and successful effect. Xbox 360 - Goals Like any Xbox 360 title, Fifa Street 3 is also giving away the canonical 1000 points to unlock. And like all EA sports titles, this one too manages to score a lot of points in the very first hours of the game. It won't take long to get them all, but suffice it to say that only with the first game session you get to almost 1/3 of the total, without having to perform particularly difficult or strange actions, but simply continuing in the single player. Definitely simple and satisfying from this point of view. Comment The new chapter of Fifa Street is ready to break the bankhino for the umpteenth consecutive year, obtaining its usual success with the public. This year, however, the critics unfortunately cannot agree with the obvious clamor aroused by the Electronic Arts title. The innovations introduced such as the Gamebreaker, an effort to be applauded among other things, do not have the desired effect but rather damage the gameplay of the title by distorting it and making it a mere repetitive exercise in the long run. The general package is very accurate: design, animations and soundtrack are decidedly convincing and very particular, giving it a captivating and fresh look. However, the renewal of style is not enough to mask the linearity of the game and its lack of depth. A missed opportunity to create the best Fifa Street ever. Pros Design, look and animations Audio compartment Historical and current players together Cons Gamebreaker too simple Repetitive challenges Very short learning curve Fifa Street 3 is out on February 22nd for PlayStation 3, Xbox360 and Nintendo DS. The tested version is the one for Xbox360.", "date": "2008-02-18", "grade": null}
