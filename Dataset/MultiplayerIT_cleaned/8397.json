{"name": "La luce dei morti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106556-deadlight-la-luce-dei-morti.html", "text": "Deadlight is the first game by Tequila Works, a Spanish team made up of dozens of people (the credits after the end credits are very long) who betray a past spent within the teams of some of the biggest software publishers in the world. from Blizzard to Sony. A young team, therefore, but one that has ancient roots. We first stumbled upon this somber adventure in February, during the spring showcase event, where, as with every occasion to showcase the Xbox 360 titles of the year, there was the usual parade of games that would part of the Summer of Arcade. Deadlight, even then, stood out quite clearly, given that the manufacturing quality, both in audio and visual terms, spoke of a game with the clear dignity of packaged. A AAA title, even with the limits given by the support, a file of just under two gigabytes to download from the Marketplace. The usual zombies? The premises of Deadlight are not exactly original, referring to obvious cinematic episodes (not disdaining some references to Lost), with an epidemic that, for unknown causes, spreads from Europe all over the world, up to Canada, where lives with the family our ranger, a lumberjack named Randall Wayne, who is among a group of survivors on the trail of his wife and daughter, who are supposed to have gone to Seattle, described by a tireless radio message as the last safe stronghold of mankind. The story is told by a series of animated and two-dimensional interlude scenes, with a raw and direct style, which are also almost the only way to see the protagonist in the face, otherwise almost always framed from the side and against the light. However, Deadlight also has a strong introspective nature and, therefore, it is essential to go and read what Randall wrote in the diary, since knowing the odyssey that happens in his head is just as fundamental as what is happening around him. Some of the pages, among other things, must be found by exploring the seabed and discovering secret rooms in the levels and these, together with a series of other objects, they are one of the elements that serve to lengthen longevity, along the lines of what happens in Alan Wake, whose atmospheres are often recalled, even on an artistic level. Wayne's dramatic run, in fact, as he crosses woods and cities devastated by this unstoppable horde of zombies, doesn't last more than five hours and, therefore, he has to go and recover the hidden items, thanks also to a convenient system for replaying the individual chapters highlighting which objects are still missing, it also becomes essential to enjoy the excellent atmospheres of the game. The plot is full of events, the world around you feels lost and boundless and, unfortunately, there is a too abrupt ending, which leaves a few too many points open and which does not sink the punch in all the excellent material that is scattered by the Tequila for the first half of the game. In short, space is almost left for a second episode without openly declaring it, but one gets the feeling that at a certain point we veered towards the conclusion of the story due to lack of time. Having said that, Deadlight is an experience that leaves no one indifferent and which, in terms of attention to detail and atmosphere, has very few comparisons in the world of digital delivery on Xbox 360. Xbox 360 goals Like all new Arcade games, Deadlight also offers 400 points to the player. Almost all of them are unlocked by arriving normally at the end of the game, leaving a handful to find all the pages of the diary and the secret objects, which, however, will have no escape with a little patience, thanks to the convenient system with which to replay the chapters already passed . There are also three Game & Watch-style laptops to discover and interact with to break simple records, but they're pure curiosity and it won't take you long to find them and beat the scores necessary to unlock the related achievements. Quotations galore Deadlight is an atypical survival horror, but perhaps purer than the latest action derivatives of the progenitor series, Resident Evil. The setting is completely two-dimensional and our hero is almost always armed with an ax and a couple of firearms with very little ammunition, however. Most of the time, therefore, rather than shooting enemies, who are hit on the head or decapitated on the ground with the ax, is spent running away, solving environmental puzzles, taking advantage of a glance and the need to understand how overcome rooms when they are littered with traps. Deadlight is not a difficult game, even the most challenging rooms or sequences where you have to escape from collapsing buildings or hordes of Shadows (that's the name of the Zombies), do not require more than a couple of attempts to beatyou, also because the checkpoints are very generous and almost always revive the scene of the crime at full energy and without penalties, dispersing that feeling of anguish which, on the other hand, is very successful on a visual level. The most obvious reference is that of Flashback, with respect to which, however, the Tequila title fails to leave the same mark, giving a truly high quality experience, but without pulling that coup de grace that was at hand. The maps are well designed, when you push yourself to find all the secret objects it is clear that the level designers of the team have experience to sell, but it remains a bit on the surface, compared to the high expectations that are created in the first two hours of game. Between references to Mirror's Edge parkour and even a small part where you have to interact with another character a la Ico, when you get to the end the feeling is that more could have been asked of the player. Also because the mechanics work and it is impossible not to get drawn into this desperate world full of pathos and find yourself on a couple of occasions with jumps to be performed exactly to the pixel which, in addition to making your heart leap, make you rediscover sensations that more often it should be found in today's games. Deadlight is powered by the Unreal Engine and offers dreamlike lights, cities that fall apart, believable liquids, good volumetric effects and excellent animations. It is difficult to remain indifferent to what appears on the screen, just as it is difficult to leave the pad until the end, which arrives, as mentioned, in no more than five hours of play. Between flashbacks, interlude scenes, at the end we know exactly who Randall is and sorry to see him go, especially because he does it in a somewhat clear (albeit strong) way. Sound effects and music are of the same level, therefore excellent, and help to complete the game which, while maintaining the voices in English, is completely subtitled in Italian.", "date": "2012-07-30", "grade": "8.5"}
