{"name": "Flatout: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flatout-la-recensione.html", "text": "Havoc? Not quite, but we're almost there. Another important feature is the size of the levels: despite going off the track too many in races means having to return to the obligatory point (and this causes you to lose precious seconds) the scenarios are almost entirely explorable and have various shortcuts such as trampolines, sections full of objects or even destructible buildings to pass through like in action movies! For cars, the engine deserves a separate discussion: every car, in addition to losing pieces, deforms and crumples in an exceptional way, gradually losing glass, mirrors, doors, bonnet, until it catches fire; then overturning the roof remains conspicuously crushed and it will be almost impossible to get to the end of the race without the car being reduced to a pile of wreckage. The main and absolutely innovative feature is the introduction of realistic physics very similar to the Havoc engine Favor the license please.. The game menu immediately points to the point: single player or multiplayer. In single mode we have to face a series of races (fifty to be precise) characterized in three classes (C, B, A) plus a bonus. The former involve racing on various circuits with different settings and different categories of cars, the latter instead offers the possibility of launching yourself into arenas as well as in a series of totally insane tests which involve making the pilots perform stunts. These turn out to be ingenious (and sadistically amusing) in their absurdity: in practice you have to run on particular straight lines which at the end have a whole series of objects such as pins, targets, rods (!) and at a certain point you have to literally ~shoot  the pilot out of the windshield, trying to score as many points as possible! Not to spoil the surprise, let's just mention the bowling in which the body of our unfortunate digital alter-ego has to knock down the pins trying to score a strike! Brilliant! Then we find the Destruction Arena in which the aim will be to resist more than the others, in fact it will not be enough to devastate the opposing cars but it will be necessary to ensure that the bodies of the enemies fly out of the cockpit. A peculiar feature of Flatout is precisely that in too violent collisions the pilots splash out of the cars to crash on the ground or against some object. However, all made without blood but rather in a comical way, since the little men seem more than dolls (if anyone expected Carmageddon they will be disappointed). Favor the license please.. The game offers us a fair number of cars, listed in order of power and cost. At the beginning we will start with a certain amount that will allow us to buy even a powerful car, but it is not recommended to immediately switch to the more performing models. This is because although the game has an arcade bent the driving model is not exactly simple. The intelligence of the adversaries proves to be competitive, they take advantage of your mistakes to overtake you and tend to overtake cornering trying to throw you off the road. This sometimes gets annoying because the cars all have rear-wheel drive and therefore you risk often ending up in a spin and therefore wasting time to get back into the race. This creates a bit of frustration. The advice is to start with a low engine capacity wreck to gain some experience and then move on to something higher. In addition, the game offers a vast possibility of tuning: you can buy new engines, suspensions, reinforcing bars (to make the car more resistant) and a whole series of components that improve performance. Of course, the depth of the changes does not reach the level of Gran Turismo but it still remains fairly varied and functional to the game. The sun sets on the horizon.. Graphically speaking, Flatout is a show: the game has a very varied color palette that makes everything spectacular to look at. The level of detail is very high and the inclusion of sunsets, the lack of clipping (therefore very distant horizon) as well as the particle effects (sand, glass, smoke made in a superb way) give total visual satisfaction. On a Pentium 4 2400 with GeForce 4 and 512mega of Ram the game runs smoothly at maximum graphics with filters activated! However, there are several customizable parameters to adapt everything to less powerful machines. The variety of environments is not lacking: they mainly have a ~rural~ background such as woods, quarries, countryside and small towns but we also find paved tracks and arenas a la ~Destruction Derby~; applause goes to the snow races, among the most beautiful to watch. Each place is characterized by a myriad of elements, some for embellishment only, others for obstacle or exploration functions, but all with ccommune a high-level achievement. Nothing has been left to chance. The 2000 engine The audio part of Flatout does its job well: although the tested version was devoid of music (not absolutely necessary for the purpose of the races) the rumbles of the cars appear bad and diversified according to the type of engine and displacement. The noises of the accidents and of the different terrains are also good (excluding the water, which is poorly made) as well as those assigned to each single object (bumping into the trunks will make a different sound than the metallic one of a fence). The game uses Eax and allows you to set up multi-speaker systems as well as Dolby Surround. Comment Flatout brings a breath of fresh gameplay to a genre that has never looked beyond car physics. The Havoc-like engine works very well and allows you to create ever-changing and spectacular situations. Longevity is more than decent given the number of races and the differentiation between them, if you then add the insane tests with the pilots and a fleet of cars that does not regret the licensed cars we are faced with a package that deserves the purchase . Only note the initial learning curve requires a little patience. Recommended for those who like to play ~dirty~ and are looking for something without too many parameters to configure to keep the car on track. Sim fanatics won't find what they're looking for. Pros: A novelty in driving games Exceptional graphics Fun and long-lived Cons: Difficult start at times frustrating Licenses or not? As already written in the preview, the cars in the game don't have real names and brands but are inspired by the big American monster cars. The bodies clearly recall this or that model however the fact that they can be completely destroyed for once does not make us regret the official licenses. Hot chair... The version we tested of Flatout had multiplayer in two modes: LAN and the so-called hot chair. If you have a network at your disposal, fun is guaranteed: a road war with blows, improprieties, dozens of obstacles in the middle of the road! Depending on the type of game you can run on the tracks or use the ~Destruction Derby~ mode in which the one who remains intact wins. It is also possible to face the insane tests (those in which the driver is thrown out of the car) but in turns. And it is here that programmers have introduced the expedient of the turn between players (the hot chair, born in the very old days of the first legendary Granprix!) in which we take turns to face the races. No split screen then. Unfortunately it was not possible to play online (for now there is no info about it) but the LAN experience is a must try! Get ready to yell at your friends... Havoc? Not quite, but we're almost there. Flatout is the latest effort by Bugbear, the same ones who developed the excellent Rally Trophy some time ago, an interesting variation on the classic rally simulations (since it was set in the 70s) equipped with a very realistic physical model. Now they offer us an unconventional title, in which you don't just have to run to win but also (and above all) destroy your opponents with blows, accidents, and dirty maneuvers! The game simulates American amateur competitions, those based on super tricked-out junk cars that run in the most diverse circuits, from woods to arenas, where the winner is whoever stays whole. The main and absolutely innovative feature is the introduction of realistic physics (very similar to the Havoc engine) which not only deals with the cars, but also manages the external environment in a credible way, offering a new dimension in terms of game possibilities in the races! It seems that there are more than 2000 objects implemented including tires (which roll and bounce), signs, barriers, poles and so on and so forth. It is even possible to destroy some buildings (such as a tank that falls in the middle of the road!) and, to cite an example, there are logs on the edge of the track that you can hit to make them end up in the middle of the road, in order to hinder your opponents! The possibilities offered are many.", "date": "2004-11-09", "grade": null}
