As we teased during our first cover article, the new approach left us with a fair amount of confidence in what would unfold in the next production rounds. We had underlined the presence of a gameplay of substance, capable of offering many opportunities and a level design up to par. At the same time we had pointed out that it would have taken a little more time to draw conclusions on the narrative side, although a reduced innovation was perceived compared to the past and therefore some question marks regarding the episodic formula chosen by IO Interactive. After these long weeks of waiting, we are ready to analyze in detail the second episode of Hitman, available since last April 26 at the price of 9.99 euros. Sapienza's mission requires a good dose of photographic memory To be an assassin you need... Wisdom After having immersed ourselves in the worldliness of the Parisian fashion shows and having eliminated the leaders of the IAGO terrorist organization, the second assignment takes us to the fictitious location of Sapienza, located in the heart of the Amalfi coast. The objectives are once again closely connected to each other and the stakes are quite high, as the elimination of a dangerous virus created in the laboratory is involved. In the briefing we learn that the pathogen is able to settle in a multitude of carriers, unaware of what is happening inside their body, at least until the toxin comes into contact with the DNA of the target subject . But the intervention in the laboratory is only part of the assignment because, after all, Agent 47 remains above all a murderer. This time in the center of the viewfinder are Silvio Caruso and Francesca De Santis. The first is among the most successful researchers in the stem cell sector, although he changed his priorities after joining the ranks of the Ether Corporation, while the woman is the head of the laboratory and is directly involved in the development of the weapon to be eradicated. Obviously you are wondering why a sophisticated research laboratory is located in a renowned seaside resort in the Bel Paese, and it is easy to say: Caruso has developed some paranoid obsessions, including the difficulty of moving away from his homeland. So off we go, towards the sun on the Amalfi coast, where we find our icy killer disguised as a wealthy tourist and carelessly reading a newspaper, right in front of the entrance to Villa Caruso. If the game area set in Paris was divided into many levels and already rich in many things to do and see, the map of this second episode takes qualities such as breadth and freedom of action to the next level. Yes, because Villa Caruso constitutes only a part of the places in which the player finds himself operating. Outside the boundaries that delimit the property there is a context, there are unaware people from whom it is possible to extrapolate opportunities, alleys typical of our seaside resorts, small shops and apartment complexes, the main square and the characteristic pier. At the same time, the interiors of the estate also offer a maze of alternatives which, at first, require attention and a good dose of memory. The opportunities that could be seized in Paris weren't bad at all, but Sapienza managed to convince us even more. Choosing one approach over another can lead to real upheavals of the assignment and pushes the player to places not yet visited, experiencing diametrically different perspectives with each new attempt. As usual, the completion of opportunities and challenges allows you to increase your level of Professionalism related to the map and is useful for unlocking new starting positions with which to make infiltration operations easier. Come on, one more time! In addition to the campaign mission, this second episode also adds a new Escalation contract, in which the primary objective becomes the elimination of Marcello Ray, renowned chef of Villa Caruso, through the use of a melee killing technique. As was the case for previous assignments belonging to this modality, the first level offers only the main objective, while the subsequent ones are enriched by further tasks and conditions to be respected, including the recovery of sensitive data, the obligation not to eliminate or stunning other characters and hiding corpses within a strict time limit. Moreover the PlayStation 4 version -with which we performed our tests - also offers a new mission exclusive to the Sarajevo Six. In the Sapienza map, Gary Lunn, also known as The Enforcer and at work in the Villa Caruso laboratory, must be shot down. On the technical side, we again encountered sporadic slowdowns in the frame rate, while the speed of the menus has been significantly improved compared to the feedback from the first content. The patch that was released in recent days was mainly aimed at reducing those tedious loading times that plagued the previous version, but the progress didn't seem very evident to us. Playstation 4 trophies There are seven Trophies of Sapienza. Three involve the story directly, while the others involve completing all opportunities, reaching level 5 in the Escalation contract, choosing a starting location and using an additional resource during a mission, and finally reaching the level of Professionalism 20 in the new map. But is the plot perceived or not? In light of the episodic formula, it would have been reasonable to expect a fair amount of attention to the script and the characters. Only in this way could an approach be justified which is usually compared to titles in which the narration is predominant. In the debut mission we had not grasped this type of narrative relevance and the short cutscenes available did not seem to deviate much from the line already dictated at the time of Hitman: Absolution. Yet in recent months IO Interactive had pointed out that, during the game, new light would be shed on some of the characters who gravitate around Agent 47, with an eye to the role and personality of Diana Burnwood. After finishing the Sapienza episode, our preliminary impressions remain unchanged, also because the material useful for establishing a plot really seems to have been reduced to a minimum. The only interlude sequence is shown after having eradicated the virus and the story that forms the background to the missions seemed to us not very substantial. Ultimately, we find it difficult to understand the choice to divide a title into many small parts that makes complex mechanics and deep interaction its main raison d'tre.", "date": "2016-04-28", "grade": "8.5"}
