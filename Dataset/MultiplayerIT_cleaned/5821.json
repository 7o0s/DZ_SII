This is the incipit of Dungeon Time, the new action game developed by Mooff Games, the team behind the entertaining Super Boys - The Big Fight. A product that this time is offered in a premium format on the App Store, at a price of 1.99 and without advertising or in-app purchases, which is saying something. The protagonists of the game are Bishop, a thief equipped with a bow and dagger; Duberry, an armored knight wielding a sword and shield; Edric, a burly hunter who likes to fire two rifles at a time; and finally Alyssa, a Valkyrie wielding a huge axe. In their basic characteristics, the characters do not differ from each other, but by gaining experience in the field it is possible to unlock their secondary abilities and special moves, true characterizing elements. During our tests we almost always used Duberry, quickly unlocking a powerful stone throw and a special with a defensive value, which develops a sort of force field capable of repelling enemies. Using a three-quarter top-down view, our objective in the game is to explore eleven dungeons from top to bottom, eliminating any opponent in our path, collecting keys to open new doors and finally finding the exit. Dungeon Time is a simple action game with some potential, albeit marred by some flaws Gauntlet Dungeon Time is clearly inspired by the classic Gauntlet, and in fact the characters have attacks from a distance (albeit short) rather than close shots. A necessary solution to deal with the numerous hordes of goblins, zombies and various monstrosities that we will have to fight, but which has been handled in a questionable way by the developers: considering the dual stick shooter-style gameplay, we would have preferred to be able to direct the attacks manually instead of submitting to an automatic pointing system, which unfortunately does not support any strategies and often leads to unfair damage. The presence of numerous checkpoints and a total of twelve lives allows you to dampen the frustration of undeserved game overs, however this factor inevitably affects the enjoyment of the experience; hand in hand with a really basic artificial intelligence of the enemies: they try to reach us even if they are behind a wall, in a ~line of sight~, so as soon as we open doors or turn corners we find them on us. However, it must be said that the game also boasts a significant feature, namely the possibility of tackling the campaign in online cooperative multiplayer mode for four participants. By creating a game or joining an existing session, with a view to a rather rapid and elastic system, which contemplates entries and exits during the same match, we will therefore be able to collaborate with three other users in order to explore the dungeons and clean them up. The co-op turns out to be fun, but often suffers from problems due to lag, some glitches and early releases, the latter only solvable by making an agreement with a few friends. From a technical point of view, a fair amount of work has been done, and the choice to keep the same graphic style seen in the aforementioned Super Boys - The Big Fight appears to be appreciable, in practice a distinctive trademark of Mooff Games, although largely sketchy and not mature enough.", "date": "2015-12-17", "grade": "7.0"}
