Real classics that inspired the developers of Slayaway Camp, a title making its debut on the App Store after having enjoyed some success on Steam. It is a rather peculiar project, in fact: a puzzle game characterized by ~cubic~ graphics in which we control a mad serial killer determined to kill his own victims from the perspective of over one hundred and forty levels divided into eleven scenarios, the latter represented by videotapes that must be gradually unlocked together with new, very painful ~fatalities~ for the unfortunate people who will end up on our way and as many skins for the protagonist of the adventure. The ultra-violence of the game is naturally mitigated by the nice voxel-based style used to represent the characters and settings, but we are talking about decidedly brutal maneuvers: from simple beheading to forklifting, from shredding to slicing, and so on. These sequences take place in the context of a sort of (trivial) quick time event that ~rewards~ the best kills, and in which we are asked to stop an indicator at the right time, when it passes through the red area of the slider. Slayaway Camp is a puzzle game that brings together a number of successful and well-combined elements The touch that kills Eliminating our victims in Slayaway Camp is simple, just reach out and touch them or even place ourselves in front of them and scare them to the point of making them flee towards an atrocious fate, such as falling into an abyss or a burning fire. The peculiarity of the game, however, lies in its puzzle mechanics, which design each scenario as a sort of diorama divided into rows and columns that we can only travel along their entire length, without the possibility of stopping at a specific point. It goes without saying that a structure of this type implies a minimum of reasoning on the order of the moves (reversible via a special key), especially during the stages in which it is asked to kill the victims and return to the dark dimension to which we belong within a limited number of shifts. In short, it is necessary to think about the obstacles, the possible sides, the ~circular~ movement that is carried out to reach an area that initially appears precluded. However, there are variations on the theme, such as the introduction of units capable of defending themselves (starting with the policemen, who are attacked from behind or from the side) or, from a certain point on, the possibility of turning off the light in the ~room~ and turn the tables. Tricks that effectively manage to avoid an excessive degree of repetitiveness, always keeping interest high in an experience that can give so much to puzzle enthusiasts. The 2.99 euro premium model chosen by the developers excludes any in-app purchase a priori, and so the gold coins collected with each success can be used to unlock the aforementioned ~fatalities~ or for tips and solutions for the most difficult puzzles, so as not to get stuck.", "date": "2017-02-22", "grade": "8.0"}
