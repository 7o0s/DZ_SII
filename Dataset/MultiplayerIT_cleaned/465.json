{"name": "Chibi-Robo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chibi-robo_a.html", "text": "A dress for all seasons You don't just live on waste collections, electronic gadgets and fights against mechanical spiders: once you have recovered special costumes through special events and subplots, the tender Chibi-Robo can dress up and thus change the way you interact with the varied cast that animates the Sanderson house. A Captain Dragon uniform transforms us into space rangers ready for the patrol, a frog costume acts as a translator for the language of the batrachians allowing us to understand Jenny's cryptic words, and so on. Each disguise also has a personal move that can be activated using the Z key at the cost of about ten points of the electric charge. It is a real fun to contemplate how the reactions towards the little robot change as his external appearance changes, and in some ways this characteristic brings to mind the playful devices implemented with the Zelda masks: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. House size After a few minutes, the night gives way to sunlight, and home activities resume more fervent than ever, completely changing the power structures. In the living room, little Jenny is lying on the carpet and drawing with crayons, while her father does nothing but watch the news sitting in an armchair. You can continue the chores started the night, or talk to humans to get more happiness points: it's all up to the player's choice and although there are, of course, predetermined events, it depends on us which ones to activate and when, and above all which requests to satisfy at what time. It is an extremely free and almost, if not quite, open ended game structure, for which you can continue repeating the same operations even for days or continue the plot and reach the end of the game in no time at all. Easier said than done, however, because accumulating Heart Points and Moolah is essential to reach certain areas of the house through technological upgrades and the finding and installation of certain tools that can be purchased at the Chibi-Casa online shop and which improve Chibi's abilities. A bit like in Zelda or Metroid, every time you get a new tool you consequently gain access to one or more new areas, to a new piece of the house where there is always something to do or find that particular object that will allow us to please mother Sanderson, Jenny or one of the innumerable family toys, which discover that they have a life of their own when the gaze of humans is not fixed on them. Just like in a Japanese Toy Story, we are dealing with galactic superheroes in the odor of Gatchman who however also unequivocally recall a certain Buzz Lightyear, or with mummies equipped with a sarcophagus who desperately try to scare but then prove to have a heart of 'gold. In every corner there is something so interesting that it is undoubtedly worth striving to reach it, and every smallest clue sown along the corridors bears fruit which, once admired, makes it clear that nothing has been in vain. And then there are the fights, fortunately sparse and very easy (also because they are not particularly well done), which with little effort allow you to collect scrap metal which will then be recycled to become useful to Chibi. This is how we proceed from day to day, and the fact that often and willingly half a day, despite the possibility of procuring time extensions, is absolutely not sufficient to complete the whole program that we have set ourselves, often pushes us to continue to the bitter end by increasing more and more the peripheral vision that of the Sanderson Chibi family is built step by step. And it is a vision, as we said a little above, which is by no means idyllic. The colors of melancholy A minimum of observation is enough to understand that mother, father and daughter, obviously not counting toys and animals, are in a situation of discomfort, when not exactly a crisis and an open storm. Dad Sanderson sleeps on the sofa in the living room, little Jenny expresses herself in an incomprehensible language, mum Sanderson mumbles and gets annoyed over nothing and the kitchen table is full of overdraft accounts: talking to the family, one gradually discovers that she is suspended in a heavy and painful limbo, and that the problems are destined to worsen over time. Chibi therefore touches, in addition to the fulfillment of household chores, also the thankless (?) task of confidant. A minimum of sensitivity is worth even a momentary relief to the interlocutor, and to us a certain amount of happiness points: Chibi-Robo manages to deal with difficult issues that are almost never touched in a video game,like family crises, with a bitter smile on his lips and an unexpected delicacy, without falling into clichs and without limiting himself to imparting easy moral judgements. The elevation to the bearer of a message, as well as of fun, ennobles the entire title, placing it a cut above most of the current videogame trend, but could lead those who just want to have fun with video games to snub the minirobot's businesses. And it's a bad thing, because there are plenty of fun and satisfaction: for once, even the technical aspect is not limited to embellishing, but plays a fundamental role in the play system. Alongside well-matched colors, at the service of spartan polygonal constructions but perfectly functional to the style they want to express, one of the most surprising soundtracks of recent years makes a fine show. The enveloping melodies, now blues now technopop, are perfectly complemented by the sounds that Chibi causes by walking on the various surfaces or by brushing and cleaning: every single gesture produces a different sound suggestion and it is a real pleasure to discover them one after the other, passing from a casual guitar solo to delicate hints of flute harmonies worthy of a vintage Disney film. Everything in Chibi-Robo is designed not only to provide entertainment, but also to make people think and to explain to the player that nothing is ever as it seems: and praising its depth and its manifesto of intent, we believe, is the best compliment you can pay him. Tidying up a house to give a little happiness to its inhabitants and solving their problems is a concept that certainly does not meet the standards set by the industry these days. We add that the game, already a niche at its origin, is now being published on a console that can now be considered dead, and the risk, more than concrete, is that few realize its value. It should already be clear, however, that Chibi-Robo is a recommended title, even if not for everyone, and that if taken in the right direction it can dispense industrial quantities of fun, causing the player to stick with the GameCube for hours. The structure, skilfully designed to encourage you to always discover a new corner of the Sanderson home, is of a unique magnetism. The objectives are there, the plot too: we are faced with a game in all respects, although its genre may be difficult to define. So abandon all prejudices and get ready for a unique and unforgettable experience, which will help extinguish the life of this console in the way it deserves: peaceful yet glorious. Pros Extremely stimulating and well-crafted game mechanics Excellent control system Free walking and non-linear development Cons Graphics, in some ways, not up to par with the rest of the game The fights are superfluous and poorly presented Going forward always pursuing the same goal could be tiring It's a real pity that Chibi-Robo comes out in Europe at the end of the GameCube's life cycle, a machine in some ways mistreated and undervalued by the same company that gave it birth but capable of giving the public authentic gems, like the game that we find to review here. Therefore, our task will be to explain why this is a purchase, if not to be done with your eyes closed, at least to be considered more than seriously, since we have one of the most beautiful adventure games of recent times in our hands and certainly one of the best titles that have graced the console. But first the fundamental question: what is Chibi-Robo? Simplifying as much as possible, we could define it as an action-adventure set in the home and featuring a small robot called Chibi-Robo as its protagonist, in charge of carrying out the household chores that will earn him a certain number of happiness points and will bring him closer and closer to the state of Super Chibi Robo. But in this way we would not do justice to a title that thrives on its nuances, its contrasts and its only apparently joyful and carefree atmosphere. Already in the opening film you can sense something that should put you at attention. Chibi arrives at the Sanderson family home on the occasion of little Jenny's eighth birthday, as a gift purchased by her father at an exorbitant price, and immediately triggers the disappointment (not to mention anger) of mother Sanderson, while the little girl, perpetually disguised as frog, he limits himself to emitting a few croaking verses. It's just the tip of the iceberg, but the first task of the willing Chibi and his sidekick Telly Vision will be to start tidying up the living room. So, while everyone is sleeping, Chibi is faced with his first dilemmas: finding us neplaying the role of a little robot no more than twenty centimeters tall, reaching the surface of a table, a sofa or a dresser is not exactly the easiest thing in the world, and this makes much of the adventure section of the title a continuous use of the resources at one's disposal to reach places that at first glance may seem totally out of our reach. The first thing to do is collect enough Heart Points to earn at least one battery expansion: Chibi's walking is in fact subject to the duration of its internal battery, which can be recharged simply by picking up the plug (which Chibi always carries around like a tail) and plugging it into one of the many sockets scattered around. By collecting waste paper, empty cans and crumbs and then throwing them in the trash you get the first points and the first rewards in hard cash. Let's start immediately by saying that, although the premises may lead us to believe, the departure is far from slow: we immediately see the objectives to be completed and the tools to collect to start cleaning the house, not to mention that already in the first scenario at least two quite interesting interlocutors are found: hats off to Skip. And this, again, is just the tip of the iceberg.", "date": "2006-06-09", "grade": null}
