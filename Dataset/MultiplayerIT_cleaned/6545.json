An important appointment from various points of view, given that we are faced with one of the most important exclusive PlayStation Studios ever which, with the arrival on the Windows platform, consolidates a strategy that has been around for some time now, but is increasingly central to Sony. The action game developed by Insomniac Games had the merit of finally giving Spider-Man a first-rate videogame dimension, after a number of tie-ins that proved to be little more than discreet at best. There was the desire to challenge Batman: Arkham, it is clear, and the Californian team responded to the appeal brilliantly, putting all their passion for the Marvel hero and quite a few elements inspired by the Rocksteady Studios masterpiece. The end result is a structurally traditional open world, perhaps a little aged, but still able to excite the many fans of the Arrampicamuri thanks to an almost perfectly rendered web swinging, a very fun freeflow combat system and an amazing direction , capable of engaging the campaign from start to finish and bringing to the screen some of the most lively and spectacular sequences ever seen in a video game. Story: A New Universe Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Peter and Mary Jane Very briefly, because you probably all already know the story of Marvel's Spider-Man: Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider that gave him the proportional abilities of a spider and learned in the hardest and most dramatic way that ~from a great power comes great responsibility.~ In the game, Peter has been fighting crime on the streets of New York for eight years wearing the Spider-Man costume. The one written by Insomniac Games in collaboration with Dan Slott and Christos Gage is therefore not a story that rediscovers the origins of hero, but a reinterpretation that starts from consolidated narrative bases to give us a character with already several experiences behind him (also and above all with the so-called super-villains) and a sentimental break with Mary Jane Watson, who in this case does not work as a model but as a journalist for the Daily Bugle. The exchange of roles works very well and MJ's figure emerges strengthened, giving life to interesting and non-trivial dynamics between the two ex-boyfriends, who for one reason or another find themselves acting as partners when the scene bursts Demons: a group of criminals endowed with mysterious powers, who seem to want to take possession of the city after the arrest of Wilson Fisk which took place in the very first stages of the campaign: we have tutorials like that. You will really find everything in the almost seventeen hours that are the minimum necessary to complete the main story of Marvel's Spider-Man, without considering the three DLCs included in the package that add more or less another six hours to the duration of the experience: reinterpreted characters , historical nemeses, but above all a large amount of surprises that we don't want to spoil you, especially if you are about to try your hand at the game for the first time. Gameplay: The Ultimate Spider-Man Tie-In? Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, web swinging between buildings at night As mentioned at the beginning, it is clear that the Batman: Arkham series has been an important source of inspiration for the work of Insomniac Games. The combat system of Marvel's Spider-Man is in fact a faithful re-proposition of the freeflow invented by Rocksteady, with some less assistance (the character does not automatically jump towards the closest enemy to hit him, for example) and perhaps a certain degree of repetitiveness in openings, but also several variants as regards the opponents and a non-trivial degree of challenge. As part of the most classic of progressions, we will gradually find ourselves unlocking new maneuvers, gadgets and skills that will come in handy for deciding the clashes, both those with an open face than the more silent and tactical ones, when by jumping from one hold to another we will be able to eliminate the enemies one at a time and perhaps leave them hanging from the ceiling, wrapped in a cobweb: would you have ever thought that spiders and bats had so many things in common ? Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, the beginning of a stealth-based battle The open world, as mentioned, is one of the traditional ones: we will have the entire map of Manhattan available, moreover faithfully reproduced to the point of inspiring a pinch of virtual tourism, and quite a few activities to try our hand at between main mission and the other. Nothing transcendental, in fact I'm Incarich a bit boring and sometimes repetitive (see the chases and robberies, always the same), but that's okay: the balance of the experience does not suffer from it and indeed time passes quickly, without burdens. Also and above all thanks to the excellent yield of web swinging, assigned by default to the triggers and the X key for shots in mid-air: a few minutes of practice are enough to obtain exciting results, which allow you to swing between buildings, but without attacking cobwebs on anything (almost always let's say), performing vertiginous dives to increase speed and passing seamlessly to fast running on the facades, the latter solution which we understand as the only way to avoid hitches during the crossings of the city, but which visually does not excite and takes away the ~physicality ~ to the character. On the other hand, the classic climbs and the positions that Spider-Man can take in such situations are very good. The PC version Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, the graphic options we used for this review and for all the accompanying images And here we are at the point. We already knew that Marvel's Spider-Man is an excellent tie-in and, although some structural aspects are starting to feel the weight of the years a little, there is no doubt that the Insomniac Games title still stands as a point of reference for superhero action, waiting to find out if the very long wait for new projects from WB Games Montreal and Rocksteady will be rewarded or not. What we didn't know was how the PC version would behave. We discovered it a little day by day, in the sense that during the processing two updates were published (one of which with a good 37 GB and just two days after the expiry of the embargo) and new NVIDIA drivers aimed at improving performance and eliminating certain problems. We'd like to be able to say that everything is perfect now, but in truth it will still take some work for the game to express its full potential even on Windows. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Mary Jane and Spider-Man The graphics options have been revolutionized with a further update in view of day one, after the expiry of the embargo on reviews, and therefore we have revised our considerations in light of the performance obtainable using the new settings. In particular, ray tracing now works only on two presets, max and super, with the possibility of increasing and decreasing the reflected objects: the quality of the effect has been substantially improved, but the impact on the frame rate has inevitably increased at resolution parity. With the latest build we were able to play at true 4K and 30 fps, making only small changes of the max preset and obtaining visually superior results compared to the game fidelity mode on PS5, both in the aforementioned ray tracing and textures , in the shadows and in general in the quality of the effects. Of course, you have to activate the DLSS or, better, the FSR 2.0 to get that extra cue in order to avoid drops below 30 frames, but remaining on the ~quality~ setting it is impossible to notice any differences. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, ray tracing can be set to three levels: change the number of reflected objects Wanting to aim for 60 fps we went down to 1440p and used more or less the same settings, therefore the max preset and one between DLSS and FSR 2.0 to increase fluidity just enough to reach the target. The problems with the antialiasing of the previous build have fortunately disappeared, but an underlying inconsistency remains that is still not convincing. Web swinging phases, fights, walking through crowds or moving inside closed environments are in fact all situations which behave very differently on PC and give rise to even significant variations in performance, which instead does not happen on PlayStation 5 thanks to more careful optimization work. It is therefore necessary to arrive at an important performance surplus (the so-called ~overhead~) to to buffer all the moments in which the graphics engine struggles the most, and this sometimes requires heavy compromises. On the other hand, the support for the DualSense controller is good, which brings into play haptic feedback and adaptive triggers exactly like on PS5. Graphics and sound Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, ray tracing reflections on the glass of a building at night Finally, a few words on the original technical implementation, which also offers sequences of great visual impact on PC, fairly detailed scenarios (a pity that the day / night cycle and the weather conditions are not dynamic) and excellent polygonal models, capable of offering excellent expressiveness during cutscenes. By the way: who writesve is not a fan of the replacement of John Bubniak with Ben Jordan for a large number of reasons, but it is useless to rekindle old controversies. On the sound side, the main theme recalls the early Spider-Man films for atmosphere and is perfectly appropriate to the action, although the other tracks on the soundtrack finish a little muted. The dubbing in Italian is really excellent, with some very good interpretations, but some mixing problems in some moments.", "date": "2022-08-10", "grade": "8.5"}
