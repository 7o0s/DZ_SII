{"name": "Somerville", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/somerville-recensione.html", "text": "The world of videogame development is changeable and in continuous movement: after the completion of a videogame, it is not uncommon to see a reshuffling in the composition of the personnel - often squeezed by intolerable periods of crunch - if not a disintegration of the studios themselves, in a continuous turnover of setbacks and new beginnings. In this sense, the story of the complicated professional divorce between Dino Patti and Arnt Jensen, co-founders of the Danish independent studio Playdead, is emblematic. After years of work on two extraordinarily successful projects, Limbo and Inside, Patti left the company in 2016 , to found a new reality the following year together with animator Chris Olsen. Jumpship has since worked on Somerville, a cinematic adventure that - as stated by Olsen on several occasions - wants to distance itself from the works of Playdead to build a new path. Now that we have completed the first work of Jumpship we can say that the intent, in our opinion, cannot be said to be successful, even though the studio has created a product that is undoubtedly cared for from an aesthetic and directing point of view. We tell you about it in our Somerville review. Evil comes from above The events of Somerville begin with the arrival of a gigantic monolith from the sky Somerville begins during a sleepy evening in front of the television. A mother and father are asleep on the sofa, while their restless child wanders around the house and manages to get where he shouldn't, climbing onto the divider between the living room and the kitchen and opening the window. The noise wakes up the two parents, surprised by the pink light that pierces the sky: it is clear that something is wrong, and soon the family will find themselves catapulted into a truly surreal situation. After a humanoid being equipped with a strange suit invites the protagonist to take him by the hand, the man - of which in the meantime we have taken control - acquires a mysterious power connected to light. This will be decisive in the subsequent environmental puzzles, very abundant in the approximately four hours necessary to complete Somerville. The anomalies brought by the gigantic monoliths that now dominate the terrestrial scenario are all marked by luminous signals: red, blue, pink lights, in a ferocious irruption of the extraordinary into the ordinary that reminded us of the stylistic choices adopted in Control. A certainly different path compared to the one taken by Playdead in Limbo, dominated by a very successful combination of black and white, and Inside, where the duotone gave way to a sober and essential color palette, played on blue, gray, occasional red tones . After the introductory events inside the family home, a breathless exploration opens between open fields, caves, stormy seas and structures aimed at welcoming the survivors. Yes, because the aliens hunt humans mercilessly, and soon the protagonist will find himself separated from his family, uncertain about the survival of his partner and their little son. A situation that should inspire empathy and concern, but which - in practice - has left us cold and insensitive: the characters completely lack the corporality and humanity of Ico and Yorda in the seminal Ico, a real masterclass to bring the soul of the player to the humanoid-shaped pixels that move in the enigmatic castle, without the two boys uttering a single word. Even Somerville aspires to create involvement without speaking, but fails to do so: of its protagonists, at the end of the adventure, little or nothing remains in the hearts of those who have played, although the narration manages to offer interesting ideas, revealing however a story that aims to tell the spirit of sacrifice of a hero so unexpected, but with very little heart. The (too much) perfection of the camera Somerville's chromatisms recall those of Control The language of cinema has been used for many years in the gaming world to control what the player sees, to influence his perception of characters and events, to build a vision of convincing and well-rounded worlds. Chris Olsen is strong in his work experience in the seventh art, fielded in Somerville through the symbolic tool of the film industry: the camera. Usually far from the protagonist to capture a broad view of the Earth invaded by aliens and how the environment has been changed over the course of that dramatic night, the camera of Jumpship follows the protagonist on his desperate journey in search of family members, in a continuous escape from the alien beings who now dominate the earth's landscape. The tracking shots are precise, and the camera allows itself a few minimal jolts only when the character stops. In nonein one case the player can influence the shot, which is always fixed: what can be seen is totally controlled by the director, thus capable of communicating a sense of ineluctability and drag that pushes us to run at breakneck speed towards the conclusion of Somerville. The view often zooms out to show players the state of the Earth being invaded by aliens In some situations it is possible to move three-dimensionally in space, and this choice was certainly a harbinger of complications for the developers, who have not always managed to make the possibilities of movement and interaction with the elements of the scenario legible. An unfortunate management of the animations does not help: to go back to quoting a character created by Fumito Ueda - a master in managing the physicality of the protagonists of his video games - the man is totally devoid of the weight and authentic movements of the child from The Last Guardian. His steps are wooden, those of an emotionless machine; the (frequent) failure to interact with levers and buttons leads to awkward and out of place movements, which break the player's identification with the events faced by the protagonist. The protagonist's house is the first setting we travel in Somerville Here, from a technical point of view Somerville would have needed more grace and care: on our test configuration we experienced frequent drops in frame rates, as well as unfortunate interpenetrations between characters and elements of the scenario that completely ripped us from the atmosphere of gloomy apocalypse that should be typical of the game. There is a strong contrast between the painstaking study of direction and artistic direction, capable of giving moments of pure beauty and also of contemplation of a world prey to tremendous forces and alien intrusions well inserted and codified on an aesthetic level, and the merely technical aspects , which seemed to us at times neglected by Jumpship, as if the final stages of development had undergone a dizzying acceleration. And it's a real shame, given the visible potential in Somerville, that the obsessive study of the shots ends up telling a story approached in a totally aseptic way: Alfred Hitchcock said that in films the murders are very clean, and that his goal as a director was to show how difficult it is, what a mess it is to kill a man; in Somerville the apocalypse is extremely clean, sterilized - like the tools of a good doctor - and in its precision it leaves behind every emotional factor. Less creepy than expected Somerville's protagonist finds himself going through a large number of settings and situations Central aspects of each cinematic adventure are the exploration of the game world and the resolution of environmental puzzles. On these aspects Jumpship has certainly hit the mark, creating an interesting and coherent setting, full of well-conceived puzzles, focused on the powers acquired by the protagonist and - as previously mentioned - on light, Somerville's true leitmotif. Unfortunately, in the puzzles there is no moral ambiguity: the protagonist is never called to make questionable choices in the context of a certainly dramatic situation, and this increases the perception of being carrying out a technical and not very human exercise, unable to involve the player's soul in an authentic and profound way. We have said that certainly the eye has its part in Somerville, but the same cannot be said for a sense that is central to increasing player involvement: hearing. The diegetic sounds are reduced to the bone, and humanity invaded by aliens is silent, impassive, voiceless - and breathless: the protagonist never abandons himself to a sigh of anxiety or tiredness, despite the overwhelming weight of the journey that is forced to do. We wish we could have felt the anxiety of listening to the buzzing mosquito sound of Limbo or the child's labored breathing of Inside, felt by the endless running in the disturbing game environments; the inhabitants of the Earth invaded by aliens never abandon themselves to the excruciating scream of the scientists gathered around the tank of experiments from which the lump of flesh released by the child erupts. The sound accompaniment, edited by Dominique Charpentier and Matteo Cerquone, becomes incisive in the most dramatic moments, but we did not appreciate the decision to bet everything, on these occasions, on non-diegetic sounds which, once again, show Jumpship's tendency to wanting to propose a ~strong~ direction, a bit artificial, which does not let the narrated world breathe, often making it inconsistent and incorporeal.", "date": "2022-11-15", "grade": "6.5"}
