{"name": "Audiosurf - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/audiosurf-recensione.html", "text": "Audiosurf, an indie game that has been released for some time on Steam, Valve's digital delivery platform, has more to do with the emergence of p2p than with video games per se. The author simply understood that there are far more MP3s and the like on users' hard drives than files of any other type, with people having hard drives overflowing with heterogeneous music collections with which they fill increasingly capacious portable players, whose success it is due more to piracy than the legal sale of songs. So: why not exploit these immense archives also for videogame purposes? Frankly, we are more surprised by the fact that no big publisher has ever thought of making two worlds interact so close, than by the arrival on the market of a simple game and, at the same time, capable of selling hundreds of thousands of copies in a few hours, strong even at a competitive price ($9.95) which is also lower than the average of indie products ($19.95). it seems made to relax the player by dragging him into his favorite music Audiosurf has a self-explanatory title, which means it allows you to ~travel~ on the songs. Put very simplistically, the software does nothing but read a song chosen by the user, generating a path based on the different elements of the musical composition and adapting them to the selected mode. The Orange Box soundtrack is included in the price but obviously the game gives its best when you use songs from your collection, especially those you are most attached to. The aim of each song is to accumulate points by hitting colored bricks with your vehicle, carefully avoiding the gray ones by moving from one lane to another. The bricks are arranged on a grid, shown at the bottom of the circuit, and points are obtained based on various factors (such as the filling of the grid, the number of bricks of the same color lined up and so on). The score is not secondary to the success of the game, since it is possible to put your results online by effectively competing with pilots from all over the world (provided they use the same song). Hopping from one song to another Up to here the idea that Audiosurf is made is that of a simple game of skill, but in reality it is much more. It will be the psychedelic scenarios, it will be that the bricks are positioned in the rhythmic points and that the path perfectly follows the trend of the chosen song... the fact is that you are quickly sucked into this little jewel that makes a mainly auditory experience interactive. As in a musical game (Guitar Hero, just to give an example) you find yourself enraptured by the rhythm and you play in a state of intoxication, following the music in a mechanical way almost as if the song were playing twice: the first time in our ears and the second before our eyes. Jazz, Punk, Rock, Blues, Metal, House all genres and all songs are sublimated in a playful sense (the worst is obtained from Italian melodic music, as well as from classical music) and rendered in fascinating and aesthetically satisfying visual trips (the screenshots don't give a good idea of the real aesthetic impact). In fact, the ~game~ itself (aligning blocks of the same color) soon fades into the background and Audiosurf turns out to be more of a relaxing pastime with which to interact with music, a sort of Zen iPod which, if we want, can also be frenetic (a lot depends from the chosen song a hardcore piece produces, with some exceptions, very different results from those of, I don't know, the Ramazzotti of the moment), but never frustrating and which, on the contrary, seems made on purpose to relax the player by dragging him inside his favorite music. Comment Fresh, innovative in knowing how to exploit modernity without oppressing the user with extra costs in addition to that of the game and, certainly, more sparkling than titles with a more pumped blazon, Audiosurf has been able to break the monotony, entirely serial, of the world of video games, conquering a large slice of the public ready to accept such a product without prejudice, demonstrating that sometimes ideas can pay off. Recommended unreservedly. Pros Original and enthralling. It makes your MP3 collection look different. One more song. One more, just one more. Cons If you only have records by Ramazzotti you won't appreciate it. A bit repetitive in the long run. Few editable effects.
