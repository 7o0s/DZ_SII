The title created by Ovee Game Studio and now taken up by Saber Interactive is quite special: on board a large group of vehicles - mostly of massive dimensions - you get involved in a matter that has absolutely nothing to do with opponents , laps of the track and a thousand adrenaline due to the high speed. Quite the opposite. Spintires: MudRunner is a slow game, created by patient people for equally patient people. Or maybe even more. A title where the mud is the absolute master, dictating the rules in its own way, between a pull of the winch, a river to be forded with every possible scruple and lots and lots of wood to transport to its destination. The previous chapter, simply titled Spintires, appeared on PC three years ago and managed to carve out a fair number of enthusiasts who were able to appreciate the many challenges, the physics of heavy vehicles in contact with rough terrain and those rhythms so staid as to make make each mission seem like a real working day, rather than just a fun day. Latest generation masochism or simple desire to hold something out of the ordinary in your hands? There probably isn't an unequivocal answer, what is certain is that MudRunner puts the same cards back on the table with some small news on the content front, but this time we wanted to try to plow the shores of the console sector through the editions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. How do you say? Have you decided to get your hands dirty like the most experienced lumberjacks do? And then please, this way, we'll be with you in a moment. Pure simulation We were talking about getting your hands dirty, right? Here, Spintires: MudRunner is above all this. It is perceived on the skin, while the tutorial scans with proverbial slowness what will be the leitmotif of the entire playful experience. Exactly as happened in the previous chapter, the most successful aspect of MudRunner lies in the faithful reproduction of the characteristics of the terrain and the reactions of heavy vehicles in complex conditions. Accelerating without hesitation to try to speed up times leads nowhere, on the contrary, it is more likely that it proves to be a great way to dramatically expand the time necessary to complete a single task. Proceeding in complete tranquility is the best thing, trying if possible to prevent the wheels of your vehicle from slipping vehemently and sinking into the rough terrain. The game brings back the five sandbox maps already available in the first Spintires, to which are added a new territory and thirteen other vehicles to master. Within each map there are various crucial points that must be reached to facilitate the progression towards the following objectives. For example, observation points must be conquered to make certain areas of the map visible which otherwise would remain mostly obscured, or reach the trucks scattered throughout the territory to unlock them and receive a strategic advantage. As we have said, an error of evaluation or excessive haste can cause critical conditions: in these cases, salvation is entrusted to the winch, which must be made to turn around trees and shrubs, necessary to act as a pivot and get out of the way of the as soon as possible. Moreover, some vehicles are equipped with fundamental characteristics such as the presence of four-wheel drive or the differential lock to improve grip at the expense of control, however, if necessary, it is also possible to set the view from the cockpit to improve driving precision during some moves. However, it seems singular that in a title like this, devoted to painstakingly reproducing the collection and transport of materials, it is not allowed to use the rear-view mirrors to facilitate certain maneuvers when the first person view is activated. In other situations it is preferable to resort to the support off-road vehicle, which however must be adequately equipped at the garage to be useful for the purpose. The camera allows you to maintain a complete view of the situation from any perspective, but needs to be handled with particular care through the right stick of the pad, since the shots are not always as fluid and well positioned as they should, especially if the vehicles are loaded with logs to be transported to the nearest sawmill. Among the many variables to keep in mind there is also the fuel level, for exampleyear-long decrease depending on the required consumption. Evidently getting stuck in the mud or going the wrong way could prove to be quite harmful, so it is necessary to keep in mind the location of the filling stations and support tankers. Another variable of some importance derives from the amount of damage inflicted on the vehicle due to collisions with trees, stones or other materials distributed throughout the maps, also in this case modulated according to the speed and size of the obstacle. In short, in case there were still any doubts, we are in the presence of a simulator with extreme characteristics, which tries not to leave anything to chance and, above all, does not compromise at all in trying to gain the favors of a slightly more vast. Patience is the virtue of the strong Compared to what happens in other simulation titles with heavy vehicles - think for example of Euro Truck Simulator - Spintires: MudRunner almost exclusively favors off-road driving in extreme conditions, where the number one enemy to deal with is mud. The upgrades introduced in the graphics sector have resulted in an improvement of elements such as vegetation or the physics of fluids, which had not been treated in such a wealth of detail previously. The maps also show the alternation between night and day phases; when darkness falls, being able to extricate oneself on such rough terrain can become even more complex, for this reason it is possible to decide to proceed quickly until the first light of dawn, sacrificing a percentage of the fuel that is available at that precise moment. The variations in the weather conditions are always absent, a lack of no small importance given that the atmospheric agents would give greater depth to the simulation experience, changing the cards on the table from time to time and transmitting a greater diversity of the environmental context with which one must interface. Alongside the traditional mode, the Challenge Mode is available, where you have to complete specific objectives on a total of nine custom maps. Alternatively, you can opt for the online cooperative mode: up to three players have the opportunity to collaborate with each other in completing the objectives. Thanks to the introduction of shared save features, the opportunity to continue one's path at will is also guaranteed, seamlessly alternating the solo phases with those moments in which one is supported by some friends.", "date": "2017-11-05", "grade": "7.0"}
