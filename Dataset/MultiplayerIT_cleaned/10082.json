{"name": "Un trip a 8 bit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76207-bittrip-void-un-trip-a-8-bit.html", "text": "The game is available for download on the WiiWare service We have already reiterated several times how the increasingly widespread choice of using a graphic style that recalls the origins of video games as a characterizing element of a new title can be interpreted as a sort of self-affirmation of the video game as a product with its own artistic identity. Clearly, such a choice falls on games that are, in most cases, dedicated to a limited audience such as indie experiments or particularly hardcore remakes. Bit.Trip Void falls more into the first of the two categories, but by virtue of its practically universal gameplay it is a usable and pleasant game for everyone. It is not just a stylistic evocation of the 8-bit period, but a sort of videogame archetype, equipped with a structure that recalls the fundamentals of the video game in its extreme simplicity and immediacy, while remaining current. It is a return to the initial definitions of the interactive game, with a simple object to control on a neutral field and elements to collect mixed with others to avoid, essentially the very skeleton of most modern videogame structures, reduced to a minimum universal. In a way, it resembles the mechanics of Ikaruga, with the fundamental difference of not having the possibility to change the color of the ~ship~. With the analog stick of the Nunchuck (or of the Classic Controller) you control the ~void~, or a black dot that grows by collecting the black pixels (obviously squared and much larger than a modern pixel) called ~beat~, while being careful not to run into white pixels, which reduce the size of the void and cancel the points collected, until the looming game over. Particular, however, the management of the latter: instead of throwing the player directly out of the game after a limited number of errors, the game allows you to return ~to life~ through the Netherworld, a sort of limbo-level in which it is possible recover points and get back on track in extremis avoiding game over. Black and white The rules are therefore simple, it is a question of collecting the black pixels and avoiding the white ones. The void increases in size as the collected beats increase, which in turn makes it easier to collect the beats but which - by occupying progressively more space on the screen - conversely complicates the maneuvers aimed at avoiding the white pixels. In the growth phase the void accumulates the beats sequentially, also taking advantage of the multipliers as its volume increases. When the player deems it appropriate, by simply pressing the A key it is possible to return to the original dimensions by investing the collected beats in points, and starting over with the conquest of the beats and multipliers; therefore it is a strategic choice to play it safe by often resorting to resizing or risk keeping the extra-large dimensions for as long as possible and consequently exploiting the multipliers for longer, with the constant danger, however, of running into the white particles. This is basically the gameplay of Bit.Trip Void, a simple yet irresistible high score race that requires timing and a glance for perfect control of the void between bonus points and impending dangers. The minimalist and chic surrounding style helps to make everything an extremely pleasant sensory experience, amplified by the pulsating electronic music to which the player himself contributes by collecting the beats, resulting in a sort of interactive soundtrack that develops in a similar way to what happens in the legendary Rez. The presence of only three progressive levels makes the game experience a continuous improvement of one's performance, however the race for the high score is heavily affected by the absence of online rankings, while the cooperative multiplayer mode is not a substantial introduction , not going to change the structure of the level design.", "date": "2010-04-13", "grade": "8.0"}
