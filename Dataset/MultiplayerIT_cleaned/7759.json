It's a game all about violence, physical but also psychological, expressed in a perfectly coherent way through every means available to the authors, from the graphics and music to the pounding, fast and obsessive gameplay. A more substantial and articulated sequel, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, is already on the horizon, but in the meantime Sderstrm and Wedin have brought the original chapter to PlayStation 3 and Vita. The team's goal is obviously to reach those who missed the appointment with the PC version, but the ability to play anywhere and at any time could be an excellent incentive even for old fans. Fast, violent, visceral: the three Vs of Hotline Miami for Life A hot phone Being a ~miniaturized~ port, Hotline Miami maintains the same and identical contents of the PC version on Sony consoles, leaving the player in a disturbing Miami of the late 80s. The story, deliberately cryptic and fragmented, takes shape in bites and pieces, through flashbacks and sequences in which the events, as well as the mental health of the protagonist, are constantly questioned. Each mission is introduced by a mysterious phone call with an interlocutor who orders the user to go to place X and ~clean up~. Not the kind you make with tea towels and detergents, mind you. In each of the levels you have to make your way with fists, baseball bats and shotguns, sending to the Creator every bodyguard, every policeman and every guard dog present in this or that building. The most obvious and noticeable difference between the PC and console versions lies in the controls: the two analog sticks thus take the place of the mouse and keyboard, but the size of the sticks on one side and the size of the screen on the other make it much more difficult to aim accurately. Almost impossible in the most excited sequences. These are limits related to the platform and which the developers have tried to remedy through the automatic pointing system, already present in the PC version but which on Vita becomes essential to say the least. In fact, pressing a key allows you to hook the closest enemy, hitting him from afar or facing him better in hand-to-hand combat. If desired, it is also possible to select a specific opponent by simply touching him on the screen, which makes it more intuitive to plan an assault: before breaking into a room, for example, you can lock your aim on one of the enemies present, trample and knock out the enemy. a guard stationed behind the door and kill the friend with the push of a button. Moving a hand to use the touchscreen instead becomes prohibitive when you need to switch quickly from one opponent to another, and it is precisely in moments of greatest tension that the problems of a pointing system emerge which on many occasions ends up hooking the ~wrong~ opponent ~. If on the one hand relying on the aiming system has allowed us to create complex and articulated combos, on the other it has also represented the cause of many anger, thus amplifying the strong trial & error component of the game. Playstation 3 trophies Taking home the Hotline Miami platinum will be a tough challenge for even the most tenacious players. There are few Trophies that are unlocked simply by continuing in the adventure, while most require you to kill certain enemies in a certain way, create complex combos or use the right weapons at the right time. The biggest hurdle, of course, will be getting an A+ grade in every chapter. Miami in black and white Hotline Miami for Vita inherits a not very clean code from the PC version, including a few bugs here and there and a collision system that in certain circumstances acts up: the latter case is especially noticeable if you are too close to the enemy in melee clashes melee, with the consequence that the hitboxes do not cross and the shots go spectacularly empty. Nothing excessively serious or that hadn't already emerged a few months ago, mind you, but this too contributes to increasing the number of unfortunate ~restarts~. As for new content, there is very little iron on the fire: except for support for cross-play and cloud saving, the big news, so to speak, is represented by Russel, a new mask that can be worn all start of a mission. However, where the others mostly give skills and upgrades, this bull-shaped mask applies a graphic filter  la Shindler's List, where everything is black and white except for the bloodstains. Playing Hotline Miami in this way is intriguing for the first few minutes, but after the novelty effect we much preferred to go back to the ~color~ version, also because on certain occasions it becomes difficult to notice the immobile enemies within a rich scenario of objects but completely in black and white. Finally, the Vita version allows you to unlock the EXPOsed chapter, a bonus level which on PC was only usable by those who had pre-ordered the game (or through a small trick): it is a special scenario that the authors created specifically for the Eurogamer Expo and set at the Eurogamer Expo.", "date": "2013-07-03", "grade": "8.3"}
