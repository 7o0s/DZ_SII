But first, a little history. Stronghold is set in a hypothetical medieval England where you play the role of a commander of the rebel forces. Your task will be to reunify England, wresting the lands from the yoke of enemy lords who govern it instead of the king. However, the translators had the ingenious idea (and one should really make a monument of it) of carrying out a total localization job, but they have taken a much longer step than their leg. The voices are all beautifully dubbed, and so far nothing unusual. Their genius lies in the fact that they have transposed the whole story... in Italy! In fact, in the summary screen of the situation of the lands we will be able to admire our boot. So we will end up with Saxon castles in Italy in 1100, Lord Woolsack and Lord Longarm who will advise us what to do, a hypothetical King who ruled Italy (who knows maybe it will be the famous and ~legendary~ Italian king)... One wonders what they were thinking when they decided to transpose the story to Italy. Apart from this ~small~ observation, the game is totally identical to the English version. But... how to play? One might ask.. ~but how can a siege be simulated~? Clearly also in Stronghold we are far from a ~real~ siege, but the abstraction carried out in SH seemed to me very convincing and above all amusing. The game features various game modes and in our experience we focused on the ~history mode~. Among other modes there is the economic one in which you will have to achieve some objectives within a certain time limit, these missions are devoid of military confrontations. It will also be possible to try your hand at some scenarios both from the side of the defender and from that of the besieger. Returning to the ~history mode~ these clearly place you in a siege situation (!!) in which you will have to manage to survive and make the besiegers retreat (the curious thing is that in this way... you conquer territories! A bit as if Constantinople, having managed to keep the Ottomans at bay for years, had managed to conquer Turkey). But... how to play? The game often starts (at least in the first few missions) with the choice of having to place the headquarters and the granary. The HQ is the equivalent of a ~Construction Yard~ which serves as the last beach for your Lord (your personification in the field) who will try to resist to the death. Also, the HQ is where your resources are stored and where your inactive citizens congregate. In SH you will have a maximum number of ~available~ citizens (depending on the number of houses at your disposal) that you can employ in the various tasks. These are created (or leave your castle) at a rate dependent on your population. For example if the food runs out, the ~subjects~ may run away. At your disposal there will be a wide range of structures: the various farms, the woodcutter's huts, the quarries for the collection of stone to be used for food, the mill and the baker, etc. etc.. Everything is harmonized in a very successful mix between Settlers and Caesar. In addition to these structures there will be the possibility of building structures that personify your noble and courageous soul or that impose a harsh regime on the commoners of the castle. You can build hanging posts, cages, dungeons, pyres, various torture facilities, or their friendly equivalents (no, you can't burn people..). These structures serve to increase the efficiency of the commoners at the expense of popularity or vice versa, to increase happiness at the expense of efficiency... the choice is yours. The art of siege But where the game comes into its own is clearly in the military side. The game, as you can see from the images, uses an isometric 2d engine (which offers the possibility to rotate the view) that manages to recreate some really... how to say... moving scenes! Seeing all the various enemies running from the forests with ladders in hand, while your archers start shooting their arrows it's really cool! Ah.. if only everything was done with the graphics of the Dragothic demo from 3dMark2001... but one day... As you may have guessed, part of your job will be to build a defensive system that is up to the task (and clearly lacking in holes.. a wall is of little use if you can safely go around). You will need to identify the probable directionfrom which the attacks will come (often identified by a ~sign~ at the edge of the map) and concentrate on that front. Military units are hired if you have citizens available and if you have the necessary resources (weapons, money, etc.). The little castle builder's kit puts at your disposal gates, stairs to reach the crenellated walls, etc. etc. Correct placement of units will be crucial for your survival (archers in elevated positions and melee units close to walls). The art of siege Sooner or later the moment of the real siege will come, signaled by a threatening message from your enemies. As soon as the enemy units take up positions on your territory (engineers start camping outside the tack and deploying catapults) you will lose the possibility to build the wall. Being the game in real time (but there is the possibility to slow down or increase the game speed), after a few ~months~ the enemy troops will start the assault. And in the assault phase you can see how carefully these parts have been crafted. For example, unlike many other games, in SH your archers will shoot their arrows straight up, as they should in real life (hoping to hit someone) and not horizontally. while the enemies' arrows will bounce off the walls. The bearers of the ladders will try to reach your walls in order to allow the soldiers who survived the arrows to penetrate your castle, while others will try to knock down your wall (in fact, in ancient times, walls were evaluated according to their resistance to pickets and projectiles launched from catapults; it seems, for example, that one of the causes of the fall of Constantinople, whose walls resisted for a very long time, came immediately after the use in the field by the Ottoman Empire of one of the first prototypes of cannons). The success of the mission lies in surviving the siege unscathed. Conclusion There are very few criticisms that can be leveled at these games, but to do so we would have to be too picky, since they do not detract from the gaming experience anyway. For example, it is often a little inconvenient to have to look for some game element hidden behind some wall. Also the ~economic~ model is perhaps a little too simplistic when compared to that of Caesar or Settlers, but Stronghold is not really a ~Sim Castle~. The biggest criticism one could level against SH is that when the action comes... it really boils down to watching your castle being besieged, as you won't have much control. However, despite this Stronghold is still a very enjoyable title and recommended for lovers of the genre! The siege ~simulator~. Stronghold was born from an idea as simple as it is ingenious: sieges! How many of you, playing Warcraft or any other game where siege-like situations are proposed, have said to yourself ~but that's not how it would happen!~. Well Stronghold tries to fill this hole, succeeding very well indeed!", "date": "2001-12-05", "grade": null}
