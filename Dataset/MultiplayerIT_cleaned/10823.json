{"name": "Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disgaea-3-absence-of-justice-recensione.html", "text": "The series of strategic videogames Disgaea became an immediate cult upon its first release: it was 2003 in Japan (and a few months later also in America) when the practically unknown software house Nippon Ichi churned out a tactical RPG so well packaged as to conquer numerous players. The strength of the series, which has earned in addition to the sequels also various portings as well as a good number of spin-offs such as Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdom, has always been not only a very solid gameplay but also, and above all, the irresistible characterization of the characters , crazy to say the least, involved in absurd and hilarious adventures. Disgaea 3 arrives on the new Sony console and we would also be happy if we did not objectively note that it has very little again. Never change a winning team Don't misunderstand, the fact that a product ~isn't next-gen~ isn't a deterrent and a video game can offer exceptional gameplay together with a certainly not exciting technical sector. The problem with Disgaea 3 is not only that it is exactly the same as a PlayStation 2 title sold at the full price of a PlayStation 3 title, but the fact that the structure of the series has changed very little or almost nothing since the original 2003 progenitor , and this both in the technical and playful fields. This is already a positive note that will excite fans of the series: we want to reassure them, Disgaea 3 maintains its strengths unchanged, starting with the complex management of its troops, which can be merged, upgraded and reincarnated repeatedly, in order to create units deadly battleships, equipped with the best skills and spells in the game. Fans of managerial tacticians will find their match in Disgaea 3, thanks to the numerous combinations that can be experimented with and the dozens of extravagant abilities, weapons and spells. Likewise, features such as ~worlds~ inside objects make their return: a series of randomly generated stages that allow you to increase the level not only of your characters, but also of their own equipment. In Disgaea 3, as in the prequels, the possibility of ~grinding~ and accumulating levels of experience and bonuses is taken to the extreme: it is still possible to reach level 9999 for your characters and perform chained attacks that allow you to inflict millions - literally - of damages. The difference compared to the prequels is that the designers have still managed to maintain this peculiar feature of the series, aimed at the more hardcore players, this time without affecting the difficulty level of the game, which constantly offers ingenious strategic challenges in which it is not possible to resort to sheer brute force. It's time to grow up Disgaea 3 is certainly a well-finished game from the point of view of gameplay, despite this, the fact that after six years the softco has made so few changes to simple elements such as, for example, the same menus which are still slow and antiquated. Even from the point of view of pure narration Disgaea 3 leaves something to be desired: the demonic Overlord of the moment inadvertently beats the video game console of his son Mao, our protagonist, who will unleash a real cosmic war against his father out of revenge. Despite the eccentricity of the characters and situations, the plot of Disgaea 3 is rather banal and the dialogues have in a certain sense lost the polish and originality they had in the prequels, perhaps due to now overused gags and a certainly not sparkling like the hilarious one of the first episode to say the least: the same plot comes to life through dialogues - well recited - between static artworks, despite the care for the drawings one certainly did not expect a blu-ray full of cartoon sequences, but an extra effort could certainly be made. What disappoints mainly from a technical point of view are however the real battles: the heart of the game, the visual quality is decidedly disheartening for a console like PlayStation 3. The various stages and battlefields are offered with the usual rotatable isometric view (the camera among other things has many flaws) and denote a certain variety. Instead, the low-resolution sprites have mediocre animations in both quality and quantity, offering embarrassing graininess during camera zooms and rotations; even the most powerful skills and spells leave us dumbfounded: their spectacularity and originality is unfortunately marred by low-quality special effects, poorly finished polygonal elements or static and pixelated artwork. Comment Disgaea fans will love this new incarnation of their favorite franchise, that's for sure. But who doesn't know the series and its bizarreness, how much can ande attracted by a product that in 2009 on a console like PlayStation 3 offers the same mechanics and practically the same years-old graphics? It is a question that is difficult to answer: Disgaea 3 is a good product whose in-depth playful complexity, combined with the various new management possibilities and the numerous possibilities in combat, is certainly a plus in its favor. Lovers of the strategy genre should definitely give it a chance, all the others should perhaps wait for an episode more up to date. Pros Deep and well-finished gameplay Extremely long-lived Cons Plot and characters leave something to be desired Absolutely archaic from a technical point of view", "date": "2009-03-15", "grade": null}
