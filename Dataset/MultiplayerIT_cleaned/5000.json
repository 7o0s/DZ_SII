As befits the Japanese epic, the story of I Am Setsuna starts from a small and remote village and intertwines the fate of an unfortunate but determined young woman with that of the whole world, in the classic narrative progression of the JRPG. The initial condition here immediately appears particular, with the presence of a strange and cruel tradition to be preserved: in the game world wrapped in perpetual snow, every ten years a human sacrifice must be consumed in order to keep the monsters at bay that otherwise would rage everywhere and the designated victim this time is Setsuna, a girl with such an inner strength as to suggest that she is able to change something of her cruel destiny, which she nevertheless accepted with courage and extraordinary grace. The strange encounter with the protagonist, who from hitman becomes adventure companion and witness of the whole matter, unleashes the usual chain of events which translates into a long training journey for the two, to which other characters will be added each, as per canon, characterized by its own background and its own narrative line to reveal. If Setsuna has managed to melt the frozen heart of the mercenary Endir, hired to kill her before the sacrifice is made, the idea is that the sad epilogue of the journey can be averted in some way, or not? This is the question that we carry with us and that pushes us to get to the bottom of the matter, also facing some drop in pace and a certain basic repetitiveness along the approximately 20 hours that make up I Am Setsuna. The game, again, is all in English. Setsuna is still her even on Switch, but in this case it finally presents itself in a portable version Japanese classicism Nostalgia is the concept on which the entire I Am Setsuna project is built, a solution that can be easy but also risky, especially in a game that still requires a rigorous and complex structure like the JRPG. On the other hand, the starting material is certainly impactful, given that the new Tokyo RPG Factory team has the possibility of drawing without too many problems from the cultural background of Square Enix, being a subsidiary, and the references between Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger they are skimped. The reverse of the medal is given by the difficulty encountered by this game in building its own identity, crushed between the weight of an important legacy and the scarcity of means made available by a semi-indie production, since it is a team made up of a handful of people. The personality is therefore entirely entrusted to the fascinating premise that kicks off the story, the snowy settings and the splendid piano soundtrack by the talented Tomoki Miyoshi, who obviously constantly winks at the productions of Nobuo Uematsu. This is enough to immerse ourselves immediately and successfully in the atmospheres of I Am Setsuna, but maintaining attention at high levels throughout the continuation of the story is not easy, given also the lack of particular jolts and the sometimes superficial construction of characters and contour elements. Here the anachronism of the project is probably demonstrated, which claims to recall what were flagship productions, built with significant expenditure of resources and personnel, with a decidedly different pseudo-indie organization that inexorably leads to more modest results. Even the RPG mechanics are strongly derivative: it is obviously a desired element, which underlines the classicism on which this game is entirely designed but consequently makes everything a bit anonymous. We are therefore faced with Square Enix's classic ATB combat system, turn-based and command-based, which allows you to choose between attack, special techniques and use of objects, with the possibility of performing combined actions between party characters. There are a couple of new introductions, represented by the Momentum and Flux systems, which add a layer of strategic planning to combat but only become instrumental in certain moments later in the story. Again, the game lacks a bit of personality, but the idea of a general improvement of the classic system that could provide a good basis for further productions of this type by the team remains. Portable vintage RPG There are no significant technical differences between the PlayStation 4 and Switch versions, beyond the frame ratand that goes from 60 on the Sony console to 30 on Switch, but in a game like this it's a variation that hardly has any actual reflections on the experience. On the other hand, the choice to adopt the same graphic representation of the great classics of the 16-bit era allows for the use of a very inexpensive solution in terms of hardware but also of forces employed in building the game. Therefore, the strengths and weaknesses of the original aesthetic remain, which finds its characterizing element in the perennial winter of its snowy world but which, consequently, loses the variety of settings that is typical of the journey in the classic JRPG. The atmosphere is perfectly successful, but one might think that perhaps a different transposition into video of the splendid artistic work carried out in the preparatory field, perhaps renouncing such a rigorously canonical vision for more daring solutions, such as a more advanced use of 2D drawing close to the initial vision, it would have given a whole other character to I Am Setsuna, even if it probably would have proved much more expensive in terms of production. The only additional and unpublished element for the Switch version turns out to be the Temporal Battle Arena DLC, a sort of asynchronous PvP multiplayer that allows the parties of different players to collide inside a sort of Colosseum for battles. The package is not yet available at the moment but from what is known and from what can be deduced from the materials released it does not seem to represent a large-caliber addition. Instead, what Switch is able to add to the original experience is portability, finally available also in our parts given the absence of an official PlayStation Vita version. Already during the first review, the game's affinity for mobile and small-screen use was noted, now with Switch we can finally confirm that I Am Setsuna is an excellent example of a portable RPG.", "date": "2017-03-13", "grade": "7.0"}
