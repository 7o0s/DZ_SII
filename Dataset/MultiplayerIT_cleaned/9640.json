Well singing players, you will be the protagonists capable of conquering the stage of X-Factor, the worldwide phenomenon TV Show that excites the public through the musical talent of the protagonists. X-Factor, which only a little fascinates those who are viewers and for the most part those who really experience this world between auditions and concerts, becomes a mirror on what the musical world is today, highlighting particular examples of real life that they also create identical emotions in the same reality. Anyone who has had the opportunity to follow an episode of the Talent Show at least once will have noticed that although it is reproduced in several countries and therefore in several languages, one can certainly breathe the same identical atmosphere of tension, joy, challenge and emotion everywhere, faithfully reproduced even within this game: the stage with its light effects, the commission that truly expresses its judgments, the sovereign audience and ~caciarone~ typical of the show. Not to mention the auditions, the emotions that almost seem real and the characters: from the movements on stage to the look, from the words spoken to the judges to the tears if the performance was not excellent. The memory is identical to SingStar, pioneer and main inspiration for the developers of X-Factor, with the only difference that here we find an extra mode where between casting and competition, the winner is decided just like in the TV program, but the vision of allowing yourself a moment of relaxation singing or if you are a professional or presumed one, test your artistic sense and compete as in the real Talent Show. For those who think it's child's play Two game modes: the one called Party and Career; the first is for having fun alone or in company even once, the second is for those who know about singing or have a strong passion that will serve to measure their energy and competitiveness to become a star! But let's analyze them in order. The Party mode is the one that actually - as the name itself carries out - tends to give us a more relaxed and less competitive imprint than the other. Here we are faced with four game possibilities: solo (measures individual qualities), duet (paired with the opponent), battle (challenge with the opponent), competition (to breathe the atmosphere of the competition). Before playing we will have to choose the song, the character and his look. You can choose between Female (Jun, Alice, Nicole, Jamila, Cassie) and Male (Leon, Charlie, Terrende, Kyle) and have fun customizing the look between hairstyle and clothes to be at the top in your performances. At this point you choose to start the competition by finding yourself on stage, between the delirious audience and the judges attentive to the performance. The latter is then always accompanied by a guiding voice - often not belonging to the real interpreter of the piece - which will obviously facilitate the rendering among the typical difficulties ranging from simple to difficult passing through medium skill. After the unquestionable judgment of the commission, a screen will appear which will describe the trend with a numerical total and one as a percentage, highlighting the Best Phrase and the Great Moments. In Career mode there is a path to follow that goes from Star to SuperStar. Here too there is the choice of the character and the song, but what differentiates the Career mode from Party is precisely the exciting intro that presents our path to becoming a star. There is a motivating presentation of the competition, very similar to the TV Show with the same effects and identical musical breaks, from here we start for the ~conquest of the musical world~ through the auditions where you have a second chance if the emotion is came forward, just like a real casting! Multiplayer management is more exciting in Career mode, as this is where you really measure up and get into the part better. The tracks Here is an excerpt of the songs featured in the game. Lady Gaga's Paparazzi, U2's Beautiful Day, Blondie's Call Me, Simple Minds' Don't You (Forget About Me), Queen's Radio Ga Ga, Doors' Light My Fire, Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, You're Beautiful by James Blunt, She's The One by Robbie Williams, All Night Long by Lionel Richie. Considerations and constructive criticism X-Factor is a game that manages to involve everyone because, as we know, singing for better or for worse is an escape for anyone. Declaring that you don't know how to sing therefore, if you are faced with a game, it can be a considerationone not very reliable, because maybe just for fun, you can give birth to an art like this that doesn't really have complex foundations if managed in complete simplicity, like performing the melodic line without the use of particular phrasing or difficult vocals. The study of singing is obviously focused on the particular propensity towards it, combined with solid practical foundations and the fact that it is a complex art is not discussed, indeed it is the only ~instrument~ that manages its parameters in a strictly abstract way, not having complete visibility of what is being done. But the ease of management in the X-Factor game is given by the guide voice which has its pros and cons: if on the one hand it helps in the execution, on the other it has a negative factor which is that of not changing the vocal timbre in based on gender. This, which might seem like an interesting peculiarity, penalizes the player in some way because he will tend to have to adapt to the tone in order to overcome the challenge. We therefore speak of notes ~too high~ for men and ~too low~ for women. Fortunately, however, the pieces under consideration are performed in a simple way and do not weigh heavily on the aforementioned parameters, on the contrary they often enhance the average qualities of the voice. X-Factor is a way to escape from work stress or to have a laugh with friends, for those who simply want to relax and ~let off steam~ with a few more acute notes, which never hurts! However, it is at the same time a way to train the young talents of music.", "date": "2010-11-18", "grade": null}
