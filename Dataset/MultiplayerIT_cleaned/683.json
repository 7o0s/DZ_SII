On Xbox 360 there are many more parameters, physical and otherwise, that you can customize for a very accurate reproduction of your player. The same situation as regards the skills and abilities that can be improved during the career mode by gaining experience. In this regard, we can immediately point out that getting more or less experience in a certain skill leads to a more significant difference during shots compared to the PC edition. The control method cannot be changed with the old ~three click~ style which, although not modern, always guaranteed the best performance, so we will have to get used to using the swing with one of the analog sticks, and set the effect on the ball with each other. Note the possibility of inverting the sticks to facilitate control of the ball even for left-handed players. Comment Ultimately, Tiger Woods' first approach in the next gen version is promoted with reservations, in part due to a series of cuts in the contents and some changes made to the backbone of the game in the PC version, which have not been very successful. On the flip side we find a good golf title already at the launch of the console, with a valid technical realization, especially for those who use high resolution Xbox 360, and a learning curve within everyone's reach. Thanks also to the good performance on Live, Tiger represents a good starting point for the next versions of the title, which perhaps will be able to make the most of all the features of the Microsoft console. Pros: Good Graphics High longevity on live Good sound effects Cons: Content cut compared to the pc edition Rivals Mode is missing Control method not optimal For is better than uan.. Tiger Woods also offers full support for various online game modes, including of course Xbox Live. Online the game is rendered in a similar way to the pc edition, there are no particular problems for timing the shots and the action always remains fluid, without lag problems during our tests. The game modes are the classic ones, and include practically all the variants of the challenge from alternating shooting in pairs, to stroke play through tournaments with standard rules and challenges for the best shot and the like. Up to four players are supported in Tiger for each match, and there are currently no updates or downloadable content planned for this game. Audio and Video want their share.. The graphic realization of Tiger Woods is of a high level, and this sector too was created especially for the Microsoft console. Compared to the PC edition seen on top-of-the-range hardware, the Xbox 360 edition looks good at all, presenting numerous details and certainly pleasant additions. The rendering of the players and faces is very accurate, without any comparison with the Xbox edition, also thanks to the use of high resolution. The facial animations as well as the reactions after the outcome of a hit are more varied than the PC edition, the same situation for some contour details in the levels, such as greater animation of vegetation and water, as well as an audience presence markedly greater. On the negative sides we can notice some slight slowdown in the frame rate during the presentation of certain tracks, which however does not affect the gaming experience, and some animations during the shot and the contact between the club and the ball that could have been made more accurately . Among the most useful graphic additions for the game, we find a much more accurate grid to analyze the green as well as the possibility of displaying an ideal trajectory of the shot on the screen, based on our position. As far as the audio sector is concerned, we can certainly promote the use of Dolby Digital 5.1 in the environmental effects, as well as the commentary on matches, the music remains a bit anonymous but it is not a problem given the possibility of using your own personalized soundtracks through the Xbox 360 dashboard. As we have mentioned previously, one of the technical changes made in the Xbox 360 edition can be found in the realization of the physics regarding the reactions of the ball in rolling and when it can be influenced by atmospheric events. For those used to playing Tiger Woods on PC, it will not be immediate to accurately evaluate and predict what kind of reaction the ball will have on the green, on rebounds or how it will react in the presence of wind. In general, the game mechanics appear as a slightly more arcade version than the PC edition, and there are differences in almost all situations.specific actions. On average, drives will be shorter, long-distance putts will be more easily hit, while getting out of a bunker will be more complicated, just as it will be easier to miss the trajectory during a shot in tall grass. During our test we also noticed a greater probability of hitting the ~lucky shot~ that all golfers dream of in the most complicated situations. For example, what is needed to make a birdie in a par 4, after two wicked shots that made us stay more than 80 meters from the hole. Also present in Tiger are the effects of the so-called ~GameBraker~ which can be activated based on our behavior during the match , and with which we will be able to slightly modify the effects or the trajectory of our shots. Among the various options available, the better management and the increase in the various cameras should not be underestimated, as well as the possibility of having more information regarding the conditions of the circuits, and the possibility of varying the weather conditions more. As with the other exponents of the sports series, EA has brought a version of its golf title to the new Microsoft console, created in parallel with those for older generation consoles and for PCs. In fact, in this Tiger Woods 2006 on Xbox 360 we find a different graphics engine and physics management compared to the 2006 edition on PC, the only one of the lot that can hold up to the technical comparison. At the same time, the main contents have also been revised, and partly eliminated, probably due to lack of development time. Starting from the single player mode, which unfortunately loses the Rivals mode and consequent players and equipment from other eras, compared to the PC counterpart. This choice dictated by time constraints also comes out for usable players, only a dozen, and only six tracks are available.", "date": "2005-12-20", "grade": null}
