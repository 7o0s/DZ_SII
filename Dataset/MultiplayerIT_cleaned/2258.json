{"name": "Max Payne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/max-payne-3.html", "text": "Max Payne or Neo? Max Payne is essentially a third-person shooter that gives the game an uncommon spectacularity. In recent months it has landed on PCs all over the world, after a very long development period, obtaining numerous awards both from insiders and from the public which has decreed a remarkable success in sales of the game. After trying the PC version, I waited with some interest for Max Payne's conversion to PlayStation 2, a game that in my humble opinion is well suited to the tastes of most console owners. But what innovations can this shooter ever contain compared to its illustrious colleagues of the same genre? In addition to the compelling story behind the game, some more or less innovative elements are of some importance. The most important of these is certainly the much-vaunted ~bullet time~, of Matrixiana memory, which allows us to move in slow motion thus being able not only to avoid enemy bullets but also to perform evolutions worthy of the Togni circus. The resulting spectacularity does nothing but increase the feeling of actually being immersed in a John Woo film. The plot itself is developed in a very original way through a series of static images characterized by the classic ~clouds~ typical of comics that we all know. So forget about the FMV scenes because you will find very few in Max Payne. The result is at least unusual and certainly very scenographic and enjoyable thanks to the excellent sound accompaniment of the voices (in English) of the protagonists. Emotion engine - conversions: love or hate? Unfortunately the conversion work must have created quite a few problems for Remedy which found itself having to pay the price for the programming difficulty of the black monolith. The original playability has however remained intact, but it was certainly the graphics that suffered the consequences of a perhaps hasty porting, whose visual impact cannot be compared either to that of the PC version or to the by now high standards of the latest titles landed on the console at 128 Sony bits. But now let's talk about the game in more detail. As already pointed out, Max Payne is a third-person shooter, made spectacular by the settings and evolutions that can be performed in ~bullet time~ mode. Having said that we would expect a control system that allows us to precisely control the character even in the most complicated situations and in fact that's how things go. After the initial, usual, difficulties common to almost all shooters that have arrived on consoles, you shouldn't have too much trouble getting hold of the commands. Using the right and left analog sticks, it is possible to control the movement of the protagonist and the angle of the view, respectively. The L1 and L2 keys are instead dedicated to the Shoot-Dodge (Bullet time of short duration) and to the real Bullet Time while with R1 and R2 you can shoot and jump / perform somersaults. Finally, with the arrow keys you can select the weapon to use, choosing it from an arsenal of undoubted power and variety. It should be underlined that Max Payne supports USB mouse and keyboard, the use of which is recommended for anyone who wants to have more precise control. Shootings, ambushes, traps... Max Payne proves to be damn funny right from the start. Every single action takes on a strong cinematic component and so the numerous shootings in which you will find yourself involved will bring to mind scenes already seen in numerous crime films. And when you find yourself surrounded by five or more gangsters ready to reduce you to a sieve, you'd probably feel doomed if the spectacular and useful bullet time didn't come to help you. With two consecutive somersaults, a couple of backward dives (obviously all in slow motion), you will be able to get out safely from the critical situation without too many problems, especially if you know how to use a lethal weapon such as a shotgun with precision. There will also be ambushes and traps... There are not good times for our hero who, almost without realizing it, becomes not only the most prominent character in New York but also the favorite target of mafia families and the police themselves. I therefore advise you to prick up your ears and to proceed with stealthy steps because an unexpected pitfall can be hidden around every corner. Something went wrong... The graphics, among the strengths of the original game, are probably the most disappointing aspect of this onethis conversion that can only leave a bitter taste in our mouths. Max Payne certainly offers a respectable visual impact but the splendor of the PC version is light years away. The use of low-resolution textures takes away much of the game's spectacularity. It would be all too easy to blame the Sony hardware's inability to reproduce high-quality textures. Many of the recent productions have in fact demonstrated how, with skilful programming, the problem of the limited memory of the PS2 can be overcome by recreating textures of extremely fine workmanship. Even more inexplicable is the weakness of the game's graphics engine, often in difficulty when more than two or three characters appear on the screen at the same time. Even in quiet situations, things aren't all that much better, as the frame rate is consistently below 25fps. Frankly, we expected much more... Fortunately, the tone changes if we talk about sound. There aren't many musics but you probably won't even miss it. The excellent sound effects and the believable voices of the characters do their job very well, practically never disappointing our ears. Despite it all... Despite all the defects that can be attributed to him, Max Payne even on PlayStation 2 convinced me of his goodness. The graphic design not always up to the situation fails to ruin a game that still relies on a winning playability and a plot that is not too trivial. We are probably not dealing with a masterpiece but this is probably due to the fact that on consoles the competition is much more insidious for Max Payne. However, I feel like recommending the purchase without reservations to all those who have not already played it on PC. Bullet time alone is probably worth the full price of the game and I am convinced that it represents an experience that all fans of the Matrix, and not only, must try at least once. Pros: Compelling storyline Bullet Time well done Fun and spectacular Cons: Graphics quite disappointing Uncertainties in the graphics engine Maybe a little short... A man with nothing to lose Max Payne, the man with nothing to lose, has finally arrived on PlayStation 2. The heroic New York cop hoped he had settled the accounts with the underworld of the ~Big Apple~ but he was evidently wrong. Even on the Sony console, the events that led our Max to wage a colossal war against the most fearsome mafia organizations in the city are repeated. If you still don't know the story, just know that each event revolves around the phantom Valkyr, a new synthetic drug with devastating effects that made its debut in New York, accompanied by a trail of heinous crimes. But what role does Max Payne play in this situation? Just under the influence of the Valkyr, some drug addicts break into his home, barbarously killing his wife and son. Unfortunately, Max returns home too late, when the tragedy had already taken place. After getting rid of the murderers of his family, a portentous feeling of revenge is born in him which will lead him to challenge the mafia clans responsible not only for the death of his loved ones but also for the lucrative trade of the Valkyr. A plot worthy of the best detective films that will become even more compelling as the adventure continues.", "date": "2002-01-29", "grade": null}
