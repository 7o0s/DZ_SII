{"name": "Fight Crab", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fight-crab-recensione.html", "text": "We all know how the world of entertainment has evolved, especially in the age of social media. It's all about catching the eye of anyone who looks casually at the screen of their smartphone. The more unconventional you are, the more you go beyond the boundaries of normativity, the greater your chances of carving out that micro-segment of an ordinary person's day and living those fifteen seconds of fame. Surely, a disjointed and chaotic fight between giant crabs wielding lightsabers and pistols is a great way to attract the attention of a large segment of the audience in trance, and the team at Calappa Games knows this very well. They are the masterminds behind Fight Carb, an obviously excessive video game that doesn't take itself seriously and has every intention of appearing deliberately trashy. We've tried it, we've even suffered a little while doing it, but we're ready to share our experience with you in this Fight Carb review. Game mode The first time you start Fight Crab, a shiver runs down your spine, one of those unwelcome ones that appear when you are faced with something extremely unsightly and ~painful~ to look at. Many would stop at that unappealing splash screen, with the game title bobbing up and down at breakneck speed and selected text flashing wildly. However, we wanted to explore the dynamics of this bizarre game further and discovered (to our extreme surprise) that Fight Crab is deeper than it appears. With ~profound~ obviously we don't want to insinuate that we are faced with a new conception of the videogame medium, God forbid, but that the team still wanted to give players something more than a simple map with some reskin of the same crab. Once we have overcome the stumbling block of the menu, we are faced with various possibilities. We can play the campaign or start a multiplayer ~versus~ match both locally (up to two players) and online (up to four players). The campaign mode, playable entirely in online co-op, is divided into seven tutorials (which will unlock as you progress through the main adventure) and six maps, which are themselves divided into several levels to be overcome on ~normal~ or ~normal~ difficulty. difficult~. Each level consists of one or more waves of crabs, which must be defeated by knocking them out. (ie making them end up ~turned upside down~). If the going gets too tough, it's also possible to be accompanied by a CPU-controlled ally, which will make the games much easier. Once you complete all missions on a map (regardless of the chosen difficulty), you will unlock an infinite horde mode where you can face the same opponents repeatedly until you are defeated. Also, once you get about three-quarters of the way through the campaign, you'll be given access to an extra section, which will add three more one-level maps. This campaign mode has absolutely no story and is, despite the amount of levels, extremely short (it took us a couple of hours to complete it in its entirety). Its implementation is, of course, a pretext to introduce you to the combat mechanics, so that you can then throw yourself into multiplayer, where you can even compete in a ranking mode, so as to officially become the most fearsome Fight Crab player (we know you thrill at the mere idea of this gratitude). But the flagship of the accessory elements whose presence surprised us is the photographic mode (all the images contained in this article were captured by us during our games). It's nothing in particular: the usual free-cam that can be positioned as and where you want (even under the pitch, if you like weirdness) with zoom and rotation. However, this photo mode has a very particular feature: you can continue playing in slow motion, so as to better adjust the position of the game elements. So, if you think you've activated the photo mode a second too soon, no problem: just hold down a button and you can slowly and in a controlled way arrive at exactly the moment you were hoping to capture. If you arrived a few seconds later, on the other hand... you missed your chance. You can't want everything. It is already a lot that there is a photo mode. What gameplay! Let's go beyond the bait and switch represented by the large number of maps and focus on what you can actually do within the latter, or fight. Before starting a game, you can choose your crab and the weapons to fight with. At first aWe'll only have one type of crab and our claws to defend ourselves, but as we defeat enemies and pass levels, we'll accumulate points that we can then spend to buy new crabs, weapons or, surprise surprise, increase the statistics of our favorite crustacean. This last feature is now the practice for most of today's games, but we didn't expect to find it even in a chaotic title like Fight Crab. The more points we spend to increase the stats of our alter ego, the more the latter will level up. It must be said, however, that this mechanic, as very often happens in games of the genre, is extremely unbalanced. In fact, it only takes a few points, a couple of powerful weapons (we recommend the Calymore greatsword) and a large and imposing crab to become practically unstoppable. This is also due to the combat system. First of all it must be said that we tried the Switch version. It should be pointed out because Calappa Games has seen fit to exploit the accelerometer of the Joy-Con of the Nintendo console. A bit like Arms' nerd and crippled cousin, Fight Crab allows you to fight using the movements of your arms ~exactly~ as if they were the claws of our fearless fried food hero. To all this must also be added a slow and awkward movement system, which makes it seem like you are constantly sliding on a bar of soap, and a bizarre and ~witty~ physics of the joints and everything they touch. The result, as can be expected from such a varied recipe made up of half-damaged ingredients, is the total randomness of the fight and the compulsive obstinacy on the opponent. In fact, many mechanics are explained in the tutorial: how to parry, how to disarm, how to electrify opponents with claws, how to move one's character and also how to use special powers (which will be unlocked as the adventure progresses and which, being extremely useless, you will use on a couple of occasions, missing your opponent every single time). However, despite the desire on the part of the developers to provide players with a simple and varied combat system, once you get to the ring, of the accelerometer and the total chaos generated by random collisions and fierce artificial intelligence make it practically impossible to fight like in the controlled sequences of the tutorial. Furthermore, if total devastation and ferocious ferocity on the opponent leads to the result in the shortest possible time, calmness and honor easily give way to the most total delirium. Multiplayer Once we get used to the more advanced game mechanics, we can finally throw ourselves into the arms of both competitive and friendly multiplayer, with friends or strangers. In this mode, called ~versus~, we have the possibility to choose whether to play one against one, two against two or even, brace yourselves, watch someone else's match as a spectator! Every day millions of people get out of bed with the desire for a healthy and invigorating clash between giant virtual crabs. In this mode (unlike the campaign, where to unlock objects and crabs you have to visit the shop and spend the points collected in the various levels) every element of the game is unlocked. We can choose any crab, any weapon combo and finally throw ourselves into the fray to lead our hands (or claws) against other strangers who are at least as problematic as us! Ultimately, the multiplayer component is an excellent addition for a title like this, which focuses on word of mouth among players in order to let as many people as possible try the title, even knowing that it will soon end up forgotten by everyone. The graphics that displace The technical sector is undoubtedly the Achilles heel of Fight Crab. Graphically we are stuck between ten and fifteen years ago; every element exudes oldism and tastes stale. The crab models could be a lot worse, but they certainly aren't mind-blowing. It must be said, however, that (again on Switch) the frame rate is quite stable. Sure, it has its dips during fight sequences with multiple on-screen effects brutally meshing into each other. However, to have a decent level of physics, rudimentary destructibility, weapons that spark left and right and special powers that shake everything on the screen a bit, the step towards crashing without restraint after the first three seconds of combat could be very short. And, instead, the title is playable both on the move (provided you manage to overcome the obstacle of poor management of the commands, which lose their accelerometer if played in portable mode) and in front of the TV. In short, definitelythe technical sector was not the goal of the developers, who probably also exalted the lack of graphics of the title to make it even more ~interesting~ in the eyes of users eager to find an over the top game to share with their friends for a laugh .", "date": "2020-10-03", "grade": "5.0"}
