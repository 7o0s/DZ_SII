{"name": "Yakuza: Like a Dragon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-like-a-dragon-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Yakuza: Like a Dragon marks a new beginning for the SEGA series, which introduces a new protagonist and a new setting, but which above all sensationally abandons the action formula that has always characterized it in favor of jRPG-style turn-based combat. It is also the first episode of Yakuza with Japanese and English dubbing, as well as Italian subtitles: an extremely important factor for those who have so far kept away from the franchise, intimidated by the abundant amount of dialogues not translated into our language, and that now it will finally be able to breathe its so typically Japanese atmospheres. History Let's start by saying that the story of Yakuza: Like a Dragon does not disappoint in the slightest and indeed stands as one of the best ever for the SEGA franchise. An incredible result, thinking about it: the development team found itself having to manage and outline a completely new protagonist, after saying goodbye to the legendary Kazuma Kiryu at the end of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, yet they did nothing wrong.Ichiban Kasuga is a young member of the Arakawa family, affiliated with the Tojo clan of Tokyo. Born in a soapland and raised without parents, the boy finds in the figure of his patriarch the father he never had. So, when the boss asks him to sacrifice himself for the good of the group, taking responsibility for a murder he didn't commit, Ichiban doesn't think twice and goes to turn himself in. Released from prison eighteen years later, the man discovers that during this time everything has changed: the Tojo clan has been swept away by a vicious anti-Yakuza campaign carried out by the local government, and his former family has become part of the hated Omi Alliance of Kansai. Incredulous, he tries to get an explanation from his patriarch, Masumi Arakawa, who shoots him in response. Ichiban awakens hours later in the Isezaki Ijincho Ward of Yokohama. Yu Nanba, a former nurse who became homeless, stitched up his wound with makeshift tools, saving his life: a second chance he doesn't want to waste, trying to put aside the past and start a new life in the new city, without however abandon the old habit of opposing injustices. So together with Nanba, the ex-cop Koichi Adachi and the attractive bartender Saeko Mukouda, Ichiban finds himself living a new adventure on the streets of Yokohama, soon discovering the darkest and most disturbing aspects of a city that survives in a precarious balance between the Japanese, Chinese and Korean mafia, submerged in a gray area between legality and illegality. Also a way of exploring new themes, such as the drama of the homeless and the job prospects of middle-aged people, with a dialogue between Ichiban and Nanba in particular that really moved us. However, nothing was really left behind, and thus the events of the campaign of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, made up of fifteen chapters for a duration of at least forty hours, reveal themselves to be somehow connected, in an enthralling narrative plot that does not spare powerful twists and fortunately lets itself go to a few ethical simplifications as we struggle to survive and to discover what is behind Arakawa's betrayal. Setting Although the first chapters see us once again exploring the streets of the fictitious Kamurocho district in Tokyo, while the final ones instead take us to a classic setting for the series that returns as a surprise, the main setting of Yakuza: Like a Dragon is the also fictitious district of Isezaki Ijincho, which takes up the features of Isezakicho and therefore projects us into the center of the city of Yokohama. here too there is a taxi service to move quickly from one point to another), yet at the same time full of commercial activities of various kinds, distracted passers-by, people in need of help (protagonists of the numerous, inevitable sub-quests) and truly evocative landscapes. The Dragon Engine used by the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio certainly has its flaws and at the same time it is true that the settings of the game are based on real places, taking away from the designers the task of creating something new and original, but there is no doubt that walking through the streets of Yokohama, especially in the evening, is a great experience. There is a river that flows to the west of the map, and on its banks we find bars, restaurants and even brothels, while to the south there are parks, decentralized streets, the inevitable mini-markets open 24 hours a day and a few pawnshops where you can sell and buy useful items. The streets pmain roads and the related traffic are no longer passive elements, on the contrary you have to be careful when crossing to avoid being run over. Wait for the light to turn red, maybe. The setting is cut in two by the train station, where we can go in some cases to reach out-of-town areas, after which we approach the commercial soul of the city with a splendid pedestrian course, the Chinese districts, the office area with its buildings and the docks overlooking the sea, while in the distance we can admire the Ferris wheel of Yokohama, always in operation. As per tradition, depending on the time of day the scenario changes substantially. In the daytime we can appreciate the colors of some glimpses and a flatness of the surfaces lower than in the previous episodes of Yakuza, probably due to an improved lighting system. However, it is in the evening that Isezaki Ijincho gives his best, enveloping us in the luminous signs and sounds of his commercial area, in a sort of truly evocative virtual journey. Gameplay The gameplay of Yakuza: Like a Dragon is characterized by the juxtaposition of two different souls. On the one hand we have the traditional exploratory phases, which allow us to visit the length and breadth of the map, interact with commercial activities, enter bars and restaurants for an invigorating meal, as well as buy food and medicines in a convenience store useful to guarantee ourselves survival. Naturally, we will also be able to try our hand at classic minigames such as the SEGA Club coin-ops (represented in this case by Space Harrier, Out Run, Fantasy Zone, Super Hang-On, Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown), karaoke, the batting center, shogi matches and the novelties of PedaLatta (a competition between homeless people to see who collects the most cans), the soporific cinema with its ~great classics~, the multiple choice quizzes of the vocational training institute , go kart racing and business management. The latter represents in some ways a campaign within the campaign: Ichiban offers to manage a family-run business and, thanks to the help of a wealthy friend, manages to make it grow dramatically in the context of a management mini-game in which purchase businesses, hire and train staff, fire redundant employees, and finally tackle fearsome investor encounters. Then comes the widely heralded battle system revolution: when Ichiban and his party encounter enemies, a turn-based battle in which each character involved can perform a single action, whether it is to attack, close in defense, use objects or special techniques that consume the appropriate indicator. The funny thing is that the imagination of the protagonist, a fan of the classic Dragon Quests, ~transforms~ his opponents from time to time into completely insane figures. The graphical interface clearly shows the commands on the screen, translated into Italian, and the progression allows you to familiarize yourself with these mechanics gradually, starting from decidedly trivial battles and arriving in the second half of the campaign to quite challenging fights, which unfortunately will necessarily require of things a pause for reflection and a bit of grinding around the city: a typical flaw of turn-based jRPGs. The system works well, even with its limitations. There are several moves and a literal job system has been introduced, i.e. an employment office where Ichiban and his friends can go to change jobs and thus acquire very different skills, which however we will have to develop and grow in order to to regain the competitiveness we previously boasted. Sometimes the change is convenient, sometimes not: in general, it takes time to understand which setup is best and how to exploit it. The turn-based system enhances aspects placed decidedly in the background in the previous episodes of Yakuza, such as the use of weapons and armor, which become fundamental; but at the same time it ends up highlighting the shortcomings of the series rather than masking them. As we have repeated several times, the formula of the SEGA title is very simple and linear, with movements from point A to point B that are interspersed with fights, cutscenes, subquests and an abundance of side activities that act as an element of distraction . The jRPG-style approach does the exact opposite, sometimes ruthlessly slamming the historical limits of the franchise in our faces. The new combat system also takes away the emotion from the experience. As we have already had the opportunity to write in the proven Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the extraordinarily involved narrationpeople developed from time to time by the screenwriters of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and its ability to carry out the necessary build up in view of a fight are literally wasted due to the fact that in the end of the day it is necessary to think in a detached and strategic way . In short, beating your hands is something else. Job System As mentioned, the protagonists of Yakuza: Like a Dragon can go to the Yokohama employment office and select a different job based on their skills. Each profession is characterized by specific skills, and the interesting thing is that carrying one for a while and then returning to the previous profession results in the retention of some of these skills. Thus Ichiban can go from being a part-time hero to a bodyguard, Adachi can use his experience as a policeman to become a riot officer, Nanba can improvise a songwriter and Saeko can become a stewardess or an idol, for example , but the possibilities are many and the game invites us to experience them all. Playstation 4 trophies There are seventy-one Trophies obtainable by playing Yakuza: Like a Dragon. Many of them are linked to the open world setting of the game and are therefore unlocked by completing the many subquests available, others are conquered by leveling up Ichiban and his companions during the campaign, changing jobs, buying weapons and items, as well as simply walking around Yokohama. Technical realization After trying the PC version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, we were pleasantly surprised by how the game behaves on PS4 Pro. The frame rate in this case is limited to 30 fps which, however, are managed very well, remaining stable and consistent. unlike what was seen in Judgment which had a lot of uncertainties. Considering that the game's scenarios are the best ever seen in the series, this is no small achievement. Beyond the beauty of the Yokohama setting, which we have already talked about, the polygonal models are excellent, extraordinary during the cutscenes but surprisingly detailed and enriched with effects even in-game, which is anything but obvious. If we then add that in the cinematic sequences the lip has been synchronized with both Japanese and English, depending on the selected language, we understand how much care has been placed in this production. After that, some decidedly old-gen expedients persist between more or less invisible walls and level design thrown there, such as the huge and excruciating dungeon that monopolizes the sixth chapter of the campaign and which represents the most striking example of how the turn-based combat system can become repetitive and cloying when we are left with no viable alternatives. In short, the concessions to the old are present here too, there is no escaping. Instead, we have mixed feelings towards the soundtrack, which undoubtedly boasts its own personality but proposes many classic themes again, thus losing the opportunity to refresh the repertoire. Nothing to say about the dubbing, present as mentioned in both Japanese and English: the first is obviously superior, but the second impressed us positively. In all cases, we repeat, the subtitles are also available in Italian.", "date": "2020-11-04", "grade": "8.0"}
