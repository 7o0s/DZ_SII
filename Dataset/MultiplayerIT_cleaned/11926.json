{"name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fullmetal-alchemist-dual-sympathy-recensione.html", "text": "A strange story The game is divided into ten levels, which attempt to (run) the story of the anime. What makes the situation at least forced is that the story mode can be completed in less than 4 hours of play, in which the plot is told above all through cut scenes and interlude videos, given the structure chosen for the gameplay, little inclined to dialogue, let's say. Pretending to insert the 51 episodes of the animated series within the few minutes available was obviously a daunting task, which the developers probably managed to carry out in the worst possible way: the vision that derives from the gaming experience is that the adventure of Edward and Alphonse is nothing but a continuous succession of clashes with increasingly nasty enemies, with chilling macabre implications, and without that human touch and that warmth of interpersonal relationships between the characters that dilutes the deep themes of the anime, evidently judged an expendable part in the necessary history-skimming operation. Those who already know the unfolding of events will obviously know how to interpret the succession of scenes well, but probably won't enjoy it much, given precisely the key chosen for the narration, and the all too elliptical editing implemented, which cuts out fundamental episodes, and recreates sketchy dialogues with fixed scenes and brief exchanges. Those who do not know the original plot, however, will receive from this game an at least confused image of Arakawa's work, and decidedly unsatisfactory. Full contact alchemist The structure of the game can be identified with the broader category of ~action-adventure~, but the most appropriate name is probably that of a scrolling fighting game, and of the more classic school too. In essence, we will find ourselves impersonating the protagonists of the game (the two brothers, initially) who move within two-dimensional horizontally scrolling scenarios. Enemies are coming at us in droves, and all we have to do is punch and kick our way to the bottom of the level. The controls are extremely simplified: with one key you jump, with one you hit: repeatedly pressing the attack key triggers some combos, of a considerably low number. A minimum of depth to the action is given by the possibility of using alchemical powers, through the obvious touch screen interface. By pressing on the lower screen, it is possible to trigger a magical attack (starting with a basic one, but others are added as the game progresses) of a different level depending on the power accumulated by collecting particular spheres, or to create a wall, useful both as protection against the enemies as a support on which to jump and reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The structure of the game can be identified with the broader category of ~action-adventure~, but the name that fits most is probably that of a scrolling fighting game Full contact alchemist These options are rendered practically useless by the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies, for which the basic attack used with good timing is enough, but return rather favorable in the clashes with the numerous bosses that dot the game, the various nodes on which the 'weave. Every now and then we find ourselves facing some simple mini-games, which succeed well in breaking up the otherwise monotonous game action, although none of them is characterized by a particular predisposition to be played more than a couple of times. After the game in story mode you access the ~Character~ option, which allows you to retrace the game using new characters gradually. In these cases, however, almost all the cut scenes and various interludes have been eliminated, therefore the length of the game is further reduced. The title is particularly full of unlockable bonuses and extras, which will surely please fans of the series, such as character profiles, screenshots, cutscenes and things like that. Serious absence, as well as mysterious, given the structure favorable to welcoming the feature, is that of multiplayer. Although the game in some cases is structured on the presence of two characters in action (one of the two managed by the CPU) it is not possible to face the adventure with a companion, neither locally nor (much less) online. Alchemy failed The element that partially saves this game from the abyss is the technical aspect, given the good graphics that characterize it and the sound accompaniment mediated directly from the animated series. The graphics are well cared for, with detailed scenarios and well-defined and worthily animated sprites, especially as regards the protagonists, although it suffers from the common defect of the gameswho of this genre in 2D: the recycling of elements. This doesn't concern so much the scenarios, all in all rather varied and well set up thanks to the various layers of parallax present, but rather the sprites: the enemies have few animation frames, and above all they are often the same models repeated with different colors, just like it happened in the 80s. However, the general aspect is pleasant thanks to the good trait with which the graphics have been built, with an accent shifted towards the ~deformed~ style rather than a serious one, also given the small size of the characters. The sound, on the other hand, is taken directly from the anime, therefore it stands at good levels, at least as regards the music. The sound effects fluctuate, an aspect on which the product generally does not shine. One aspect on which it was reasonable to expect more is instead the sector of multimedia content, which in a video game based on an anime should play an important role. In fact, the structure focuses a lot on collecting extras and bonus content, but these don't offer anything particularly satisfying. It's true that a Nintendo DS cartridge is perhaps not the most appropriate medium to load movies, but some animated scenes in addition to the scanty cut scenes, also given the new compression systems, could have been inserted. All that the game offers are images taken from the anime, of not even excellent quality, and even in the narrative phases the ~movies~ are actually composed of static scenes, associated with a direction that raises more than a doubt. At least, many of these interludes have a dubbing implemented by the same actors of the animated series, and even if the compression is not the best, they let themselves be seen in a dignified way. Comment As if thanks to a sort of anti-philosopher's stone, Bandai has managed to derive lead from gold, transforming an important license into a mediocre video game, botched in many respects. The technical sector, as regards graphics and sound, defends itself quite well, offering a good adaptation of the anime style on sprites and scenarios, accompanying everything with the music taken from the animated series. The big problems concern the very soul of the title in question: the gameplay. In 2007 it's already difficult to craft a 2D scrolling beat 'em up that is captivating, but if you also add poor longevity, ~button masher~ style combat dynamics (repeatedly pressing a single button) and level design and uninspired bosses, success couldn't be further away. The picture ends with a bizarre interpretation of the story that derives from a questionable reduction of the plot of the anime, and a poor quality of the extraludic elements (interlude videos, various multimedia contents) which are fundamental in a game based on such a license. In general an avoidable product, unless you are a really die-hard fan of the series. Pros: Good graphics or decent sound Large amount of extra content to unlock Fullmetal Alchemist (the anime) is a very good series Cons: Prehistoric gameplay and not very satisfying Inconceivable rehashing of the story Poor quality of multimedia contents Total absence of multiplayer Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy is available for Nintendo DS Fullmetal Alchemist is starting to enjoy good success in our area too, thanks to the television programming that has recently begun, but in Japan and the United States it is an anime/manga that is definitely approaching the ~mass phenomenon~ status. Anyone who knows him knows that the story centers on two young brothers, Edward and Alphonse, who find themselves having to do with the mystical science of alchemy in an attempt to restore life to their missing mother: the experiment not only goes wrong end, but heavily disrupts the existence of the two boys, changing their own appearance. From there, the journey in search of the philosopher's stone begins, the only hope of resolving the intricate situation in which they are thrown. Clearly, everything is configured as the classic training journey for the two, who on the way will find themselves crossing an infinite number of different realities and new characters, some good, many others very unfriendly. Hiromu Arakawa's work is not excessively focused on the frantic action, but rather on the relationships between the characters, on the different situations and on the particular charm of a subject such as the ancient alchemy, treated here (as often happens for Western historical themes in Japanese works) in a decidedly romantic and adventurous key. In every respect, Fullmetal Alchemist is far from the continuous fist fight to which this videogame adaptation has reduced ita: Bandai Namco has in fact seen fit to draw from the license in question nothing less than a scrolling fighting game, in a reinterpretation operation that frankly leaves you stunned, more than anything else.", "date": "2007-10-17", "grade": null}
