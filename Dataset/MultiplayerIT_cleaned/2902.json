After all, those who have already dedicated several hours to Warhammer Quest and Warhammer Quest 2 might not go crazy with the desire to try their hand at a new chapter that is completely identical to the previous two. A need that Silver Tower manages to satisfy? Let's find out. Gameplay The basic formula of Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower is the one we know well: a very traditional turn-based strategy in which, in the context of a campaign made up of almost thirty acts, each divided into a variable number of missions, we are asked to carry out specific objectives by moving and attacking with the units at our disposal. It is precisely the presence of targets that are different from time to time to mark a first step in the direction of greater variety, followed by the variable conditions linked to the settings, for example portals from spawning infinite enemies or areas subject to energy blasts that incinerate anyone nearby at the end of the turn. The sensation you get is that of a somewhat simplified gameplay, with much shorter stages and a clear repertoire of actions: our fighters can move and attack, or perform special maneuvers once the time necessary for them to load has elapsed, but further strategic aspects are managed automatically. The biggest difference, however, lies in the interface, which we found not very intuitive and functional, in particular as regards the equipment of weapons and objects, as well as the enhancement of the character. Small precautions are missing such as a sound, a visual effect that underline what we are doing and provide a minimum of satisfaction linked to progression. Structure So let's come to the structure, which in the case of Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower presents a fulcrum represented by the aforementioned campaign, very full-bodied and fairly multifaceted, with a large outline of special events and optional assignments which at a certain point, inevitably, we will have to exploit in order to grow the members of our team. The freemium approach, unprecedented for the series, is already felt after a handful of missions, when you are faced with a first, powerful summoner and you need to have the minimum skills to survive its deadly attacks. Trying to eliminate it without doing a little grinding or reaching into your wallet is almost impossible. We therefore need to spend some time between secondary missions that are inevitably similar to those we have already completed, further simplified in the mechanics, in order to collect the credits necessary to buy more powerful weapons, summon new warriors or enhance those already in our possession: a practice that could bore you. Technical realization On the front of the technical realization there are positive and other less exciting aspects. Among the first we certainly point out the abandonment of the top view, which substantially sacrificed the detail of the characters, in favor of a three-quarter camera which also in this case can be freely zoomed. The various knights, archers and bombers take great advantage of this visual setting, showing off a good set of animations and the various details of their weapons and armor. However, we are not faced with the technological evolution that one would expect from a franchise after three different chapters, and indeed as regards the scenarios it almost seems like a step backwards has been taken.", "date": "2020-09-14", "grade": "7.0"}
