In reality, however, the character created by Apogee Software was born a few years earlier, to be precise in 1991, in the form of an action platform. It wasn't yet the Duke we know today, he didn't show off his dark glasses or face anthropomorphic pigs, but since then he boasted a certain aptitude for destroying anything that came in front of him. We can therefore speak of a sort of return to origins for Duke Nukem: Critical Mass, which presents itself as a two-dimensional action game full of platform elements, made exclusively for Nintendo DS. Initially framed within a trilogy that would also be published on PSP, the game developed by Frontline Studios had a troubled birth, characterized by constant postponements and a concrete risk of cancellation. Last year there was even talk of a change of title and graphics, or the renunciation of the Apogee license; and after playing a few games, unfortunately we can understand why so many doubts. In fact, we are faced with a mediocre product to say the least, which bases its gameplay on botched dynamics and in some situations it almost seems like an amateur project, so many are the ingenuities contained in the single player campaign. How to get some! In the role of Duke Nukem, our goal within the various levels is to eliminate any enemy, save some beautiful girls in difficulty and possibly collect certain objects. The scenario is that of a future where the world has been taken over by alien forces, and so the Earth Defense Forces decide to use the time machine to send the Duke to ~fix the situation~. The structure of the stages is not linear, in the sense that you don't simply have to reach the exit by proceeding to the right, but very often this type of setting appears obscure and misleading, until you see the mobile platform on which we may have to jump to succeed to continue. The controls are the first thing that doesn't add up: instead of adopting the well-established ~action~ configuration that sees the button at the bottom used for jumping and the one on the left used for shooting, the guys at Frontline Studios have inexplicably decided to mix the cards: the A Button to jump, the B Button to shoot, the Y Button to perform a melee attack, and the X Button to throw grenades. The shoulder buttons are used to pan the view left or right, revealing the entirely polygonal nature of the graphics, which are in fact 3D masquerading as 2D. The maneuver of moving the view turns out to be very useful, given that the enemies tend to shoot us when we have not yet framed them on the screen, thus making any attempt to dodge their shots in vain. Using the default pistol or a series of additional weapons, we will have to get rid of them and achieve different objectives in each of the available maps, until the mission is completed. Near the alleys we will also be able to penetrate the scenario sideways: Duke Nukem will lean against a wall and a reticle will appear on the screen to open fire on the enemy who is trying to get us out of that position. From the very beginning there is an almost total lack of balance, so much so that the fights are ~suffered~ due to how badly represented they are, and the only way to survive is to collect a medical kit from time to time. This does not mean that the level of challenge is high, unfortunately, but that the basic dynamics of the firefights are in many ways distorted. Variations on the theme Unfortunately, even less brilliant variations alternate with the 2D action sections. The first is represented by shooter phases where the action takes up both screens, with Duke using a jetpack to clear the city from above with a machine gun and a missile launcher (the latter is not actually visible, so the missiles pop up out of who knows where). At this juncture, the control system shows new questionable ideas, in particular the use of the back keys to rotate the position of the character and thus allow him to hit targets that are on the side or in the lower part of the screen. Shooting an enemy from close range starts an alternate animation in which the Duke takes off his opponent with his bare hands, but as soon as that sequence ends we're dropped back into the action as we left off, and the effect is terribly sloppy . At the end of the stage a boss appears who throws projectiles of all kinds at us, but which we can easily dodgere seen that his movement routine is simply moving from left to right. Defeated in this first phase, the second variation of the gameplay starts and the game becomes a sort of third-person action game, in which our movements are however limited to a small fence. It is at this point that we have to eliminate the boss once and for all, moving continuously to dodge his blows and at the same time trying to hit him, in a horrible roundabout often characterized by blocks against invisible obstacles and approximate controls. So, is there anything that saves in Duke Nukem: Critical Mass? Perhaps the musical accompaniment, of discreet workmanship. For the rest, this new Duke's adventure turns out to be really bad, and it's a shame because on paper some ideas relating to the fusion between 2D and 3D could have been interesting.", "date": "2011-05-24", "grade": "3.0"}
