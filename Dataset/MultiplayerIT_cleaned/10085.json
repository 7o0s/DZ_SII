In fact, Combattimenti Fra Giganti is not only a videogame (or rather, a series of three videogames: this one dedicated to insects, one for dragons and a future one that focuses on dinosaurs), but also a line of toys that can already be find in shops, as well as a Magic card game, also already present in newsstands and comics stores, a deck of which you can find, just as an incentive, also in the packaging of any of the DS titles. Had the human race survived? Rightly, in this article we remain in the videogame field, also because the card game is still not widespread and it has not been possible for us to test its mechanisms... We are in the usual post-apocalyptic future, and this time it is an asteroid which, deviating from its course, has disrupted life as we know it. The human race has totally died out and it is the insects, which the changed conditions have made real giants, who have inherited dominion over the Earth: we thus have giant spiders, giant scorpions, giant mantises and half ants-half giant flies, in an atmosphere that partly resumes, partly mimics the naive and romantic Godzilla-like catastrophic science fiction (the original one), and with excellent results, as we will see shortly. The structure of the game is simple, as required by the rules of a good casual game: once you have chosen which of the races present to play, you wander through labyrinthine (but never too much) levels viewed from above, looking for the boss of the particular area, facing the other creatures present and obtaining particular gems which are then spent, between one level and another, to enhance one's insect (by acquiring new powers or increasing the strength of the four parts into which the body of each creature is divided), or simply to change the color and some small aesthetic details. All movements are made exclusively via touch screen: so, if moving around the level is immediate, the question becomes a little more complicated for combat. The four parts above (head, tail and the two forelimbs) can perform attacks if the player touches them with the stylus and draws a line towards the opponent; instead touching the body of your insect and then moving to the right, left or backwards dodges and parries are performed. Finally, landing two or three hits without being interrupted by an opponent's attack triggers the possibility of the combo and of an extremely powerful super-hit, to be carried out simply by joining the points that appear on the screen. An insect got into my eye! Apart from the occasional inconvenience, the controls described so far prove to be agile, immediate and fun, making both exploration and, above all, combat very enjoyable. Great credit also goes to those who took care of the technical department: the graphics are particularly surprising, inspired on an artistic level and surprising on a technical level, with a quantity of details and polygons that make much more famous productions look bad, and very convincing animations of the insects , all without almost ever losing the necessary fluidity. The sound, on the other hand, stands out for how spot on it is, reproducing with music and effects that science-fiction disaster film atmosphere we mentioned earlier. The title is also endowed with a certain longevity, thanks to medium-length levels and present in forces, not excessive but still forces. Replayability is also stimulated by the presence of more creatures with which to face the adventure, even if the differences are not that marked, as well as by the inevitable multiplayer mode for up to 4 players. However, the game suffers a bit from its own structure, which is rightly simple and immediate, and which however does little, during the levels, to offer a minimum of variety to the player; thus also the difficulty, calibrated downwards given the target to which the product is addressed, registers a curve that is not very steep. Nonetheless, Ubi's insects present themselves as an excellent meeting point between games with an overall traditional structure and the ~new wave~ of titles intended for an extremely vast audience, and the presence of the ~Starter Deck~ of the connected card game can be a good incentive to enter the world of the Giants of the French house: we will see how this operation, undoubtedly new and interesting in the videogame industry, will end up...", "date": "2010-04-09", "grade": null}
