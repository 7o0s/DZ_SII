IO Interactive made us tread the couture catwalks in Paris, took us to the Amalfi coast on the trail of a dangerous pathogen created in the laboratory and finally pushed us to the coasts of Morocco, in the midst of a political crisis. Now it's time to pack your bags again, destination Bangkok, while the pieces of a somewhat bizarre mosaic begin to take shape in the head of Diana Burnwood and her agency. The new appointment has been available for download since last August 16 and can be purchased individually at the price of 9.99 euros. Exactly as was foreseen for the appointments of Sapienza and Marrakech, the only indispensable package is the introductory one, while the intermediate chapters can be set aside or recovered at a later time. The fourth episode is also accompanied by patch 1.13, which introduces further corrections and improvements of a general scope. The map of Bangkok is the least inspired of those proposed so far 27 is the perfect age to die if you're a rock star The place where the fourth episode of Hitman takes place is the Hippaman Resort, a prestigious structure located on the banks of the Chao Praya River, near Bangkok. Jordan Cross, frontman of the indie rock band The Class, is hosted within the luxurious walls of the complex. The brilliant artist seems to have a few too many skeletons in his closet, and it is precisely because of a dark past that Agent 47 is on his trail. In the short briefing that precedes the mission, Diana informs us that about a year earlier, the emerging actress Hannah Highmoore died when she fell from her penthouse in Brooklyn, just as she was in the company of Cross. Police investigations have suggested it was a fatality, but the girl's parents are not at all persuaded by the reconstruction of the investigators and intend to go through with it. Meanwhile, the public has become convinced that Cross has escaped responsibility thanks in part to the considerable influence of his father, the media mogul Thomas Cross. As always happens in Hitman episodes, we also have a secondary target, this time played by the lawyer Ken Morgan. Defined as a very astute and unscrupulous subject, it is above all thanks to his services that Cross was cleared of the accusations that had been made against him. In short, the Highmoore family demands revenge and, having not obtained answers from the law, the services offered by the ICA are the best way to put an end to the matter once and for all. The Hippaman Resort map takes us back to a unique context, very similar to the assignment we completed in Paris. Compared to Sapienza and Marrakech there are fewer variables: the environment is reduced to a single building, while the external areas are limited to the atrium that leads towards the pier and the edges of the garden on the sides of the property. The entrance is suggestive, going up the stairs you reach an imposing hall, where large glass vaults and a massive amount of decorative trees cover the entire surface area. The rest of the structure unfolds between catering corners, bars and corridors leading to the suites, but with the right disguises one can also enter the basements, or reach the higher floors which are reserved for the band's recording studios. Although the glance is not bad at all, the location seemed to us to offer a bit too limited room for maneuver, also due to the density of the subjects distributed in the rooms, too low to blend into the crowd at the first hitch, but at the at the same time too high to be able to get your hands dirty without being easily identified. The strategy is also often questioned due to the limited escape routes and reduced concealment opportunities of downed individuals. Playstation 4 trophies The Bagkok Trophies are once again seven and follow the same line already seen in the previous appointments. We have the three objectives related to the story, the one that foresees the completion of all the opportunities, the obtaining of the maximum level in Escalation, the choice of a starting position and an additional resource in the briefing of the mission and finally the achievement of the maximum Professionalism. An atypical tourist The Bangkok mission comes with eight new assassination opportunities that, as usual, allow you to engage targets in many different ways. Our assignment began on the hotel dock, amid moored motorboats and attendants carrying suitcases. Psite the elegant entrance stairs we immediately met Ken Morgan in the company of his trusted bodyguard. Just as the lawyer was busy making inquiries at reception, we decided to pursue the first of eight different assassination opportunities available in this episode. Once we had retrieved the requested message, we disguised ourselves as an attendant to accompany the unsuspecting guest to the imperial suite. With a pinch of patience, and after having finalized some pedantic requests of our goal, it was possible to exploit the opportunity: so good old Morgan received a free apnea lesson at the bottom of a five-star toilet. Back downstairs we learned that The Class's official drummer was due to be replaced by one Abel de Silva, who was waiting in the restaurant lounge and had yet to meet Cross in person. Agent 47 then had the opportunity to take his place and meet the target without too much effort. After the pleasantries, and a fleeting but improbable performance on drums, Cross asked us to follow him on the roof overlooking the main hall, to discuss business. Not even the time to let him formulate the proposal and the musician was already a silhouette drawn on the floor below. As you may have guessed, there is no shortage of bizarre or particularly scenic solutions here either, although the overall impression given to us is lower than the two previous attempts. Thanks to the new Escalation mission, entitled Somsak's Equation, some additional objectives are then introduced to be completed in progression. The first level involves eliminating one of the cooks working in the hotel, while the next steps require the combined killing of three individuals, the concealment of the corpses in the icebox positioned at the back of the kitchens and finally the completion of all the tasks precedents without ever changing the dress worn at the beginning of the mission. Finally, the fourth episode adds another assignment belonging to the Sarajevo Six missions which, we remind you, are available exclusively for PlayStation 4 users. In this case, the target is John Stubbs, also known as ~The Veteran~, a mercenary who retired to private life and is on vacation at the Hippaman Hotel with his wife.", "date": "2016-08-22", "grade": "7.5"}
