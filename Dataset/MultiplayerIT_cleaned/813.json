Having chosen one of the many available scenarios (or even free play) we will find ourselves faced with a management system that closely resembles the long series of Tycoons (Railroad, Pizza, Restaurant etc. etc.). Here we are, therefore, intent on finding the personnel necessary for every aspect of production, installing the various machinery in our multi-storey building which will be our real headquarters. For the rest, the game mechanics are literally identical to those of the other management systems: great attention to the budget, cost containment, targeted investments to grow in a healthy way without the risk of crack. More rampant than Ricucci The more unusual our products and services will clearly be to offer to consumers: from the call center for hard numbers, to physical ~supports~ for our sexual activity (don't get me into details), film production, creation of sexy lingerie, calendars and magazines. Each product must be followed in all its aspects, both in financial terms (selling price) and in terms of content (such as magazine cover, video editing). An important aspect to note is the total lack of vulgarity of the game: no explicit sex or overly risqu poses. If we exclude some ~nature~ photos, we are faced with a title that is certainly frivolous and spicy but far from porn and/or hard core. Erotic Empire is undoubtedly not a millionaire production and it is perceived above all in its audiovisual component What did I do to deserve this scrolling? Erotic Empire is undoubtedly not a millionaire production and it is perceived above all in its audiovisual component. In 2005 it is very difficult to find a PC game in which you cannot choose the resolution or some graphic parameter and instead EE is the exception that proves the rule. If the general visual level still stands at an acceptable quality (the functional term is the most appropriate), the same cannot be said for the operation of scrolling on the screen: the player will have to pay excessive attention to where to move the cursor to move the framing. Better results do not come at all from the alternative setting in which by moving the mouse to the extreme parts of the screen, arrows will appear to be pressed to move. An absolutely uncomfortable and not very immediate solution. The sound is decidedly ~winking~ and lends itself well to the ~liet motif~ of the game but does not go beyond the function of pleasant background. Pub Company with Erotic Empire tries to tease management lovers, offering us the classic mechanics of the ~Tycoon~ series in the world of eros. As we already did many years ago in Lula Sexy Empire, also in EE our task will be to create a real hard multinational. Let me be clear though: Erotic Empire never descends into vulgarity or extreme sex, stopping at a few ~risque~ clips and a few ~nature~ photos in a decidedly ironic setting. The very classic gameplay is easily assimilated even by newbies and after a few minutes you will have the feeling of having always been experts in the sector. A pity therefore having to point out a technical realization which in general does not go beyond the meaning of functionality but which presents a very annoying problem in the management of scrolling on the screen, a very annoying defect and which the programmers should have absolutely eliminated. Despite everything, however, Erotic Empire snatches a very narrow pass, also thanks to the very low price with which Leader has decided to market it in Italy. A title capable of eliciting a few laughs in the company and also within the reach of non-habitual gamers. Pros Easily assimilable gameplay Ironic, frivolous, spicy but never vulgar Very low price Cons Fans of the genre may find it elementary Irritating screen scrolling management Those expecting a hard three XXX game will be disappointed Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex! One of the arguments that most easily raises the audience of TV programmes, newspaper sales, the number of cinema tickets for a film with some rough scenes, in the world of videogames is still at the marginal limits of productions and if we exclude some cases illustrious (I am referring in particular to what happened with GTA San Andreas), the ~sinful~ titles can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Sureseldom the most famous sexy video game star (if we exclude Lara Croft, but she is an archaeologist by profession...) is certainly Lula, the protagonist of many games and with the most heterogeneous characteristics (from a pinball machine to a tamagotchi-like). Erotic Empire has many elements of one of those titles: I'm referring in particular to Sexy Empire, where Lula was the queen of a production house of hardcore movies and we, as managers, had to try to create a real sex empire!", "date": "2005-10-11", "grade": null}
