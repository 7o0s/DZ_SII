I see many perplexed and doubtful faces, let's go and reveal the mystery, the frenetic action accompanied by the parallactic scrolling of the floor, the special moves, etc etc could not be done, both for reasons of memory of the phones themselves and for not turning an adrenaline fighting game in a session of kabuki theater at one frame per second (even if Honda rigged with kumadori was just fine), what to do then? You know Dragon's Lair or Dance Dance Revolution? Well, the two opponents face each other and cyclically small numbers appear in unpredictable areas of the screen corresponding to the key to press at that instant, if you are on time your character will inflict a blow or make a providential parry, otherwise the enemy will have the upper hand , the moral is ~right key at the right time~.
