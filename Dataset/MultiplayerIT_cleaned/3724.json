Valkyrie Anatomia: The Origin, protagonist of this review, is a good example of this new organization by Square Enix, on paper very efficient as it is based on the exploitation of the famous historical catalog of the label but with titles declined more precisely for the fruition mobile. It is no longer a question, or at least not only, of taking old RPGs and adapting them to a new interface, now we try to build the gaming experience by modeling it on mobile use, however maintaining some historical characteristics of the company between settings, stories, characters and atmospheres. Valkyrie Anatomia: The Origin is presented as a prequel to the Valkyrie Profile series (which has long been absent from console scenes) and the fact of being based on a brand of this kind and of such high value even among nostalgics is enough to distinguish the game from the countless similar titles present on the mobile stores. Because in fact, with all the positive things that can be said about the care taken in the construction of the story, the charisma of the characters and the good functioning of the combat system and party management, the problem is that this is just another mobile JRPG free-to-play with fights interspersed with dialogue scenes, concentration on the evolutionary aspects of the characters and the inevitable use of the gacha system for the purchase of new elements to add to the roster. In short, from a structural point of view nothing different from Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner, Epic Seven or even Final Fantasy itself: Brave Exvius, however between the charisma of the Valkyrie series and the care put into the creation of this mobile game we can find different reasons to seriously consider it compared to the flood of competitors. The power of the Valkyrie The combat system and the structure of the quests, all set on progressive battles interspersed with narrative moments in the form of dialogues, are borrowed directly from similar titles, as is the access screen to the various components of the game (story, quests, special events, management of characters and summons), therefore Valkyrie Anatomy: The Origin fits perfectly into the well-defined canon. It must be said that the game was originally released in Japan in 2016, so rather than riding the trend, it can be said that it helped shape it, but for us Westerners at this point the substance does not change. In particular, the combat system is very similar to that of Brave Frontier and is based on touching the various party characters in order to carry out chained attacks between standard and special moves, with the need, especially in more advanced levels, to study the sequence with which to make the fighters attack in order to maximize the damage with the combos. As we have said in the past, given the absolute equivalence of the structural characteristics with other exponents of the genre, the evaluation of this type of game depends above all on the interest aroused by the setting and story and by the honesty of the progression system, in the deep mechanisms of the gacha and the evolution of the characters. On the first aspect we can give an absolutely positive opinion in no uncertain terms, on the second we can glimpse a rather honest model, between energy duration and drop rate of the characters in the gacha, but it is difficult to give a definitive evaluation after a short time and with possible future adjustments arriving. In any case, there are no obvious injustices regarding the complex of free-to-play and micro-transactions. There are also particular elements in the quests, with the characters to be moved within a 3D map considering the expenditure of AP for each move. This imposes a minimum of strategic planning in the exploration of the environments, often equipped with crossroads and ramifications, which impose the choice on investing AP for additional movements that can lead to the discovery of treasures or not, or face fights or avoid them by following different paths. because once the AP is exhausted, you have to resort to waiting for the energy to recharge or to the classic micro-transactions. The evolution system of the characters and weapons is a bit cumbersome, as often happens, but from this point of view the depth and quantity of content is guaranteed for those who intend to immerse themselves in the game, butWhile the evocation, whose subdivision between weapons and ~artifacts~ (i.e. the additional characters) is not entirely immediate, seems to have quite accessible drop rates, with the whole economy of the system based on gems, found in good amounts just by playing, and on various additional materials to apply for upgrades. Where Valkyrie Anatomia: The Origin proves superior to many other titles is in the construction of the setting, characters and story. Although the narration takes place in a rather mechanical way, through pre-set dialogues, the story is fascinating and engaging. It is a dark and powerful story, full of clichs as is often the case with RPGs but interesting and enriched by references to Nordic mythology, demonstrating how Square Enix on this front has a decidedly different step from many other competitors. The 3D graphics are very basic in the exploration of the map, becoming more detailed in the combat phases, with a good realization of the characters and their respective animations but they are rather the 2D illustrations, also thanks to the splendid original character design of the series by by Kou Yoshinari, which give the game a very special characterization.", "date": "2019-04-12", "grade": "7.7"}
