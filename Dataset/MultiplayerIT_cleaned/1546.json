{"name": "Cidiverte: Collezione BIS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cidiverte-collezione-bis.html", "text": "Hidden & Dangerous Deluxe You will have to deal with numerous original weapons and you will be able to use everything you find along the way (such as weapons stolen from your victims or vehicles conquered following a fight). The structure of this game made school and soon became the standard used by all the best known Tactical FPS. By commanding every single element in the first person, you will be given the opportunity to switch from controlling one character to another. The characters, so to speak, without a guide, will be guided by the game's AI following the instructions you have given. These orders (6 in all) cover the basic functions of the soldier, ranging from ~maintain position~ to ~open fire on any enemy in sight~. At the beginning of each mission, having become aware of the details of the missions provided at the time of the briefing, it will be up to you to choose which of the elements made available to you will be most useful for your purposes. Each character has a characteristics sheet, useful for identifying the most suitable for the mission at a glance. For example, if the superior orders require you to eliminate a particular enemy, perhaps positioned inside a well-protected square, a soldier with good aim could come in handy to whom you could entrust a sniper rifle to allow him to carry out a sniper action. Everything is placed in your hands and you will have to know how to manage even in the most desperate situations. Thanks to the implementation of the multiplayer mode, you can also enjoy the opportunity to collaborate via LAN connection in teams of 4 players, also taking advantage of the real-time voice chat included in the deluxe version. Personally I have to admit that taking up the title after a few years, all the emotions felt in my very first approach to the title re-emerged in me, with the addition of a total revision of Artificial Intelligence (a bit lacking at the time) and of a whole series of improvements made over the years by the various patches. The whole is completed by the presence of an editor (definitely dedicated to expert users) which will allow you to create your own ever more compelling maps and missions. Now H&D, in this elegant Deluxe version, presents itself as a mature title, free from particular flaws and always fun. If you want advice, think about it, if you want to make your own a really good game, take advantage of this opportunity. 4x4 Evolution 2 If off-road driving is your secret passion and above all if you passionately love off-road driving, 4x4 Evo 2 has arrived for you (yes, I admit it is a slightly unpronounceable title, but what can you do?). In this game, re-proposed by Cidiverte in a comfortable (and convenient) economic edition, you can get behind the wheel of a powerful off-road vehicle and leave your opponents and friends in the dust. Developed by Terminal Reality, already known for the ~Madness~ series, which deserves credit for having given birth to titles such as Monster Truck Madness, 4x4 Evo 2 follows the path taken by its predecessors and re-proposes the theme of crazy racing and reckless aboard vehicles that are not exactly conventional. Taking advantage of a booklet of more than 70 really existing vehicles (from nine different manufacturers) and a total of 32 4x4 tracks, Evo 2 offers a varied series of exciting game situations. The main feature of this genre has always been that of being able to choose whether to follow the route or improvise new shortcuts, traveling far and wide, without limits, the entire map. This feature, combined with the possibility of being able to make improvements to the car by changing and installing components such as wheels, shock absorbers and GPS, make the title truly attractive and amusing. It's certainly not a game dedicated to an audience hungry for extreme realism, but it won't fail to surprise with its vivacity all those looking for a car racing game that is a bit out of line. The proposed game modes will allow you to try your hand at simple tastings through tracks to be played individually, or in real championships thanks to which you will be able to grow your fame and above all you will be able to advance the development of your car by continuously making additions and improvements. The ~career~ mode will allow you to choose the path to success, providing you with various ways to advance in the game. 4x4 Evolution 2 Starting with a rather limited budget and without any car, you will in fact be asked to proceed with the purchase of your first fuoristrade. Inside your personal garage you can check the status of the car and make your changes, buying new parts (if your resources allow it) or calibrating the set-up. At this point you will have to work hard to earn money. You can choose whether to run in more or less prestigious races (as tradition dictates) or throw yourself into something more original (and even more challenging) such as the ~Mission Mode~ thanks to which you can participate in different types of missions such as rescuing a village razed to the ground by an earthquake or the delivery of medicines for a hospital isolated by a storm. The quality of the graphic effects is truly remarkable, the title has been greatly refined compared to the previous chapter and features remarkable light effects, an excellent variety in terms of textures. Finally, the high number of shots available combined with the possibility of viewing the replay of the match (and saving it to be able to see it again later) make 4x4 Evo 2 a truly amusing game, which allows you to get lost most of the time in improbable acrobatic maneuvers rather than following the actual race. A rich range of game modes like the one presented in this game combined with a good level of realization make this title good material for a successful purchase. If you are looking for fast thrills, immediate fun and you are looking for all this in a car racing game that does not feature the usual bland cars then trust 4x4 EVO 2. Tropic: Paradise Island This game is the key to making one of the most widespread dreams come true: to be the absolute master of a remote Pacific island where you can fulfill all your wishes. A direct descendant of Tropico, this Stand-Alone expansion will allow you to relive the fantastic experiences offered by the first title with some interesting additions and numerous ~tuning~ operations. On Tropico you will play the role of a dictator, a maximo leader in the style of the well-known Castro or Peron. Everything on the island is your property. First you will be asked to reconstruct your historical background by describing how you came to power, what politics you follow, what your strengths and weaknesses are. Through this hilarious rediscovery of your origins you will set your position on the international level, which will influence the future dynamics of events on your island. Once all the parameters have been defined, the game opens to a bird's-eye view of your island; from now on its fate and that of its poor inhabitants is totally in your hands. The choice is yours on which road your island-state will take to establish itself internationally and allow you (let's not forget it) to make you enormously rich and powerful. Since it is a management game, and not a strategic one, life on the island will go on even without your intervention, while the economy and social balance will depend entirely on your actions. Tropic: Paradise Island The population will be able to approve or disapprove of your choices, strike if it deems it necessary (unless you intend to use military force against the protest marches), and you will have to deal with the elections that will show how wise your conduct has been . Obviously you can cheat and try to falsify the votes at the polls or use some other not exactly democratic method to assert your reasons. You can lean on Soviet communism and set up your economy on agriculture and military support for power, choose the fascist path of armed repression and a hard line with the population or throw yourself on capitalism, doing everything to get into the good graces of the CIA and boost your industrial and tourism sector. I find this title, in its originality, simply brilliant and very engaging, almost surpassing Tropico 2 in many aspects related to the setting and the variety of actions. Those who found titles like Beach Life amusing, or have already tasted the beaches of the island with the first version of Tropico and want to deepen their experience, cannot miss this train. Everyone else is advised to at least try - it's worth it! A brief, very last comment should be dedicated in general to BIS, the ~economic~ line proposed by Cidiverte. The games covered in this article are part of a series that currently has 13 titles. Being a ~budget~ series, the package has a rather minimalist and modest appearance, inside you will not find the manual, which can be downloaded, however, from the official Cidiverte website. In eachthe gesture of re-proposing such glorious titles at a price that is truly accessible to all seems noble; an initiative which, moreover, has been giving positive results for some time and reinvigorates the pockets of the market dissatisfied with the excessive cost of PC titles. However, it is impossible to give a single vote to a series of so different games. We can reward the choice of titles included in the BIS collection, both for variety and quality. Hidden & Dangerous Deluxe For those of you who are not informed enough, Hidden & Dangerous can be considered the forerunner of modern-day Tactical FPS. Today Cidiverte offers you the opportunity to devote yourself body and soul to this game, presented again in the Deluxe version, which, in addition to containing the original title, complete with expansion, presents a series of improvements capable of giving new life to a product that is still very current . Updated to work flawlessly under the most recent operating systems and featuring graphics dusted off and softened by spectacular additions such as dynamic shadows, not present in the original title, H&D Deluxe will not fail to awaken in you an irrepressible passion for strategic shooters. The aim of the game is to command a handful of soldiers, made up of up to four elements, guiding them through more than thirty missions. Set in the midst of World War II, H&D will make you experience the most exciting war situations, leading you to carry out sabotage, eliminate Nazi leaders, save prisoners and partisans. Through carefully detailed maps you will test your command and fighting skills.", "date": "2003-09-05", "grade": null}
