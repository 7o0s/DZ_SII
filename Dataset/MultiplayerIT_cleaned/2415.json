{"name": "Dexter's Laboratory: Robot Rampage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dexters-laboratory-robot-rampage.html", "text": "THE TITLE IN YOUR HANDS The game expects you to take on the exploits of a nice protagonist by deciding one of the three ~robot-suits~ that he can wear (not that it will generate any changes in the game mechanics, but it's good to know). The aim of the title is to complete 4 levels with increasing difficulty, each consisting of 4 stages. To complete a stage it is necessary to recompose all the pieces that create the secret code, which you will find behind orange doors imprinted with the symbol of a test tube; once you have the required amount, you can move towards the end of the level (either high end or low end). Scrolling is multi-directional even if levels usually have a vertical dynamic; you can move between the various floors via air ducts, stairs or elevators. A flood of robots coming out of the blue doors will try to stop you, even with their deadly lasers. Don't despair because to defend yourself you can, as well as crouch or jump, shoot. The weapons will change: you will find them inside some orange closets together with some energy refills. You will have several lives available, in turn made up of five hearts. Some actions will be fatal, such as being crushed by elevators or taking too long falls. Among the most interesting things you can do, I recommend shooting the chandeliers: you will generate some interesting light changes. The graphics are nice and ~cartoonish~ even if repetitive, the design of the various levels does not change excessively so everything soon becomes monotonous. However, it should be emphasized that there is some flickering too much and given the relative simplicity of the product, greater attention would not have hurt. The screens that illustrate the plot are well done, given that the title is still an animation license it was reasonable to expect it. The sound flounders in the average of the products. LET'S LOOK INTO OUR EYES Here we are at the dawn of videogaming: an almost similar structure that repeats itself over time, like SpaceInvaders, even if now you can hope that sooner or later the game will have an end screen with respective victory. Mind you there is nothing wrong, the problem is that the fun is not to the nth degree and that the product is definitely aimed at a very young audience for the money it costs; perhaps another mini-game would have helped. Surely the game is above sufficiency and presents a serious challenge in the last level, granting it a modicum of longevity. If you are a lover of Tetris and similar structures, I suggest you take a look at it, trying it beforehand, otherwise, if you are not interested in this gameplay, skip ahead. Pros Cartoony and nice If you love this gameplay you can replay it for a long time Cons Monotonous level design Poor title to be bought at full price Links Nintendo Gameboy UbiSoft CartoonNetwork WarnerBros Taito Bam! Entertainment THE PLOT THE CONFESSIONS The game is licensed from an animated series that you can watch on CartoonNetwork, a satellite channel. The undersigned confesses that he does not have a parable, indeed he considers television as a console monitor with no other function, ergo I have never seen the animated series in question (I trust in your clemency anyway). In any case, I will tell you the misadventures of poor Dexter, who has seen all his robots reprogrammed by his enemy Mandark, so that they kill him. Now the brave Dexter will have to wander around each level looking for the secret code that brings everything back to normal. To do this we can count on a valid ally: the manual in Italian, which always fills us Italians with joy.", "date": "2001-08-24", "grade": null}
