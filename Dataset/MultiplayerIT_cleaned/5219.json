A conclusion open to possible sequels and (according to many) rather hasty, however, left a bad taste in the mouth of more than one fan, giving rise to countless fears related to the management of the DLCs. The risk of seeing a more satisfying ending in the form of paid downloadable content was after all real, despite the inevitable discontent that could be unleashed with such a choice. A fortune therefore that the developers of Eidos Montreal have got smart and, at least for now, have averted the danger with their first DLC dedicated to the main story: System Rift. This ~piece~ of adventure (easily activated from the ~Jensen's Stories~ menu) does in fact very little to give more concreteness to the conclusion of the campaign and is linked to a completely different part of the game, putting a charismatic old acquaintance back into the field. Having therefore dispelled any doubts about the mismanagement of the plot, it remains to be seen whether this new adventure is worth the price of the ticket and how much it actually manages to enrich an already brilliant structure in many aspects. We reviewed the first Mankind Divided story DLC: will it be the update the campaign needed? Hi Frank The ~return~ we talked about in the introduction is that of Frank Pritchard, supporting actor of the good Adam Jensen in the previous title of the saga and linked to the protagonist by a strange relationship of hate/friendship (to put it in Japanese, Adam and Pritchard behave a bit to ~tsundere~ with each other, but few will understand this). Jensen has some outstanding debt with Pritchard, and obviously the hacker sees fit to exploit this for his convenience, involving our favorite enhanced agent in a series of events that will lead him to deal with the powerful organization known as Palisade as well as with one of the most renowned hackers in the world. So, if you hadn't understood it from the premise, here the storyline is not designed to reveal great secrets about the fearsome organizations of the game or the mysterious antagonists, but manages to give more concreteness to the Breach mode, adding interesting elements to the world of Deus Ex . In short, no script attacked with spit, but not even unimaginable revelations, and this desire to fly low also seems to have repercussions on the gameplay, which deviates very little from the precepts set by the basic campaign. In fact, the novelty here is not bombastic powers or game sessions never seen before, but a large primary quest that ends in an armored building in the Palisade, highlighting the main strengths of the gameplay of Mankind Divided. If in fact the first phase is rather linear and in some cases forcibly simplistic (seeing hidden posts defended by low-level IT protections in the house of the most fearsome hacker in Prague is really weird, but it is an understandable stretch for the sake of progress) , once you enter the Palisade building things change radically for the better. Agent Jensen Infiltrations are after all the most successful part of Eidos' work and the addition of a new six-story building full of guards, cameras, turrets and drones certainly cannot be evaluated negatively. The ~blade~ of the Palisade is a complex and well-managed structure, full of passages and alternative routes that make the most of Adam's various specializations, even reaching areas where his most efficient and abusable abilities are ineffective. It's a nice change of pace from the slow first few minutes, capable of being more entertaining than most of the other missions; there is only one not negligible problem: it lasts very little and one constantly gets the impression that a similar phase should have been part of the base game (or at least be released for free). In fact, the mission entrusted by dear Francis lasts just over two hours if faced calmly and with the will to explore (it can also be completed in an hour if you go straight to the point), very little justifiable timing if you evaluate the price of the package . Its nature as a narrative glue, then, makes it seem more like a missing piece than a real addition, a sensation further amplified by the marginal gameplay tweaks we mentioned earlier. With the purchase of the season pass, the content undoubtedly acquires greater meaning, but it remains a ~taste~ rather than a real DLC, satisfactory only because it is built on already granite foundations. The fact that the DLC is detached from the primary campaign was not enough, while forcing the player to choose carefullyhow to specialize, is an annoying limitation, which prevents those who want to face the Blade of the Palisade from having total freedom of approach. Eidos Montreal could have done much more.", "date": "2016-10-19", "grade": null}
