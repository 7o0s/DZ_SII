Paid explorations Although at first glance it could be dismissed as yet another Temple Run clone, Nono Islands is actually a decidedly different product. The objective of the game is to bring the protagonist explorer safely to the end of the various levels by making him walk on a path made up of hexagonal platforms. By tapping on the lower part of the screen, the character advances one square, while a swipe to the left, right or down will move the character respectively to the side or onto the platform immediately behind him. It is an undoubtedly simple and intuitive control system, which nevertheless also opens the way to some annoying problems: in fact, it happens that the software does not correctly understand the command given, or that the forks in the path are not clear enough to make the user whether it is necessary to go forward or turn. However, ending up outside the path is not the only cause of death in Nono Islands, on the contrary: with the exception of the very first introductory schemes, each stage is full of dangers such as traps and various little monsters, which cause the game over at the slightest contact. Some of these may be avoidable by proceeding with caution and analyzing their movement patterns, but many fully fall into the category of trial and error, thus revealing themselves as pitfalls so unpredictable that they cannot physically be overcome on the first try. There would be nothing wrong with all of this if only Illusion Labs hadn't explicitly exploited this element to push the in-app purchases of the product, represented by the tokens used to place a checkpoint at the beginning of the level you are about to face: the the few units made available at the launch of the game end very soon, leaving the user faced with the need to dip into the wallet to buy more and not be forced to redo entire stages in the event of a game over. It is a frankly idle and obnoxious sales model that numerous other mobile titles have shown they can overcome without however affecting the developer's sacrosanct right to monetize their work. Nono Islands has some good intuitions that are however held back by some unfortunate design choices It's not all gold... These aspects inevitably end up diminishing the value of a product which, with a little more attention, could certainly have had its say in the current mobile panorama, strengthened by a concept that is in any case valid and original enough and by a fair amount of content which particularly favors the replayability. In fact, each level has collectible elements placed in more or less difficult to reach places which reward the user with substantial score bonuses, and the calculation of the final evaluation also includes the speed with which the finish line is reached: those who love challenges he will therefore find bread for his teeth in Nono Islands, assisted by the inevitable online rankings that certify his performance in the world ranking and in reference to the friends of the Game Center. Also from a technical point of view, the work of Illusion Labs is certainly appreciable, albeit more on the graphic front than on the sound one: the title has a lively and colorful cosmetic appearance, with very different levels both in terms of conformation and quantity and type of obstacles present, while the audio sector could certainly benefit from some more music and effects. In the end, however, what prevails is a certain bitterness for a mobile game that has not been able to transform its good intuitions into a well-balanced package in all its various components.", "date": "2015-07-23", "grade": "6.5"}
