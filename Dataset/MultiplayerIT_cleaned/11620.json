{"name": "Cubis 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cubis-2.html", "text": "Puzzle games have always been linked to the world of mobile video games. A bond that is based on important and practical elements, above all the immediacy that distinguishes the genre and the ability to work even on technically obsolete devices. After all, Tetris has sold millions of copies despite using few colors and a handful of pixels. It is clear that many software houses, with these assumptions, have for years been looking for an idea that can repeat that resounding success, and Cubis (now in its second episode) is just the umpteenth attempt perpetrated in this regard. It is a title that brings to mind a classic of the past, Columns, but only for the presence of colored cubes and the need to combine them: the approach, in fact, is completely different. The game gives us the opportunity to try our hand at a number of different modes, which share the same basic mechanics: moving along the two front faces of a three-dimensional table, we have to ~launch~ colored blocks in order to bring together three or more of the same delete them. Generally, the objective of each stage is to make a certain number of blocks marked with a star disappear, which are always located in the innermost areas of the ~pile~. What differentiates Cubis 2 from other puzzle games is the presence of different blocks: in addition to the standard ones, of a single color, we will find some ~double~ ones, others capable of transmitting their color and still others capable of slipping under those already present, to grow in height. Furthermore, it is clear that the three-dimensional graphics were not placed there by chance, nor for mere aesthetic purposes: the game structure makes extensive use of the three axes and very often one finds himself unable to see the block just thrown because it is finished ~behind~ the foreground elements, which may be stacked on top of each other. You have to build your own combinations in width, depth or even height, the important thing is to eliminate the outermost blocks to reach the hidden ones and be able to complete the stage. The substantial difference between the various game modes lies in the arrangement of the initial elements, which can appear in the form of even complex geometric figures, which must inevitably be ~disassembled~ paying close attention to making the most of the empty boxes, the ones in which we will place our blocks. On a technical level, the game looks very good: the graphics are full of colors, very well designed, with an excellent 3D effect and a series of animations that make the action much more interesting. The table is located within a well-crafted scenario, with the cubes that can be launched from the two front faces and which project their trajectory before being placed. The interface shows us, in the lower part of the screen, the next three blocks we will have to deal with, while in the upper left we can check at any moment the number of marked cubes to be eliminated, as well as the time left to complete the stage. Lastly, the number of moves made up to that moment appears at the bottom right. As far as the sound is concerned, we have a series of good quality music (with a volume that can be adjusted independently of the phone), which do their job well to accompany the action without disturbing. The control system is extremely simple and is based on the use of the joystick and the FIRE (or 5) button only. PRO Well designed and very colorful graphics A good number of internships and modalities It is an atypical puzzle game AGAINST Mechanics more complex than average Only for fans of the genre Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-02-15", "grade": "S.V."}
