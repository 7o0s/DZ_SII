{"name": "Crash: Il Dominio sui Mutanti - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-il-dominio-sui-mutanti-recensione.html", "text": "Crash Bandicoot, the original for PSone, marked the beginning of a successful career for Naughty Dog, capable of nailing characters and mechanics so good as to conquer millions of people in one fell swoop. The game presented itself as a platform with out-of-parameter graphics, without exploratory ambitions (the scrolling of the stage was predetermined) but with really solid platform elements. The transition to the next generation, with PlayStation 2, was unfortunately not managed in the best possible way: the series passed into the capable hands of Traveller's Tales, but the team struggled to rediscover the charm of the first episodes and the critics did not welcome these productions enthusiastically. Despite this, even on PS2 the Crash Bandicoot games have sold millions of copies. In short, it would have been a shame not to recover such an important and deeply rooted franchise among fans. It is for this reason that Vivendi Universal Games has decided to entrust Radical Entertainment with the task of renewing the series, which the Crash of the Titans episode (released exactly one year ago for all systems) has done more than decently. We therefore have a new Crash (more ~jaunty~ and naive, but with the usual crazy look), his sister Coco, the omnipresent Aku Aku and his strong friend Crunch, who live happily on the island of Wumpa and occasionally have to face the threats of the lunatic on duty. In the case of Crash: Domination over Mutants, the threat comes once again from Neo Cortex: the evil scientist, allied with Nitrus Brio, has created a device that is ~advertised~ as a multimedia device, but in reality takes control of wearer, turning him into a mutant. The Bandicoots are targeted, and only Crash can fix the situation... The return of the titans Those who played Crash of the Titans will certainly remember the possibility of controlling a whole series of creatures with different powers: Crash had to hit them until they were stunned, then make them ~wear~ Aku Aku to take command of them. It was an element that was strongly proposed right from the start, perhaps showing us too quickly all that the game had to offer from that point of view. In Crash: Domination of Mutants, the possibility of controlling the titans still exists and is concrete, given that in fact the creatures have been completely renewed, but it is fed to the player in small doses, together with an upgrade system capable of radically change the skills of our character. In terms of controls, things have practically not changed: Crash moves using the Nunchuck's analog stick, performs a combo by repeatedly pressing the B trigger and jumps with the A button, while the Z and C buttons are respectively for the attack powerful and to parry the blows of enemies. Shaking the Wii-mote allows us to resort to the good old rotation, which performed before a jump gives us the possibility of reaching otherwise impossible heights. For the fight with the titans, the possibility of dodging attacks has been introduced (by pressing the Z button at the right moment) to take advantage of any favorable situation, but in reality, playing on the medium difficulty level, it will be unlikely that you will have to resort to it: the opponents will go down without too many stories, revealing a calibration of the challenge decidedly aimed at a young audience. Strolling merrily As far as collecting objects is concerned, Crash: Domination of Mutants is truly extraordinary: once again there is the cursor on the screen similar to Super Mario Galaxy, and by moving it we will be able to collect all the gems that are in the vicinity of the character. Hitting plants or flowers (with plenty of pollen coming out...) to conquer new power-ups is a really fun practice, and to this we must add the possibility of digging tunnels in the ground at certain points: Crash will thus be able not only to collect more gems, but also finding shortcuts to hidden areas of the stages. The locations boast a truly inspired design, with a feast of colors and above all with a series of possibilities that can only be accessed if you have the right titan. For example, the first creature we'll be able to control has the ability to turn water into ice, and we'll have to use this power to build passages there on various occasions. In another case, we will find ourselves in command of a sort of chick obsessed with Michael Jackson (fantastic when, the first time we meet him, he performs in a themed ballet...) and endowed with telekinetic powers: he will make us capable of activate switches remotely as well as knock down columns to turn them into bridges to previously unreachable areas. As mentioned above, the titans will be presented to us in a much slower and more progressive way than in the previous episode of the series, but an exceptional job has been done in terms of their variety and their characterization. Technical realization Tested on a Wii connected via component cable, Dominion Over Mutants is undoubtedly one of the most graphically successful titles ever seen on the Nintendo console, so much so that on certain occasions one gets the impression of playing with the version for Xbox 360 game. Of course, this is due to a precise stylistic choice and to the particular design of the levels, which on the nextgen consoles gain in detail but without creating the monstrous gap to which multiplatform products have so far accustomed us. The polygonal models of the main characters are the same seen in Crash of the Titans: nice and well animated, with the protagonist who has gained in ~freshness~ compared to the classic episodes. If visually the low-level opponents do not appear very inspired, the same cannot be said of the titans, who have been renewed for the occasion and boast a truly exceptional baggage of skills and moves. The presence of a fixed view, which cannot be managed in any way, could make some people turn up their noses, but in reality it does not create particular annoyances except when you have to retrace your steps. The jumps are precise, given that it is possible to adjust through the shadow of the character, and the locations are overloaded with inventions and devices that are used to overcome certain points: at this juncture, we must applaud the imagination of Radical Entertainment. The graphics engine manages to handle everything without problems, with excellent fluidity (we are talking about thirty frames per second) which decreases only during the most crowded situations. And can we talk about the animated sequences? An incredible job has been done to get that humor that characterizes certain American cartoons, moreover drawing the scenes with a different style each time, paying homage to the classics of Western and Eastern animation. From this point of view, it is clear that dubbing represents an extra weapon: Aku Aku, who acts as narrator and gradually explains what to do, has the voice of the excellent Giorgio Melazzi (you will remember him for a famous commercial), while Neo Cortex is voiced by an outstanding Wizard Forest. The sound is also characterized by nice effects and really spot on music, with a curious and irreverent vein. Comment While not bringing any particular innovations compared to the previous episode, Crash: Domination over Mutants is undoubtedly one of the best platformers available for Wii. The developers have wisely blended solid gameplay and excellent technical realization, with the icing on the cake represented by a truly excellent Italian dubbing. There has been a clear improvement in terms of level design, with the stages overloaded with devices and inaccessible areas, to be visited several times in order to access all parts of the map. If we want to criticize this type of setting, it must be said that we often find ourselves in difficulty precisely because of the lack of precise indications: perhaps we have to go back to an area but we proceed with attempts, with the risk of replaying sections from scratch already extensively explored. If the ~backtracking~ bothers you, you have to take it into due consideration, together with a cooperative multiplayer mode which unfortunately leaves its time and adds nothing substantial to the experience. Ultimately, those who enjoyed Crash of the Titans should not under any circumstances miss out on this sequel, much more substantial and richer: given the average quality of multi-platform Wii games, it would be a mortal sin. Pros Colorful, fluid graphics, full of funny gimmicks Excellent dubbing in Italian Solid and varied gameplay Against Difficulty calibrated downwards The quality of the map makes backtracking difficult Fixed view", "date": "2008-12-20", "grade": null}
