This does not mean that Sony has forgotten that the effect of nostalgia still acts powerfully in the hearts of players, and while the various chapters of the Jack & Dexter series have also returned to PlayStation 4 a few days ago, after having patched a few months ago in company of Parappa's remastered, now LocoRoco 2 is not missing either. Yes, precisely that LocoRoco 2 that was released as an exclusive on PlayStation Portable in 2008. A very specific exclusive, among other things, which exploited the portable console to offer a very particular gaming experience, based on crazy music, excellent level design and funny colored creatures. The conversion to a fixed console could be seen as a stretch, and instead re-proposes an extremely valid title, making its strengths even more evident, if possible. MuiMui versus Moja Moja Don't worry, we have not become dysgraphia: the names you have just read belong to some of the species that populate the curious world of LocoRoco 2 Remastered. Being a sequel to the first chapter, the story starts right where it left off: the Moja Moja, ~Afro~ little monsters similar to black clouds, after their defeat they trained for years, honing their singing skills. Now they are ready to launch a new attack on the LocoRoco world: their song is able to steal life, colors and music from the planet, imprisoning its inhabitants. But our heroes certainly don't stand by and watch: helped by the MuiMui, humanoids as tall as mushrooms, the LocoRoco return to hop here and there for every nook and cranny of the planet, bringing the colors (and the music) back to their rightful place . It's hard to say exactly what a LocoRoco is, but a first glance will be enough to make you fall in love. Although they can take various forms and shape their bodies at will, the little creatures are colored balls capable of jumping, singing and actually doing little else. Because the player takes care of the rest, through an intuitive control system adapted to perfection for the console's DualShock 4. The game mechanics are extremely simple: by pressing the R1 and L1 back buttons we rotate the level view, tilting it respectively to the right and left. The LocoRoco adapt to our actions, starting to roll along the slopes we have created in the level, using effective and functional physics. With the combined pressure of both keys it is then possible to make them jump, and the longer our pressure will be, the higher the creatures will be able to reach. But the LocoRoco are not just colored balls that we will launch at random in the game environments: they have the ability to divide and amalgamate according to the circumstances. Each level starts with only one LocoRoco available, but by collecting red flowers along the way we can make his fellows appear, until we have a small army at hand. With the Circle command the LocoRocos merge into a single larger specimen, with all the benefits (and disadvantages of the case). Each situation will require the exchange from one version to another: in passages that are too narrow a gigantic LocoRoco will never be able to pass, so we will need to divide it into many small creatures. In turn, when these balls are separated they are more difficult to control, also because they all move together at the same time, and it is easy to leave a few behind, ready to become the meal of a Moja Moja. Heartbreaking situation. Playstation 4 trophies Despite the duration of the title, the LocoRoco 2 platinum trophy will prove to be quite a challenge for players. Apart from completing the adventure, it will be necessary to collect all the collectibles, unlock and complete the MuiMui House to the maximum, and also show that you are good at the other mini-games. With a little time, patience and a pinch of skill, however, we should be able to do it. More alive than ever, even after ten years Publishing LocoRoco 2 on PlayStation 4, ten years later and individually, is the result of a very simple reasoning. Already in its time LocoRoco 2 was a ~more of the same~ of the first chapter: bigger, more beautiful, more fun, without altering or adding anything significant. What was the point of making a remastered that included both? Might as well relaunch first one and then separately the second chapter, the highest result of the series. In this way, among other things, the price has remained extremely low, equal to that of a pairof pizzas on the plate. Let's also add that the weight of the years has not caused any damage: the game mechanics are original, still fresh, and the adaptation to the controller can be said to be completely successful. Even the graphics have been almost completely overhauled, and now LocoRoco 2 can be enjoyed in excellent high definition on the standard PlayStation 4 and in 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro. Why ~almost~, then? Because the care that has been reserved for the title as a whole has not also come from the cutscenes, which have remained identical to those of the PlayStation Portable. Among the many colorful and heated videos and game sessions, out of the blue films relating to the story arrive in a definition that cannot be lowered: a real eyesore, the only real flaw of the remastered. In all other respects, however, LocoRoco 2 is more alive than ever, and above all, it is as fun as we remembered it. The 26 game levels are tackled one after the other under the banner of cheerful and imaginative music, for a total duration of around six hours, unless you take the collection of collectibles and timed challenges personally of the various worlds. In this case, the title manages to prove difficult even for the most elderly players, and not only for the particular controls: the collectibles hidden by the MuiMui can really be hidden anywhere, and there are no indicators of any kind to show us the way. To unlock certain areas of the levels, then, you have to sharpen your wits and imagine how we could exploit the surrounding environment, whether or not to divide the LocoRoco. In some cases, a precise number of little creatures is needed, and if we have lost someone along the way due to a thorn or a Moja, we will have to start all over again. There is also no shortage of valid additional modes, halfway between the extras section and the actual mini-games. For example, we can use the stamps collected in the various levels to decorate postcards with a LocoRoco2 theme, whose white spaces must be filled using exactly the stamps designed by the developers; or we can improvise as manager of the MuiMui's house, making the little creatures work to build new objects and customizable elements, once again exploiting the resources collected in the various levels. And what about the mini-game Nyokki NyoNyokki, which despite an unpronounceable name offers immediate sessions in the style of ~catch the mole~?", "date": "2017-12-13", "grade": "8.5"}
