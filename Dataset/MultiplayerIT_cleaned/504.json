{"name": "NHL 2K6 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2k6-recensione.html", "text": "The coolest game on Earth! Punctual, 2K Games shows up at the annual appointment with the traditional simulation of Hockey for consoles, this time without even the task of going head-to-head with EA, given that for the moment the giant from Redwood City has not presented itself to the appeal of the puck on Xbox 360. The 2K series of hockey simulations has always stood out for the solidity of the gameplay, and for the accuracy in reproducing the sporting spirit in videogames. Leaving aside certain derivations particularly based on the violent component of this sport, which have led several titles to include almost fighting game characteristics in some cases, with great attention paid to the famous ~fights~ on the frozen field, this title is instead extremely sober and realistic. There is obviously the possibility of hitting opponents, but everything remains within the normal administration of a real game, without sensationalist exaggerations. It can be said immediately that this is the best hockey game among the very latest releases, both for playability and for the completeness and realism of the simulation, however it has some evident problems in the technical realization and in the harmonization of its various parts. The amount of options is truly enormous, just as the franchise mode remains excellent, which incorporates and improves all the managerial component already present in the previous chapter, obviously with all the rosters of the official teams updated to the latest season. Also present is the multiplayer mode via Xbox Live, the backbone of 2K Games sports titles and an inexhaustible source of motivation to pick up the game again. This NHL 2K6, a game with a title resembling a tax code, presents itself as a good bridge between the tradition of the series, now in its sixth episode (also considering the episodes published by Sega, also developed by Visual Concepts), and the projected future in the new generation of video game platforms, a title that promises, and bodes well for the next. Let's see how. you can define this as an episode halfway between the previous and the next generation NHL Something is changed The structure of this NHL 2K6 faithfully follows that of past episodes, but introduces interesting innovations within the dynamics of the game itself, albeit in a somewhat chaotic way. What comes to mind when playing this title is that several good new ideas have been introduced, but have not yet been implemented in a completely organic way within the gameplay, therefore this can be defined as an episode halfway between the previous ones and the next generation NHL, as demonstrated by the positive test of NHL 2K7 presented in preview at the recent E3. Of course, taking the pad in hand and immediately starting a game, it is not easy to notice the difference between this and any of the previous titles in the series, also thanks to a questionable technical realization which we will talk about later, but taking care to calmly try the new game features you will realize the increased depth of the simulation. The most striking feature is the practically complete management of the goalkeeper, through a particular system that allows you to switch from the normal shot from above, including a large slice of the field and the players in the action area, to the view from the goalkeeper's shoulders. By simply pressing the right analog during the opponent's attack phase, we will therefore be able to take control of the goalkeeper and follow the action from his point of view, with a particular display showing a colored cone in front of the ~goalie~: when this is green it means that we are positioned correctly with respect to the disk and the action, if it is red it means that we are leaving the door uncovered. The moment the opponent shoots, the action slows down (yes, just in bullet time style, it's becoming a habit...), and a red mark will appear on the goal to represent the point where it will go place the disk, while we will take care of moving the cursor that has just appeared so as to cover that point, and foil the goal. Something is changed It is in itself an excellent idea, which creates an interesting diversion as well as allowing greater control by the player in every phase of the game, but in the heat of the action it is still a bit cumbersome: the clear transition from the normal view to the one from behind the goalkeeper at first it creates a bit of bewilderment, and in any case this framing makes the representation of the action chaotic. Other points against, the lack of realism deriving from the slow motion during shooting and the fact that the framing remains fixed on the goalkeeper until the right analog is pressed again, so even if our defenders recover the puck, we will remain in the goalkeeper's shoes until we realize it and press the fateful stick again. Even the immediate call of the teammates is a novelty that could have been implemented better: pressing the right analog in the attack phase, each player of the team will be assigned a key, so that the simple pressure of this key translates into a direct pass to the designated character. The only problem is that this feature is also always connected to the pressure of the analog, which must be pressed again to exit the mode, which makes the action somewhat cumbersome. The new introductions inserted in a more harmonious way are instead that of the ~Enforcer~ and immediate strategies. The ~enforcer~ is the element of the team most dedicated to ~hard~, physical and borderline foul play. If this character is used properly, this will intimidate the opponents who will begin to lose shots, while the ~on the fly~ strategy is the command to be given to the team connected to the digital cross: each direction corresponds to a particular order in which to organize the team such as defense, attack, ~pressing~ etc. Team management The care with which the ~Franchise~ mode of the game was created is surprising. Basically, it's like having a management game inside a hockey simulation, with complete management of the team: from signings, to exchanges, to player careers. All this, combined with the possibility of carefully training the various elements of the team with exercises aimed at developing certain characteristics in each player to the detriment of others, makes for complete control over every aspect of the team. You will thus be able to buy your players, and have them train in order to create the perfect formations to be deployed on the pitch at the right moments, also trying to develop the ~alchemy~ element, i.e. improve the agreement between the various members and consequently the game team. Waiting for the next gen From a technical point of view, in particular as regards the graphic rendering, NHL 2K6 does not represent that generational leap that one would reasonably expect from Xbox 360. The rendering of the field and the polygonal modeling of the players is very similar to that seen on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, which makes it difficult to find a motivation to buy the version for the next gen Microsoft, which is also available on the market at a significantly higher price. If you are lucky enough to have an HDTV you will be able to enjoy the new effects inserted in the graphics engine, such as certain special effects added to the textures of the shirts, equipment and player skins to make the various materials more realistic, but if you have a normal TV not high definition, the difference with what should be the ~old gen~ is difficult to notice. The same feeling given by the skates on the ice and the consequent movements of the characters on the pitch are strongly reminiscent of what has already been seen, giving the sensation of being faced with an almost direct transposition from Xbox/PS2: we would expect more from 2K Games, hoping that in the next chapter know how to implement that leap in quality that will make players feel truly inside the next gen. Even in the surrounding elements such as menus and various interlude screens, there is a certain general sloppiness, which makes browsing among the rich options and settings rather monotonous and tiring, which is aggravated among other things by the non-renewed agreement with ESPN, which thus could not provide its typical familiar graphics to every NHL fan. The sound instead stands out for the excellent music ranging from Pop to Rock to melodic Hardcore and for the excellent in-game commentary, truly exhaustive and varied, absolutely realistic. Comment After reading the review, perhaps the relatively low rating given for all the listed advantages may seem jarring, but there are several factors to take into consideration. The technical realization is absolutely not up to Xbox 360, and this becomes tragically clear if we don't have a television or an HD monitor available, in which case above the same polygonal models of the previous editions of NHL 2K it is not even possible to see all the effects applied to try to embellish the graphics. The numerous innovations introduced, as mentioned, give the impression of having been introduced without paying much attention to the general harmony, as good ideas that still blend imperfectly with the typical gameplay of the series. Finally, in a country where hockey cannot count on a particularly large audience of enthusiasts, it is difficult to find a solid justificationna to buying a stock based on such a sport that is not close to perfect, especially at the price it is in the market. So to speak, there is a lack of the cultural factor that can push, for example, the unconditional appreciation of a football title, perhaps only sufficient, in our area. However, it remains a good basis for the future, since with a better technical realization, possibly with the complete reconstruction of the graphic layout and a greater general refinement work, high levels can be reached. We look forward to the next chapter. Pros: The only hockey game currently on Xbox 360 Huge variety of options and game modes Interesting new additions... Cons: ...but badly blended within the game Technical realization absolutely not up to Xbox 360 The higher price does not correspond to a legitimate substantial improvement Hockey, gentlemen, is a particular sport: for the average Italian, whose experience on ice skates can lead him to go round and round on the frozen pond in winter, it can resemble a sort of acrobatic show, fast and violent. And this is the first problem of the title in question, trying to get hold of an audience without being able to exploit a cultural substratum crucial to its success, which instead is easily found in many other countries outside Italy. Those who know this sport will obviously find bread for their teeth, but even those who are simply intrigued by this game will be able to discover how deep the reality of ice hockey is. Specifically, in this case, the NHL.", "date": "2006-05-10", "grade": null}
