{"name": "La tempesta imperfetta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139992-agents-of-storm-la-tempesta-imperfetta.html", "text": "Inspired by the special teams that have been proposed by television series for decades, starting from classics such as the A-Team and the Thunderbirds to arrive at more recent productions such as NCIS and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agents of Storm is the new project created by flaregames, the authors of Royal Revolt, who for the occasion worked side by side with a team known and experienced as Remedy. The result is once again a strategic one, albeit characterized by a structure that divides the gameplay into two specific phases: the first is management, in which we build our base of operations piece by piece, enhancing its positions in order to aspire to a larger fleet. numerous and efficient; the second is the tactical one, with rather linear missions that take place along a predetermined path, dotted with enemy towers that we have the task of destroying (or overcoming unscathed) to finally arrive at the appointment with the enemy stronghold. The latter must be shot down using not only the weapons supplied but also the ~stun~ shots collected along the way, which are essential to prevent the most dangerous guns from biting. The interaction is unfortunately quite limited, in the sense that apart from choosing the initial formation and making it leave for one of the paths highlighted on the screen, we won't be able to do much else, apart from using the aforementioned expedients to gain time compared to the normal reaction times of the players. opponents. Agents of Storm is a decent strategy game, technically well done but with a limiting freemium model It's raining, thief government That the technical sector of Agents of Storm is respectable, it does not rain. The game boasts clean and detailed graphics, embellished by a sophisticated lighting system that further enhances the surfaces, all of which can be zoomed and rotated at will both in the management and in the strategic phase. We also liked the illustrations of the characters, which appear on the screen during internal team dialogues or with the enemy on duty. However, if the production value of the flaregames title is high and it shows, the same cannot be said of the solutions adopted for the gameplay, in particular the influence exerted on it by the freemium mechanisms. From the very first missions, but above all after the tenth level of experience, the times necessary to scrape together a small hoard of gold or fuel expand, and this leads to having to endure rather long waits to do anything: repair damaged ships or build new ones new ones, start technological research to unlock new units, upgrade the buildings of the base and even access the missions themselves. A real nonsense, if you think about it: resources are asked to be able to earn other resources. All operations can of course be speeded up through the use of hard currency, diamonds, which are obtained, however, in very moderate quantities through the completion of achievements. In short, to be able to move freely in Agents of Storm you need to have a lot of patience and enjoy the experience in a very fragmented way or, alternatively, put your hand in your wallet and buy the diamonds necessary to guarantee at least a quick start. These are choices that in our opinion excessively penalize those who want to play for free, even if we understand the need to monetize in the face of a significant productive investment", "date": "2014-11-01", "grade": "6.7"}
