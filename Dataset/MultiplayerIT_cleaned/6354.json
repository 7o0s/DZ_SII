The biggest obstacle in proposing a game of this kind (simulation or not) on these platforms is obviously the control interface, but once this obstacle has been overcome, the road is downhill. For EA Sports UFC, the system of various types of touches corresponding to strikes and parries has been adopted, a solution that in a certain sense represents the standard for productions of the genre in the mobile sector: light strikes with rapid touches on the screen, medium strikes with a swipe horizontal of the finger and powerful with oblique swipe, while the defensive phase takes place with a double tap for the parry and rubs in the opposite direction to the opponent for the dodge. It is therefore an ~indirect~ system since it is based on a pre-established set to be activated with these simple movements, but it is still able to give satisfaction, even if often the general delay with which the response to the commands occurs tends to make the fights more cumbersome than they already are on their own with this control scheme. The aim of the game, of course, is to climb the ranks of UFC fighters to reach the top, one fight after another in a continuous progression of the level of challenge, with increasingly powerful opponents and increasingly complex secondary objectives to achieve. The fight takes place inside the iconic octagon, the classic UFC ring, with the players framed from the side although the camera often has to change the shot to make everything more spectacular. And a show really is, that of EA Sports UFC: the fighters are large, perfectly modeled and animated, approaching the level of videogame productions for the major consoles, on this point the EA Sports title is truly satisfying and can already be worth the price of the entrance ticket. Also because it's free. Orbi blows and touches on the touch screen find a good synthesis in EA Sports UFC Fight in the Octagon Given also the free-to-play setting, one could have thought that EA Sports UFC was a sort of companion or interactive reference to the game released on consoles, but instead there is a certain structural depth in the EA mobile game that makes it a complete product , and not too set on the need for in-app purchases. In the store it is possible to buy gold and packages of paid elements but it is not an invasive mechanism, in fact it is possible to advance in the career even without paying money, at least up to the highest levels. There is no bar that is consumed and blocks the continuation, the only real limitation is given by the need to use, in more advanced matches, a sort of performance boost for your wrestler (doping?) which is present in limited quantities and it recharges extremely slowly and which can lead to in-app purchases to obtain it more easily, becoming almost indispensable in the most difficult battles. Similarly, the extreme rarity of additional fighters within the prize packages that are conquered by advancing from level to level makes it easier to form a team of valid and varied fighters (also in terms of category) through direct purchase , but with these exceptions it must be said that the standard career can continue without a hitch while maintaining its free status. The amount of basic blows during the match is rather limited, being fast and light, medium and heavy blows as mentioned, but it is possible to significantly expand the attack possibilities by acquiring new special moves that are unlocked with the progression of the wrestler and are proposed during the match as a sort of deck of cards, distributed as good combinations of shots are scored. Through pre-match training it is possible to increase the power of special strikes and adopt new ones, including a wide range of punches, kicks, holds and projections all drawn from the tradition of mixed martial arts and from the specific characteristics of real fighters. There are also sets of shots to be performed on the ground, with sorts of quick time events to be completed to knock down the opponent and force him to surrender. All this implies a certain strategic depth with the need not to waste empty shots and to use the right moves at the right time, although the perceptible delay in the execution of the strikes and parries by the wrestler can partially nullify this aspect.", "date": "2015-05-07", "grade": "7.5"}
