{"name": "Hellpoint", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hellpoint-recensione.html", "text": "In spite of some angularity, the Hellpoint preview had left us favorably impressed: Cradle Games' debut game does not revolutionize the formula imposed by Souls but takes some interesting detours that combine to give it its own identity. The definitive test done for the review of Hellpoint has highlighted the obvious advantages, as well as the progress made compared to the demo, together with some defects of a certain weight that we do not doubt will be fixed with some patches - right now, however, the This is how this adventure presents itself to us and certain setbacks could have been avoided a priori. This does not mean that Hellpoint does not offer an overall valid experience, as we will see, and slightly different from the soulslike we are used to. The Irid Novo space station is huge, full of secrets that if identified can make exploration easier, and well diversified in the different sections that compose it, effectively giving the idea of contact between different civilizations but also of all the horror and of the corruption that has taken over. Where it all began Like any self-respecting soulslike, Hellpoint is no exception in setting up a plot of which we are not told anything: we do not know who we are, why we are in Irid Novo and above all the reason why everything fell apart except us and very few other lucky ones. We have no name, we are known as Spawn and arrived in the presence of our creator after the first few minutes of the game, little is done to make sense of what is happening: we only know that there has been a quantum cataclysm of incalculable proportions, well known such as Merge, following which everyone lost their mind as bodies and memories merged with versions of other parallel realities. If that weren't enough to wreak havoc already, the incident has summoned entities of immense power to Irid Novo who had better stay where they were. In short, an immense mess of which we must discover the causes, the proponents and every single aspect that can help us make a decision on which is the best solution to adopt - this is because Hellpoint has different endings, it depends on you what you want to do. However, the fragmentary plot is an essential element of the gameplay, since while in Souls its discovery is left to the player's curiosity and does not prevent you from going straight to the conclusion, at most it influences the outcome, in this case it becomes the backbone to continue in the game and be able to come into direct contact with the Author (the mysterious figure who gave us life). In fact, our task is to collect data on events that have occurred and then report everything to him: every breach, every monster, every message that we find around will contribute in small or large percentages to enriching the amount of data. Therefore, exploring is not only an invitation but in some ways an obligation and every bit of information can make the difference. Next stop, Irid Novo Hellpoint is all set inside the Irid Novo space station and the developers have given their all to make it dispersive, huge and full of secrets. In the twenty hours needed to finish the first run we explored most but not all of them and we made up for it with a second game, after having developed the eye to understand where a secret passage was potentially hiding or having memorized the various settings just enough to remind us what we missed on the first lap. Be prepared to run back and forth, retrace your steps after getting the key to an inaccessible room (if you haven't forgotten where it was), collect an abundance of access keys and try to figure out where to use them. Even now, as we write to you, we have not managed to find everything, in particular because Irid Novo is subject to a particular mechanic called Black Hole Hour.Orbiting around a black hole, there are specific moments during which, for example, the overlapping of the two visible rings in the upper left indicator allows access to new areas that can hide power-ups, weapons and even some interesting fights. They are areas scattered throughout the space station, not always easy to identify and not all responding to the same pattern. Sometimes it's a matter of luck to be in the right place at the right time. But orbiting a black hole is not only a source of joy, timing aside, there are also hidden dangers around the corner: its influence could cause stronger enemies to appear or increase the number of creatures within an area making the matter more complicated to manage. As the story progresses, some areas will also have different enemies that maybe until a few hours ago were cconfined to other places. In short, Hellpoint does everything to try to offer as varied an experience as possible during the game and succeeds in doing so, above all encouraging exploration. There are also game sections in the Underworld, what we could define as the Upside Down of Irid Novo: it is activated by coming into contact with special monoliths and is the negative and mirrored version of the space station, where common creatures are replaced by more lethal. If at first glance it may seem like a simple aesthetic variant, it doesn't take much to understand that it opens up various possibilities both in terms of resources to collect, since you won't find them elsewhere, and in terms of story development. We won't say anything else so as not to spoil the surprise but know that looking at things from another perspective you could gain. The real danger of the Underworld is that we cannot stay there for too long: one round of the clock is the maximum time available, on pain of losing one's life but above all the resources collected up to that moment. It is necessary to dose the exploration well in order not to frustrate the efforts and even in this Hellpoint shows a certain originality. Unlike Souls or Bloodborne, the game adopts an option that is in a certain sense more punitive with regard to exploration. Like any soulslike, it uses safe points in which to stop to take a breath, in this case called Breach, but with two substantial differences: the first is that activating a breach does not restore our healing objects (in case of death, it only returns the base number and not additional ones that we may have obtained through improvements), the second is that the breaches are not all directly connected to each other. To connect them we will have to use a specific consumable object, the Breach Synchronizer, and decide from time to time where it is worth exploiting it based on the number available. The only exceptions are a breach in the so-called main hub and all those that are formed after defeating a boss, the others are subject to our evaluation. This makes exploration more complicated but by placing the synchronizers with a certain criterion, at least at the beginning, the crossing from one side of the station to the other can be managed quite fairly. To help in this sense there are the numerous shortcuts that we can activate by thoroughly exploring every corner of Irid Novo, a useful distinction to understand where it is appropriate to activate the fast travel and where not. If you like to go on an adventure in company, Hellpoint allows you to play seamlessly with a friend both in local co-op and online: unlike the other soulslikes in which the friendly player can be summoned if the boss is present in the area and abandons us after defeating him, in this case you are free to get to the end without any constraints. Combat system Compared to the demo, Hellpoint has refined its combat system making it more fluid especially with regard to the dash attacks - one of the most used during our game. Again, the game takes a lot from soulslikes and then veers in a direction of its own, for example eliminating critical strikes and parry to introduce weapon skills and deflection as a specific stat - the value of which indicates the chance to deflect a heavy attack. Each weapon improves with use, unlocking specific active or passive skills that affect the weapon itself or the character but cannot be known in advance: to know what you will encounter and above all if they are right for you, you will have to continue use them. There are three types of weapons, melee, fire and catalyst: each can be found in the game or built after obtaining the necessary blueprints and materials. There are also equipment that falls under the hidden category and requires the relative station to be developed. You can manage your character as you prefer, making him wield two weapons of the same type, two different ones or one together with a shield but their use depends on the build you want to develop and related stats. Furthermore, a chip can be implemented to weapons that improves them based on their type: for example a light sword revolves around the Reflexes, therefore the use of a Reflex Melee Conductor is more recommended than others. From the point of view of customization and builds, Hellpoint does not miss anything and allows you to experiment a lot, the only flaw lies in the overall difficulty of the game: after an initial initial stumbling block, you don't particularly feel the need to go to the bottom of the development of a build and you can be satisfied with improving the ba equipment step by stepif, where possible, with more refined versions of the same weapon. In our case we got to the end with the same sword and shield without any particular problems: excellent on the one hand, because it doesn't represent the prohibitive challenge that could keep new players away, but a little more disappointing for those used to soulslikes . The bosses, even those that apparently promise a profusion of curses, are quite predictable and can be eliminated even on the first hit. Often, on the contrary, it is the common enemies that represent the biggest problem, especially when they are in large quantities - also thanks to a camera that is not always optimal and a sometimes ineffective targeting system. However, if you feel that the challenge level is set to low, you can increase the difficulty to a breach using a specific item (same speech if you want to lower it). In general, Hellpoint's true complexity is not in the power of the enemies themselves but in the set of aspects that combine to differentiate it from a common soulslike: the failure to restore healing items to breaches (which are filled only by hitting enemies), combined to the need to connect the latter to each other, make the crossing of Irid Novo much more circumspect than it might seem on the surface. A few bugs too many To the difficulties desired by the developers are added the problems dictated by the bugs. We do not doubt that some patches will solve the situation but at present there are flaws that could have already been avoided: the most obvious and annoying is the one related to deaths from falls. Contrary to any other soulslike where the character does not reach bottom when falling into a ravine, in Hellpoint it happens and in addition to being visually ugly (in fact, you hit an invisible floor in the middle of the space) it keeps all our lost Axions. We didn't want to believe it the first time we saw it, unfortunately it is: any death by falling will cause all your future experience points to remain there at the point of impact, lost forever in most cases, as if to make a mockery of you. If you are lucky enough to crash and die at a point you can then return to you have hope of retrieving them, otherwise say goodbye to them. Considered the more ~platform~ soul of Hellpoint, in which you jump a lot and often with very high risk margins, the danger is not represented by common enemies or bosses but by falls and their disastrous consequences. minor entity but still present and which overall affect the experience making it less pleasant: from the body of our Spawn that bounces along the screen when he is killed, to the enemies that get stuck or continue to go around without attacking (it is to our advantage, ok, but we would do without it), to some element of the scenario out of place or clearly repeated without it being foreseen, our journey through Irid Novo suffers from various imperfections which, while favoring us, sometimes further lower an already not too high level of difficulty. The fact that these bugs also show up during boss fights doesn't help, which is a shame, because Hellpoint has a great atmosphere, as well as being a pleasant alternative to the more medieval fantasy settings that preceded it. Although The Surge have already shifted the focus to science fiction, Cradle Games' game adds that horror touch that we always like and recalls distant Dead Space. With a few tiny precautions he could have aimed even higher.", "date": "2020-07-29", "grade": "7.0"}
