{"name": "High Seize", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/high-seize.html", "text": "Pirate & Gentleman High Seize offers a fairly compelling and well-told story as a backdrop to the actual strategic activity, which unfolds within the typical pirate scenario, i.e. the Caribbean of the seventeenth century: cosmetically more than pleasant fixed screens mark the progress of the plot, whose narration is enriched by a spoken commentary of remarkable quality despite the high compression. As per the script, the plot is in any case little more than a mere glue between one internship and another, an elegant justification for a full-bodied succession of battles that RedLynx certainly has the merit of having faced in the best way. Taking up what was said at the beginning, High Seize is a title that certainly draws inspiration from Advance Wars, with which it shares most of the game mechanics: it is therefore always a question of moving one's units in turn (different in characteristics such as mobility, firepower etc.) using a grid of squares in order to defeat the enemy, possibly sustaining a tolerable number of casualties. The battles take place at sea or on land, with the presence of both surfaces in certain scenarios, to the absolute benefit of variety. But what amazes about High Size, and which makes it materially deeper than Advance Wars, is the amount of variables that regulate the progress of the games: in addition to the obvious differentiations between units, the different characteristics of the terrain or the water (with bonuses and penalties of various kinds depending on where you are), the occupation of villages or buildings on the map and even the health and equipment conditions of your troops. In High Seize, in fact, it is also necessary to monitor that the units have sufficient doses of food and ammunition available, elements whose existence - together with the creation of new forces to be thrown into the fray - depends precisely on the possession of the aforementioned strategic areas. All this plays in favor of the complexity of the product, making enthusiasts happy but exposing the less experienced to the risk of frustration, also thanks to a considerable level of difficulty. In the navy Pleasantly elaborated in terms of the game structure, High Seize cannot properly be defined in the same terms as regards the cosmetic, appreciable and functional aspect but decidedly far from the glories of Pathway to Glory. The graphics of the RedLynx title concede little or nothing to the spectacular during the combat phases, offering an overview of the all in all conventional battlefield on which units with sprites move, however rather well-finished and well-defined. Nothing striking even regarding the animations that accompany the attacks, insipid to the point that we tend to skip them in full after the very first games. Without wanting to complain anything to a strategic title that must make clarity and functionality its main cosmetic virtues (and which High Seize diligently respects), it is a little sad that the battles do not enjoy the visual richness that distinguishes the free-roaming map which allows the player to move from one mission to another at his leisure. In short, Pathway to Glory is quite another thing, but we can't complain anyway, also considering the good use that the RedLynx product makes of the non-exciting audio qualities of the Nokia handheld, offering music that is not very varied and original but still pleasant and adequate sound effects. Last but not least, a few words should be spent on the multiplayer features of High Seize, which are truly tantalizing and which constitute an important added value to the game: it is possible to challenge up to three other users via Bluetooth, N-Gage Arena or in hot seat mode , and the online service even includes optimatch options for ranked matches and the inevitable world scoreboards. Really not bad. Comment High Seize is not Pathway to Glory with boats, as some might think: it is a product in its own right, different from the strategic one based on the Second World War but equally cared for and capable of giving great satisfaction to fans of the genre. While not being able to count on an impressive cosmetic yield, the RedLynx title shows off an enviable complexity, which makes the game in campaign mode compelling and exciting in online multiplayer challenges or via Bluetooth. Highly recommended to anyone with a minimum interest in the strategic. Pros Nice and fun gameplay Comfortable and functional HUD Demanding campaign mode and excellent multiplayer Cons Graphics not great Difficulty level above average Praiseworthy architect of that Pathway to Glory that it is no exaggeration to define as the best game available for N-Gage, the RedLynx development team first wanted to repeat the success of their jewel with a more than worthy sequel, and later threw themselves into the production of a new strategic title : not a simple clone of Pathway to Glory with a different setting - as one could also expect - but a game with a different gameplay, intended to challenge none other than Advance Wars. And in some respects, this High Seize proves to be even superior to the instant classic Nintendo...", "date": "2006-03-30", "grade": null}
