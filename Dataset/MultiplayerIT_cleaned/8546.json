Thus, after the extended cut of Overkill, the Japanese software house tries again with the adaptation of The House of the Dead 3 in high definition with some unpublished content exclusively on the PlayStation Network. The third chapter of the series, which arrived in arcades in 2002, then converted for Xbox in 2003, on PC in 2005 and finally for Wii in 2008 in a collection that also contains The House of the Dead 2, for the uninitiated is a shooter on rails, or if you prefer to call it by the English term, a rail shooter. These, as tradition has it for the genre, is therefore characterized by a game mechanic that provides users with the need to continuously shoot against the video where dozens of monsters and various creatures appear threatening in front of them, aiming at them thanks to the help of an on-screen pointer and through the use of weapons of various kinds. Usually the paraphernalia can be physically controlled through special peripherals in the form of rifles, pistols and so on, present in the cabinet or as additional peripherals in the case of console editions. To move, the gamer takes advantage of the automatic and predefined movements of the path designed by the developers, even if occasionally some titles have crossroads to be selected by shooting the dart that indicates one direction rather than another. Playstation 3 trophies The House of the Dead 3 HD offers twelve Trophies divided into eight Bronze, three Silver and one Gold. To obtain them you have to satisfy the game's requests by perhaps obtaining all four endings of the main adventure, completing the Time Attack mode or saving your partner from certain death several times. We shoot in joy The House of the Dead 3 HD moves the setting of the series into the future, precisely in the year 2019, where following the incidents narrated in the first two episodes, civilization has suffered a bad blow and the entire planet has become unlivable, haunted by terrible and menacing creatures. Thomas Rogan's daughter, Lisa, and the old ~G~ will try to put things right, and together they will try to infiltrate a structure within which there seems to be the key to the annihilation of all beings. created by Dr. Curien. Since it is mainly an aesthetic restyling, the heart of The House of the Dead 3 HD has in fact remained exactly the same as it was nine years ago: the player's only concern is therefore to aim at the screen and blow the heads off everything you see. moves, enjoying in the meantime some sketches with the characters. New, however, are the mode for two players at the same time, the one called Time Attack and various extras scattered here and there such as the ability to unlock new difficulty levels and Trophies. In addition, there is an option that allows users from all over the world to measure their respective performances on a special online ranking and, as mentioned at the beginning of the article, support for PlayStation Move, which can be used as a ~gun~ (as an alternative to it and lightgun also the DualShock is fine). The latter works quite well and after a quick initial calibration the aiming system is precise and responsive, if we exclude a little the action required to reload the weapon, which due to the low sensitivity forces the player to shake Move in perhaps too pronounced. For the rest, the playability is confirmed as quite fun, at least in the first few games, but then everything starts to become slightly monotonous. In this sense it would perhaps have been appropriate to devise a system that randomly generated the position of the enemies in the various locations, rather than leaving this function pre-established, which in our opinion undermines the user's willingness to replay the title once completed . If the player already knows where a zombie is hiding or where a creature will pop out of, the next time he finds himself in a certain area he will not have much difficulty getting rid of it and will no longer feel the thrill of discovery, the fear of surprise. It would have been enough to randomize some monsters to make the experience more fun and in some ways varied. Finally, there are few notes relating to the aesthetic restyling of The House of the Dead 3 HD, which even if it exploits the power of the PlayStation 3 to offer more detailed and high definition graphics, is not sufficient to mask the fact that the gioco was developed many years ago. Furthermore, the title is not in widescreen format but has an adapted 4:3 image, therefore there are annoying black bars. Ditto for the audio: cute, functional to the type of game and its settings, but stylistically sounds and soundtrack appear old-fashioned when compared to more recent productions.", "date": "2012-05-09", "grade": "6.5"}
