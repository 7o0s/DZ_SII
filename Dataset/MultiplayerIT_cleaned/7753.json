It is an HD reissue of two of the most complex cabinets born of the Japanese house: Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom and Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara. The years are respectively 1993 and 1996, a period in which Capcom has perfected the mechanics of the scrolling fighting game to perfection, culminating in what we can define as its masterpieces. In this case the fantasy setting suggests role-playing grafts beautifully combined with the dynamics of slash 'em up, but also the possibility of playing up to four at the same time, taking advantage of the generous set of characters. You are better than uan! Of the two titles, Tower of Doom is the more archaic, but despite its venerable age it represents the maximum expression of the experience gained by Capcom in the genre, starting with titles such as Knights of the Round and Final Fight. Not to mention that the use of the CPS2 hardware allowed for an astonishing graphic realization at the time, so much so that it is still positively striking today. The cornerstone of the collection, however, is represented by the sequel Shadow Over Mystara, better from practically all points of view as it is full of innovative ideas. It is probably the most daring title ever developed by Capcom, audacious in wanting to mix an adventure structure in the rather limiting confines of a coin-op. The cast of characters retraces the canons of the fantasy genre by proposing various classes, ranging from classic warriors, elves, wizards, thieves and dwarves. Each character has a personalized set of special moves, selectable through a rotating wheel, limited in quantity and which must be restored by recovering resources on the field. The diversification of the combos allows for very different strategies, the elf for example is able to unleash very effective elemental magic from a distance. The scenarios themselves present crossroads capable of making the games always different, unique items and truly unusual situations for an arcade cabinet, a context that forces rapid rhythms and simple mechanics. The production actually suffers from the contrast between the money-eating nature and the pursuit of a certain structural complexity. Contrast that becomes even more heated in this console version, as the tokens are replaced by infinite lives. Like all Capcom beat 'em ups, the need to put the player at a disadvantage (to get his money out of him) results in unbalanced situations, a feature that risks compromising the single player experience. Much better in company, a context that greatly benefits this collection, especially if faced in four online or locally. D&D: Chronicles of Mystara reiterates the timeless appeal of the original titles Xbox 360 goals Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara features 24 objectives for a total of 400 player points. Only 50 points await those able to complete both titles in the collection, a sign that to win the others you will have to roll up your sleeves and complete a series of additional operations, such as special stages. Good luck! As before, more than before Technically D&D: Chronicles of Mystara replicates the beauty of the original cabinets in the splendor of high resolution, with Capcom's unmistakable 2D style that mixes fantasy suggestions with drawings between Japanese anime and American comics. Iron Galaxy offers one of the best ports ever seen on Live Arcade titles, full of modes, galleries to unlock, graphic filters and free management of the screen format. You can therefore play in faithful 4:3 or full screen, however at the expense of the aspect ratio. The possibility of activating the so-called scanlines, or the display method of the old cathode-ray tube monitors, is hilarious, as well as a series of welcome bonuses such as the ability to view the cabinet in pure arcade style. Graphically there isn't much to complain about, the two games are still visually splendid today, with sprites of generous size, scenarios that are always different and full of details, the music less incisive, which suffers from the past four decades. The netcode is quite efficient, certainly a crucial added value for this production for the reasons explained above.", "date": "2013-07-05", "grade": "8.0"}
