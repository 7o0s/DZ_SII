Pete Collier, founder of the English micro studio Hogrocket, asked himself this question in a recent post on AltDevBlob. Its formula provides that a valuable title is engaging, that gives the player meaningful choices, that gives a purpose, that is profound and accessible at the same time, that allows different approaches giving the impression that it can be approached in different ways and that finally you value the money and time invested to play it. It's just one of the possible recipes for making a successful video game, of course. But that handbook could be a good starting point for any independent developer and seems to follow the list of priorities of the two components of another small developer, MiniMax Games, who in the last two years have dedicated themselves body and soul to the creation of Space Pirates and Zombies. A project that perfectly embodies the above values and which cost its creators, former designers of major studios working on triple A titles, a radical change of life and approach to work, but which paid off in full in the end. Maximum freedom of choice The inspirations of Space Pirates and Zombies are called Star Control, Mech Warrior II and Master of Orion. Genres mixed in range from shoot 'em up to RPG to strategy. In short, it is not the ambition that was lacking in the conception phase: the player is projected into the role of a space pirate at the head of an increasingly large and technologically advanced fleet, in a future where man has reached the stars , has split and now fights split into two factions, Civilians and UTA, unaware of a threat that threatens its survival. Once you have started a game, you are asked to choose the size of the universe and, having passed the tutorial, you can become familiar with a structure for which each solar system, the hubs from which to access the individual missions and through which to relate to the factions, is connected to others of different difficulty, which can be explored after having crossed a portal protected by enemies indicative of the challenge that one will have to face. It's a rather elegant trick that immediately offers a choice: creating a smaller galaxy, with fewer solar systems, requires more significant leaps forward and therefore a greater commitment, but also a denser experience. Conversely, increasing the branches of the map lengthens the broth, dilutes the contents, increases the hours and makes the progression more gradual. The implications of this not exactly intuitive logic, at least at first, have been intelligently dampened in the transition between the beta and the final version by the inclusion of different levels of difficulty, which can be modified over time but only by going towards the simpler ones, without given the opportunity to raise the challenge again. Even before having fired a shot, therefore, it is already clear how Space Pirates and Zombies is above all a response to all those users who are clamoring for a return to more complex, profound and customizable titles. A tendency, that of leaving the user free to move as he prefers and master the tools made available to him, which never stops for the entire duration of the adventure. The main plot, not too engaging, is almost only an excuse to immerse yourself in a richly layered gameplay, where by destroying enemies you earn experience points to unlock new technologies, where you can customize weapons and equipment, strategies and the behavior of the artificial intelligence that controls the ships you take with you and so on. The balance of the world itself, of the individual solar systems, can be influenced according to the choices made by completing one mission rather than another. All the contents are procedurally generated and, although it still feels a bit repetitive, the high number of side quests, random encounters, battles in which you can freely take sides and patterns used to create the main missions, make the dozens of hours of game necessary to complete it a good compromise between the amount of content necessary to experience all the meat on the fire put by MiniMax Games, and the variety required by those who do not just want to be fascinated by the complex mechanism that moves under the hood of this ambitious indie . Among other things, the presence of the zombies so pompously referred to in the title is experienced only from a certain point forward and, once they enter the scene, they are able to change the cards on the table, once again thwarting a feeling of discovery that does not stop never from start to finish. Captain The complete articleit of elements that form Space Pirates and Zombies is in contrast with the extreme simplicity of the control and combat system: having taken command of one's own spaceship, chosen among those unlocked by destroying the enemy models and exploiting them to reconstruct its functioning, it is use four keys to move it and the mouse to aim and shoot, with a simple 2D physics model to make driving more interesting without requiring any effort or skill. The beauty is to master new missiles, cannons, bombs, drones and mines unlocked by purchasing their instructions on some remote space station. Or check out the differences offered by changing elements such as engines, shields, optical cloaking systems, and so on. The customization possibilities are many and involve the main spaceship as well as the secondary ones that follow us - and of which you can switch to command at any time, if you want - opening the doors to a virtually infinite number of combat strategies. The battles, although rather limited in the number of vehicles involved, are enhanced by a good artificial intelligence of the enemies who give each other a hand, protect the objectives and try to beat the retreat if in obvious difficulty. Instead, a randomly generated loot system is missing if not the one, also added with the transition from beta to the official release, which regulates the recruitment of specialists. Members of the crew, the latter, which guarantee different bonuses and constitute a concrete incentive to venture into the most complex and dangerous quests, often being the most important prize. It would have been nice to see this kind of object creation mechanism applied to the parts of the spaceship, but apparently we will have to wait for the sequel, already announced and equipped, as said, also with multiplayer. For the next six months, however, MiniMax Games will undertake to implement what is requested by users and to develop some DLCs: an in-depth analysis necessary to give further depth to what is already one of the most interesting titles released in recent months, not to be missed for no reason at 13.90 euros. In the future we also wonder if the choice of the game engine will still fall on the Torque Engine, which has proven to be functional for the purposes of the game itself and to make it as light as possible, despite the ultra-comic style tending to get boring in the long run . Wanting to try a compilation work, the small and large mechanics involved in the gameplay of Space Pirates and Zombies would be very many - the ships have their own crew to be fleshed out in case of losses, there are three ~currencies~ that manage everything, from purchases to respec of the skills for relations with Civilians and UTA, and so on - but more than the individual aspects, we repeat, it is the amalgam that is created that amazes and entertains for a long time. Provided you overcome the initial impact that is too generous with information and elements to juggle.", "date": "2011-08-31", "grade": "8.8"}
