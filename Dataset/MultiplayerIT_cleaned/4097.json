{"name": "Shenmue I & II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shenmue-i-ii-recensione.html", "text": "Shenmue I & II represents the realization of a desire long cherished by many gamers of the old guard, those who have had the opportunity to try the experience created by Yu Suzuki on Dreamcast, eighteen years ago, and still keep a splendid memory. At the same time, however, it is by no means an easy product to evaluate, if we consider that it represented the starting point for an evolution of action adventures that has never stopped since then, literally transforming the genre and redefining its mechanics. Shenmue was an extremely ambitious project for the time, a game capable of introducing cutting-edge concepts, structural elements and technical solutions, squeezing the hardware of the SEGA console to the maximum: a real prototype for modern open worlds, with a scenario that can be freely explored but above all alive and pulsating, with its characters, shops, restaurants and side activities. Some of these ideas will no doubt be familiar to Yakuza fans, see arcades with the ability to play classics like Hang-On, Space Harrier and Out-Run; but Toshihiro Nagoshi's work is characterized by different intentions compared to Suzuki's philosophy, which intended to use the best technologies to create an adventure full of realistic and concrete facets, deliberately slow and reflective in the initial stages. In the original Shenmue it was in fact necessary to do without the map, looking at road signs and asking for information from passers-by to know how to reach certain places; or spend the time going around, discovering secrets or training while waiting for a certain time to access specific situations. Characteristics that in 2000 could count on the solid support of a technical and artistic sector of extraordinary workmanship, but which today are extremely antiquated and do not boast the same charm. history and structure The protagonist of Shenmue I, Ryo Hazuki, is a young jujitsu expert who reluctantly witnesses his father being killed at the hands of a lethal Chinese fighter, Lan Di. Taking possession of a mysterious mirror, the assassin flees without a trace, but Ryo promises himself to find it and make him pay. To complete this mission, the boy will have to conduct a series of investigations in the various districts of his city, Yokosuka, until he finds a trace that leads him to Lan Di and thus obtain a ticket for Hong Kong, the scenario in which the second chapter. Yu Suzuki, moreover, has always conceived his work as a whole: it is for this reason that fans of the franchise have reacted with such enthusiasm to the announcement of Shenmue III, which will finally give a sequel to the story. In short, there is a thread that inextricably links the two titles included in this remaster, originally separated by a two-year long process and inevitably different in some respects, with Shenmue II playing the part of the more refined production, smoothed in some corners (see the maps and the possibility, albeit limited to certain circumstances, of making time pass quickly), with a more sustained rhythm and a different charm. Compared to the first chapter, the map is in fact wider, the urban scenarios add detail and possibilities for exploration, some shots are very evocative and even on the narrative level there is room for valuable subplots. The formula remains practically unchanged, as well as the notebook that Ryo always carries with him and on which he writes down every new event: a precious help to remember who we are looking for and where to find it at any time. And if we really don't have the money for a map of the neighborhood, we can always ask passers-by for directions and pay attention to the signs, as already mentioned. Gameplay and missions The historical accuracy of Shenmue is still remembered today as something obsessive, just consider that Yu Suzuki used a meteorological log to faithfully reproduce the climatic conditions of the days in which the adventure took place. From the gameplay point of view, however, we are faced with fairly linear mechanisms, in which you have to find certain places or people, interact with them and move on to the next track. Clearly it is not so much the achievement of the destination as the journey that represents the most fascinating part of the experience, and it is in this perspective that the broad freedom of action that both episodes allow is placed, inviting us to browse everywhere in search of secrets and collectibles, or to try our hand at the collateral activities available during the campaign. We already have arcadesspoken, but it is also worth mentioning the jobs that Ryo will be able to carry out to raise the money necessary to finance his expedition, in particular the iconic role of handling heavy crates driving a forklift. Yes, the same forklift that we will have to push hard to win the traditional speed races with colleagues. Then there are the quick time events, which feature fast and engaging sequences and in which we are asked to act on the right buttons as soon as they appear on the screen, under penalty of failure; and finally the fights, which arise almost as a separate portion of the experience. During the clashes, Ryo will be able to use the many jujitsu moves learned during training or taught to him by some friend or martial arts master, making combinations very similar to those of Virtua Fighter, a fighting game from which Shenmue is clearly inspired as regards the combat system. Playstation 4 trophies Shenmue and Shenmue II include twenty-nine and twenty-eight Trophies respectively, with a view to an achievement system that represents one of the novelties of the remaster. Most of the challenges are linked to simple progression within the story, but there is no shortage of Trophies that can be obtained by defeating a certain number of opponents, collecting certain collectibles and dedicating some time to side situations with respect to the main plot. A good remaster? So let's get to the heart of the matter, namely the very nature of Shenmue I. There is no doubt that Yu Suzuki's series was extraordinary for its time and played a fundamental role in the structural and technical evolution of video games as we know them today, therefore we find it even more necessary to enhance it in a different way than with a simple increase in resolution; because in the end that's what the guys at d3t did. We don't question the difficulty of taking the original code and running it on completely different machines eighteen years later, with all the necessary tests, but there are brilliant remakes that are nothing like the originals (Crash Bandicoot: No. Sane Trilogy, remade from scratch) and others that boast completely different assets (Yakuza Kiwami), as well as a series of optimizations. Here, sorry to say, the less tortuous path has been chosen, even in the face of frankly unpresentable situations, such as the Shenmue II cutscenes which, despite the 16:9 aspect ratio, are reproduced with black bands above and on the sides . It is appreciable that the sampled dialogues (at low bitrate) are consistent with the more complete editions, and that therefore there is dubbing in both English and Japanese for both episodes, but a simple texture pack could have made the graphics more current, net of angular and often animated polygonal models in an essential way. The possibility of saving the game at any moment (possibly transferring the progress from one game to another) is good rather than having to wait each time to return to the base, but the block at 30 frames per second, although motivated by technical reasons that are difficult to circumvent, it only adds limits to a graphic that feels the full weight of its years; so much so that, by activating the option to display the original resolution, you don't notice who knows what difference in terms of visual impact. And the controls? Apparently the phantom improvements promised compared to the original ~tank~ style consisted only of support for analog sticks, which were unreliable during QTEs.", "date": "2018-08-20", "grade": "7.0"}
