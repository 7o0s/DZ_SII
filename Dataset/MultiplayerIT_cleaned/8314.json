A chance encounter, an unexpected experience and something beautiful is born. It happened for the Zelda saga, ditto for that of Kingdom Hearts. This time, a meeting between Hisashi Koinuma, producer of Tecmo-Koei, and Koji Nakajima, director of Namco-Bandai, was enough to lay the foundations for a title inspired and based on One Piece, one of the most acclaimed manga ever . The ingredients are so simple that many have always wondered what made Eiichiro Oda's work an immense phenomenon, capable of outclassing paper mastodons that seemed to have cemented their supremacy. After all, Oda-San has done nothing but skillfully mix adventure, action, humor, pirate settings and a treasure in the distance to make millions of readers dream around the world. Over time the elements have increased, forming a complex plot, fascinating and enriched by many beautifully characterized characters. Yes, the writer is a huge fan of One Piece, one of the many who rejoiced at the announcement of the European localization of One Piece: Kaizou Musou, later translated Pirate Warriors in our own lands. Honestly, it's not that there weren't any pirate-based titles, God forbid. Namco has been capitalizing on the brand's success for years in the best way, but it was really time for a high definition chapter that would give fans the right feeling. Luffy's crew has decided to dock exclusively on PlayStation 3, hoist the sails! The past teaches It is undeniable that the announcement of the development entrusted to the Omega Force division of Tecmo-Koei made those expecting a different type of product slightly turn up their noses. The team, which has become famous over time for the Dynasty Warriors brand, has always instilled the basis of its products with an action gameplay characterized by waves of enemies to fight against, sometimes exaggerating in flexing the muscles of their graphics engines by inserting hundreds of opponents at screen and expiring everything in a sometimes trivial button-mashing. In One Piece: Pirate Warriors the formula is similar, but fortunately differentiated properly to make the play structure much more fluid and dynamic. Inevitable will be the moments in which the design philosophy will put masses of enemies between us and the objective to get rid of, but everything is intelligently integrated into the flow of the game, making rapid progress and overcoming these points. The feeling of having in your hands a much stronger character than the challengers is well packaged and helps to give realism of transposition to the title. Anyone who has scrolled through the pages of the books or watched the cartoon will know well the obvious technical difference between Luffy's crew and the so-called ~small fish~, and in One Piece: Pirate Warriors this factor is made perfectly. No downtime in observing entire armies advancing like automatons regardless of danger: in each section of combat it will be enough to go directly towards the leader and defeat him to see the remaining opponents flee in panic. The progress along the chosen scheme will therefore be based on conquering the areas that compose it to culminate in reaching the final section, with a probable boss fight. Probably, but not sure. The wisdom of the Omega Force team has made it possible to diversify the playful offer by alternating episodes in which you will have to make your way through hordes of enemies to others in which the platform phases and small puzzles will have the upper hand with others still focused solely on the boss fight on duty. Thanks to the bland role-playing component integrated into the advancement, it will be refreshing to see how the heroes of the adventure learn moves and acquire attack skills as they level up, with the aesthetics of the evolutions faithfully taken from the manga and a collection and consequent insertion of coins within a grid that will enhance the character, unlock affinity and color the experience at each playthrough. Lots of routes to follow There are several ways to choose from and which make the offer complete. The Main Diary traces the plot of the saga from the point of view of the protagonist, with sections inside dedicated to the individual characters involved and which allow you to revive the progress by living the topical moments in the role of the specific pirate. Going forward in the narrative, managed through interlude scenes and balloons in pure Japanese style, and completing the episodes related to them, the individual members of the crew will become the protagonists of their own Secondary Diary. An intelligent gimmick to make us relive the raids in a sort of Dream mode so dear to Omega Force, in which the effectThe actual flow and unfolding of events is slightly distorted in exchange for a little poetic freedom of design. Oda's skill was precisely that of having created a cast of effective supporting characters, who made charisma and characterization their priority qualities, and the method chosen by the developers to make them all protagonists is effective, helping to make the experience of One Piece: Pirate Warriors a kind of expanded universe. To enrich the dish, an online mode comes in support, with which to indulge yourself looking for the ideal combination with your network friends. In addition to cable co-op, a welcome dip into the past is also available for the occasion: offline co-op (and consequent split-screen). Anachronism? Perhaps, but for those who appreciate experiencing the emotions of the Rotta Maggiore with someone at their side, the option with a nostalgic flavor can only be a welcome addition. A self-respecting product characterized by beautiful interlude scenes must give its owners the opportunity to enjoy them at will, admiring them when desired, and One Piece: Pirate Warriors is no different. The Gallery mode comes in handy, also allowing you to check the profiles of the characters to learn more about them. These are times where you would always like more, and when the present difficulty levels don't help to give you more hours of play, the Challenge mode can fix it by providing a good end-game addition. Get ready to face the game's most fearsome bosses relentlessly in a sort of climb to power, where only the best (and with the right amount of experience) will be able to survive. The sea is definitely a treacherous place. Playstation 3 trophies One Piece: Pirate Warriors contains 36 trophies, divided into 20 bronze, 13 silver, 3 gold and platinum to dominate them from above. In addition to the usual collection of objects scattered throughout the stages of the game, the title offers prizes for carrying out particular attacks against specific bosses as well as completing the proposed quests. As per tradition, there are numerical trophies, therefore based on the quantity of defeated enemies, and others relating to retracing the deeds of single episodes as they are narrated in the manga. Overall it will not be difficult to unlock most of the trophies, with a little effort required only for the more ambitious ones but always within a decidedly low level of challenge. Oriental cosmetics Although we don't know for sure who invented it, it doesn't matter: the Japanese are the undisputed masters of animation. Omega Force proves to be in step with the times by proposing a videogame transposition of physical and environmental models that goes well with the cel shading graphics engine used. Vibrant colors and pastel textures effortlessly catapult into the marine universe of One Piece, also loved for the exuberance of its settings and the expressiveness of the characters, here re-proposed in splendid computer graphic sequences seasoned with a facial mimicry that will not fail to meet the favor of the fans. On a purely artistic level, the succession of episodes shows even more clearly how the videogame transposition enjoys insertions and inventions that expand the known universe and shown by the manga, thus allowing to trace a common thread flowing through the environments, which is impossible to do between the cartoons of a comic if not thanks to a little healthy imagination. The general design takes up the line designed by Oda, with clothes, details and distinctive signs of the characters on the screen that vary as the adventure progresses. It's a bit sad that the good work done is sometimes sacrificed by a sometimes badly calibrated camera, but this is the price to pay for a graphics engine that can handle a good amount of polygons with a very fluid flow of frames on the field and which, even in the most agitated phases, does not lose frames excessively, making the dynamism expressed on the screen even more palpable. Although the songs of the crew will not welcome us on board, the soundtrack has its own personality and goes well with the dubbing, available only in Japanese with Italian subtitles. With a skilful use of jazz and exotic instrumentation, Omega Force has managed to customize the sound accompaniment with ease, which remains sunny and suitable for completing the overall pirate picture with notes.", "date": "2012-09-20", "grade": "8.0"}
