Anyone who has played at least one other football created by Visual Concepts can already boast a certain familiarity with ESPN NFL 2K5, whose gameplay does not differ significantly from that of the previous chapters. The strategies, which can be selected before each action, bind the different actions of the quarterback to different keys that are different each time and the system is intuitive, guaranteeing the adequacy of the pad even in the management of an entire team. With the ball in hand, the runner can feint or charge with his own weight, or throw himself on the ground to maintain control of the ball and it is advisable to know the strengths of one's players in order to choose the right approach to different situations. A heavy player is in fact clumsy in feints and evasions, while a quick and light player takes a big risk trying to break through against a well planted defender. As we said, the game structure does not present significant changes but the few made have proved to be able to significantly improve the gaming experience. ...the game structure does not present significant changes but the few ones made have proved to be able to significantly improve the gaming experience. Small relevant variations. The sports series created by Visual Concepts has always been famous for that arcade touch that permeates it. This element is linked to the incredible responsiveness of the controls which allow you to instantly launch a player into a dive or change his direction in a few moments. The resulting sensation is an absolute mastery of the characters, but, on the other hand, it affects the likelihood of the game by allowing players to intercept opponents' throws and movements too easily. In this new chapter of the series, Visual Concepts have decided to add a little extra animation, a little extra step that can slow down the action slightly. Arcade lovers may not like the change to the fullest, but ESPN NFL 2K5 games, with this simple gimmick, can boast much greater credibility. As icing on the cake it is now possible to carry out two different types of tackle: with the simple pressure of a button the player carries out a standard tackle, while by keeping the button pressed the tackle starts more slowly but is much more violent and ~definitive~. The artificial intelligence responds promptly to the tactics used by the player trying to block his game on every occasion, but to have a reactive and truly dangerous opponent it is necessary to play in PRO mode. Once the difficulty level has been raised, it is strongly advised not to repeat the same pattern twice or adopt predictable tactics. The show, the game ESPN NFL 2K4 enjoyed the first implementation in the series of numerous features related to the ESPN brand, aimed at making the gaming experience more complete and exciting. But this second chapter, and it is noticeable right from the start with the implementation of very accurate statistics and detailed sports news, aims to recreate the football environment in all respects, obviously from the ESPN point of view. Interviews, music, sports news and, of course, commentary come together, creating a sports network to live and play. The ~recreational~ room is back, that is the space to keep trophies, secret objects and which we can furnish as we like by buying furniture and decorations. As in the previous chapter, we will acquire points for our purchases by equaling or establishing historical records and by performing spectacular actions on the playing field. Progressing in the purchase of more or less useful objects, you get to be able to even buy bar games such as the famous darts board, too expensive but quite fanciful. A VIP (Virtual Identity Profile) mode also appears in the menu which generates a profile capable of storing our game statistics similarly to other sports titles, but there is a substantial difference because the VIP allows us to challenge, as coaches, five entertainment personalities ranging from extreme sports king Steve O to Carmen Electra. Furthermore, the VIP can be exchanged and compared both through memory cards or, for those who own Xbox and Live connection, through the internet. In addition to the career, VIP and single event modes, the items First Person Football and ESPN 25th Anniversary appear in the menu. The First Person Shooter is an experiment already attempted in the previous chapter that puts us in first person in the action, sharing the visual angle with the player who is at the center of the action. Unfortunately playing as a single player, on a flat screen, instead of showing the game action iMore clearly it does not allow you to have a complete game vision and heavily affects the playability of the title. The ESPN 25th Anniversary mode, as the name indicates, allows the player to experience the golden moments of 25 long years of professional football and is a real godsend for fans of the sport. Franchise mode The franchise mode, already contemplated by the series, is none other than the career mode. As president of a team, you can buy the manager and players and accurately manage their career within your own staff. But the innovations included in this chapter make the experience much more captivating for lovers of total management. It is now possible to modify players' contracts based on their performance or put them on hold, and the market, during trading periods, reacts in a likely way. Poor clubs target players in decline or up and coming, while affluent clubs look to sign up for established or up-and-coming athletes, with each team considering signing players based on their tactical deficiencies. forcing the hand can cause discontent or even have a negative effect on the players' fitness. Franchise mode The team's training section has also been expanded, allowing training planned by day of the week and, above all, differentiated for each role. It is therefore possible to enhance the drive of the defenders and strengthen the shoulders of the quarterbacks on Mondays, reverse the training on Tuesdays, allow a day off, determine midweek practice games and establish a light practice shift on the eve of a big game. Proper training planning ensures motivated and fit players, while forcing the hand can cause dissatisfaction or even negatively affect players' fitness. ESPN NFL 2K5 on the go ESPN NFL 2K5 brings into play an enviable technical sector. If some models are below the EA tagged Madden Football, the animations will take care of not making him regret even for a moment. Tackles, interceptions, throws and falls follow one another without hesitation, reaching a verisimilitude and fluidity never seen before. The PS2 version has negligible uncertainties in the frame rate and a slightly lower image definition. From a sound point of view (or rather from an auditory point of view), there is little to say. The commentary is sufficiently rich and varied, even if it is not uncommon to hear the same sentence repeated several times in the same match when describing similar actions. There is no shortage of musical pieces after a touchdown, cries of pain and dull thuds and the cries of the public and players are convincing. The soundtrack, while responding almost entirely to the growing rap fashion, is sufficiently nourished and qualitatively sufficient. On Xbox, thanks to the hard disk, it is obviously possible to add songs and modify the soundtrack, just as it is possible to change the clips that start after a touchdown or after a particular event, making sure that the exaltation of the moment belongs entirely to us . ESPN NFL 2K5 isn't just a great football game, it's a media spectacle that can keep a football fan hooked for hours on end. But the SEGA / Visual Concept title is not limited to this and relaunches with a complex management system, capable of inserting the player even behind the scenes of professional football. The small refinements in the gameplay and the improvement of the artificial intelligence add up to the care for the animations, immersing the player in the playful experience closest to a real football match. Pros: Great animations Comprehensive team management Massive media spectacle Effective gameplay improvements Cons: First Person Football mode doesn't live up to its title Some players are less well-groomed than others American football, a mythical sport full of American tradition, is certainly the most direct and physical discipline that exists but, ironically, in its mechanics it embodies the very essence of strategy. On the football field, every team is an array and every action is a battle that demands accurate troop disposition, but the most important analogy lies in the white horizontal lines that trace the field and represent the terrain to be conquered and held. any cost. Football is therefore a mix of waiting and shooting, study and adrenaline and if for many too many breaks are a deterrent, for fans they become moments of tension worthy of a shootout on penalties. If many choices made by SEGA in recent years are questionable, that certainly does not include that oneto transform the SEGA Sports brand into the ESPN brand. The sports network par excellence bases its success on making famous and less famous disciplines spectacular and football in particular, with its heroes and battles, fits perfectly with the ESPN philosophy.", "date": "2005-02-07", "grade": null}
