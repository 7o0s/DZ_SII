{"name": "Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ar-tonelico-melody-of-elemia-recensione.html", "text": "Nippon Ichi, what was once a practically unknown software house, now attracts converts to every new game launched on the market: the Japanese company, of which NiS America is a rib, has come a long way on PlayStation 2, starting from one of most successful title in the strategy RPG genre, the mad Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. The aces up the sleeve of the softco, still anchored today to old-style technical achievements all sprites and rough polygons, have always been an extraordinary character design, crazy and bizarre stories, but above all depth of gameplay rarely equaled. NiS games are always full of things to do, tasty long-lived and full of original concepts, perhaps taken up and further explored, as happened with Makai Kingdom, a mix of the trump cards already exploited in Phantom Brave and Disgaea. And again, La Pucelle and Atelier Iris, and then Disgaea 2: while the most avid players of the genre feel a certain tiredness from title to title, the new generations hardly do not become fans of such original products full of character. Ar Tonelico is a bit of a turning point: developed by Gust on behalf of the Banpresto & NiS alliance, Ar Tonelico is not a strategic RPG, but a pure RPG of a decidedly Japanese type, which maintains the salient features of the NiS production. Bizarre characters, a truly original combat system, a retro technical realization and as a novelty a touch of eroticism: a masterpiece or a fiasco? A jewel of a package The American version of Ar Tonelico enjoys one of the best packaging ever made for a ~standard~ game: an elegant, paperback cardboard box in fact includes not only the game, in the typical amaray packaging, but also a splendid bound and hardcover color artbook , with 52 pages of artwork, information, images and curiosities. Definitely an atypical choice, probably promotional for a game so little publicized in the West, but which in Japan has even enjoyed an animated transposition for home video. What if the Reyvateils are out of tune? Probably the question asked at the end of the previous paragraph will have displaced the readers of this article. Maybe someone will have fondly remembered a great JRPG for PSOne, or Thousand Arms. And so here is the bizarre idea that unites our protagonist, Lyner, with his adventure companions Reyvateil: the blond Knight in fact has an irresistible charm and soon every woman in the party will feel attracted to him who, on the other hand, is truly a sentimentally inept. And yet every time we take advantage of an inn and the option to rest after a new narrative phase, the Reyvateils will try to chat with Lyner, and there they will read some good ones: strangely Ar Tonelico is full of double meaning jokes with bad references hidden from the sexual sphere, and the various dialogues will elicit many smiles from the players. And moreover, Lyner will have to penetrate (ahem...) the Cosmosphere of the Reyvateil, to discover the darkest secrets of their psyche: only in this way will the Reyvateil be able to forge new songs to use in battle. The Diving System allows a fair amount of freedom to explore the minds of the Reyvateil, and taking advantage of the Dive Points earned in battle you can dart into this sort of mini-game to get new songs by darting between the main events, or even deepen the relationship between the protagonist and the Reyvateil on duty exploring the less important areas of their mind. The player has the decision, between one dialogue and another. The songs are a fundamental element of the atypical battle-system, which sees three party members and one Reyvateil deployed at a time on the battlefield: the Reyvateil will remain in the rear to sing for the group, consuming her Magic Points at each turn in which his song will continue. In fact, it is the player who decides when the song must stop, carefully considering the Reyvateil's MP reserve, which once depleted will interrupt the spell and its effects, perhaps frustrating the loading of a devastating attack song. The prolonged song also influences the performance of the party which, deployed in front of the Reyvateil, engages the opponents between basic attacks and special shots: their power also depends on the Harmo-Gauge in the lower portion of the screen, which will charge with each blow inflicted and at each turn a song is sung. The important thing is that Reyvateil is defended at all costs, given its very poor defensive capabilities. Consequently, it can also happen that an enemy decides to target her, and here then it would be wise to have the whole party protect the Reyvateil, consequently triggering sspectacular counter-moves based precisely on the Harmo-Gauge, which also affects the objects obtained at the end of the fight. As chaotic as it may seem, Ar Tonelico's battle system is decidedly easy to learn and in a short time the player will find himself mastering it by combining songs and special attacks in devastating assaults, also thanks to the ease with which it is possible to get rid of enemies: Ar Tonelico is in fact a decidedly simple game from this point of view, and as pleasant as it may be to proceed in the adventure without frustrations of any kind, the more savvy players will find very little challenge in the fights proposed by Gust, who also placed a limit to the frequency of random fights thanks to a particular bar that will indicate, during the exploration of the locations, the degree of danger, essentially delaying the clashes. When this bar runs out, it will no longer be possible to fight in that area until it is abandoned and revisited: an ingenious system that limits not only the nervous breakdowns that some games cause, but also the unbridled grinding of experience points, which for a certain type of gamer can also be a significant defect. 2D to the rescue? As per tradition, NiS offers us a new title that mixes very little 3D with many more two-dimensional elements, from sprites to isometric backgrounds. The latter are far from the graphic and artistic magnificence admired in titles such as Stella Deus, unfortunately, and sometimes turn out to be bland and poorly defined, while not lacking in considerable detail, while in other cases they are decidedly good and detailed, even if the choice of colors is sometimes questionable. A completely different matter for the fantastic high resolution sprites, skilfully animated especially in combat, which mix with the pyrotechnic effects often caused by the attacks, normal and special, of protagonists and enemies. Reyvateil's songs, in particular, often fill screens with color, light effects, and floating sprites that act as avatars for their songs, changing graphically based on the level the magic reaches. Some spells also give life to short animated sequences in which their power is expressed in a decidedly spectacular way on the poor unfortunates of the moment. In general, the visual quality of Ar Tonelico suffers from some ups and downs, but it remains at decidedly more than good levels, which retro-loving players will love, while the more modern ones will be able to turn up their noses but not remain indifferent to the more spectacular fights. On the soundtrack instead there is no discussion, the music by Ar Tonelico is of a high level, even if it is now difficult to judge the soundtrack of an RPG after listening to the musical magic of XenoSaga, Tales of Legendia or Final Fantasy XII: the new NiS product however, it offers a remarkable sample of musical pieces that are well suited to the various playful and narrative sequences. But the real strength is undoubtedly the excellent dubbing, which accompanies most of the dialogues, and which can also be heard in the original Japanese version: simply superb. Comment With a sequel in the pipeline, Ar Tonelico is certainly not a game that does not deserve attention. It is certainly one of the most original RPGs in the PlayStation 2 toy library, and it probably would not have had the same impact with a technical implementation more suited to the console's capabilities: the two-dimensional graphics are of excellent workmanship, despite the sometimes mediocre locations, and the characters, excellently characterized, they live an adventure that does not spare many twists and turns, despite the bizarre and spicy tone of some dialogues. The fun and complex battle-system is undermined only by the lack of resistance offered by the enemies: the real flaw of Ar Tonelico is in fact the excessive simplicity, probably combined with a dungeon-design that is sometimes trivial, despite the inclusion of puzzles and vaguely platforming sections. It is a product that fans of the Disgaea softco will love, and that all other lovers of the genre should not underestimate: if the cards are well played, it could be the first episode of a very promising saga. Pros: Gorgeous hi-res sprites Interesting story, excellent dialogue dubbing Ingenious and original gameplay Cons: Some locations graphically are just fair Overly linear Very easy A plot worthy of a soap The plot of Ar Tonelico is not very simple to summarize, as it is necessary to know and understand the past of the world of Sol Ciel, now reduced to a system of floating islands connected to the mystical tower of Ar Tonelico, between a sea of poisonous clouds and a energy domethermal: two mythological catastrophes have led to this situation, which has also split civilization, divided between the lower areas, technically less advanced but more religious, and the upper ones, in possession of an ancient and very powerful as well as incomprehensible technology. Everything revolves around the tower of Ar Tonelico and the songs of the Reyvateil, a race of only partially biological female beings who are able to communicate on a computer level with the technology of the tower. Why and how are mysteries that will be revealed during the adventure, which begins when the tower suffers a powerful assault by deadly techno-organic entities believed to have been defeated for centuries: viruses. The only way to counter them seems to be a Purger-type Hymn Crystal, hidden somewhere in the lower section of the tower, and will be the mission of a young Knight of Elemia, Lyner Barsett, son of a politician but decidedly unsuitable for the career of Elemia. father. As is the tradition in this kind of adventure, Lyner's mission will prove to be much more complicated than expected when he crosses the paths of two Reyvateil, Misha and Aurica, and two very powerful companies, the Church of Elemia and the Conglomerate of Tenba: everyone seems know Lyner's fate apart from him, and only his pure soul and goodness of spirit will allow him to face every threat to the world of Sol Ciel... but will they be enough to win the hearts of the women around him?", "date": "2007-08-09", "grade": null}
