How many books, films and video games were born from this canvas? Crookz - The Big Heist by Skilltree Studios is only the latest in terms of time in a very long series of works that have tried to explore the comic side of criminal life, and it's also a nice surprise, playfully speaking. The race for the Moonstone, an invaluable artifact, puts us in the shoes of a group of skilled thieves from the 70s, who look like they have just come out of Staying Alive and who are capable of getting away with any situation. Too bad their employer decides to deceive them, making them literally end up in the middle of the street. However, when after a few years the possibility of revenge arises, our people don't think twice and go back to business, also dragging along new companions. This is, broadly speaking, the story that will be the background to the action of what we can define a Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines with a more refined interface and completely focused on the study of the maps and on the resolution of small environmental puzzles. Briefings and characters At the beginning of each mission, eighteen in total, a briefing phase is proposed, which consists of illustrating the points of interest of the place where you are and from which you can draw valuable operational advice. The camera flies over the various areas of the map emphasizing the presence of enemies, controlled accesses, buttons, terminals and more. Obviously, ample space is given to the objectives to be achieved which vary according to the mission. In short, everything that is important is analyzed. This is a non-interactive phase, in which you only need to observe and mentally note what you see to get an idea of how to move into the operational phase, the next one. Above all, it serves to decide which gang members to bring into action. In the first maps, in reality, the choices are forced, but from about halfway through the game, more characters are available, all with their own characteristics that can be more or less useful. For example, is it better to count on a skilled burglar so as not to have problems with locks, or is it preferable to exploit the air ducts to quickly reach otherwise well-protected rooms by selecting a fairly agile character? Or again, can a thug capable of putting the guards to sleep come in handy or risk slowing us down too much? Once the appropriate considerations have been made and all the slots of the available characters have been filled (up to four), the time comes to give oneself to the real crime. We reviewed Crookz - The Big Heist, which puts us in the shoes of a group of scumbag criminals Burglary The first big surprise of Crookz is the game interface, really comfortable and refined. It is based on a system of stages, which can be imported manually by the player or created automatically in case of more complex selections. Let's take a very simple but explanatory example: in a closed room there is a switch that must be pressed to deactivate a security camera. Once the burglar has been selected, we can proceed in two ways: either click directly on the switch, letting the system calculate the other actions necessary to reach it (burglary the door), or first select the door to break into, then set the switch as second stage. What's the best choice? Let's just say it depends on the situation. In this case it was better to opt for the direct selection, given that there weren't big dangers waiting for us, but in other cases we have to dedicate ourselves to managing all the team's movements at the same time, creating even very complex networks of actions, in which the individual moves must be managed of every criminal, breaks included. The latter are essential and add a certain depth to the gameplay, because they allow the player to decide not only what action to take, but also when to take it. For example, you can decide to press a certain switch only after a guard has passed, or you can coordinate with a partner in crime and act simultaneously to deactivate a series of switches in distant rooms. In short, the system itself is really versatile and works great. Of course, don't expect a game too fast, given that it can take well over an hour to complete a single mission (let's say that realistically the longevity is around twenty-five hours), but we believe that strategic fans will not be sorry. Rigidity What is less versatile is the game structure. The eighteen maps are built very well, with only one problem: rethey ask for a linear approach to be completed. In what sense? Well, net of the characters put on the field, which can vary some passages thanks to the already mentioned different skills, there is not a great freedom of action and, in general, more than deciding what to do, you have to understand it. This brings the gameplay closer to that of a puzzle game. Not bad, if the desire to replay the maps once they are finished was not completely lost. Maybe completionists will try to collect all the treasures and open all the safes around, which then go into determining the overall mission score, but in general it doesn't make too much sense to replay a successfully completed level, also because there are no leaderboards online from which to compete with other players. Another defect, certainly less serious but still present, is the lack of care in certain aspects of the narrative side of the game. In general, Skilltree has done a good job of characterizing the menus and characters, but has sinned a lot with the environments, made with professionalism, but all stylistically anonymous. Even the music, although it strongly recalls the 70s and guarantees the right atmosphere, is few and far between. Sadly the worst part comes with the cut-scenes, which are poorly done. We didn't expect who knows what, but seeing the portraits of the characters chatting on a static screen, in which only the texts change, is a bit sad. Obviously this is a secondary aspect, but it's annoying that it hasn't been taken care of more, above all because the various videos, however very simple, are very well done and have a perfectly fitting style.", "date": "2015-08-28", "grade": "8.0"}
