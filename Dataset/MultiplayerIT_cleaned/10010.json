On the iPhone, in particular, this kind of game has had a good following, and among the numerous titles present in the App Store, Alive 4-ever was certainly one of the most downloaded ones. Therefore, his successor, Alive 4-ever RETURNS, has the difficult task of continuing and, if possible, improving the already positive experience of the previous chapter. In Alive 4-ever RETURNS we will return to impersonate a combative survivor of the usual lethal virus which in contact with people transforms them into zombies. To be honest, the clich on which the plot is based has very little or nothing interesting, also because the justification for an invasion of the undead from the first Resident Evil onwards is so obvious that it seems almost superfluous to repeat it for every similar title . The story therefore serves more than anything else as an excuse to go from one mission to another; however, given the very frenetic nature of the game, almost certainly no one will feel the need for a Hollywood script. The strategy of massacre However, those who expect from Alive 4-ever RETURNS an approach of a simple ~ignorant~ shooter, whose purpose is only to collect kills are very wrong indeed: after choosing your own avatar, in fact, selectable from a roster of very classic characters, we will find ourselves facing to a menu that closely resembles, albeit simplified, that of an RPG. There will therefore be the levels of health, firepower, accuracy, defense but also objects and skills, which will increase as you progress in the missions. The money earned, obtainable by completing the secondary objectives of the various scenarios, also contributes to increasing the strategic component of the title; these resources will be used to purchase ever more powerful skills and weapons, even if not all equally effective. Having thus completed the customization of your avatar, you immediately enter into action: the movements of the character, taken from a top view, are immediate and managed using the left virtual stick, while the direction of the shots fired is delegated to the right one, the all in a simple and intuitive way. Although killing zombies is the core of the action, the developers have not skimped on real gameplay gems, able to give a nice touch of variety to the title. In fact, in some missions it will be necessary, for example, to recover suitcases with a vaccine inside, thus forcing us to use one-handed weapons, or often we will have to escort other helpless survivors making sure that the zombies do not reduce them to pulp. The longevity of the game is also really high: to the approximately 40 solo missions there is also a fun co-op mode for up to 4 players, via bluetooth but only locally, which is decidedly well implemented. In particular, it is worth mentioning the horde mode, classic but always damned fun, where you and your friends will have to face increasingly numerous and bloodthirsty waves of zombies. The technical sector undoubtedly contributes to completing the already excellent overall picture, thanks to a very accurate 3D graphics, the inspired level design (even if inevitably a bit stereotyped) and the total absence of slowdowns despite the high amount of enemies present at the same time. Just the enemies deserve a special mention: 18 different types between zombies and various monsters, all with a peculiar lethal characteristic that distinguishes them and all or almost all to be fought in a different way. In fact, as the story progresses, more intelligent than normal types of zombies will appear, who will face you by surrounding you and from which it will not be easy to extricate yourself; at a certain point, for example, the hostile zombie-cops will appear, who will be able to shoot, those football players, bigger and more robust, the explosive ones and even the guardian zombies, equipped with a resistant shield. However, the examples could continue for a very long time, a sign of how from this point of view the imagination of the developers has certainly not been limited. Then there are the imposing bosses, such as stone giants or large worms, capable of giving many headaches (and causing numerous game overs) at least until the right attack tactic is found. Finally, the sound is normal, with music that is never too invasive and the horrendous verses of the zombies quite well done and diversified.
