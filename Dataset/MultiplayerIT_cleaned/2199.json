Wait a few more lines and you'll know. Jet Set Radio Future. It all begins in the mega metropolis of Neo-Tokyo, commanded by businessmen who exercise their power over the forces of order. While all this is happening in the city, a certain DJ K (known to those who have had the good fortune to play the first chapter) incites groups of young people to revolt to smear and create havoc in the metropolis. Then groups of rival gangs roam the city, with their trusty skates on their feet, ready to give the city cute graffiti and murals of some artistic level. But obviously that's not all, because to permanently block everything, entire platoons of policemen will intervene, ready to hinder you by any means, even with tanks and helicopters. Gameplay The game in question has a real support column (read plot) in which we will play a decisive role in the life of Neo-Tokyo. Unfortunately, teams of policemen, equipped among other things with helicopters and tanks, rival gangs and their neighborhood bosses will put a spanner in the works. So to face the rival gangs and the police we will be able to juggle amazing and complex acrobatics bordering on the unbelievable, moreover by smearing as many walls as possible with our special spray cans. The game in question has a truly enormous level of playability and immersion that guarantees us a very high longevity value. It should be remembered that the sound aspect of Jet Radio Future plays its part, which presents a really great soundtrack for a video game, but more on that later. Graphics Looking at the various screenshots, the particular graphic realization of the title will surely have jumped to your attention. In fact it is very characteristic and is achieved by a technique adopted by the programmers of Sega. This technique is called Cel-Shading, it consists in combining the artistic expressiveness and details of two-dimensional graphics on the screen with the infinite potential of an environment entirely created with a polygonal rendering. The effect is a bit unusual but we can guarantee you that it's really nice and fast. Of course, the game adopts many Xbox-exclusive features such as hardware anti-aliasing, bump mapping and other refinements. A soundtrack worthy of a first place in the hit parade! Guys, here we are dealing with a game with a truly mind-blowing soundtrack. While we will roam in Neo Tokyo, songs of various musical genres will alternate: from funky, passing from hip hop, house up to techno. This already guarantees a high number of genres but Jet Set has illustrious participations: Just to name a few, Wavemaster, Hideki Naganuma, Cibo Matto, Latch Brothers, Mike D.

JET SET STATION #4 - Hideki Naganuma Comment Jet Set Radio Future looks like a very original and innovative game in many respects, in the end the programmers managed to match the already excellent first chapter on the Dreamcast. The result is truly incredible especially for the audio aspect which is incorporated directly into the gameplay offering hours and hours of pure entertainment. The only unknown is the graphic design, which being made with a new and unusual technique for many, may not please many of youthe. Finally, I personally recommend you try the demo, and then contemplate a possible purchase, if you love games of this genre. Pros: Style and originality Soundtrack to scream Innovative graphics Cons: Small slowdowns It may not appeal to those who don't like frenetic games Materials: Tips Sega and Xbox With the arrival of the new Microsoft console, Sega had to adapt to the console market and focused on its satellite team, the Smilebits. The latter, in past years, has had particular success on the Dreamcast, for which it has developed several titles of different genres, among these we positively mention Jet Set Radio, a video game product with an innovative design and characterized by an excellent level of gameplay, as well as a original story. Now Smilebit is ready to break through on XBox, presenting two promising new titles, Gun Valkyrie and Jet Set Radio Future, the sequel to the game mentioned above and of which I am about to write a review.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
