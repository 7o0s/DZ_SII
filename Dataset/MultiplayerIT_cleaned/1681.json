The opening of the brand to Apple Arcade, albeit with a different name, therefore arises as an event of a certain importance, which depending on the outcome could translate into the arrival of Clap Hanz productions also on other platforms, in particular Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Structure Clap Hanz Golf, a character celebrates the arrival on Apple Arcade. The Clap Hanz Golf home screen gives you access to four different modes: Tour, Score Attack, Survival and Local Multiplayer. Yes, online multiplayer is unfortunately missing: it is possible to face other players in matches for up to four participants, but only if they are in our vicinity. Where Score Attack and Survival focus precisely on obtaining high scores and of minimum scores to avoid elimination, the fulcrum of the experience is obviously represented by the Tour, a real career (as a group, however: we'll get there in a moment) in which we will be able to unlock new characters and increasingly longer and complex, going from three holes to six and nine. Gameplay Clap Hanz Golf, some scenery is quite evocative. Clap Hanz Golf immediately clarifies its arcade nature by offering us not only players who are absolutely outside the canons of this sporting discipline, from the girl with braids to the pensioner, but also by making them compete in group matches in which the various athletes pass a symbolic baton to each other, each of a single hole. All characters have different skills and a specific preference for clubs, making them the ideal choice for tackling certain courses. We will be able to select team members manually or let the system do it automatically, and then jump straight into the action and start making some powerful swings. Clap Hanz Golf, an approach sequence that repeats for each character. The gameplay turns out to be simple and immediate right from the start, but at the same time with a certain thickness as regards the calibration of the shots. In fact, we can limit ourselves to loading the shot by drawing a line with the index finger downwards and then quickly drawing one upwards to impact the ball, but this light-hearted approach will only work during easier matches. The more we go on, the more opponents we have they will become good, which means that we will have to take into account the direction of the wind, the inclination of the terrain, the distances and any obstacles, then try to give the swing a rotation, power or damping effect depending on how we will make the pressure. We are talking about delicate mechanisms, which require a little practice. Clap Hanz Golf, the diagram near the hole represents the slopes of the land. Like the vast majority of titles available on Apple Arcade, Clap Hanz Golf also supports Bluetooth controllers, but in this case you do not get great advantages from the physical commands: the right analog stick must be used to shoot, more stable and precise in some situations but less inclined to the nuances we have just talked about. We have mentioned the fact that we can unlock new characters within the Tour mode, but there is no shortage of extra challenges, collectibles (different clothes for our golfers, for example), a progression system which improves the statistics of each athlete and even the boss fights at the end of each tournament. The level of challenge always remains quite accessible in the early hours, also indulging in a more relaxed use. Technical realization Clap Hanz Golf boasts a very unusual roster of characters. We can say without fear of contradiction that the Everybody's Golf series has always remained a bit tied to old technologies, with rather dated polygonal models in terms of design and animations which however have helped to define what is actually the graphic style of the game , which has become well recognizable over time. Clap Hanz Golf is no exception, dragging us into such a colorful and fun context, with its over-the-top protagonists who move a bit' as if they were still the times of PS2 and scenarios that at first glance appear large and suggestive, but when you bring the view closer, they reveal themselves full of gimmicks and very dated polygonal solutions. In terms of atmosphere, in any case, the system is confirmed to be effective and pleasant, the fluidity on iPad Pro is excellent and the options to adjust standard and ~tactical~ view (a diagram of where the ball should end up on the field) are not lacking . The sound is also good from this point of view: the dialogues in English are ~old school~, but sounds and music effectively accompany the action.", "date": "2021-04-10", "grade": "8.0"}
