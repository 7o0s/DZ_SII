Yet already from the second chapter the need for some innovation began to be felt, which went beyond the simple more of the same to which LocoRoco 2 was limited instead. Evidently strengthened by the same awareness, the Japanese team responsible for the project therefore chose to shuffle the cards on the table with the third iteration of the franchise, for the occasion baptized LocoRoco: Midnight Carnival; a change of direction destined, however, we say it immediately, to cause discussion. Hardcore-hoarse Among the characteristic elements of the gameplay of the first episodes, the accessibility and the low level of difficulty were undoubtedly the most important; while offering different interpretations thanks to the collectible elements and the secret sections hidden along the levels, the LocoRoco guaranteed the possibility of being appreciated even by less savvy players, and indeed the particularly colorful and pleasant aesthetic component confirmed the developers' desire to create a product intended for the widest possible target. An aspect that is anything but negative, which on the contrary thanks to the rather original mechanics and the excellent characterization, has made the product appreciated in a transversal way both by casuals and by those who are particularly familiar with video games. A subtle balance that has instead been somewhat lost with LocoRoco: Midnight Carnival; if at first glance the only differences seem to be linked to a darker artistic setting and in many ways ~Halloween~ (forgive us for the horrible neologism), in reality we are faced with a profoundly different product. Certainly not in the control system, which still uses the back buttons to tilt the entire game world and thus determine the movement of the LocoRoco, where pressing instead of both buttons allows the creature to jump. And it is precisely on this last aspect that the game designers have revolutionized the gameplay, giving renewed importance to jumping and redesigning the game with a much more marked platform declination. Therefore, through a real combo system it is necessary to proceed precisely in hops, keeping the pace, thus being able to both earn a higher score and reach gradually greater heights, which obviously often conceal secret areas and bonuses of various kinds. The game itself is not particularly demanding in this sense, that is, you can very well reach the end of the levels with reduced combos and collecting little or nothing; just start from A and reach B and the internship is over. On the contrary, however, it is the level design that determines a sudden and rapid increase in difficulty, which is soon expressed in sections of small and self-propelled platforms to be overcome, perhaps placed on chasms that bring immediate death, with lurking enemies or spikes and so on ready to throw a spanner in the player's works, thus requiring a timing, precision and responsiveness that the control system is unlikely to be able to return, as if to constantly remind that its birth was certainly not designed with this type of game structure in mind. And everyone is well aware of the frustration caused by a life lost not for one's own demerits, but for the limits of the control system... Pom pom pom Therefore, despite the presence of mid-level checkpoints, the use of which must however be purchased at the price of a total of the accumulated Pickory, and despite the possibility of spending this sort of currency in mini-games and in a shop, they tend to partially mitigate the desire to launch the PSP against a wall after the umpteenth fall on deaf ears, the belief remains that LocoRoco: Midnight Carnival lacks the coherence and balance of the previous episodes. The 16 levels present, almost always decidedly short, also maintain the qualities of a level design which often does not allow backtracking to re-explore passed passages or to recover missed bonuses; in such cases, for those who want to try the 100% road, the only solution is to start over. There is also the obligatory multiplayer mode which struggles to find particular points of interest, representing the classic ~more~ that only a very few will exploit. The technical component is instead certainly positive from every point of view; if the graphics maintain the stylistic quality of the previous episodes, strengthened by a fascinating setting well inserted in the LocoRoco universe, the soundtrack is absolutely excellent, with some new songs intended to collectsuccessfully the legacy of the tunes present in the first chapters and which many still continue to whistle today.", "date": "2009-12-03", "grade": "6.8"}
