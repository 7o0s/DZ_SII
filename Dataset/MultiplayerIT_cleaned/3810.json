{"name": "Super Fowlst", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-fowlst-la-recensione.html", "text": "The beauty of the mobile landscape, from the point of view of video games, is that you can find such absurd titles that the developers would have no way of proposing them elsewhere, as we see in this review of Super Fowlst. The indie scene is by now as beautiful as it is cleared through customs and offers gaming experiences of all kinds even on PCs and consoles, but there are some solutions that could not find space on more complex platforms, perhaps due to the particular control interface or the methods of intended use. Among these there is certainly Super Fowlst, which finds a considerable strength precisely in its extreme peculiarity. Imagine a mixture of features between Flappy Bird and Downwell and put it all in a roguelike (or rather roguelite) context with hints of exploration and puzzles and you can get an idea of what this title developed by Thomas Young offers, evidently after drinking too many beers. However, be careful not to judge it as a simple mix without rhyme or reason: it is certainly a bizarre game but a certain study in its design can be seen at the base, because otherwise it would not be possible to explain how each piece fits together perfectly to form a mechanism of irresistible game, at least for the first few hours. The strange Flappy Bird-style control system serves to complicate the movements just enough to create a certain level of challenge, Downwell's gravitational pull and almost shooter-like chaos solidifies the gameplay and finally the roguelike mechanics give a wider breadth to the game. everything, giving further meaning to the procedural construction of the levels. From this emerges an amalgam that works, even if a very simplistic structure is to be expected. The lethal flutter chicken We therefore find ourselves controlling a sort of cockerel capable of fluttering, with a system similar to that of the aforementioned Flappy Birds: with a touch on the screen, the gallinaceous leaps upwards, to the right or to the left depending on the point where we pressed. Each touch corresponds to a new thrust and in this way the protagonist is able to fight, with small progressive leaps, the force of gravity that inexorably draws him towards the bottom. The levels develop in different directions with some platforms, various obstacles and a lot of empty space in which swarms of enemies roam who can be defeated simply by touching them, but they have the bad tendency to get nervous and shoot at a rather rapid pace, so it becomes indispensable hit them with the right timing so as not to take damage, also because the amount of energy is really limited and once it reaches zero we are sent back to the start of the game, while keeping the money collected and the upgrades unlocked (ie the roguelite elements we were talking about) . All we have to do is clear the areas of the enemies present, collect coins and open the gates that lead to the next levels, flying around and crashing into enemies, avoiding bullets and occasionally using power-ups that provide weapons and possibilities of additional attack. As the game progresses, some interesting variations in level design crop up, which also feature some puzzle elements that stimulate exploration with keys to collect to open doors, switches to push, explosives to detonate and obstacles to avoid until real own bosses to defeat. In short, there is a certain form of a more traditional video game underneath the facade of a hit and run mobile action game, even if the structure of the gameplay remains extremely simple, with some insights given by the possibility of enhancing the rooster through the purchase of various additional features such as extra energy, weapons, increased movement possibilities and other improvements that persist from game to game. The graphic characterization in full 16-bit style is more genuine than usual, with handcrafted solutions that remain quite distant from the usual stylish pixel art assuming a simply functional and pleasant aspect. Finally, note the rather harmless free-to-play model: Super Fowlst offers the player to see advertisements to get more coins or additional hearts but these are not mandatory options, while it is possible to completely eliminate the advertisements by making a real and own purchase of the full game for 6.50 euros.", "date": "2019-02-15", "grade": "7.8"}
