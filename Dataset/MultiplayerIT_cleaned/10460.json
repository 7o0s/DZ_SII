Cities XL, created by the same authors of City Life (Montecristo games), tries to make up for this lack by following the direction traced by the various MMOs released in recent years and proposing a new game mode that can relate the virtual mayors of the whole world. However, before thinking of the everlasting glory derived from the creation of a great metropolis shared, envied and visited by all, one must learn how to create a city and how to make it develop. Here the first problem already arises: verifying that the learning curve to get to having a successful city is not too steep, that is, that it does not scare the players. In fact, the thought of taking weeks to put up an urban space worthy of being put online scared us a bit, but we were proven wrong by the facts: Cities XL prunes the basic mechanisms of the genre and offers a simple, functional and extremely friendly interface which allows you to quickly get to put your ideas into practice, money permitting. Urban space In the first place it should be underlined how the development of the civitas follows a free pattern and is no longer tied to a 'square' conception of the urban fabric. From this point of view, the agility of the interface and the possibilities offered in terms of design are surprising. Do you want to create a circular neighborhood crossed by a ring road where every block is surrounded by a park? Why not. Do you instead want to follow a more classic and rational scheme based on rectangular blocks? You can do this too. That idiot in the middle is the avatar we created for the review The system is simple. To draw a building area, proceed by points; once the first is placed, a line is drawn which determines the direction and length of the road along which the buildings will rise and which is also one side of the ideal perimeter of the area itself. Placing more points ends up creating the district. In case an irregular neighborhood has been created, the non-buildable areas will be filled with a decoration that will give a sense of unity to the whole. In fact we realize that the system is more difficult to explain than to use, but we guarantee you that it is very simple and after a couple of minutes of trying you will become the master and begin to no longer feel the weight of the novelty. Economy and Gems Learned how to draw the city, you have to plan it. Obviously there are many types of buildable buildings, which enter into a direct relationship with those around them. For example, by creating homes for generic workers, it will be necessary to provide suitable economic activities to guarantee a job for everyone. Same thing for skilled workers and managers. As the city grows, it will also become necessary to provide certain services, such as a hospital or police station. Cities XL offers a simple, functional and extremely friendly interface that allows you to quickly put your ideas into practice, money permitting. Unlike other titles of the genre, it is no longer convenient to create handyman cities, that is, it is better to specialize them in specific areas and trade the necessary raw materials with others, following a logical development line aimed at obtaining certain results. For example, if you choose to create a tourist city, it is not advisable to create factories or other infrastructures that are too polluting because they make visitors flee. It will therefore be necessary to aim at the creation of an attractive and clean environment, centered on agricultural production instead of industrial production and powered by renewable energy sources such as wind power. From this point of view, Montecristo has created a very intelligent (and crafty) system of downloadable paid content: to best specialize the cities it is possible to purchase the so-called Gems, i.e. extra content that allows development in specific areas by adding buildings and options . Obviously the aim is to offer the greatest possible variety and to allow the creation of very different cities. It goes online Everything we have illustrated above has a specific purpose, which is to make playing online exciting. In fact, to find all the resources necessary to meet the needs of virtual citizens, it becomes essential to trade with other players, especially in the presence of strongly characterized cities that completely lack certain raw materials. Technically, Cities XL is excellent In reality, it is also possible to trade offline via a dedicated system that is very simple to usere, but of course it's online that Cities XL gives its best (or at least it should). Commerce also becomes necessary with a view to selling what is produced in our city. It is useless to create a technology industry without a market to place the products made; the result would be to see it plummet and fail within a few turns. The main problem with trading with other players is that it is something very cumbersome that also requires you to exit the game. Once you have found a player to exchange goods with on the world screen, you have to make several clicks to offer him the exchange. Our interlocutor will then have to go back to the desktop and connect to his account via browser to accept, renegotiate or reject the offer. This allows you to manage your city from any computer, but it's a very cumbersome system, especially when you have many cities and multiple exchanges. The first patch has already worked to remedy the problem, but it is hoped that a less abstruse system will be implemented in the future and, above all, manageable while remaining within the game.", "date": "2009-10-19", "grade": "8.2"}
