{"name": "Rise of Lost Empires", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rise-of-lost-empires.html", "text": "The debut of real-time strategy games on mobile is quite recent: the developers waited for the devices to be able to handle a certain number of sprites on the screen and a convincing scrolling, then they threw themselves headlong into the production of titles whose structure fits perfectly with the control system via joystick and numeric pad. In fact, the input device of telephones can hardly match the comfort and ergonomics of a joypad for arcade games, but it can have its say when it comes to emulating the movement of a mouse. Rise of Lost Empires starts with a menu from which it is possible to start a new adventure, select a chapter of the game (to continue the already started campaign) or read a guide to the characters and the actions that can be performed. The internships are structured to function as a sort of ~extended tutorial~, in the sense that as you progress you will pass from the control of a single character to that of entire battalions, which follow the relative commander and boast an independent cue in the when an enemy comes within range. Commanders, who are eight in all between the two factions in the game, have the ability to claim territories (marked with a banner on the map) and transform them into farms (which produce gold and food), barracks (for the creation of soldiers) , shooting schools (for creating archers), stables (for creating knights), outposts, buildings capable of producing upgrades and so on. Everything works exactly like in Warcraft, so you select a character by moving the cursor with the joystick (or with the number pad) and pressing FIRE (or 5), then ~click~ on the area of the map where you want it to go. When we select a commander, all his subordinates will move with him unless we ~double click~ on the character, so that he moves alone (the same can be done for the troops). Each commander also has the ability to recite spells, different for each one, which allow him to heal from wounds and also regenerate his companions, or become invincible for a short period of time, or even enhance his own attacks and launch more powerful ones (the magician who conjures fireballs, for example). Each internship has objectives to be completed, after which you can move on to the next chapter. After completing certain missions with the human faction, you will also unlock the orc faction, with just as many chapters to complete On a technical level, this new Gameloft product surprises from all points of view. The graphics look miraculous in how detailed they are despite the poor resolution of mobile phones, and if on the one hand reading the dialogues (all in Italian) is not the easiest thing in the world (the characters are tiny, there were no alternatives), on the other we have a really extraordinary work on the sprites (very well drawn and animated) and even on the scenarios. The look is that of a PC game from a few years ago, and the graphics engine manages to move a large number of characters without suffering, at least until the soldiers on the screen become dozens. It all depends on the power of your phone, however. And the sound? Impossible not to mention it, since it is also exceptional, with several really beautiful and sticky music (moreover, it changes depending on whether you play with humans or with ogres), as well as with the voices of the characters that ~respond~ when we order it to move or to attack. The control system, as mentioned, adapts perfectly to the game mechanics and proves to be extremely immediate and functional, with only the 0, asterisk and hash keys acting as ~extras~: the first lets us access the spell menu, the second reminds us of the objectives of the chapter, the third quickly takes us back to the base on the map. PRO Well-kept graphics High level sound Extremely deep and long lasting AGAINST More advanced missions take a long time Sometimes confusing and cumbersome", "date": "2007-08-28", "grade": "S.V."}
