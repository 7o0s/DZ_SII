Maybe from above or in command of an elite unit, commandos, even on a chessboard. We stopped their crazy plans to build supersoldiers, to bring the dead back to life and probably to build the Death Star, invade Kuwait and shoot J.F. Kennedy, while discovering that they were the ones who killed Lincoln. But never, and we stress never, had we seen the Nazis march alongside dinosaurs to conquer the world: as they say, there's always a first time. God destroys dinosaurs, the Nazis recreate them! The story behind Dino D-Day is probably the game's greatest strength. The title was originally conceived as a mod for Half Life 2 (mainly based on Day of Defeat Source) and only recently marketed via steam at the not exactly indifferent price of 19.90 euros. The game tells that in 1942, in the midst of the invasion of Africa, the Nazis somehow managed to clone, train and arm none other than dinosaurs! While waiting for a single-player mode that explains the background of this mysterious and disturbing genetic aberration, the only information we have on the prehistoric horde are given by the newspapers and messages reported during the loading screens between one game and another , which, reproduced in the classic style of the time, emphasize the situation in the most grotesque way possible - a flyer depicting a T-Rex snatching a woman resembling Marilyn Monroe between its paws - giving an even more hilarious to the already absurd concept of the title. Having said that, Dino D-Day for now presents itself as a classic multiplayer shooter for teams of up to 24 players with seven traditionally specular maps and different objectives which, under high-sounding names and descriptions, hide the usual routine made of team deathmatch, king of hill and destroy/defend the fort. Even if a good breath of fresh air is given by a particular map in which the final battle will be between the allies and a gigantic triceratops on which a cannon has been mounted. The Dirty Dozen As promised in the body of the review, here's a quick overview of the classes in the game: ALLIES Cap Jack Hardgrave: excellent example of a hybrid between assaulter and sniper, armed with a Garand rifle and a 1911 colt, he has the ability to go into berserker mode as a special ability after killing 3 enemies in a row, increasing the damage inflicted and reducing that right away. Cpl Joe Spencer: machine gunner and scout equipped with the deadly tommy gun and bags of explosives, excellent class for the assault and effective against raptors due to the high rate of fire of the machine gun: his obvious flaw is accuracy. Cpt Nighel Crossley: English sapper armed with a shotgun capable of penetrating the thickest armor and a lethal rocket launcher, he too lacks in accuracy and reload times. Ilona Viche: Soviet sniper equipped with a very precise Mosin Nagant and a revolver, she has the decoy as a special ability, or rabbits capable of attracting the attention of enemy velociraptors. Camille brun: partisan from Grancia, she is armed with the Sten machine gun, the most accurate of those in the game, which makes it lethal for velociraptors or enemy soldiers. The low caliber makes it poorly suited to deal with large dinosaurs. His special ability is to throw medium packs. Jacob Frank: Dino D-Day's Jewish Bear: His deadly Browning Automatic Rifle can fire both burst and single shot, making him a great mix between stormtrooper and gunner. He is also armed with a sawn-off shotgun. The only drawback of both is the long reload time. JURASSIC AXIS/BERLIN: Hptm Kurt Streiker: German basic soldier and hybrid between sniper and stormtrooper armed with a mauser k98 and a mp40 submachine gun. The slow rate of fire makes the Mauser inferior to its American Garand counterpart, while the MP40 lacks the power of other weapons. The grenades he carries with him are good. Olt Hissman: typical sniper from the infallible K98 with optics, he can also launch pterodactyls armed with kamikaze-style explosives on the field. Doctor Wolfgang Von Graf: the power of the Nazi doctor doesn't come so much from being able to launch medi packs capable of curing even dinosaurs, but from the very powerful mp44 that he carries around, which makes him a devastating shock soldier. Raptor: the first of the dinosaurs usable by the Nazis is the classic velociraptor that we have known since the days ofJurassik Park: very fast and able to make great leaps and kill an enemy in a few moments with a bite to the throat, pay for all this with the few life points. Desmatosuchus: very powerful armored dinosaur carrying a cannon on its back. It has incredible firepower and an almost embarrassing rate of fire, moreover, it is very resistant to bullets thanks to the armored scales that cover it. Luckily it's clunky and slow. Dilophosaurus: medium-sized carnivore, it can hit enemies with its claws or charge them head-on, moreover, it can grab sheep between the jaws or directly opponents to hurl against those who have the courage to face it. Its extreme defect is its dimensions, which make it an attractive target for any shooter, even if the skin is quite resistant. Let's extinguish them again! Maintaining the obvious parodic verve of the title, even the classes mainly represent the typical stereotypes of the world war, with an eye to the American propaganda films of the 60s: in fact there are six characters per faction, each equipped with weapons, skills, name and even unique history. We go from the usual American to John Wayne, with a Thompson machine gun and a great desire to hurt the French partisan armed with Sten and medi packs, up to the English sapper with a David Niven mustache, with the Soviet sniper and the big Jew, big and armed with a sawn-off shotgun and heavy machine gun, with even physically an eye to the mythical Jewish Bear of the Inglourious Basterds. On the German side we have the doctor armed with an assault machine gun, the sniper and the ever-present simple soldier equipped with a carbine and a submachine gun, who are combined with the great novelties of the game: the dinosaurs. Leaving the details on the various characters in the appropriate box, let's analyze the impact of this mixture in the gameplay. Impact that, in addition to the subtle irony of each comment from the various avatars, also highlights a basic imbalance that signals how the game will need various tricks and patches to bring everything to a fair level of equality. Let's be clear, shooting bursts of machine guns in the face of raptors is always fun, as well as grabbing opponents in the jaws and hurling them at their companions, or shooting them with cannon fire with the artillery piece mounted on the back of a large desmatosuchus, but to the player more experienced will not be able to escape some problems of too powerful or precise weapons (the German mp44), of excessively armored dinosaurs (the already mentioned desmatosuchus), of markedly trivial objectives in some maps, which penalize too much the attacker/defender on duty, or of subpar classes compared to others - the Allied engineer, for one, but also the German private makes no sense when you have the better armed medic and the sniper equipped with a better rifle. However, there are some ideas for fun and, at least in the first hours of the game, the sensation will be that of being faced with a mixture between Jurassik Park and Indiana Jones in its amalgamation of the traits of both films with a marked and irreverent irony at the right point. The problems will come later, when all the seven maps have been seen and all the variants of the objectives have been tried, the routine will start to become repetitive, so much so that, less than a month after the release, after the initial full house, you can already notice a noticeable decrease in players in the servers. Jurassic technique Speaking of the technical aspect of Dino D Day, we know that we can't expect too much from a title based on an engine that is now as old as the Source, especially when it's not Valve who gets their hands on it, and in fact in the face of a general figure satisfactory it is not possible to ignore the various shortcomings both in terms of texture and general detail, both in the characters and above all in the interiors of the houses and in the environments. On the other hand, the three-dimensional models of the dinosaurs, the exteriors and some lighting effects, especially the flames, are improved. Fortunately, the frenzy of the clashes often overshadows the graphical shortcomings, however leaving the player satisfied with what moves (and dies) on the screen. With regard to the servers, there is good general stability, with very rare crashes often motivated by important reasons such as updates or the like. A couple of patches have been released in two weeks, which gives hope for a continuous commitment from the developers to update their product, which still lacks an already advertised single-player and who would appreciate a few more maps and dinosaurs, maybe that T -Rex peeping in the trailers but not seen in the final game, and it is known that a dinosaur product will never be a dinosaur product without a Kingx incattivito chasing the protagonists. The sound effects of the various weapons are good, recognizable from each other precisely by the sounds of explosions (knowing if the one shooting on the ground floor of the house on which you have positioned yourself as snipers is the machine gun of an ally or an enemy helps a lot) and the voices of the characters, their comments and the accompanying music based on those of the great American blockbusters are also spot on.", "date": "2011-04-26", "grade": "6.0"}
