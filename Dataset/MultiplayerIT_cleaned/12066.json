Land of Wonders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/italy-land-of-wonders-recensione.html", "text": "Italy is a wonderful country, which alone possesses a good portion of the world's artistic heritage, boasts extraordinary landscapes between sea and mountains, a balanced climate and an incomparable culinary culture. However, we have not always had the ability to adequately promote these incredible riches. Maybe a mobile game will make the difference? The review of ITALY. Land of Wonders presents us with the new title developed by the Italian Infinity Reply team in collaboration with the Farnesina. A promotional project, in fact, and completely free, which through simple puzzle mechanics aims to accompany us in our twenty regions, in search of as many sparks necessary to bring the light back to the beautiful country. History ITALY. Land of Wonders, the diorama of an area of Sardinia. Despite its simplicity, the story behind ITALY. Land of Wonders hides interesting aspects, starting from the name of the protagonist, Elio, which refers to the Greek god Helios and who is facing this adventure in the company of five guardians who embody Art, Nature, Gastronomy, Entertainment and Italian Design. Completing the one hundred levels that make up the game's long campaign immediately reveals itself to be an operation of great cultural value, given that for each completed region we will have access to a series of descriptions and curiosities relating to the attractions present on the territory. In short, a real guide that we will be able to consult freely and that will not fail to provide us with information we were not aware of yet, encouraging us to visit new places. Gameplay ITALY. Land of Wonders, the diorama of Pisa. ITALY. Land of Wonders immediately presents itself as a simpler and more essential product, although far from trivial. We are talking about a real puzzle, in which from time to time we will have a number of moves or a limited time to restore a fragmented path and allow a particle of light to reach the other end of the scenario. After a couple of simpler regions, the complexity of the gameplay increases and some buffer solutions come into play to avoid episodes of frustration, see for example the multiple choice quizzes useful for obtaining additional moves or the same possibility of buying new moves using coins earn so far. Technical realization The graphic style of ITALY. Land of Wonders draws clear inspiration from that little gem that responds to the name of Monument Valley, painting some of the most famous Italian places in a minimalist and elegant way, as if they were small dioramas in pastel colors, very pleasant to see despite their general static nature. An excellent job has also been done on the front of the interface, which is always clearly legible. The touch controls are just as simple and immediate: just touch a single block of the path to make it rotate until it is in the position we want, after which the movement of the particle to the finish line will be automatic. The music is very nice, which refers to the Italian tradition trying to mix different atmospheres together.", "date": "2021-08-02", "grade": "7.5"}
