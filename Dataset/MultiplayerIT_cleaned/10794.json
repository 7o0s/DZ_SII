Therefore, a software house like EA could not miss the appeal, which tries to ride the wave of success of the MySims series by reproposing it in a multiplayer key. My name is not written on the glass Like any self-respecting episode of The Sims, MySims Party opens with the character creation screen, indeed rather limited and at the same time equipped with a strangely uncomfortable interface: a trend that also extends to the game menus, which are too little user-friendly both by the standards of the MySims series and by those of the entire party game genre. Once the initial perplexities have been overcome, we find ourselves faced with a main mode in which one or more players are called to participate in various festivals (nothing more than collections of minigames, more or less thematic), by winning which it is possible to unlock new ones and get rewards for furnishing your home or beautifying the -small- town that is the backdrop to the action. In reality, this aspect of EA's production is particularly limited and, above all, useless: the monuments can only be arranged in predefined positions, while your Sim's home has practically no sense of existence other than the purely aesthetic one. The depth of the ~furniture~ component of the chapters of The Sims on PC is obviously far away, but even that exemplified by the MySims series appears to have an unattainable complexity compared to that of the title subject of our review. Returning to the actual game, before engaging in a festival, the user must select two companions who will support him in the various minigames: each character has certain values of strength, speed and so on, characteristics that deteriorate as stages are completed that require the use of one of these skills. It would therefore be important to choose a balanced team, in such a way as to use one or the other Sim depending on the reference minigame: the conditional is a must, given that the characters' statistics seem to have a very relative effect on their actual in-game performance. Another of the many aspects that give MySims Party the appearance of a product made with great superficiality. Shoot the bottle game Unfortunately, MySims fails to establish itself even in terms of the pure and simple quality of the minigames, an element that alone could have overshadowed the numerous defects of the EA work. A total of 50 internships have been put on the plate by the developers, divided - and often repeated - over the course of the 12 festivals in which one finds oneself participating. The mini-games do not shine for originality, be it conceptual or structural: the sample collection therefore offers levels in which to collect documents that have come out of a folder on the fly, others where to season a pizza by reproducing the same composition as the one present in the center of the screen, to arrive at slightly more action sections, for example aboard a mine cart. Although MySims Party is evidently a title oriented towards a casual user that couldn't be more casual, the simplicity of many stages is really excessive, to the point that even a child could consider them boring or lacking in bite. In any case, this subjective consideration must be accompanied by another decidedly less questionable one, and which concerns the control system: also in this case the developers got carried away, stubbornly wanting to use the motion sensor functions of the Remote even when it wouldn't have been necessary. For example, you are forced to shake the controllers like a maniac just to make your Sim go for a short run, or to produce unnecessarily large and frantic gestures just to manage a change of direction. The situation worsens when certain mini-games categorically refuse to perceive the movements made by the user: this is the case of a rhythm game-style stage, in which most of the inputs provided through the Remote and Nunchuck shocks are beautifully ignored. Another -grave- sin of naivety of MySims Party is constituted by the unsustainable verbosity of the cutscenes that precede or follow the various mingames: the protagonist is always the presenter of the festivals, a figure that one soon learns to hate in the light of how he dwells in disproportionately formalities such as the illustration of the score or the introduction to an internship. Close the cartata a technical sector that has very little to say: MySims Party does not deviate one iota from the standards of the series, offering blocky and colorful settings and characters supported by a soundtrack that is certainly not unforgettable. Comment While not a bad title, MySims Party is certainly not the best expression of the genre on Wii: valid on paper, the EA title shows on balance a superficial realization in all its parts, from the technical one to the purely videogame one. There are many minigames, but often poorly constructed or simply boring, there are no side elements capable of giving the product a life expectancy greater than a couple of hours; finally, from an audiovisual point of view there is nothing that exceeds the threshold of sufficiency. In short, there are decidedly more fun parties... Pro Technically acceptable 50 minigames... Against ...but largely disappointing Inaccurate control system Boring and too simplistic", "date": "2009-03-25", "grade": null}
