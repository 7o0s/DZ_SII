The famous rural life simulator has developed over the years with very few innovations, always remaining faithful to the original and winning formula (it had some success in the land of the rising sun), and exploring new possibilities only with the advent of 3D graphics and 128bit consoles. On NintendoDS, a platform evidently very welcome to the developers, here comes the fourth chapter: the Island of Happiness. The particularities of a peasant RPG The title reveals the main novelty of this latest title in the Harvest Moon series: the ship we were traveling on was destroyed by a terrible tropical storm, and the current carried us to the shore of a remote island in the middle of the ocean, along with a family of four. The island is apparently uninhabited, but shows evident signs of past civilizations, or in any case of someone who inhabited it in the past. You can choose, as usual, to start the adventure with a male or female character. The protagonist is not controlled with the directional cross but necessarily through the use of the stylus on the touch screen, just like in Zelda or Animal Crossing on DS. Using the arrow key, on the other hand, you manage certain objects and items such as, for example, the spade for hoeing or the fishing rod. Through special colored stones you can enhance your objects, and these special gems can be conquered in some special competitions, purchased in the shop or donated by the Goddess of the Harvest. Harvest Moon is still an RPG, and maintains many characteristics of this game genre. Then it is also the heterogeneity of the context due to the island that makes it never boring and there are so many things to do during the game. As in any self-respecting Harvest Moon, you have to organize crops, farms, fishing and excavations, manage resources but above all human relationships with the villagers, who will gradually grow once the island has become more hospitable. The game is initially slow and cumbersome, and since there are many things to learn, the real gameplay will reveal itself and begin to give satisfaction only after many hours of play. On the desert island, but connected to the whole world There are dozens and dozens of characters to discover in this latest Harvest Moon, and as usual we are given the opportunity to get married and raise a beautiful family. Among the new additions there are some unpublished possibilities, such as the cultivation of rice (appeared only in an old episode of the GameBoy Color, until today): the harvest is evaluated according to a special classification which is based on freshness, quantity and quality , and can be compared with that of other players via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which provides the player with a special ranking of the best farms. Furthermore, by exchanging friend codes, there is also the possibility of chatting with up to four people, simply by entering one's home and using the telephone as a true virtual means of communication. The rankings are updated every weekend, and are divided into general and weekly, so as to give even the latest arrivals the possibility of being able to place themselves among the first places. Nintendo will regularly offer special rankings (for example: best wheat grower, best fishermen, etc.) and will reward the most deserving with special downloads, new tools and unpublished objects to be used for farm work. A certain sense of Deja Vu The Isle of Happiness follows the bird's eye 3D settings already seen in the previous chapters, with super deformed polygonal models that are certainly not amazing from the point of view of detail. The characters are well characterized and with a pleasant and colorful style, very manga as usual. Some elements are recycled from the episode already seen on GameCube, but animations, models and sprites draw decidedly back in the years. The feeling is that the Nintendo DS hardware could certainly manage a much more lively, elaborate and well-finished visual sector. The innovations brought about by the Nintendo portable, except for those that exploit the Wi-Fi Connection, are almost nil. The same use of the touch screen not only fails to bring freshness, but also damages the gameplay of the game, making many operations and movement cumbersome. Even the accompanying music suffers from a certain deja-vu and does not remain particularly impressed in the memory, but in general the whole realizationtechnical mirrors the average of any title of 10 years ago, although improved from the first Harvest Moon appeared on the DS. Comment Those who have already enjoyed any Harvest Moon chapter in the past know well what the latter can offer: the gameplay and game structure have remained almost unchanged, except for the setting, the different characters and some new features. It is now possible to chat with other friends, participate in competitions and be part of special online rankings. Too bad for the decidedly too dated technical realization and the use of the touch screen that creates more than a few problems. Pros Lots of things to do and manage New online features It is unique in its kind Cons Touch control from some problems It starts to give satisfaction later many hours Graphic and audio compartment too old", "date": "2009-01-17", "grade": null}
