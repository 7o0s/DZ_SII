Even today, despite the countless attempts by the developers, the platform has not yet found its Super Mario, while the rare and pleasant Pizza Boy and Frogatto alternate with much more questionable productions, such as the recent Sonic: The Hedgehog 4. With Kami Retro, the British development team Pawprint Games seems to aim at the same target of traditionalists, but it does so by leaving arrows, keys and directional crosses at home, and adopting a decidedly unique visual style. Move, jump, repeat Kami Retro presents itself as a tribute to the platform genre and to the pearls that made it up, a minestrone of clichs and overused mechanics, a toy box containing all the gadgets already seen in past years. In the role of a cubiform alter-ego, the player must reach the exit placed in each level using the objects that the game makes available to him. From trampolines on which to jump to fans that throw air, passing through levers that must be operated in order to continue: each of these objects must be selected and positioned in a precise point of the scenario, transforming each level into an intricate puzzle. Once you have created your own path, you can finally activate the entrance, allowing four small characters to enter the game and move forward independently, stopping only once they have reached the exit or ended up in a trap. From this point of view, Kami Retro clearly resembles Lemmings or Mario vs. Donkey Kong on the Nintendo DS, although the player is able to issue a limited number of orders, allowing him to jump or change direction. If you don't make mistakes, you can easily lead one of the characters to the exit before the next one enters play, but a bad jump or any unexpected event is enough to start the chaos: being able to control and keep two characters in play at the same time it's an almost impossible feat, especially if one of the two has gone off the originally planned path. A very imprecise and unresponsive control system doesn't help, which shows off all its flaws especially in jumping: rubbing the screen upwards seems the most intuitive and comfortable solution, but you need to swipe your finger in the immediate vicinity of the alter- ego for the command to work. This is a clear design choice to avoid trouble when giving orders to multiple characters on the screen, but in a short time it also reveals itself as the main cause of several accidental deaths. Luckily restarting a level is almost instantaneous, and the fact that all objects remain in their last chosen position allows you to retry over and over again without the experience suddenly becoming frustrating. In reality, it is enough to reach the exit only once to be able to unlock the next level, but the stars that appear along the way, and which are just waiting to be collected, entice the player to repeat the same actions for all four members of the party . The colorful and vibrant art style makes each level feel like a toy diorama, while enemies and traps range from huge quills to pools of acid, from scrawny hands to hungry alligators. The real strength of Kami Retro, however, is the good frequency with which new skills and objects to interact with are introduced: as soon as the player has become familiar with a gadget, and just before he can get tired of it, a new gameplay element jumps out , heavily dampening the repetitiveness of the game. Too bad that, although there are some really difficult levels, the vast majority of the puzzles are too simple, so much so that completing them all takes an hour or so, and even those who want to collect all the stars or unlock every Game Center will not have major obstacles.
