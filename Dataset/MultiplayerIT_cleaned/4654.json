Sure, Nintendo must have really liked the idea that EVO and the other tournaments that matter were played with Wii U and perhaps it was also for this reason that it entrusted the development to Katsuhiro Harada, the historic producer of Tekken: the aim was yes that of making a good fighting game, but also and above all of making one suitable for everyone who could appreciate even those who did not know Pokmon well or, vice versa, Tekken. In the end, the bizarre project was of some use, because it demonstrated the versatility of Pokmon even in a field in which they had not yet ventured and because it probably brought many players closer to a genre that has been practically only represented on Nintendo consoles for years from Smash Bros. In short, Pokkn Tournament laid excellent foundations for the growth of a new and interesting franchise, but Pokkn Tournament DX did not take the desired step forward. Deluxe? The dictionary tells us that the word deluxe or de luxe means: ~luxurious, luxurious, sumptuous~. However, this is not the case with Pokkn Tournament DX. That's the game, mind you. It hasn't changed one iota and this can also be there: despite some uncertainties, such as the questionable division into phases of the clashes or a discreet slowness, Pokkn Tournament was a solid, competent and even quite technical fighting game. As we said at the beginning, he tried to please everyone and from our point of view he even succeeded. Nintendo, however, had abandoned it rather quickly, also thanks to the sunset on the horizon of Wii U: while the arcade version was updated with some extra fighters, the console version remained motionless in its dramatic repetitiveness. Here, Pokkn Tournament DX includes those fighters that should have been DLC at the time of the Wii U - Croagunk, Scizor, Darkrai, Empoleon - and adds an absolutely new one to them, Decidueye from Pokmon Sun and Moon. We tested them thoroughly and we were able to see the goodness and originality of their movesets, especially of Decidueye which we understand was designed in a moment of greater maturity compared to the launch: he is actually the most versatile and interesting wrestler of the five, above all thanks to its ability to hang in mid-air and confuse the opponent. The new fighters, together with the two ~secret~ bosses of the original Mewtwo and Shadow Mewtwo, are selectable from the beginning and the same is also true for the new support duo formed by Litten and Ploplio: this means that the player doesn't have to show off the boring Ferrum League only to unlock the two Mewtwo and the corresponding stages. The campaign therefore becomes an even more secondary mode in which to ~grind~ the meetings to earn bonus points to be assigned to personalized Pokmon or clothing for our avatar and his coach. Alternatively, the player can dedicate himself to the other two game modes implemented in the conversion phase. The first is actually only a structural variant of the clashes that allows you to fight three against three. Don't get excited: this is a nice but very essential addition that does not contemplate real-time trading like for example Marvel Vs. Capcom. In this sense it is more similar to the old The King of Fighters and the fighters take on the opposing team simply in turns. It is still interesting to break the monotony of the usual one-on-one meetings. The other mode, Daily Challenge, is just what the name suggests - a daily encounter that offers bigger rewards in terms of currencies and bonus points. Other than that, Pokkn Tournament DX lacks single player content just like the original version. Of course, there's a multiplayer mode that allows for friendly and ranked online matches, as well as the ability to set some rules in custom matches. The shadow of the Wii U Let's clarify: our problem with Pokkn Tournament DX is not strictly content. More high-sounding fighting games with less content have come out at launch and in any case we all know that it is the Versus mode that makes the difference and, from this point of view, Pokkn Tournament DX also offers a netcode that has never missed a beat in the games played. It's actually a bit annoying that the game sports that DX in the title and ultimately adds very little to the source material: compared to another conversion like Super Mario Kart 8, for example, Pokkn Tournament DX comes away with broken bones . The fact remains that a small effort has been made, including additional fighters, a few small extra modes and so on. The problem of Pokkn Tournament DX is another, and that iswhich is a conversion... in the truest sense of the word. The Japanese developer has taken the game from the Wii U and adapted it to the new Nintendo console, increasing the resolution of some textures that now appear sharper. All the issues we flagged up in the review two years ago, such as general image grime due to resolution, aliasing, and the unfortunate decision to more realistically depict Pokmon, sadly return to the spotlight, exacerbated by the simple fact that Switch could have done more. For the avoidance of doubt, Pokkn Tournament DX runs at 1280 x 720 in the Dock, while the original ran at 960 x 720. Fortunately, the frame rate looks rock-solid this time around - the Wii U version missed a few beats in the most chaotic moments and when we replicated them in this new test we did not notice any slowdown but a constant 60 frames per second. In multiplayer mode, however, the situation is disappointing. In the absence of a GamePad like the one on the Wii U that allowed a second player to fight locally while looking at the controller/tablet screen, Pokkn Tournament DX allows you to choose between a classic mode and a split-screen mode. The classic mode, however, is impractical due to the peculiar structure of the fights: for the uninitiated, the matches in Pokkn Tournament begin in the so-called ~panoramic phase~ and the camera focuses on the player from behind, a bit like in the recent Naruto fighting game. The attacks - which change considerably - can however trigger the ~duel phase~, in which the players face each other on a single axis taken from the side as in the most classic of Tekken. This means that in the classic one-on-one mode, one of the players is filmed, in the distance, by the opponent's shoulders: although it is possible to extricate oneself between the reverse directions as has always been done in any other game, the classic solution prevents you from evaluating correctly distances and spacing. The split-screen mode, on the other hand, is disappointing. The screen splits vertically into two equal halves, but each halves reproduce letterboxed combat, further reducing the player's field of vision. Added to this is the halving of the frame rate which passes to 30 frames and even less in the most agitated moments. Obviously the split-screen is absolutely out of the question in portable mode, which nullifies one of the strengths of the new Nintendo console: at that point, the player who has run out of single player content and who does not want to ruin his view locally, will be able still make use of the one-on-one fights online.", "date": "2017-09-26", "grade": "7.0"}
