{"name": "Nba Street", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-street.html", "text": "The graphic impact The graphic trait and accuracy of the EA Big is certainly one of the elements that most contribute to the exciting impact of the games of this software house. The graphics of Nba Street are very reminiscent of the Japanese / comic style SSX and a high general level even if every now and then there are some small smudges. The players are ~big~ and defined and thanks to the excellent use of motion capture the players perform tricks and dunks in a completely natural and fluid way. As in SSX there are some beautiful colored ~special effects~ designed to emphasize the action and the show such as the trail left by the hand of the defender when he tries to steal the ball, the sparks falling from the electric cables, the dynamic shadows of the players during night games and players breathing during a snowfall. The playing fields (or battlefields) represent another exercise in skill and imagination by the creative staff and achieve a refined customization of the different locations: the games will be played in very different climatic conditions and the whole environment that moves and ~lives~ around at the field makes everything highly spectacular (in fact you will be able to see taxis taking a road near the playing field, or the DJ changing records among the roaring audience). Even the sound part is of the highest quality, immersing us in the classic urban suburb environment with bases and songs with a clear rap and HardCore imprint; for this part, EA relied on the well-known Ninja Tune label which accompanies our journey into the world of Street Basket with an interesting sound track. The Game: refined technique and spatial physics Another strong point of NBA Street is certainly the very fast, precise, engaging and immediate gameplay. To become familiar with the controls, Joe's course ~The Show~ is the obligatory first step with which the novice player will have to measure himself. Already from this tutorial we will notice the general quality of this title. What for many other video games represents a boring starting point here, thanks to the graphic accuracy and Joe's sympathy, the player will have fun and learn the basic techniques with a smile on his lips. After gaining experience you can choose 2 modes: City Circuit where you will face all the NBA teams and the 6 + 1 street legends while in Hold the Court you will be engaged in winning series of matches (the number varies from field to field) to get points and items to further customize the player you'll be able to create. The main and fun game mode is represented by the ~City Circuit~ a championship that takes place on the streets of many cities, from New York to San Francisco; some basketball courts are made up, while others are faithful reproductions of reality. In the first phase, you have to compete with other NBA representatives, in numbers ranging from two to six, who must all be defeated if you want to have the chance to face the local champions. The latter are not taken from the ranks of professional players, but are simple street players, some really existing, others completely invented by game designers. All these characters are strongly characterized: ranging from the giant who touches the basket with his hands without jumping, to the very fast rapper. Once the local champions have been defeated, you can continue on a new field of the circuit. The prize for victory also consists in the possibility of introducing the most representative player of the defeated team to your roster. The team we build can also be used in the other game mode, ~Hold the court~, the classic single game, which can also be played against a friend. As already mentioned, technically the environments are very well done, with a wealth of detail and great realism but, unfortunately, the interaction of the players is limited to the pitch, creating an unpleasant invisible wall that separates the field from everything that surrounds it . This problem is all the more serious when one considers that when the ball goes out of play, since no infringement is foreseen, the ball appears to bounce back in pushed by an unseen force. One of the most interesting innovations compared to SSx and which gives even greater depth to the game is the possibility of creating a player thanks to the points that you will be able to get every time you win against an NBA team and legends. You can choose his height, face, weight, his skills such as the 3-point shot, the two-point shot, power, speed and other parameters. With an almost RPG setting, every time you getof the points you will have the opportunity to increase the skills of your dream player and test them immediately on the field. If you decide instead not to take points for your beloved player, you can ~steal~ a member of the team you just beat to grow your roster. Not indifferent detail is that, after winning the first match, you will be able to play in your team the myth of always Mister M.J. which, I must say, gets away with it even in provincial playgrounds!!! The sample of dunks, more relevant to reality than those present in NBA Jam, your players will give vent to their creativity by performing the coolest and most spectacular tricks you have ever seen. Dribbles at the limit of the impossible, somersaults on the ground keeping ball control secure, sprints at the limit of the improbable and very violent body checks will increase the ~trick meter~ until you are able to perform the Game Breaker. If in NBA Jam, after 3 consecutive baskets the player went ~On Fire~, in this case with the Game Breaker you will have the possibility to break the opponents' game or rather to bring a decisive break. In fact, if you crush or make a shot inside the perimeter you will increase your score by one and that of your opponents will drop by one, while if you shoot a Bomb your score will increase by 2 and your opponents will suffer a sharp minus of 2. That of ~show points~ it is another element that brings the feeling of NBA Street closer to that of SSX. In fact, you will not only have to be effective but also ~beautiful to look at~. In fact, the more you contribute to the show, the more you will be able to make the definitive break to beat your opponents (unlike ~trapattonism~, here it's not just about throwing it in!). Little tactics, very physical As already mentioned above, the game is based above all on spectacular and fast actions, which leave little room for useless (in this case) tactics. Unfortunately this aspect is also the biggest flaw of NBA Street, because too often the actions are reduced to simple coast to coast, with a single player who in practice leads an entire team to victory. Thus, the action often turns out to be not very varied except in the number of ~figures~ that the players are able to do. The scenographic value of the game is also favored by an enormous number of animations, which reproduce practically any type of existing movement, from the most absurd dunks to the most unpredictable passes. Player control is very good and you have a good command of the team. The only perplexity concerns the management of the artificial intelligence which seems, especially when you are winning big, to intervene decidedly in favor of the team managed by the machine, thus giving the impression of too heavy an intervention by a deus ex machina capable of reporting even the most unbalanced in balance. However, those just made are small criticisms of a product that stands at excellent quality levels both for the impactful aesthetics and for the longevity of the fun above all, once the ~City circuit~ is finished, in the one-on-one challenges in which you can have fun to humiliate your friends. Pros: Excellent technical realization Playability to scream! All the NBA teams plus countless ~secret~ teams There's even Michael Jordan! Cons: Artificial Intelligence Not supporting 4 players NBA Street: Whoever doesn't jump, white is! Nba Street is an important game for at least two reasons: firstly because it is very fun, well-finished and destined to become one of the flagship products of the PS2 (still hungry for quality products that reconfirm its potential for the moment still partly unexpressed) . The second reason (in our opinion even more important) is the fact that Nba Street definitively consecrates EA Big as the most interesting rookie creative team of this year; while SSX was, until the release of this summer's big titles (GT3 and Onimusha), the only good reason to buy the PS2 at a high price and not use it exclusively as a DVD player, Nba street can be considered as a worthy descendant and evolution of one of the funniest sports games ever: NBA Jam. The Ea Big is also important because it is stylistically recognizable and has an important and clear objective, that is not to pursue simulation perfection (already an objective of the parent company Ea Sports and in our opinion a utopia of modern times) but to make the various sports real and own spectacular events, grotesquely exaggerated and therefore absolutely amusing (is there really a lot of difference with what is happening in reality for the most popular sports? We think not). Ea Big has therefore entered the crowded world of video creativityudica with clear ideas and objectives and a good dose of creativity and technical quality and is demonstrating to everyone (also thanks to Nba Street) that it has already carved out a prominent place by creating what we could already define as ~feeling Ea Big~. Who doesn't jump is white (USA 1992 directed by Ron Shelton with Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson and Rosie Perez) is a film underestimated by critics and the general public but considered as a cult by all basketball fans around the globe for its realism with which he manages to describe the life of the American playgrounds, a real borderland of the big cities in which real legends of street basketball and gymnasium move for many future champions of the greatest show in the world: the NBA championship. NBA street can be considered as equivalent to the aforementioned film in the world of video games: in the ~Nba street~ you will have the pleasure of leading teams formed by the legends of the NBA against very aggressive teams formed by legends of the playground. This combination is precisely one of the most interesting ideas in the plot of this title game and one of the reasons why even the purists of the great ~official~ basketball will be able to get passionate and play hours and hours in this new title for PS2.", "date": "2001-08-28", "grade": null}
