It will be up to the player to manage a monetary reserve (at the beginning negligible) to buy cars, spare parts and repairs, for a management mode that has little to do with real rallies. The sore point in fact lies in the total absence of official licenses: therefore no names of drivers, car manufacturers and sponsors. However, the cars shamelessly resemble their real counterparts and even the names are very similar (for example, the Ford that has become Cord!). For those who do not appreciate these shortcomings, various mods are already available on the internet to change everything and make it ~official~, thanks also to the excellent level and car editor available in the package. Reflection of perfection... Graphically speaking the game is set to quite high standards, both for the courses and the cars. The various stages take place on immense scenarios, never seen in a rally game! The non-existent clipping allows you to see very far, and in levels such as the American Grand Canyon you travel in the midst of these enormous mountains that leave you speechless in their immensity! The clouds, although they seem to be moved by sidereal winds, leave their shadow on the mountains. The cars are then well modeled and faithful to the real ones, even if colored in an unhappy way. The bodywork reflects the surrounding environment in real time, gets dirty as you run, dents and is destroyed until it catches fire (watch out for the driver...) offering us a convincing damage model and slightly inferior to the usual Colin. Even the particle effects are not far behind: the smoke remains on the road for a while (not like in Colin where it suddenly disappears), sparks, the pieces of the car flying off; all taken care of in the smallest details. A mention to the beautiful water: while not reaching the heights of Half-Life 2 it reflects everything around it including the car! And entering a puddle causes the lifting of millions of drops. Well done indeed. On sunny days we have a light blur filter which, together with the light, creates a rather convincing warmth effect. Beware of evening races: the headlights illuminate the road just enough and care must be taken not to damage them and not to go off the track. Disorientation would mean precious seconds. Lastly, the excellent replay mode: this is perfectly complete and equipped with some goodies such as the display mode; practically filters are applied to the camera (motion blur, saturation, black and white, etc.) which allow nice visual customizations. Then there are numerous cameras, which allow you to see the races from the angle that suits you best and at the same time to enjoy the majesty of the levels. Four left, CUT! The version tested was the one in English which offers a single co-pilot always ready to speak at the right moment. There are no flaws to point out except a too serious voice that sounds very ~English waiter~. The noise of the cars differs according to the category of car but in models of the same the sounds tend to resemble each other. On the other hand, the environmental noises such as the diversified surfaces (asphalt, ice, gravel, bridges) and the occasional noises of the miserable public following us are good. Beware of these individuals: attempting to stretch in the GTA or accidentally bumping into them while crossing the road (including animals) will result in a four-second time penalty! Unfortunately, EAX support is not provided, but the game defends itself in a more than discreet way. Multirally... The multiplayer modes include Internet and LAN, up to a maximum of four players who can play games (fun for arcade lovers) or use ghost cars, to show who has the best times. Ramping opponents is fun especially given the possibility of playing really dirty on the slopes, perhaps by making the enemies fall down a slope. If, on the other hand, you prefer a serious approach, the challenges to demonstrate who has the best car or simply drives better are exciting. Players can create their own servers however they prefer although it should be noted that in games outside of Italy there were several latency issues (especially with active damage). In LAN, however, things improve and if there are four of you, you can launch interesting challenges. Comment The field of rally simulations sees a valid entry in Xpand Rally, which introduces some interesting innovations demonstrating that Colin can no longer lay down the law. Capital management, car tuning and driver health bring a new way of playing, perhaps a little orthodox but interestingand in this field in which it has been a while since there have been significant innovations. If it had been inclusive of licenses, surely enthusiasts would already have a new idol to adore, however the Techland programmers show us how something good can be achieved without showing off high-sounding names. Furthermore, the car and level editor, combined with an imperfect but intriguing multiplayer, guarantees excellent longevity. Simulation lovers will find what they are looking for as well as arcade gamers. To conclude, it should be noted that the stock is being sold at the very attractive price of around 30 euros. Pros: Innovations such as health and monetary career Advanced graphics Attractive price Cons: Absence of official licenses Sometimes repetitive and frustrating Multiplayer not without flaws Unclean worlds The absence of licenses also gave programmers the freedom to invent all the competitions by offering five different countries (it would be better to say worlds) and various special stages. The term ~worlds~ means that the various stages are obtained in a single scenario for each of the five, often mixing the various roads along the lines of Project Gotham or Need for Speed Underground. Translated in other words: some routes end up looking too much alike, giving a sense of repetitiveness. On the good side we find different types of gradients that make some races real height nightmares: curves on the edge of a ravine, dangerous jumps, bumps surrounded by pits. The tension from a fall is very high at certain times, above all due to the risk of hurting the pilot who, if slightly injured, will compromise driving slightly, but in the event of severe trauma it will certainly lead to defeat (and hopefully not death!). The physics introduced by XR stands at qualitatively high levels, slightly lower than the Richard Burns Rally simulation, but rather higher than Colin 2005. Controlling large-engined cars requires experience, which will be obtained with a long apprenticeship starting from low-engined models. Purists will appreciate it, while others strictly recommend the arcade mode, which leaves out all the more or less complicated aspects of the simulation. By progressing in the game and thus obtaining good positions in the rankings, you will get cash prizes to repair and tune up your car; operations to be carried out under penalty of repeating tenders which sometimes proves to be rather frustrating. Often times an attempt to put away the money for a more powerful machine will fail in buying the modifications needed to beat the competition. An annoying choice but which serves to give greater importance to the tuning. Expand the rally! Techland programmers seem willing to give Codemasters a hard time which, with the latest Colin, seems to have rested a little too much on its laurels. The main menu offers the usual game possibilities: single race, championship-career, multiplayer (Internet or LAN). Choosing the second, the real fulcrum of the game, you find yourself in a mode that offers some novelties for this kind of title. Meanwhile, it is possible to decide whether to play in the arcade (fast and without too many thoughts) or in simulation, where things change drastically given that for the first time a rally game offers the possibility of injuring (if not killing) the driver, compromising the outcome of the races and of the whole career! On top of that you start out as a novice racer without even a car wreck.", "date": "2004-12-30", "grade": null}
