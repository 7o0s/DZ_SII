{"name": "Il peso dei ricordi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119324-remember-me-il-peso-dei-ricordi.html", "text": "Remember Me, originally Adrift, is the first project of the young French house Dontnod, a studio that welcomes developers from Ubisoft, Criterion Studios and Quantic Dream. Born in 2008, the game underwent an extremely troubled gestation, almost risking cancellation, finding new life (and funds) thanks to Capcom, which decided to produce and distribute it. Set in a futuristic Paris, the title fully embraces the cyberpunk vein with an unoriginal but always intriguing premise, that of the manipulation of memories, and does so by exploiting a female protagonist of rare charm, ironically the greatest source of headaches for programmers . But the surprises don't end there. Empty heads 2084. It's a day like any other in the future of Neo-Paris, a future governed by the Sensation Engine, for friends Sensen, a revolutionary brain implant that allows you to download and share memories online. Placed on the back of the neck, this ominous orange valve-like hologram makes people into hard drives, moving towards inexorable dehumanization. In this chaotic scenario, we take on the role of the errorist Nilin, a prodigious hunter of memories capable not only of taking them from the Sensen, but also of modifying them at will. But now there is no time to think about this, because Nilin is in big trouble, imprisoned in the Bastille, the main prison of the city, the girl finds herself deprived of memories and about to undergo a little reassuring ~reconversion~ therapy. The intervention of the mysterious Edge prevents the precipitation of events, providing our heroine with an escape route. After the initial dismay, Nilin tries to organize himself to find his identity and discover those responsible for what happened to her. A series of events, more or less fruitful encounters and a long series of missions govern the plot of the game, until it leads to the inevitable final twist. Personalized barrels Remember Me is a third-person action that mixes different elements together in an attempt to offer a deliberately confusing experience, so much so that the same game looks like a distorted memory grafted into someone's brain. The vocation towards the platform is very strong, with parts that recall on several occasions both the various Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider and Uncharted. Nilin moves easily between the neon signs and the windows, descending from the ledges with the grace of a kitten, but she also has the nature of a true warrior, particularly useful considering the countless fights that see her involved. The multinational creator of the Sensen, called MEMORIZE, has set up a militia of super technological soldiers, the SABER, who represent the main enemies of the game and are supported by deadly drones. As if that weren't enough we also find ourselves facing the disturbing Leapers, mutants and outcast bums who have gone crazy following a rejection of the Sensen and who dominate the slums of the city. These unpleasant encounters translate into increasingly complex combat sections featuring a customizable combo system. The player is able to freely assign four series of skills, called Pressens, to each of the keys that make up the combos, which guarantee a series of additional bonuses in battle. These concern both the ability to heal, deliver powerful blows or increase the effect of the chain. The idea is truly innovative, because it allows you to develop different strategies depending on whether you prefer a defensive or pure attacking approach. To these we add the fundamental special attacks, which can be performed through a ring called up with the left trigger. These range from deadly logic bombs, fierce volleys of blasts, and the ability to sabotage support droids so they turn against their own masters. Finally Nilin can interact with the Sensen connector of enemies once they have received a sufficient dose of hits, in order to give him the coup de grace. Opponent attacks are instead avoided through a special move to be carried out at the sight of the exclamation point above the enemy, in a completely analogous way to Rocksteady Studios' Batman, titles from which Dontnod is clearly inspired. The use of special moves is particularly decisive in the battles against the bosses, long and exhausting. Remixing, what a passion! But Remember Me isn't just about jumping and martial arts: the programmers have inserted stealth phases in which we have to avoid reconnaissance droids, and others where we find ourselves facing a series of environmental puzzles. Between the need to move objects or bypass terminals thanks to the powers enclosed in Nilin's glove,some parts are distinguished in which it is necessary to assimilate the memories of others to continue. In this case we see holographic images superimposed on the screen that repeat pre-calculated sequences in a loop, such as the opening of closed doors or the overcoming of deadly traps, which serve as a guide for the action to be taken. The most bizarre addition, however, is the remix of memories, a feature profusely heralded by game director Jean-Max Moris and which highlights the development studio's ties to Heavy Rain. These are basically sequences that Nilin must alter to change the course of events. These sequences are real short films built with the game engine, with the ability to be rewound at any time using the analog stick, just like a movie. The aim is to alter details of the memory to change the outcome, just to give an example we have to prevent a bounty hunter from killing us or induce our victim to commit suicide, making him believe he had murdered his wife. Unfortunately it is impossible to go further on the details in order not to spoil the surprise, but the experiment proves to be very stimulating, creative and decidedly original, even if a little disconnected from the rest. We even managed to achieve a goal by achieving a memory outcome that was not expected to be optimal. Too bad for their small number: we would have liked a more integrated study with the base game, which despite these pleasant parentheses remains anchored to well-established mechanics on the market. Digital madness Graphically Dontnod manages to paint a fascinating cyberpunk universe that denotes the typical European taste: the work on the costumes and settings is nothing short of sumptuous and focused to the maximum on the fascinating protagonist, but everything else also denotes remarkable care. The Unreal Engine is always a guarantee in terms of quality and guarantees defined textures, a high polygonal load and rich colors, a little less the animations. In any case, the confidence of the development team is almost impressive and brings a completely free of slowdowns or tearing, with a framerate anchored to thirty frames per second and excellent video cleaning, but the lion's share is represented by the sound. The musician Olivier Derivire has churned out a true visionary masterpiece that will make school, with a prevalence of symphonic parts enriched by electronic sessions and dissonances that loop like unhealthy viruses. The audio is fully synchronized with the action to give the idea of the supremacy of the binary code over reality, while the unrecognizable main theme is only played entirely at the end of the game. The game is completely localized in good quality Italian, even if the number of voice actors is certainly not striking. The chromatic choice is also decidedly pleasant, which favors the white and orange tone to obtain an alienating contrast between the aseptic cleanliness of the uptown neighborhoods of Neo-Paris (or the Bastille itself), as opposed to the degradation of the slums. Too bad that the story fails to do justice to the visual rendering, resulting rather confusing and not very well narrated, considering the dearth of cutscenes and not exactly brilliant dialogues. Most of the elements are then supplied in the loading sequences between the game chapters, compromising the narrative fabric. The developers said they were inspired by George Orwell for the story, but on balance there are many more ties to Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell. Xbox 360 goals Remember Me features 50 achievements for a total of 1000 player points; concluding the adventure will earn you just over 200, the rest requires finding the collectibles or performing certain actions, such as making a combo consisting of 17 Pressens. The most hilarious is the one you get after being killed five times by reconnaissance drones, which is far from uncommon, which will bring you the coveted 30 points. Not all bad comes to hurt! Where is the problem? As we have already said between the lines of the review, Remember Me is not an innovative product, perhaps to meet market needs: the game follows a consolidated structure in a fairly canonical way, alternating the platform phases with fights for its entire duration . The stealth grafts and the environmental puzzles are simple conjunctions to give variety to the formula, although quite brilliant, especially the latter which require a minimum of reasoning to be overcome. The problem is essentially the execution of what we can consider as the main backbone. Fights failon to evolve as in other exponents of the genre, resulting repetitive and sometimes frustrating. Even if the special abilities are gradually acquired through experience points, one never feels a real growth in one's abilities, as the game does nothing but alternate enemies that require different patterns to lead to error, or that continuously break the chains by surrounding Nilin. The variety of opponents is also very limited, essentially they are color variations of the same SABER soldier model, the droids and the outcasts, only the way you fight them changes. The platform phases follow a similar line, oscillating between the elementary and the cumbersome, with the second case often resulting in excesses of ~trial & error~. In short, Remember Me is undoubtedly a challenging title, but the difficulty curve is more linked to the moodiness of the game design rather than the player's skills. The levels are very linear and there is no way to go back to the old visited areas, but it is possible to replay the episodes individually to find the collectibles, present in large quantities, which allow you to unlock 3D galleries and the inevitable objectives. The adventure has an adequate duration, settling between eight and ten hours, but there are no additional or online modes to extend the life of the product. A fascinating and believable world that has taken away space from the gameplay", "date": "2013-06-03", "grade": "6.9"}
