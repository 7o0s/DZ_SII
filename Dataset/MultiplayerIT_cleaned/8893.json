Almost three months after its release, the Poles of Techland release the first downloadable expansion of their successful tropical resort horror title. ~Bloodbath Arena~ is available on Steam, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live at the usual price of 9.99 euros, corresponding to 800 Microsoft Points, but it's free for all those who have found the code in the limited edition of the game. How... Atrocities! Once the download is completed and the main game has started, it is not perfectly clear how one should access the contents just downloaded, but only after a short search do we understand that by moving quickly on the island map one must access some ~bunker~ points of collection, where through special vendors weapons are purchased, items are modified and repaired on special work plans before jumping into the fray. The level of your character and the equipment are obviously imported from the single player campaign, and for this reason we advise players to access the Bloodbath Arena mode only after having reached a sufficient level and acquired weapons of a certain power (it is useless to enter the bunkers with a water rifle or a slingshot, for example). The level of challenge of this DLC is decidedly tough, with a gameplay that follows the one already appreciated in Gears of War and its ~Horde~: in turns, with half-minute intervals, swarms of zombies throw themselves against our physical safety, threatening her with every means at their disposal (see: the great desire to eat us alive). During the breaks between a herd of undead and the other it is possible to catch your breath, recompose the paraphernalia and fix the hairstyle before a new attack begins, with an inexorably higher and higher level of difficulty as you continue. It starts with a few enemies scattered here and there, and we find ourselves after the tenth wave with a hilarious level of undead that infest every corner of our TV. You haven't seen so many of them, and all together, since some scenes in Dead Rising. Not even the Techland graphics engine, which is an excellent engine nonetheless, was prepared for such an invasion of bad thugs, who in fact sob like crazy in the most crowded scenes. The Poles overdid it, they exaggerated, they spared no expense in terms of the amount of enemies, but in the end it was their Chrome Engine that lost out, subjugated and kneeling by hundreds of zombies. In some situations we find ourselves literally surrounded in every direction, so much so that it is practically impossible to even move freely and we make our way with machetes or machine guns through hordes of walking corpses. It always gives a great satisfaction (and perhaps it is the secret of the success of almost all Zombie titles). The greatest fun is obviously doing it in co-op with three of our other friends, an option provided by this DLC. An option inherent in ~Bloodbath Arena + Leaderboards~, as the title of the file to download suggests, is the presence of online rankings intended to collect the best ~survivors~ in the world based on scores and statistics, with the obviously possibility of being able to compare our progress with those made by friends and the best players around the net. Xbox 360 goals This DLC increases the ~loot~ of points to be unlocked by bringing it from the canonical 1000 to 1200, adding 10 objectives for a total of 200 points, which are very simple because it will be enough to survive the thirtieth wave to have practically completed all the steps, without any particular precautions or actions to perform. L as... Lake of Blood! Bloodbath Arena offers the bloodthirsty player four different maps on which to compete, four different locations by ~typology~ (bunkers, an exterior, a cave and a night map) and relative difficulty. Confronting zombies during the night is obviously different than doing it in daylight, just as surviving in a cave, hunted down like dogs, is more challenging than having an open environment available in which to escape freely and move around 360 degrees. The maps, well designed but not excessively elaborate in terms of quantity and quality of elements on the screen, will certainly not enter the level design manual: the developers have in fact created ~arenas~ (hence the name of the DLC) into which to throw player and zombies, without paying too much attention to subtlety or thinking about refined stratasurvival gie. We are not dealing with the Halo Firefight maps, so to speak, but with real ~spaces~ in which to freely slaughter ourselves with the undead. The ~strategic~ phase is rather given by trying to carry out certain actions requested by the guiding voice. In fact, during the breaks between one wave and another, ~secondary missions~ are given to us to be completed if we want to acquire more points, as happened for example in Bulletstorm and as already happens in Gears of War 3. For example we are called to kill a given number of zombies with targeted methods, or not to use even a medikit during the whole wave. These particular actions reward us with an amount of money proportional to the degree of difficulty, but are not mandatory for passing the round. Since the player's level, weapons and experience during the Bloodbath Arena phases are imported and exported to the single player game, this mode is particularly useful for quickly leveling up, even if now, three months after its release of the game, this feature has now been lost on most players. Too bad also, for the lack of real news. If on the one hand it is true that the ~horde~ mode is always a sure shot, almost a fan service by now, it is equally true that this should be accompanied by at least a fair amount of new weapons (here there is only one unpublished one, the ~ sonic grenade~), characters created ad hoc for the occasion, new game mechanics. None of that in this DLC, just lots and lots of action, blood and zombies. For many it is enough, for many others it is not. Bloodbath Arena is available for 800 Microsoft Points in the Game Extensions area of the Marketplace and can be downloaded here.", "date": "2011-12-02", "grade": "6.0"}
