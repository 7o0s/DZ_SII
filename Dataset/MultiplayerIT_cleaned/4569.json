Team Ninja's souls like has been able to carve out an increasingly large slice of the market and sell a quantity of copies much higher than expected. This thanks to a reworking of a winning formula, combined with the great desire to return to settings forgotten in recent years: the brilliant union between Onimusha and Dark Souls (more BloodBorne in speed, to tell the truth) was the spark that it triggered great curiosity. After more than ten years of troubled development, today the journey of one of the great epics begun during the last generation comes to an end. NiOh is finished, no doubt we will have a sequel sooner than the original but, in the meantime, for those who haven't had the chance to play it yet, get ready for an impressive amount of hours. Welcome to the longest and most varied souls like you've ever seen. Amrita only love We're here to discuss how this PC version fares in relation to a not-so-extraordinary tradition of console porting. However, this does not exclude the fact that someone may not be aware of the assumptions of the game, which is why we will try to give a smattering of the various aspects. On a narrative level, NiOh is inspired by an old script never brought to the big screen by Akira Kurosawa. Announced in 2004 by Koei, the project was blocked and restarted several times over the years: having chosen the definitive path of souls like, the narrative arc was structured around a long series of missions divided between them and independent, but which follow all a common thread. The protagonist is a notorious silver-haired English soldier imprisoned in the Queen's dungeon, awaiting judgement. Saved by his spirit guide, he learns of the importance of accumulating Amrita in Japan and of the queen's will to grab a large quantity of it to quickly end the war against Spain. In order to pursue the one he believes to be responsible for the damage caused by this mysterious stone, he decides to embark towards the Rising Sun, starting the real adventure in a devastated Japan of the 1600s. From these premises a sufficiently long, which requires no less than thirty hours to be completed in its standard version, but which is also able to give ten times as many in which case you want to recover all that can be recovered and face the missions at different levels of difficulty (which here totally change the approach to action). As if that weren't enough, the addition of the New Game Plus, capable of completely updating the sets and weapons, and the contents of the three very substantial DLCs, are all elements that will risk keeping you glued to the screen for weeks, if not months. Difficult or frustrating? Let's not hide the reality: NiOh, as souls like, is not a game with a simple approach. It is probably the exponent of the genre which, during the first handful of hours, can be the most brutal and demotivating on the square. The amount of enemies, the frenzy and the addition of particular mechanics such as the recovery of stamina, are elements that take time to digest, but once understood they can totally change the sort of battles. This is exactly what makes the difference between NiOh and all the others: Team Ninja, thanks to its history and experience, has created an action RPG that makes the assimilation of the technique its focal point. If you are good enough to get carried away by what NiOh can give you, you will discover a title that is anything but difficult, but at the same time extremely rewarding. Understanding how to manage your arsenal, when to instill some specific weapons, how to work on character growth and which of the dozens of spirit guides to equip, will all be elements that will make the difference between life and death. It is here that some small flaws in terms of balancing probably arise, which culminate during the three DLCs. The almost infinite variety of approaches, difficulties and the consequent difference in terms of accumulation of resources and growth of the character, made balancing the game difficult for Team Ninja. It is in fact possible that, depending on the method you will use, you will find yourself being war machines or simple soldiers after a few dozen hours. Needless to say, all this will affect a competitive multiplayer component that infatti has never managed to mesh, keeping the focus of the title on PVE alone or in the company of a friend. Nothing alarming, but it is clear that those who are used to painstaking choices of their equipment and then face other players as happens in any Dark Souls, could not digest an armory management similar to what could be found in a title like Diablo . In fact, loot is the fulcrum of exploration and one of the nodal points of the gameplay: in NiOh each piece of equipment can count on a level, a degree of rarity and a disproportionate series of values that change from one specimen to another (also as regards two exactly alike weapons or armor). Each of these can then be transformed into amrita, sold or modified or still infused thanks to some of the NPCs in the game. It goes without saying that all this gives a variety incomparable with no other exponent of the genre, but risks confusing those who are not used to such an approach in an RPG. Patience and dedication, because it will be really worth it. Launcher what a passion! We write this little box separately, hoping that it will catch the eye for all those who find themselves in the situation in which we too found ourselves. Unfortunately for some unhealthy choice of the developers, by launching the title normally from its Steam library, NiOh starts without going through a launcher that exists and through which to manage everything concerning resolution and standard graphic settings. This could give you quite a few headaches, given the fact that in its standard version, NiOh is launched at 720p and there is no way to change the resolution in game. For this reason, the first time, take care to right-click on the title from your menu and select the launcher, so as to set everything up correctly and not waste the two hours that have fallen to us. The joys of Japanese programming. The hard life of porting We come to the crux of this piece: the optimization of the title on PC. In the handful of hours that characterized our test, we can only be satisfied with the work done by the team. Considering the short time since its release and the very few days that have passed since the conclusion of the work on the latest additional content, the title performs very well. It would have been stupid to expect a series of very wide graphic choices, but there is no shortage of all those present on PlayStation 4 Pro and some new and welcome additions. You can thus choose whether to play the title in the ~action~ version - frame rate at 60fps and variable resolution - or decide to use the so-called ~movie~ version - resolution up to 4k, with the sacrifice of being able to count only on 30fps. It goes without saying that our advice is to focus on a greater number of frames per second, which remains a more or less standard suggestion for any gaming experience, but even more when it comes to a title belonging to this genre and as technical as turns out to be NiOh. The positive note is that the performances are excellent and even by activating a series of options useful for seeing the use of resources, one can only be satisfied with the work done by Team Ninja. Unfortunately this is only true for the best performing configurations: sifting through the meanderings of the network and looking for information also through the various discussions on Steam, it would seem that as you get closer and closer to the minimum requirements, the title suffers from some sudden drop in frames of the most tense situations. In any case, nothing that hasn't already been possible to notice in the console version. From an aesthetic point of view, the title remains the mixture of suggestive and mediocre that we have come to know: where the models of the protagonist and demons are excellently made and animated, it certainly cannot be said that the textures of the environments and some standard enemies make one cry to the miracle. To overcome this problem, a design so inspired takes care of it that, provided you appreciate the Japanese setting, it will elicit more than one emotion from you during the course of your experience. Honorable mention for a soundtrack that certainly does not stand out for its variety, but which with its oriental sounds is able to more than worthily accompany the player on his journey made of loyalty and demons.", "date": "2017-11-07", "grade": "8.8"}
