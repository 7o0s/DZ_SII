This is the second downloadable content for the open world RPG created by the Rockville-based software house, but it is not an expansion characterized by additions in terms of story and quests, but rather a ~private~ digression for the Dragonborn . In fact, the Hearthfire package allows ~only~ to build a house within the world of the original game, to raise a family there and to protect its territory. Let's see how. Head of household and carpenter Once the package has been successfully downloaded and installed, just start playing normally and after a few minutes the player receives a message from the local Jarl inviting him to perform a mission. The latter is random, in the sense that it is not fixed and depends on some specific factors inherent in each gamer's game, including the level reached in the campaign. However, at the end of the task received, the user is offered to buy a plot of land with a total value of 5,000 gold coins. The area where you can build your new custom home can be purchased in the counties of Pale, Falkreath or Hjaalmarch, and even in this case the choice of one fiefdom rather than the other is always conditioned by the events experienced by each user. If the gamer does not have the amount needed to complete the transaction, he can easily go around the lands of Skyrim to scrape it together and come back later to carry out the operation. Once the desired land has been purchased and the appropriate area has been reached, the user can finally start building his new home. In fact, there are already part of the material to start the work and the tools necessary for the purpose, such as a blacksmith's anvil and a carpenter's bench for working the wood. Thanks to a guide, the fundamentals for putting up the building are explained, while using a comfortable drawing board you plan what to do: taking advantage of the latter, you start by building a small house, which can then be transformed into a bigger and better home. arranging around it up to a maximum of three wings, each of which can then accommodate a specific room. To do what has just been described, however, it is necessary to procure other material. It can be purchased in shops or recovered from the areas surrounding the plot of land in which it is located. Basically there is no shortage of raw materials, there are deposits of natural materials to ~plunder~ and among fragments of iron, stones, clay and trees to be cut down it is not difficult to find what is needed and transform it into very useful nails, bases, wooden planks and etc. Xbox 360 goals The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Hearthfire gives users five new Achievements. Getting them is quite simple, in fact it is enough to engage in the various tasks to unlock them. In detail, it is necessary respectively to adopt a child, buy land, buy three plots of land, complete three houses and three wings of a building to get the five coveted prizes. The dream house Unfortunately due to some limitation imposed by the developers on the building construction system, in the end some room types can only be inserted in predefined points and not freely. In any case, you can choose to dedicate a wing of the house, for example to the needs of the family, by building a room used as a bedroom or kitchen. In another one it will be possible to obtain a space to deposit the spoils of war earned, armor and weapons, and be used as an exhibition room for one's trophies. Finally, in the last section, space can be given, if desired, to a library or an alchemical laboratory. You can also equip a garden area to be able to grow vegetables or to build a corral for livestock. If some difficulties should arise, a superintendent can always be hired to take care of the needs of the house, supplying the pantry with food as well as going to collect useful building materials himself, and much more. Once you have completed your home, you can move your family, if you already have one (some users have reported a bug in this regard on the developer's official forum which would sometimes create some difficulty in moving their loved ones from the old to the new home - ed ), or make one by adopting up to a maximum of two orphans. Once this is done, however, you must then worry about them from the first moment they set foot in the house and get clothes, toys such as wooden swords and dolls, and everything that can be used to make the little ones happy. Interaction with childrenit's important because you can play with them but also teach them to behave well, scold them when needed or even allow them to keep a pet at home. What more to add? Hearthfire is a DLC with great potential unfortunately not exploited by Bethesda, as the experience runs out briefly and is perhaps not accompanied by more connected missions or by a system that allows for example to start a business or something else. However, while not adding anything particularly exciting in the universe of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim it can be fun and offer, at least to those who have spent entire weeks of their life wandering around the lands of the game world (to others we recommend if possible to ponder their choice well, perhaps by taking a look at the product at the home of some friend who bought it), to go back once again and savor some of its magic. For only 400 Microsoft Points it can be taken into consideration by the most ardent fans, even if in general it has not convinced us to the point of recommending it unconditionally.", "date": "2012-09-07", "grade": null}
