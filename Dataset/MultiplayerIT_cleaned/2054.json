{"name": "Drakan: The ancient's gates", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/drakan-the-ancients-gates.html", "text": "Whoever finds a dragon finds treasure! This is the impression I got from Drakan: the dragon as well as being a combat element is also a valid help and an excellent ~sidekick~ on many occasions. As for the main menu, it is not very rich but contains a series of very useful options with which to manage the commands and change the position of the screen; the ~in-game~ menus are called up with the select key and give the possibility to manage the weapons, the spells and the experience points earned during the game. Loads during the game are fast, while loads between levels are long enough that they load the entire level and all the character dialogues. The graphics are very detailed, the textures are of an excellent level especially for the faces of the characters. The game speed does not slow down even during the most agitated phases. The aesthetics of the character and of the enemies are very accurate and successful, moreover it is perfectly in theme with the fantasy setting of the game (trolls and so on). The environments are very large and well built, allowing considerable freedom of movement and exploration in many levels. The dragon is drawn very well, with majestic and imposing features, and its movements make it more alive and human than other characters in the game. The cleanliness of the backdrops does not go unnoticed which, in addition to giving a discreet sense of depth, renders the distances between the sprites and the backdrop itself well. The joypad controls are very intuitive even if they still require some practice to be mastered; in flight with the dragon the controls are not very difficult but with a little experience you can dominate the flying creature. As far as gameplay is concerned, initially commanding the character's movements is not very simple precisely because the response to the commands is not always fast and appropriate: during the game, however, we will have to deal with characters who will show us the movements to perform (a sort of tutorial) and the keys to press to use the weapons that we will find along the way. With both analog sticks you can manage both the character and the camera system. The game map always indicates all the paths that we will have to reach but it creates a bit of confusion when multiple objectives overlap that are added as the game progresses. The actions available to Rinn are manifold: she can swim, archery, perform magic, ride the dragon and fight with various weapons that we will buy during the game. The sound is characterized by orchestral and impact music, increasing in intensity in the most agitated phases during the fights; the mostly sad music underlines the drama of the period in which the events take place. The dialogues are accurate, they are all in Italian and finally the dubbing is well done (the commitment of the voice actors is noticeable). The game consists of various missions in which you have to carry out the objectives that will gradually be proposed to us during the game. There are, however, numerous extra missions which do not affect the gameplay but which increase its duration. Of course, it cannot be said to pick up the joypad again once the game is over, also because there are not many stimuli in doing so. The hard sentence. In my opinion, the efforts of the programmers can all be seen: the idea behind the game, while not being a pearl of originality, manages to keep the player attached to the screen. The fantasy component and the settings have been well cared for; the figure of the dragon is never ridiculous and it is very rewarding to dominate it during the flight phases. Drakan: the ancient's gates, above all, emerges from the mass of adventures that now populate the shelves of shopkeepers, and even if it seemed shallow at first, it was a great gaming experience. Initially born on PC, the epic of the Dragon Arokh and the warrior Rinn was masterfully reported by Sony on our PS2. The game is a mixture of action and adventure with strong fantasy and epic appeals; However, Sony has not limited itself to the simple transposition of the series on consoles but has created a new game with the plot that begins where the first game ended. The game starts with a short introduction which narrates the story in its previous goings-on. Men and Dragons made alliance pacts so that order and peace reigned which lasted for many years until the wizard Navaros and the Black Alliance, thanks to the help of the Dragons, betrayed the trust of men by violating the pact of alliance. After a period of war and chaos, Navaros held sway until a warrior named Rinn united her soul with Dr.agone Arokh by defeating Navaros and restoring order. The game begins after this narration, and a non-interactive sequence introduces the evolution of the events that promise to be rather nefarious: Rinn returns to her village to discover that his brother has disappeared; Arokh flies to the city of Surdana and will be joined by Rinn and it is in this city that the actual game begins.", "date": "2002-07-17", "grade": null}
