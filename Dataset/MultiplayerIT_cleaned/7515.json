{"name": "Warface", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125146-warface-pallottole-gratuite.html", "text": "What are the ingredients needed to make a solid free to play multiplayer-only shooter? First of all, an accessible and flexible platform, which allows you to manage chat, friends lists and any clans quickly and easily, and which in the case of Warface is identified with the GFace service: just sign up, log in, download the (large) plug-in and you are inside, with the sole condition of choosing a server among those available (in our case the European server). Secondly, immediate gameplay is needed, which preferably refers to the reference points of the FPS genre, both in terms of controls and feeling, albeit with some small variations on the theme, but which is supported by a robust netcode, which leaves no space to issues such as excessive lag. From this point of view, the Crytek product draws a little from Call of Duty and a little from Battlefield, also adding a pinch of Crysis and focusing on the usual four classes: rifleman, sniper, doctor and engineer, the last two unlockable after a few match. Finally, there is a need for a multilayered structure, capable of dividing users into various experience ranges so as to give everyone their own dimension and limit the inevitable frustration of the ~first impact~, when hordes of novices come to terms with the reality and are promptly massacred by those who have been playing longer than them. The multiplayer modes included must also draw in the traditional, with the various all-against-all, team deathmatches and variants of the territorial type, but it doesn't hurt to include some cooperative missions. Finally, there is the technical aspect, which in this specific case can count on the powerful ~know-how~ of the German team, and the very important aspect of giving balance to the free-to-play dynamics to avoid situations in which whoever pays enjoys too obvious advantages compared to those who have no intention of putting their hands on their wallets. How does Warface behave in all these situations? Warface is free to play without problems, it's solid and nice to look at, but it doesn't stand out in the FPS genre Do you spend or do you spend? The free to play model spreads regardless, one might say, but lasts over time and proves to be effective in terms of revenues only when there is quality. We have all turned up our noses at the news that Crytek would have dedicated itself to this type of business, yet the first impact with Warface makes us understand the potential of a free shooter powered by CryEngine, capable of running even on mid-range PCs with all details at maximum and anchored to sixty frames per second, thus offering a remarkable glance and the fluidity necessary for the controls (strictly with mouse and keyboard, the Xbox 360 controller is not supported - at least for the moment) to reveal themselves responsive, accurate and corresponding to what is happening on the screen. As mentioned above, the GFace platform (which also had some flaws for a few days after the official launch in Europe) allows you to access the experience quickly and without barriers, and the start screen presents us with the possible choices: co -op, versus, shop, inventory and clans. In the lower part of the screen there are indications relating to the three currencies of the game: the standard credits, which are earned at the end of each game together with the experience points; i Kredit, the hard currency that must be purchased with real money; the Crowns, a third currency that has the obvious function of limiting the ~pay to win~ phenomenon, given that to earn it you need to stand out in cooperative modes and not necessarily have the best equipment. By accessing the shop, you immediately realize how the developers wanted to manage the presence of these three currencies: there are weapons and items that can be purchased for a limited period of time, often with standard credits, but also permanent variants which, however, must be unlocked by earning experience points, in a reward system that makes the sense of progression an undoubted strength. There is no shortage of aesthetic customizations, a distinctive trait that users tend to care a lot about, but in general the approach seemed honest to us, that is, it is actually possible to play for a long time and obtain good results even when we face people who have invested a certain amount of money to get this or that rifle. To each his own Warface's approach to the shooter genre is frenetic and fast, so much so that the guys at Crytek Seoul have seen fit to characterize the game actions by inserting a spectacular slide (F key while running) which allows the characters to evade enemy fire at close range and simultaneouslyattack from below. The four classes appear well balanced but devoid of any novelty. The rifleman has his nice assault rifle as his main weapon, a blast grenade and an extra ammo pack, while the sniper uses a precision weapon that is very quick to set up and, as we have seen, not affected in any way by the lag: one hit and you're down. The doctor stands as a great class, given that he has a powerful shotgun (one shot, one kill, at least if we hit the target) but above all a medikit and a defibrillator: the first allows you to heal other players and yourself , the second to revive downed teammates (unless they decide to respawn). The engineer uses a light machine gun by default and mimics the medic due to his regenerative abilities, in this case dedicated to armor rather than life energy. He can also place handy claymores to set traps for his opponents. The matchmaking is quite fast, even if sometimes you can run into situations where the game is never started or, worse, you can find yourself faced with people who use tricks to take advantage in-game, such as aimbots or even the ~telekill~, or the ability to kill an enemy without even seeing it. In the presence of subjects of this type, unfortunately, things get complicated: leaving the game results in a loss of points (this is how Crytek wanted to protect itself from ~quitters~), but at the same time there are children who even they boast of using tricks and having received many reports which, however, did not lead to their ban. In short, the best thing to play in peace is to organize yourself with a group of friends. The offer in terms of modalities, as mentioned, is fairly rich but very, very traditional, and only highlights the intention to work within precise boundaries, almost with the fear that a particular change in the structure or gameplay could drive away crowds of gamers. This is certainly the greatest limitation of Warface: it plays well, the gunplay works (even if it is not at the level of a Call of Duty or a Battlefield), there is solidity and the accompanying technical quality is indisputable, however in the package that is proposed to us there is really nothing new, nothing that stands out compared to the many shooters currently available. Gratuity and permissive free-to-play dynamics certainly play in favor of the final result, and the numbers confirm it, but today as today, something more and not less is needed to stand out.", "date": "2013-11-06", "grade": "7.3"}
