Yes, ~Thongs of Virtue~ literally means ~thongs of virtue~, that's right. And anyone who played the first DeathSpank will have no trouble imagining that there really are supernatural thongs in this colorful fantasy world. A few months after the prequel, it is possible to continue the adventure of the hero of the oppressed, as one of the most captivating and amiably stupid protagonists of this generation is pompously defined. Created by Ron Gilbert, father of Monkey Island, DeathSpank inherits the ingenious madness of its creator in a third-person adventure game clearly inspired by the Diablo phenomenon. In reality, legend has it that DeathSpank was a single game, split in two for mystical reasons that will never be really clear, and in fact DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue begins right where the prequel left off... Hello, DeathSpank! Imagine the beginning of The Lord of the Rings film, the famous sequence of the forging of the great rings of power, but instead of the rings imagine that there are colored thongs and that each of these represents a virtue, such as mercy or courage. Now try to imagine someone who tells you this story a bit like Cate Blanchett, with an absolutely epic tone, especially when she points out how the pity thong was given to Santa Claus, who also later fell victim to the nefarious power of the enchanted thong , who have transformed their owners into evil creatures, members of the evil Order of the Tanga. Now imagine you're absolutely serious as you watch this cutscene, and if you can't, welcome aboard. In short, DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue maintains the almost demented humor that characterized the first chapter unchanged, this time projected in a slightly different setting: the completely fantasy world has been abandoned in favor of thematically more realistic locations, DeathSpank will in fact be found to cross battlefields reminiscent of the Second World War, to fight indigenous people in the jungle and bloodthirsty pirates. All to complete the myriad of requests that a true hero like him cannot ignore, exactly as in the prequel, even if DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue demonstrates a slightly greater variety of situations, puzzles and quests right from the start. And as in the prequel, DeathSpank will not necessarily be alone: a second player can in fact participate in the adventure by impersonating an unpublished sidekick, Steve, who, as in the case of the previous Sparkle, shares his vital energy with DeathSpank and cannot equip any object. Playstation 3 trophies DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue features thirteen Trophies: seven Bronze, four Silver, and two Gold. As in the case of the prequel, also this time obtaining the Trophies will not be particularly difficult: for example, reaching level 20 allows you to obtain a Gold Trophy while for some Silver Trophies it will be enough to defeat some mandatory story bosses. Die, minor character! The sensation is that of being faced with a real ~DeathSpank 1.1~ also due to the interface, totally identical and therefore still intuitive and enjoyable, and the control and combat system, almost completely unchanged, except for the major emphasis placed on the use of firearms, distributed in industrial quantities by enemies and practically crucial to get the better of the most difficult opponents. For the uninitiated, the series allows you to associate a different weapon with each of the four main keys of the controller: the fights are therefore rather hack'n'slash with some nice variations, for example alternating attacks to increase a damage multiplier and fill a gauge that can then be depleted with a special shot from some weapons. Also from a technical point of view DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue presents almost no changes compared to the already appreciated prequel: the spherical world of the protagonist continues to be characterized by a great variety of stylized two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements reminiscent of a pop-up book. The character design is hilarious and spot on and the creatures show off an excellent variety of animations, obviously starting with DeathSpank. Perhaps there is a darker choice of colors that make some locations less flamboyant than in the prequel, probably to underline the ~realism~ of some settings such as the pseudo-French town, considering that others, such as the jungle, are complex and very colorful. The huge amount of items that DeathSpank can equip as weapons and armor also contributes to the visual variety:once again, the completely fantasy style of medieval armor is slightly set aside in favor of crazy looking items: have you ever dreamed of wearing a tank?", "date": "2010-10-11", "grade": "8.5"}
