{"name": "Nom Nom Galaxy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163288-nom-nom-galaxy-nom-nom-galaxy.html", "text": "Over time, Q-Games has accustomed us to many interactive experiences with very different characteristics, brought together under the umbrella of the PixelJunk brand. From 2007 onwards, the titles belonging to this trend have been numerous, some have proved to be more successful than others but the common thread has always been to offer the public unconventional ideas. PixelJunk Shooter and PixelJunk Monsters were probably the two most successful experiments of the entire catalog, closely followed by PixelJunk Eden. Nom Nom Galaxy does not deviate from the tradition of the series, proposing a singular sandbox nature that mixes exploratory and platform phases with tower defense mechanics. The whole game is centered on careful strategic management of the resources at one's disposal, necessary to be able to successfully produce and sell tons of soup in a thriving intergalactic market. Yes you understood correctly. In the role of an Astroworker of the Soup Co., a corporation engaged in the recovery of raw materials on uninhabited planets, the player must undertake to build, start up and make efficient a real factory for the production of soup, while taking care to protect the business from the threats hatched by the ravenous competition. For the creation of this project, Q-Games drew partial inspiration from some of its previous projects, but among the main points of reference - since it is a sandbox - titles such as Terraria and Minecraft could not be missing either. Nonetheless, the development team preferred to limit the field, directing the player towards freely malleable but at the same time very specific activities, in such a way as to place a series of stakes that the user must assimilate and take into consideration to aspire to success. Nom Nom Galaxy debuted on the PlayStation Store in May 2015, but the project also landed on PC after going through an Early Access period. At present the game is part of the Instant Gaming Collection intended for PlayStation Plus subscribers for the month of February, so we took the opportunity to carry out a test and share our impressions with you. Nom Nom Galaxy induces the player to make quick and precise decisions The market must be conquered, one centimeter at a time To get in tune with the mechanics proposed by Nom Nom Galaxy you need a minimum of sedimentation. The first level of the game is in fact a full-blown tutorial and it is on the field that all the main rules of behavior are taught that must be kept in mind in order to progress smoothly in the adventure. All objects and materials are proposed and explained in a single solution, to then be gradually diluted during the rest of the experience. That's why it's very important to pay due attention to everything and get a clear idea about base construction methods, resource gathering and defense activities. Within the maps there are products through which it is possible to produce hundreds of different types of soup. Through a machine called Soup machine you are put in a position to mix two different ingredients at a time and to obtain personalized compounds, for the sole purpose of capturing increasingly large portions of the market, saturating the offer and causing the opposing corporation to leave the scene. In essence, only through product diversification is it possible to attract the necessary approval from the public and avoid declines in favor of the competition. The maps in which you operate develop both vertically and horizontally and must be shaped by the player in order to speed up the production cycle as much as possible. To this end, the astroworker has an efficient circular saw with which he is able to modify some areas of the subsoil, creating tunnels and placing stairs as much as possible to speed up both the ascent and the lateral movements. At the same time, the instrument also proves to be crucial for the extraction of materials of vegetable and sometimes animal origin, while time is marked out through single working days, at the end of which a reward is received for the work done and the balance sheets of the activity just finished. Planning and efficiency The most interesting and fun part of Nom Nom Galaxy is certainly the one that allows you to build the entire factory structure from scratch. The material to be used is quite numerous, in addition to the machines for the production of the soup it is necessary to decide where to place the office and the generators, modify the corridors to make them as efficient as possible and allocate some areas to the mailshipping operations that take place using interstellar rockets. The viaticum for success can be summarized in a single word: sustainability. Yes, because in addition to the basic structures it is necessary to set up a dense network of robotic collaborators who will be responsible for transporting the resources and transferring the ready-made material to the shipping area, but not only. In the more advanced stages of the game, in fact, additional personnel are unlocked, destined for the research and collection of materials, to the point of allowing the player to better set up tasks and provide logistical support. Moreover, during the production it also happens to suffer several raids by the competing forces, sent to damage the factory buildings and slow down its efficiency. For these reasons it is also necessary to place defense turrets and constantly check the state of conservation of the most delicate parts of the factory, such as the office and the generators. As an alternative to the single player experience, Q-Games has also set up a cooperative mode, which can be used both in split-screen and online. By selecting the Quick Merge mode, you can enter other people's games by contributing to the development of large structures in the company of three other users, while by selecting the Suppa Simulator mode, you take back the same building already created previously in that particular level, only aim of continuing the expansion of production and without entering into direct competition with other corporations.
