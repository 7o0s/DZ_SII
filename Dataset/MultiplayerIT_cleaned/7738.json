The path that a poor seed must follow to be able to reach a piece of fertile ground and be able to become a seedling is a real epic journey that involves the most powerful forces of nature, coordinated in the solution of puzzles such as to suggest that the growth of a simple nettle outside the window is an event to be greeted with sincere enthusiasm, rather than an event worthy at best of a fleeting glance of disapproval. This, if nothing else, is something that remains within the obviously fictionalized direct experience of the natural planting illustrated by the Eko Entertainment game, which, despite various defects, offers an original and interesting initial concept and a certainly not abused atmosphere. There is some reference to Flower, in the idea of the precious vegetable transported by the wind as the protagonist of a fantastic story, but the similarities with the title Thatgamecompany remain rather scarce, linked to the limit to the general spirit of the game. It is no coincidence that Storm has entered the court of Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network through an interesting publishing and distribution agreement promoted by Namco Bandai: it is not a game that can easily impose itself on the public, especially the console one. The rarefied atmospheres and the peaceful, almost humble appearance make it a somewhat particular product compared to the mass of games available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 (while PC gamers have the plethora of Indie games to enjoy), even taking into consideration the now well-established digital libraries. In short, the premises are excellent, in particular as regards the initial idea and the basic rules on which the puzzle is structured, but the final result shows some flaws in terms of implementation, above all as regards the control system and the balance, which in a puzzle based on the dynamics of the elements and physics are not secondary characteristics. Elementary puzzle The aim of the game is therefore to make some seeds reach plots of fertile land within the approximately 50 levels present, divided into four macro-sections represented by the different seasons, which characterize settings and some different types of interaction with the scenarios. The player finds himself moving a pointer on the screen, controlling with this the three elements available: wind, rain and lightning, each capable of acting in a different way and with the need, often, to fit together the effects of each detail natural ~power~. The wind is able to move objects (and the seeds themselves) with strong and sudden gusts, the rain creates flows of water capable of filling the hollows, making objects float or move based on the movement of the fluid, finally lightning it can set fire to some elements of the scenario or create sudden movements, for example making the seed blow up. The basic dynamics work well thanks to an appropriate response of the seed based on the simulation of physics (particularly convincing, from this point of view, the reproduction of the behavior of water) and the level design for most of the game stands on great levels, but problems arise when the powers start to get more complex, like when tornadoes come into play or using lightning to blast moving seeds. In these cases the indirect control system, via pointer, shows both the physiological limits given by the adaptation to the controller of an interface clearly designed to be used through the mouse, and some intrinsic problems in the management of the physics when multiple inputs contribute to a complex reaction. In the more advanced levels, the slightest mistake can frustrate the game and the absence of checkpoints, combined with the lack of communication from the game within the levels - an element that can be considered positive in general, but also disorienting in several cases - make the inaccuracies of the control system a rather annoying problem, since they focus the level of challenge around the trial and error of the commands rather than on solving puzzles and planning the actions to be taken to get to the bottom of the level design. Xbox 360 goals Storm contains 12 unlockable achievements for 400 Microsoft Points. Most of these are unlocked by continuing in the game, so the conclusion of this is rewarded with an adequate collection of points, while for the complete loot a little additional effort is needed on the different modes and perhaps more passages to the game.inside the levels. The wonders of nature As befits a game centered on nature, Storm features simple but effective cosmetics. The levels are designed in 2D, with scenarios that represent natural, bucolic landscapes and dominated by tranquil and rarefied atmospheres, also underlined by an audio accompaniment with a rather new age style. All this contributes to providing a very relaxing, almost regenerating experience compared to the normal sensory stimuli of classic video games. Perhaps the most characterizing element for this Eko title lies precisely in the general atmosphere, which manages to combine the basic idea of a puzzle game linked to natural forces with a technical realization that actually highlights nature, perhaps stylized and a little ' naive but undoubtedly well built albeit with simple means. The level design works well until it gives way to the timing and precision of the movements, leaving the complications of the control system the load of effort that would certainly be better invested in the desirable complexity of the puzzles and the structure of the levels. It is perhaps a choice also dictated by the good quantity of these, which reaches around 50 in total, but perhaps a reduction in length (although not very large, in terms of amount of hours of gameplay) would also have been preferable provided constant maintenance of the pace and intensity of the game. In any case, puzzle game enthusiasts will probably find bread for their teeth in the Storm offer, which also allows for a certain replayability thanks to the three modes present (Adventure, Free mode and Spirit mode), but the lack of any sense of progression (although consistent with the essence of pure puzzle game) beyond the change of seasons and the sense of alienation that also derives from the lack of a ~guide~ of any kind in tackling the game's levels are features that are unlikely to will be appreciated by all.
