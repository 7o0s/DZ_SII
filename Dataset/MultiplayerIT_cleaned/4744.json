At first sight you might not think so, but the game developed by Monomi Park is based on an excellent - albeit bizarre - idea and develops it in the best possible way in a balanced and deep structure, which perhaps also benefited from the long period of early access to which it was subjected. It tells the story of Beatrix LeBeau, an enterprising girl who, tired of the usual routine, decides to leave the Earth and travel a thousand light-years towards the ~Far, Far Range~ sector of space, to make a fortune by dedicating herself to breeding of slimes. Yes, because the strange planet is uninhabited by mankind, but it is quite lively as regards the local alien species, which correspond to different types of slime: hopping little beings with different characteristics and aspects but all capable of producing a material called ~ plort~ which, as the name suggests, seems conceptually similar to feces but which represents an incredible source of interplanetary income in the new space economy. In short, Slime Rancher puts one of the ancient principles of land cultivation into practice, which sees in excrement an important source of wealth, translating this concept in an all too literal way: we therefore find ourselves managing a ranch of alien creatures entirely focused on poop production. Not really a shooter Were it not for the decidedly ~kawaii~ aesthetic choice, to see the subjective shot or the strange weapon held by the protagonist, one would think of a first-person shooter, perhaps in Metroid style given the alien setting. Nothing could be more wrong: Slime Rancher is a sort of management system that puts us in control of a ranch armed with a single handyman tool capable of sucking and shooting slimes and materials, with the possibility of expanding the farm's equipment and instruments by investing hard earned money. The first-person shooter-style setting makes the action particularly dynamic, with the need to engage in various phases at a rapid pace, from exploring the planet to constantly monitoring the situation at the ranch, which is why it also becomes important to enhance the own equipment to enable faster travel and greater transport capacity. When the situation becomes more extensive and complex, the limitedness of the subjective shot emerges somewhat for a game of this kind, which would perhaps require a more extensive and comprehensive look at the progress of the ranch, but the subjective shot perfectly conveys the idea of what it can be like to be the only human on a planet filled with chaotic little creatures that you have to take care of. In fact, at the center of all this there are slimes, alien beings that come in various types, shapes and sizes and of which we will soon have to learn every feature and variant as they are the basis of the entire economy of the game. The creatures can be sucked in and released inside special enclosures which we will take care of preparing and modifying according to the needs to safely contain the various types of aliens. In fact, it is not just a question of collecting aesthetically different creatures, but of managing in the best possible way a real alien ecosystem whose components evidently have an innate tendency towards total chaos, essentially guided by two priorities in life: eating and producing ~ plort~. The latter is the element around which the economy revolves, and it must be suitably aspirated and released into a special machine that takes care of the payment in direct proportion to the quantity and quality of the material collected. Love/hate slime A love/hate relationship is soon created for these little creatures, so cute but also so difficult to manage. From this point of view, the work done by the developers in the construction of an artificial intelligence capable of making the different species follow different behavioral patterns that are very simple but also well characterized is also commendable. The pink slimes are the first to be found on the planet and are relatively easy to manage, they eat anything and are not harmful but if left unchecked and in large quantities they manage to organize themselves by climbing onethe other to escape from fences, also their plort is not as profitable as that of other species. Red or blue rock slimes produce high-quality, well-paying scraps but have unpredictable behavior and can cause damage when moving fast. Then there are the flying ones, the nocturnal ones and the giant ones, just to give examples, and for each of these varieties it is necessary to find a suitable containment system (raising the fences, also closing them at the top, protecting them from the light) and a right method of diet. In fact, each species eats different things, and to ensure a constant flow of food it becomes necessary to dedicate spaces on the ranch also for the cultivation of raw food materials including wheat, chickens, fruit trees and so on. The important thing is to always keep the situation under control, because you can gradually invest in increasingly safe and automated systems for the ranch (high-level fences, machinery for distributing food and for collecting plort) but there is no never the certainty that everything runs smoothly when breeding has so many different species, also considering that the rarer and more profitable ones often have the tendency to have equally difficult characters and behaviors to manage. Therefore we always find ourselves alternating the exploration phases with running towards the ranch to check that everything is going well, developing a relationship of affection and fear for these bizarre and remarkably vital little alien creatures. Like new gremlins, there are general rules to follow to avoid disasters, such as avoiding mixing species and keeping certain types particularly far from others, because as wild as slimes are, they tend to eat other people's plorts and generate bizarre fusions that can be precious but also harmful in the balance of the ecosystem. Xbox One goals The 1000 points are distributed over 57 unlockable objectives, therefore on average with a rather low score each. Having no real story, Slime Rancher's achievements are all based on performance ranging from discovering new areas to certain actions taken. In short, simply by playing it is easy to unlock a good amount of them. Space bucolic living It is clearly an independent project with a limited budget, yet the aesthetic choices undertaken by Monomi Park reveal a remarkable coherence in the vision of the game, which is based on a well-characterized and non-trivial style. It is true that the general cuteness may seem a bit pimp, but it hides a bizarre contrast with the management difficulties and certain nastiness intrinsic in the mechanics of the game (shooting the slimes from the weapon or burning them in an incinerator are practices considered normal in the care of one's farm), not to mention the absurd situation of having to make money by reselling the creatures' droppings. It is clear that the humor underlying the strange story of the space breeder Beatrix LeBeau goes far beyond the somewhat absent smiles of the slimes, little beings in any case truly endowed with a certain charisma. Stylization obviously also falls within the need to make ends meet in terms of computation and graphic complexity, but the important thing in these cases is to be able to emerge with an original and characteristic style, and on this front Slime Rancher fully achieves the goal. There are still some technical flaws on Xbox One, especially as regards the frame rate which appears somewhat unstable in various situations, but it is possible that these are problems that can be easily solved with subsequent updates, even if after such a long early access period we would have preferred not having to wait for further updates to be able to play without problems. The stylistic compactness also includes the audio sector, which is not distinguished by particular qualities but fits perfectly into the strange bucolic / alien atmosphere, sometimes infernal, of this strange game. The delicacy with which the settings and the variety of these are outlined makes the exploration of the planet truly pleasant, attenuating the sense of monotony that can occur in the numerous and frequent forays between the ranch and the different areas of the world.", "date": "2017-08-04", "grade": "8.4"}
