It is, to all intents and purposes, a resource micro-management system, which leverages small gameplay elements interlocked together like cogs in a perfect mechanism that pushes you forward thanks to the sense of constant progression and a rhythm of very close game. We proceed largely by automatism, in an action that has largely repetitive elements, but it is really difficult to leave the small island once we have started our work of management and survival. Micro-management Survival on a Small Island plays out exactly what the title says It's more a sort of micro-management than a real survival, but the basic simplicity, the perfect chain of actions and the sense of constant progression, even if limited to a single very small area to explore, manage to make a real magic. Survival on a small island manages to be irresistible thanks to the perfect balance between its parts, although the repetitiveness of the action inexorably emerges after a few hours of play, but before reaching that point you will still have tried to see practically everything that c 'is to be seen in the tiny setting. The game is distributed as free-to-play with the presence of advertisements that impose gaps in the gameplay of a few seconds, with the possibility of seeing some longer commercials in order to obtain in-game rewards, and it is easy that even the most stoics can give in to this temptation, once they enter the terrible survival-management mechanism. Survival, crafting and micro-exploration It sounds crazy, but exploring an island that's a few inches wide can be a pretty tricky business, as Survival on a Small Island proves. The story is very simple: the protagonist finds himself on this mysterious island in the middle of the sea and realizes that a column of smoke is sticking out of the center of the forest: is the place inhabited? What secrets are hidden in the trees? Reaching the center of the grove seems like a walk, but it's actually a hell of progressive requests and interconnected objectives, which force us to work diligently so that we can obtain ever more efficient tools to enter the mini-forest and discover its mysteries. The survival mechanics are reduced to a minimum but perfectly thought out: it is a question of collecting the few resources that the island makes available, crafting these elements to build new tools and make them evolve from level to level in order to cut down more robust trees , break stronger stones and fight more aggressive monsters, because of course there are those too. While the screen is pretty much the same, there's a lot to discover in Small Island Survival It is a form of obsessive grinding given by the continuous collection of the same materials but the simplicity with which it is possible to obtain them simply by touching the elements of the screen and the fast pace, also given by the very short waits we are forced to between the necessary rest and advertising breaks , makes the mechanism truly irresistible. The number of hearts at the top of the screen refers to the amount of possible actions in a ~day~ before having to rest in the tent, and these too can be expanded by returning to a pervasive and well-balanced game micro-economy, which also includes the possibility to see commercials to get in-game rewards. Gathering resources allows for crafting but also the eventual trading for money, with the money being invested in hearts and further upgrades. All of this includes the relationship with various NPCs that can be ~discovered~ by exploring the forest, as well as the need to keep monsters and skeletons at bay that emerge from the heart of the island to steal materials and which must be kept at bay by building and strengthening some defensive structures, in an almost hint of tower defense. The use of pixel art style graphics is perfectly appropriate to the concept of the game, also recalling the tradition of Kairosoft and NimbleBit productions, not for nothing also specialized in games centered on the micro -management. It's nothing original, of course, but it fits perfectly with the general style and is always pleasant to look at, even though it is limited to showing prabasically the same screen for hours.", "date": "2021-07-22", "grade": "7.8"}
