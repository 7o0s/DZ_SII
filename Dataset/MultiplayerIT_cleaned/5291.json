On the other hand, as we always say, it is enough to play one of the titles that make up the saga at least once, especially the more recent ones, to realize that fame has never been so deserved. In this sense, the development team seems to have taken a famous phrase by Michael Jordan as a reference, the same one we used to give the title to this review, and even with NBA 2K17 it seems to want to confirm that the growth of this franchise has not and has not it will also have limits in the future, at least as long as they and their passion are there to animate it. Once again, as we will soon see, while not revolutionizing their creature compared to the previous edition, Visual Concepts has managed to give the public a new edition that is always improved in relation to the one that preceded it, working on three simple but important aspects: smooth out the defects of 2016, improve even more what was good and offer some new content, without however putting it there at random, just to make up the number. NBA 2K17 brings all the charm and spectacularity of great basketball to our screens If you don't believe in yourself, no one will do it for you As per tradition, NBA 2K17 offers an enormous amount of modes in which to literally indulge yourself or in the company of friends and acquaintances, locally or via the Internet, using the various teams of the American NBA, some national or historic teams (depending on the version of the game taken) or twenty-one of the best Europeans, including sixteen from this year's Euroleague, such as Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv, Panathinaikos Superfoods Athens or Real Madrid. The beating heart of the production remain My Player / My Career and My GM / My League. In the first, which we largely analyzed in our trial a few days ago and which we invite you to read for further details, the user is called upon to impersonate a college promise, from the first college challenges, to the Draft and up to the top of the NBA, in a mode characterized by a narrative structure that therefore combines the whole aspect of the athlete's life with the match element. He is busy juggling friendships, a mother who is a little too intrusive, the shadow of the legendary Kobe Bryant, distracted managers and so on and so forth. The character must be created from scratch using a complete internal editor, and if desired it is possible to apply one's face to him by scanning it using an app called MyNBA2K17, which to tell the truth does not always work well. After which it must be grown on and off the field thanks to a sort of RPG-style system and to the Virtual Currency, the official currency of the game. The story told in NBA 2K17 puts aside the drama and the strongly cinematic imprint of the one curated by Spike Lee last year, in favor of a lighter plot, but still fun to experience and play. My Player/My Career is also once again network-extended to allow users to extend and share the experience with other real players, and enjoy other gameplay options, including My Park, a dedicated basketball multiplayer mode ~from the street~. By the way, until we tried the game, the servers held up quite well: so let's hope that no problems appear in the next few days and that they work properly compared to the past. My GM/My League, on the other hand, opens up a multitude of options: depending on the choice, one can in fact interpret the role of a General Manager, managing a team from both an administrative and technical point of view, or an entire League, having control over it total, developing a franchise that lasts a single season or up to eighty years, freely intervening on the various parameters that regulate both the gameplay and the organization of the tournaments, from the salary cap to the salaries up to the number of games per season, to the teams to be entered up to a maximum of thirty-six. Also within this area you can also play a Season or just the Playoffs by controlling your favorite team. There are also My League Online, and Start Today, where you can lead an NBA team starting from the real standings and statistics of the moment you decide to control it. The latter, however, will be made available from 25 October. To complete the picture there are the usual Friendly Games, the various challenges to be played with or against one or more friends, My Team, a sort of Ultimate Basketball Team where you can build a team from scratch made up of current players and legends, and where accumulate points to buy new packages containing other champions, upgrades, and so on, which this year is enriched with sand sub-game sessions and an interesting new player/card rating system, as well as the new 2KU tutorial mode, with Team USA 2016 and Mike Krzyzewski, the coach who also boasts the most victories in Division I as well as being the coach of the American national basketball team that won the gold medal at the Olympic Games in Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016, where to train. Playstation 4 trophies NBA 2K17 offers players 46 trophies distributed in the various modes. To obtain them you must therefore work hard in each session and be able, depending on the importance of the prize, to sign a sponsorship contract with Nike or Jordan in My Career mode, buy an upgrade in My Team mode, be named Man of the Match in an NBA game or score a game-winning field goal when time runs out in a non-simulated game. Like on parquet And training thoroughly is, at least for newbies since the feeling with the controls has remained unchanged to the delight of the fans, the best way to better master the controls of NBA 2K17, which in terms of playability leaves no room for any arcade simplification . However, if, basically, the title rests on the solid foundations of the previous chapters, on the other hand it tries to evolve, and it largely succeeds on those aspects linked above all to the defensive and offensive phases, eliminating those elements that did not work properly last year, such as the changes of pace, now made less sudden and more dynamic, and the defense phase, an aspect on which NBA 2K16 limped a bit. The work of the developers, from this point of view, this year has focused very much on artificial intelligence, to give the virtual players greater logic in applying their team's schemes, but also in acting suddenly in relation to what it takes place in every specific moment of the game, and on their management of physical contacts with the opponent on duty, especially at the maximum difficulty level. In this sense, the spatial awareness of virtual basketball players also helps, so it is difficult to see them glued to each other as sometimes happened in the old editions. From this point of view the work is quite good, and the feeling, right from the first matches, is that the game takes more account of a whole series of parameters in the ~management~ of the various game situations, even if occasionally the defense seems still sometimes a moment get distracted. The developers have also reworked the skills of some athletes, so that their style does not end up exaggerating the dynamics of the game due, for example, to an excessive propensity to perform the same plays with success margins equal to 100% or almost, and so Street. Together with the renewed artificial intelligence and the best physics, to make every contact, movement of the ball realistic (except when after a shot it touches the ring: sometimes it gives the feeling that it must necessarily enter the basket, even if the rebound would suggest everything else!) or touch on the parquet act in combination a series of new connection and completion animations, especially those related to dribbling, crossovers, rotations and sudden movements, contacts under the basket and rebounds, which are truly more natural and fluid compared to the 2016 edition. To steal the ball or block without committing a foul, you must therefore take greater account of every single gesture of the opponent, try to understand where he will go to dribble; in the same way, when it attacks, the artificial intelligence shows a good ability to read the action and the strategies set or invoked by the user. The latter are many and customizable, available and adaptable to each phase of the match, to which they give a further level of variety: in fact, even if you play against the same team several times, the game will never be the same as the previous one, just as it will hardly be an action within the same quarter. Basketball on TV It can therefore happen in a phase similar to the previous one, that the ball carrier draws the attention of the defense to himself to serve a more free teammate or to open useful spaces for the pivot wing for an insertion, or, alternatively, that you really take advantage of a cut on his block to free up the latter's area, to go to the basket or to attempt a running conclusion or a stop and shoot. Regarding the latter, the system that manages them has been recalibrated, in such a way as to further reduce the percentage of randomness to a minimum, and to give greater weight to the amount of parameters that are considered from time to time. Among them, the position on the fieldand the body posture of the person performing it, but also the level of fatigue reached at that precise moment, all his general statistics (the value of an athlete affects the speed with which the shooting indicator fills up), and so on Street. In any case it is clear that the more experienced player or the CPU in the more advanced difficulty levels know how to make the most of their resources, taking advantage of the talent of champions such as LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers or Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks, or of the various Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Danilo Gallinari (cover man of the Italian edition) or Klay Thompson, just to name a few: having similar people in the team can be a significant advantage, considering how these are faithfully reproduced from the point of view technician. And not only in that, to tell the truth: the polygonal models that represent them, in fact, like the rest of the athletes present in NBA 2K17, border on photorealism, even if the smallest athletes appear in some cases slightly more slender than the their respective real counterparts. Sweat, beard, hairstyles, tattoos, everything is rendered with a truly obsessive attention to detail and we must admit that at times, during our test, we had the feeling, especially in replays or in sudden shots, that we were watching a game true. Not least is the public, well defined and interactive with everything that happens on the ~field~, promptly filmed by a director in perfect television style, which never fails to excite the gamer with sudden cuts on the fans, coaches, players and everything that contributes to making this sport even more spectacular in the USA. To complete the picture of a very rich offer, there is a respectable audio sector, curated by Imagine Dragons, Noah Shebib and Grimes, which offers a rich and diversified soundtrack where there is no shortage of songs by international artists such as Jay Z , Jain and Stokeswood, to name a few. The ~arena~ audio effects are also excellent, which help to amplify the feeling of being in front of a real basketball game, in addition to the more complete and full-bodied commentary in the American language, which offers multiple pairs of commentators and announcers, depending on the arena in which it is played, and at jokes during the pre-match curtains where that funny guy Shaquille O'Neil once again stands out.", "date": "2016-09-20", "grade": "9.2"}
