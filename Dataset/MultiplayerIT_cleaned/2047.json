Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville on Nintendo Switch; in short, it took a long time to adapt the latest chapter of the franchise to the portable console of the Kyoto House. This is because EA probably wanted to ~do things properly~ and avoid a mere compression of the original experience, with all the defects that would have resulted from the porting side (the history of Nintendo Switch is full of sad episodes of this type). The result has been achieved, and we are happy about it; we would have been even a little happier seeing proper advertising for Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville, which has been missing from the start, but never mind. Those who love the series probably inform themselves. Are you among them? While you think about it, read our verdict. The contents During its year and a half of presence on the market, Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville continued to receive updates on consoles and PC, which then stopped last September 2020. This means that the Nintendo Switch port of the title will give you access to all original content, plus all subsequent additions, including initially paid DLC elsewhere. It is, of course, a real Complete Edition which consists of a single purchase. If until now you had turned up your nose at the idea of competitive seasons with new prizes, on Nintendo Switch you will have the definitive point of arrival for this chapter; in fact, it does not seem that further updates are planned, at least on the content side. Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville: Zombies and plants clash again! This is not a little material, and probably those who gave Plants Vs. Zombies a chance elsewhere, over the last year, will have already guessed it. From the point of view of the play itself, this is probably the most substantial video game ever: single player experience complete with bosses, playing both as plants and zombies; multiplayer mode full of variations, on which we could write two or three separate insights; twelve maps full of rewards to unlock; twenty fully customizable standard characters, to which three more are added (Wizard, TV Head and Wildflower) that will be unlocked with 500,000 coins each. Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville and a flying camper. Why not? To all this must be added a general rearrangement of the various mechanisms for unlocking game content: clearly the season system has been completely revised, in anticipation of the launch on Nintendo Switch. In general, that content has now been redistributed at some emporiums on the main map; the currencies have also been reorganized to unlock these elements, which can consist of skills with which to equip the various characters or (more commonly) in cosmetics of various types to be exhibited during battles. Overall, it should be noted that Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville was already chaotic at the time of launch: too much iron on the fire usually prevents you from fully enjoying all the good things that are present. Now, at least in the initial moments, the confusion is total, despite the attempt by the developers to bring everything back to order. We appreciated the attempt - the fact is that there are just too many things to do, to see, to unlock and to obtain. There were probably no decent ways to put them in order: the first few hours of the game you will spend exploring the menus and locations of the various hubs. The conversion to Nintendo Switch Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville, here is one of the playable characters The first detail that should be noted, regarding the conversion of Plants Vs. Zombies on Nintendo Switch: The Battle of Neighborville, is the presence of the Frostbite Engine: in fact, this is the first EA title to exploit it. This required several months of porting work, with the intention of optimizing as much as possible not only the technical-graphic sector, but also the audio one, to the Nintendo hybrid console. The result is more than satisfactory: despite the general limitations of the hardware and the particular amount of content, The Battle of Neighborville is pleasant to see on Nintendo Switch, and during our hours of play it has not shown any obvious problems. Especially in the most agitated situations, we happened to notice some drops in the frame rate (usually anchored to 30 FPS), but these were sporadic cases. Commendable is the attempt to exploit the potential of the consoles in question that are often overlooked by developers. Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville first of all enables the touch screen for navigating the menus in portable mode (it seems little, in reality we assure you that it is almost always missing even in titles designed specifically to be played on the road). Then there is an entire menu, freely customizable, dedicated to motion control: you can then use the motion sensors of the Joy-Con or the Pro Controller to aim at enemies, modifying various parameters dedicated to sensitivity. Online or offline  the choice is yours Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville allows you to play with your friends, even locally It is plausible that the style of Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville immediately convinces parents: if the little ones necessarily want to fight, why not do it at least in the role of harmless seedlings and funny undead? For the latter, who perhaps do not pay for the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but also for all the others, the possibility of enjoying the entire offline experience will be particularly useful. From the very first moments of the game, the title will ask if you prefer to access the online features or go local. In this second case, every single aspect of the game - including multiplayer modes - will see the arrival of bots, i.e. characters controlled by artificial intelligence. The owner of Plants Vs. Zombies: The Battle of Neighborville will thus be the only true human being among all; you can then invite other friends locally, using other controllers. Alternatively, it will require very minimal steps to go from offline to online, and vice versa, at any time. This addition is not meaningless, given that it is almost always missing in titles designed exclusively (or mainly) to play against other opponents on the network.", "date": "2021-03-19", "grade": "8.0"}
