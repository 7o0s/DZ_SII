Among the latter rightfully falls Star Fox 64, questionably renamed in Europe Lylat Wars; sequel to that Star Fox released on Super Nintendo, it was basically a three-dimensional space shooter on rails. With a strategy similar to the one that reported the aforementioned Ocarina of Time on 3DS, Nintendo has chosen Star Fox 64 as the second game fished from the Nintendo 64 and destined to enjoy a remake thus landing on the new portable. Good Luck! It is quite clear that remakes are strategically used when there are not enough original and new titles to support a console, especially in its first months of life which correspond to a sort of running-in; going to recover products released on the market in the first instance in another geological era, videogame speaking, can also represent a risk when you find yourself comparing past gameplay within modern standards. It is not uncommon to realize that memories are better than reality, and the pace of progress in the sector is so pressing as to transform expected re-encounters into bitter disappointments. That didn't happen with Ocarina of Time, evidently good enough to stand the test of time, but it's more of an exception than the norm. In fact, Star Fox 64 3DS is certainly not today what it represented 14 years ago, and this is a rather evident fact; both those who have had the opportunity to play the original or the most recent release on the Wii Virtual Console, and those who are facing the adventures of Fox McCloud for the first time, will find in the Nintendo title a series of limitations related to the age of the project. The very trivial plot sees the evil scientist Andross launch an invasion on the peaceful planet Corneria from the planet Venom where he has been forced into exile; the Star Fox team, a mercenary group of fighter spacecraft pilots, is thus called to help the army now on the verge of strength, and at the same time to rescue Fox McCloud's father who was lost in a previous similar operation. As we said at the beginning, Star Fox 64 3DS is a 3D shooter on rails in most of the situations it offers; the development takes place through a series of planets with different settings, even if the juice is always to shoot all the enemies on the screen. The control system, simple and effective, allows you to have a good command of the shuttle already after a few minutes of play; the analog is delegated to the movement, while the front keys allow you to perform short accelerations or braking as well as obviously shooting with the primary weapon or throwing a bomb. The backbones instead allow you to perform turns and rotations so as to avoid enemy projectiles. There is also an alternative that rests on the gyroscope, so as to manage the movements of the spacecraft by tilting the console; a less precise and practical solution, and above all destined to negatively affect the maintenance of the three-dimensional effect. The 3D effect Pleasant but never surprising or essential, the 3D effect in Star Fox 64 3DS limits itself to increasing the depth of the settings without adding anything particular. Being a remake it is absolutely understandable, the fact is that lowering the delegate lever will be an action that many will probably perform rather quickly. It goes without saying that the coupling with the control via gyroscope becomes decidedly complicated to manage. Peppi, Slippy, Falco and Fox The key component of the Star Fox 64 3DS structure lies in the organization of the levels, which are always identical and unchanged every time they are faced. The carefree and superficial approach is certainly possible, but it only allows you to touch the surface of the Nintendo product; on the contrary, memorizing the attack patterns of the enemies and the positioning of the objects and key elements allows you to understand and access the more or less evident crossroads present, which allow both to cross ~secret~ areas and to determine through which planets the adventure. Your performance is also evaluated at the end of each level, in order to obtain medalsand which represent a pleasant stimulus for perfectionists. The brevity of the main mode is therefore mitigated by the high replayability and the desire to access at least all the planets present, even if it must be said that a bit of repetitiveness is perceived quite quickly; above all those who don't intend to commit themselves too much with Star Fox 64 3DS will have to suffer from a certain lack of content, difficult to offer in 2011 with a full-price title. Even the secondary modes help little in this sense; the ~point challenge~ allows you to perfect your performance on the various levels to obtain a score, while the multiplayer allows up to 4 players to face each other in deathmatches within arenas. In reality, the absence of online greatly reduces the appeal of this last part of the offer, and although it is possible to play even with only one cartridge, the gameplay offered is not intended to keep you glued to the screen for a long time. From a technical point of view instead, just like in the case of Ocarina of Time, there has been a substantial and evident modernization work, especially as regards the textures and effects, even if the reduced polygonal complexity of the settings and bosses makes it rather clear the real age of the game. Nonetheless, the Nintendo production remains a pleasant title to look at, able to exploit the three-dimensional element sufficiently.", "date": "2011-09-19", "grade": "7.8"}
