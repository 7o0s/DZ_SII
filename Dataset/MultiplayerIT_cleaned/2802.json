For Honor, in fact, stands as the main inspiration of the game, which incorporates the mechanics of the ~three-way~ combat system developed by Ubisoft. It is a formula capable of supporting the experience of the new freemium title developed by itself from Vivid Games for iOS and Android devices? Let's try to understand it. Gameplay The main screen of Knights Fight 2 allows you to continue within the campaign, simply made up of a series of increasingly difficult duels, but also to manage the character's equipment, check the progress of the castle (a real reward for the efforts made in battle, symbol of our coat of arms), face other users online and access the inevitable in-game shop. Once you take the field, the touch controls refer exclusively to the three-way system: with the analog stick left we can keep the guard up, right or left, while by acting on the appropriate button it is possible to strike with the sword from one of the three sides. If the opponent blocks to the left but we hit him to the right, we'll inflict damage on him; and the same will happen to us. It is not possible to move within the scenario, the movements are automatic and therefore one cannot even escape the clash. A stamina bar also makes it difficult to perform repeated moves: when the resistance ends, the graphics are desaturated to highlight the state of exhaustion of the character and the visual indications disappear, therefore to parry the blows at that point it will be necessary to carefully observe the movements of the enemy and cross your fingers. To this mix of mechanics, which just like in For Honor boast a certain strategic depth, are added some special maneuvers to be unlocked as we grow and which allow us to obtain some small advantage during the duel. There is also no shortage of evasive actions and quick time events, which however represent only one of the facets of the gameplay. Structure The duels of Knights Fight 2 are interesting and engaging, net of a not exactly exciting technical realization. The problem is that they are also too demanding, and one might think that all this is simply due to the freemium setting of the game, therefore an attempt to monetize with the various packages, the Battle Pass and everything inside of the in-game shop. It therefore happens that after the first victorious clashes we are faced with opponents on paper ten times stronger than us, equipped with substantially superior equipment and skills. In that case the only way to move forward, perhaps trying not to run out of action energy that is consumed with each duel, is to access the multiplayer component, it is not clear whether in real time or asynchronous, and obtain in this way the experience points and/or the objects necessary to become competitive. The road, however, will not be short. Technical realization As mentioned, Knights Fight 2 does not excite from a technical point of view, in particular as regards some facets of an interface that often and willingly lets itself go to approximate solutions, with low-resolution assets that certainly do not give the idea of a well finished production. However, the controls are reactive and fast, it must be said. Once in combat, the polygonal models of the knights betray a certain angularity and the animations do not appear particularly realistic, but in any case they represent one of the best aspects of the visual sector, also for their undoubted variety. Little to say instead about the scenarios, often generic.", "date": "2020-11-12", "grade": "6.7"}
