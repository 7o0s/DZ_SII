{"name": "Spy Hunter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spy-hunter-2.html", "text": "Playability Those who played the old Spy Hunter will immediately notice that the game has many aspects in common with the original. However, it should be said that Spy Hunter is basically a racing game with lots of action. Once you insert the dvd into your console you will be immersed in the initial movie showing the classic game scenes that you will soon find yourself facing. At the wheel of the most powerful and technological vehicle, the Interceptor G-1665, capable of transforming itself from car into motorboat, motorcycle and plane according to your needs, you will have to carry out a series of missions, but the particularity of Spy Hunter is that you will not have to chase anyone but instead you have to run away and complete your mission in the shortest time possible. There is no real storyline, each mission will see you engaged in achieving multiple objectives ranging from the destruction of enemy bases or strategic objectives to the activation of the StaComs and so on. The objectives of each mission are divided into primary and secondary, the primary ones must be completed to complete the level, but very often, in order to move on to the next mission, the secondary objectives must also be completed, and this can generate a slight frustration given the difficulty of some goals. In the 14 levels you will have mainly 2 weapons at your disposal: machine guns positioned on the hood of your racing car and a series of powerful missiles. With the L1 key you can switch from one weapon to another very quickly. It should be noted that the fun and useful weapon present in the original version has been maintained, or rather the oil stains that you can spread behind you to sow enemies by pressing the R2 key on the joypad. During the game you will constantly have a series of indicators available that show the quantity of weapons, the time available and the status of the damage reported; once you get to 50% damage the G-1665 Interceptor will automatically transform into a motorcycle to be more agile and difficult to hit, in the same way if you are in the water, your speedboat will become a fast jet ski . The first level of Spy Hunter is basically training to familiarize you with the vehicle, and it is here that you will first see it transform into a speedboat in a fantastic sequence with a rotating camera effect reminiscent of the spectacular slow motion images of matrix. The control of the vehicle is quite intuitive and the handling is all in all simple with a clear arcade setting. Graphics We now come to the aspect that seems to interest the new generation consoles more than any other, namely the graphics. Certainly this is not the best aspect of the game, but in any case the infamous 60 frames per second are guaranteed without any kind of slowdown. Despite this, Spy Hunter will not surprise you with its graphics which, although without particular flaws, are still average. The textures are pleasant and the environments are full of details such as people, buildings and vehicles that help give the game a very varied look and diversify the levels. Unlike the monotony of the original Spy Hunter, now the settings are very exotic and we go from dense swamps to the German highways or from French streets to the beautiful canals of Venice. The reflections of the water are beautiful as well as the effect of the explosions, but a particular note should be made for the really well made computer graphics movies and which between one mission and another will also give you information on the missions keeping you glued to the action of game. Sound The sound aspect of Spy Hunter has not been underestimated by the guys at Midway. The music is very suitable for the type of game, perfectly managing to immerse you in the action, just as the sound of the G-6155 is quite convincing and varied depending on the vehicle you drive; the car has the roar of a real road racing car and the motorboat stands out for the effect of the engine on the water. Even the noise given by explosions, collisions and the use of weapons is all in all pleasant and well done. Conclusions Ultimately Spy Hunter is not one of those hurried remakes of old successful titles, but it is the classic example of how a good game can be created from an old idea, taking inspiration from the original features, obviously adapting them to modern times and technologies. Good gameplay, great soundtrack, avarious settings and a lot of action are essentially the characteristics of Spy Hunter which ultimately I would recommend not only to those who have been a lover of the original, but also to those who love racing / action games. Conclusions Pros: Various environments Excellent soundtrack As fun as the original Cons: Not great graphics Few weapons available A 20 year old game Spy Hunter is a famous coin-op from the 80s that, thanks to Midway, now returns in a big way on PlayStation 2. The developers of Paradigm Entertainment have tried to revive all the fun and gameplay of this classic by combining it with modern 3D graphics , and I must say that the result is really satisfying.", "date": "2001-10-24", "grade": null}
