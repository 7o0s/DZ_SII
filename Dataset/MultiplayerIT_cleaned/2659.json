I find the graphics of the GBC very beautiful: cartoony at the right point, captivating and very ~free~. I apologize if I will always be ~nice~ to talk about this aspect of games, but it's stronger than me! Since I believe in a level playing field, then I begin with a criticism directed at UbiSoft: I believe it is unacceptable in 2001, to see a game like this translated into 3 languages (English, French and German) and not into Italian: the GBC is a product mainly aimed at children who cannot necessarily understand a foreign language; a pity indeed! From a graphic point of view, I can point out the good animations (even if a little repetitive) and the excellent characterization of the characters: there are numerous antagonists, all really beautiful. I also found the interlude scenes that tell the story very beautiful: they are well done and detailed. The weapons and add-ons at our disposal are a bit few: in addition to the punches (but always very powerful), there are the ~magnetic blow~, the ~Batman discs~, a jet, a type of shield and the very powerful ~Batman's stick~. ALWAYS AND ONLY COCKS? Well yes: the mechanics of the game are simple: kill, kill and advance towards the truth. The level of difficulty is not very high, moreover the infinite number of coninue make the game finishable in about twenty hours. The settings are really varied and built with different textures, a sign that the Kemco developers have taken care of the game well. The plot that underlies the video game is quite obvious (after all, Batman has been doing the same things for decades, but he grants a great twist in the end (which I won't reveal...) The saving method is unfortunately the password (which you can find here on Joypad.it) even if I strongly recommend you to play the whole game, to be able to enjoy the plot.What to say: a MUST for bat lovers, an interesting game for an audience that can overcome the language handicap, or for a child who enjoys ~reply punches~ as only Batman can do. HE IS THE HERO Pay me a moment's attention: I don't know how many of you will be over 20 (or close to this threshold), but since I'm right on target, I remember a wonderful TV show that I watched as a child: a 1960s TV show, with a masked hero , his faithful squire, and many, many punches, with some inbetweens that reported the writings of the comics (pum! stomp! etc). In this show, the hero was always him, Batman, the bat man, in the service of good, to protect his city Gotham City, from the evil of the moment (Penguin Joker or others). With him, the faithful Robin, and the old servant, as well as connoisseur of the secrets of the bravest billionaire (born Bruce Wayne). Unfortunately where the villains' criminal attempts had always failed, time was fulfilling its sad destiny: the truth is that now, at the beginning of the 21st century, Batman is just a tired old man. This should also be the case for the Joker, but instead he is (suddenly) back with ever more evil intentions! How come? How did he still be young. And, if the old Bruce is injured by the Joker during a shareholder meeting, who is the new hero behind the Batman mask? Well, I certainly can't tell you everything...", "date": "2001-01-02", "grade": null}
