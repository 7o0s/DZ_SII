{"name": "Rollercoaster Rush: 99 Circuits", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rollercoaster-rush-99-circuits.html", "text": "While on the one hand there are developers who wanted to bring the gaming experience of consoles to mobile phones, facing a series of technical and practical limitations that did not always see them as winners, on the other hand there are those who have thought of dedicating themselves to the creation of products designed specifically for this particular platform. The reference, of course, is to all those action games characterized by a control system that defining ~immediate~ is an understatement, given that they base their gameplay on pressing one or two keys. Digital Chocolate has stood out within this genre, which in addition to the popular Rollercoaster Rush series has simple but fun titles such as Kamikaze Robots and Crazy Penguin Catapult, both enthusiastically received by both critics and the public. The strength of these games lies in mixing immediacy and depth in an intelligent way: the player only has to press one or two keys, while the action is enriched by ~external~ variables that make the experience gradually more complex and demanding. A formula that we also find in Rollercoaster Rush: 99 Circuits, since our task will simply be to increase or decrease the speed of the carriages that travel our roller coaster. But how does it all work? After selecting our carriage among those available (each with different values as regards maximum speed, acceleration and brake power), we will find ourselves facing a sequence of circuits within scenarios that start from China, pass through Europe and finally arrive in the United States. The goal is to complete them all and to be able to score the maximum possible score (five stars) in each one. By acting on the 4 and 6 keys of the numeric keyboard (or by pressing the d-pad left and right), we will be able to control the speed of the carriage while the tracks of the carousel slide underneath it. The faster we go, the more fun our passengers will have, ergo we will get a higher score, with the ~approval~ index being indicated by a series of smileys. The problem is that we won't always be able to proceed at full speed: we will often find ourselves facing dangerous ups and downs, literally taking off if we reach them too quickly. Letting the carriage lift off the rails is sometimes a good idea, as it adds to the fun of the kids we're carrying, but it all depends on how the subsequent landing is accomplished. In the lower part of the screen, a sort of ~road sign~ will appear from time to time to indicate the presence of peaks, loops or jumps. As we complete the stages, not only will we have the possibility to select a different carriage, but we will see additional carriages added to the first unit which will change the balance of the ~vehicle~. The technical realization of the game is very good, functional to the action that is represented on the screen. As usual for Digital Chocolate productions, the bulk of the work is done by the colors, which consistently differentiate one location from another. Together with the design of the characters and structures, the final result shows a really successful and beautiful ~cartoony~ effect, further enhanced by a fluid, fast and uncertain scrolling. Too bad about the sound, made up of rather weak and repetitive MIDI music. PRO Excellent use of colours Simple and immediate gameplay Ninety-nine circuits available AGAINST Sound without bite Sometimes frustrating A bit limited and repetitive", "date": "2009-01-21", "grade": "S.V."}
