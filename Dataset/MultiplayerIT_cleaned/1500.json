{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2004.html", "text": "From GC to GBA For some time now, it has been difficult for a Game Cube title not to make use of the connectivity between GC and GBA in some way. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 follows the tasty trend, offering stats and characters to unlock and import between the two versions of the game (the portable and of course, the older sister). In any case, even if you don't have the Game Boy Advance title cartridge, you just need to connect the two consoles to take advantage of valuable bonuses and items which are then available at the heart of the World Tour, at the Pro Shop. The wind is favourable, the hole is waiting for me... Like any product that lies slyly in the shadow of the powerful Electronic Arts brand, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 also takes full advantage of and shows off its official license, which translates into the obsessive presence of each brand, sponsor, of the real stages of the PGA Tour but above all of the most famous aces of the green (fifteen real plus 12 other ~surreal~ to unlock). Although this title showcases a real plethora of game opportunities, let's start with the one that represents its ~heart~, its potential and immense depth: the World Tour. A mode that closely follows the one made famous by Virtua SEGA Tennis 2. It all starts from the Game Face Mode, or from the moment you give life to your character. Here we are immediately faced with the most devastating editing and customizing system that has ever appeared in a video game in order to build the somatic and physical features of a character. The detail that can be achieved through dozens of different skin types (wrinkles, freckles, different levels of tanning, pimples), hairstyles, eye models, mouths, noses and cheekbones practically infinite considering that each feature can be altered in percentage giving life , really, to thousands of completely different individuals. Recreating your likeness or that of a friend is an exercise that can be achieved with embarrassing ease, realism and speed. You don't simply intervene on the traits but you modulate the bone and muscle structure until you get to modify the teeth, to understand, it looks more like a program used in a maxillofacial department of a large clinic rather than editing in a video game; monstrous. The credibility given to one's character serves to best match the climate one breathes once the World Tour has begun. The mechanism is the simplest and most complete one can ask for: one travels around the planet to challenge every single local champion up to face to face with the legendary Tiger Woods and snatch the title of number one from him. It is what lies in the middle of this path that makes the experience unmissable. The character you give life to is forced to make your way through initials and inevitable fools to then win tournaments, accumulate money, acquire credibility (which translates into copious sponsorship offers that come from the most prestigious brands: adidas, nike... ) and invest your earnings in the Pro Shop, where you will definitely know what a bottomless pit you are in front of with this PGA TOUR 2004. The dollar income can be used to improve and increase your skills (each point, for each item has different costs) or to delve into the folds of the look and image thanks to the largest and most incredible series of accessories and garments ever to appear in titles like this. There are several hundreds of models for each item: from T-Shirts, to sweatshirts, from cardigans to sportswear, from wide-leg washed-out jeans to elegant striped pinstripe trousers and even shoes, all kinds of headgear, earrings, watches , set of bats and eyeglasses and sunglasses. All this frenzy of thousands of different gadgets and garments have absolutely no mere cosmetic function. It is known that sport-business is by now a tangible reality, in Golf it is almost an integral part of the game, this means that, once under contract as a testimonial of a great brand, wearing their products in competition brings further income and decidedly important to grow from the ~sports-athletic~ side. Look me in the eye Tiger... We concluded the previous paragraph by talking about functional cosmetics for playability. Behold, in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004, each component of the game serves another in total harmony. The result of all that ~shopping~ and customization of the protagonists of the Green are enhanced by the technical component, at times truly excellent. The credibility of the contexts in which one is inserted is defiablereally rare to find elsewhere. The scenarios offer absolute cleanliness and the ability to immerse the player through a sound sector of the highest order. Beyond the soundtrack typically full of hits in EA products (which sometimes become too invasive because they are not suitable for the context, but which can be managed by lowering the volume up to putting them on ~mute~ to enjoy the quiet of the Golf Club), it should be noted the mania of the effects; wind in the trees, chirping, the echo of trains and planes passing in the distance, even reaching the sound of waves crashing on the cliffs of the Highlands. As we mentioned, graphically, this TW PGA 2004 flexes its muscles and if the settings enjoy beautiful textures and wonderful weather effects (lead and rainy sky, breathtaking sunsets and even the nebulization of the water that breaks near the cliffs) the care lent to golfers is a standin' ovation. A simply perfect motion capture, an infinite number of engaging animations (there is even the chance to create a ~personality~ by acquiring at least a hundred positive - and otherwise - attitudes and reactions to show off on the green at the shop) and a detail that even shows the ~swoosh~ of the nike on the golf balls and the Adidas lettering and logo clearly visible and legible even from distant shots, a visual triumph. Pass me the 9 iron, or rather...the Joypad of the Cube Apparently, governing a game of golf via joypad doesn't seem easy, but even this rhetorical belief crumbles. The method used for the so-called ~swingin'~ (that is, the airy movement with which the ball is hit and thrown) is wonderfully conveyed through the analogical which pushes the player to find the right harmonic times which are also wisely rewarded. Striking to perfection, opens the door to a real show. In these cases, effects and variants of the famous ~bullet-time~ in pure Matrix style are used to highlight the shot itself, bringing the rate of spectacularity to extreme levels: the camera rotates, zooms are wasted and the ball runs towards the hole, driven by the effect that is impressed on it and by the typical prayers of the genre: ~tipregotipregotiprego~. You slip into TW PGA TOUR 2004 and get entangled, thanks to continuous and intelligent ~hints~ on how to behave in difficult situations and thanks to continuous challenges in the challenge. Within a competition it is possible to come across extra prizes and awards (always in cash) for special shots or records to break down and as a demonstration of maniacal care in an attempt to involve the player, there are founds such as the heartbeat; in front of the shot that is worth a championship or that could straighten the fate of a defeat, the rhythm of the heart will come out of the speakers and dance in time with the vibrations of your pad, simply priceless. The fact that each element is functional to another is also taken up by the same game modes. Playing a versus with friends or a simple track for training, if tackled with your own character, allows you to set aside money to be used later in the World Tour shop. The EA title also offers the chance to try your hand at a simulated ten-year career in the PGA Season which differs from the World Tour for a more iron structure which above all limits the enjoyment, showing only one's own golfer in action while in the World Tour it is possible to follow the performances of the opponents, having fun cheering sensationally ~against~. In addition to multiplayer for up to four players (non plus ultra of competitiveness, you end up insulting each other in the most creative ways in less than fifteen minutes) and the usual and inevitable variants related to subgames such as the longest shot or target shooting , a notable gem embodies the Real Time Events. Based on the Game Cube's internal clock and calendar, the game signals special events related to holidays and anniversaries spread throughout the year that allow you to unlock items, paths and characters. Very original and numerous, it is sufficient to change the time and date before launching the game to discover and appreciate them in the shortest possible time. Commentary Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is a game that borders on perfection in its field. An extreme playability, a mammoth depth to say the least that extremely ennobles the single player, experienced in multi proves devastating and becomes a great alternative to the classic sports to play in company. An ingeniously simple control system with a steep learning curvelight and constant. Technically impeccable, it provides an electronic version of the same emotions that are sought in its real counterpart: it offers a sort of healthy relaxation combined with that competitiveness that makes you pleasantly aggressive and hungry for victory. By adding the World Tour and a practically infinite personalization of the characters, the jewel fits perfectly into our GC. Intended for those who already appreciate something about golf to enjoy it, it could bring even the most laymen closer to this sport. Pros: Depth and playability on exceptional levels Technically almost perfect Invaluable in multiplayer, very rich in singles Sound effects of the highest order Cons: Its own wealth of options and modes in which you can get lost Music not always suitable but customizable, including mutes .. Obviously more difficult for those who know only the reputation of golf The greatest rapper on the planet is a white man. The best golf player on the same globe is, today, a black. This was the overture to a recent idea by Diego Abatantuono which signaled the crumbling of some certainties taken for granted only to find healthy and ironic confirmations in an Inter that was true to itself, always looking for successes that are slow in coming. Without slipping for another two lines into the delirium of a football tease, the incipit that I have quoted comes in handy on two fronts. The first is because we are just about to talk about that black boy who became number one on the ~green~ and then because you too will be destined to see various certainties vanish and revisit various mental clichs. It is possible to imagine that a golf-inspired video game could become as satisfying, spectacular and full of playability as that sort of pagan deity who responds today, to the name of Winning Eleven?, it may seem like a heresy but by deciding to read this review you have already done a few steps to get into the right ~mood~, it means that Golf intrigues you (or that you clicked wrong but in this case, you will already be arguing elsewhere about Console War) and I assure you that our Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has a lot to offer, far beyond a simple infatuation. So, drawing Manzoni's ~Dear my 25 readers~, let's discover the announced wonders of a title that has class to spare.", "date": "2003-11-06", "grade": null}
