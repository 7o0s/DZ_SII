It's not confirmed yet, but the film will probably be a very long chase of almost two hours, a bold and interesting idea that we can't wait to see on the big screen. While awaiting its visual magnificence, but also the game dedicated to Max Rockatansky, there is another title, with decidedly lesser pretensions, which promises to give you a few hours in the company of marauders, street fights and the fight for survival: Convoy. An indie with pixel-art graphics and a top view that we could trivially define as a FTL on wheels with procedurally generated adventures and obstacles. While waiting to enjoy Mad Max: Fury Road, try to survive in the world of Convoy! A ruthless world The plot is very simple: we are part of the crew of a huge spaceship forced to land on a planet due to some technical problems, to restart we will have to look for some components making our way through marauders, checkpoints, local tribes and the thousand unexpected events that can arise in such situations. To do this, we will be able to count on a small convoy based on a main vehicle and a retinue of four (or less) escort cars that will have to defend it to avoid game over. A very difficult mission because, as you can well imagine, Convoy is a hard and bad game, which will punish any uncalculated risk with destruction and death, this without counting the times in which chance, a sandstorm or a wrong answer will put us in trouble. The game is divided into three sections, one where you move around the map, one where you upgrade and one, the very heart of the Convoy, where you fight. In this section we will have to command the escort cars in real time, telling them where to position themselves and who to attack, they'll take care of the rest. As for the main vehicle, however, we will only have to remember every now and then to launch its special attack, which can be a rocket, an electromagnetic pulse and other amenities. If desired, it will also be possible to ram enemy vehicles, an extreme move that allows you to inflict a lot of damage but which will also damage the car that performs it. As if that weren't enough, every now and then we will also need to remind ourselves to dodge any obstacles, perhaps trying to push the marauders' buggies against them. The fine line between challenge and frustration Very often we will go into these fights in vast numbers, so managing the health, supply and shields of our vehicles is a crucial element to last more than five minutes. The result is a chaotic and entertaining test of micro-management that will strain our nerves. Cut that enemy's way, push the other one against a rock, avoid the mine, fire the EMP pulse, control the energy of the vehicles and try not to go crazy in the meantime. The feeling is very similar to having to manage your FTL crew while the ship is falling apart, with the difference that instead of checking the health of each section of the ship we have to manage the combat and the position of the vehicles, trying to bring everyone home. Fun? The first few times enough, if only for the novelty effect, but it doesn't take long to turn it into a frustrating experience. In fact, it may happen that, while we are totally absorbed in the fight, some red skulls start flashing on the right side of the screen. This is the signal that obstacles are approaching that our means will have to avoid at all costs. If they don't, death is instantaneous and particularly harmful, given that in the explosion all the upgrades you have chosen with such care will also go away. A moment of distraction is therefore enough to transform a tense fight into a total rout, perhaps only because you gave the command a second too late. Being defeated by a superior enemy for a wrong choice is painful but sensible, dying because a buggy responded too slowly to the command is instead the main ingredient of a ~ragequit~. To tell the truth, it must be said that, if desired, there is the possibility of pausing the game by pressing the space bar, and then taking all the time to give orders. However the craft are so slow in reacting to our commands that you either give the order as soon as the red skulls appear on screen or death is almost certain. Believe me when I tell you that when things get serious and the enemies are tougher than the standard ones you will be so focused on saving your skin that if there was a naked woman next to you you would not see her, let alone dand the red skulls. The underlying philosophy of these obstacles is not wrong, it serves to give us the idea of a desperate race in a hostile environment full of pitfalls, but transforms what should be a strategy game into a mere matter of reflexes. If we then add it to the fact that Convoy doesn't even leave the player time to breathe, besieging him insistently with random events (which often turn into catastrophes) and sudden attacks, a tough Mad Max-style simulation turns into a deliberate act of cruelty that can also be boring. There are a lot of interesting secrets in the desert of Convoy, but they are often hidden behind a storm of dull grind and fights that don't even give you time to repair the vehicles. Random, but not too much What in theory shouldn't bore us in this type of game is the random factor. During the phases of simple movement, one can always come across positive (few) and negative (many) events that have the purpose of moving the situation, but unfortunately this is not the case. What initially seem totally fortuitous exciting situations become repetitive after a very short time and goodbye to the surprise effect. If you have played Red Dead Redemption you will remember the amazement of the first time you fell victim to the ambush with the fake girl in danger, but you will also remember that from then on you figured out the trick and immediately shot the lonely women in the middle to the desert. Here with Convoy it works in more or less the same way, only that afterwards you are still forced into a fight that threatens to screw up your plans. The situation is the same also with regard to the dialogues: initially we laugh thanks to the dozens of references and quotes to films that we know well such as Back to the Future, A Clockwork Orange and, of course, Mad Max, but there is a limit to the number of winks 'eye a man can stand before he gets bored. It would be enough... Despite these repetitions, Convoy reserves its best for those who are able to overcome the initial difficulty and accumulate enough resources to properly upgrade and equip their ramshackle group. When simple machine guns are replaced with rocket launchers, when the ramming factor of a vehicle is enhanced by mounting chainsaws, when the shields are able to withstand a fair amount of damage then things start to get more interesting and fun. It's at that point that we begin to see a glimmer of hope, maybe we could make it, maybe we'll see the universe again with our spaceship... until a damned rock shatters our best vehicle. Despite being a complete game in all respects, Convoy is a title that could improve a lot with a few patches. Already in the past few weeks there have been updates that have lowered the frequency of random encounters (before the game's wasteland was populated like a shopping mall on weekends) and improving and enriching some dialogues at the same time. It remains to be seen if there is the desire and the resources to continue working on the game in the coming months as well. However, it would be a real shame if what is good in Convoy were thrown away by the lack of desire to improve it.", "date": "2015-05-14", "grade": "7.0"}
