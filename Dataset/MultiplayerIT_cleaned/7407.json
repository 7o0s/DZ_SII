Through a space-time portal, the eleventh and final expansion developed by Maxis and Electronic Arts will allow you to travel through time and discover what the future has to offer. A new world of futuristic buildings and flying machines, robots with human intelligence and emotions, and much more will open before your eyes. You will have the opportunity to meet your descendants, to talk to them and to make important decisions in the past that will heavily influence their future. Does The Sims 3's latest expansion, Into the Future, live up to expectations? So and so! Enjoy your future! The main feature that gives this expansion its name is the ability to travel to the future. It all begins with a strange portal that suddenly appears at the back of the house and from which the eccentric Mr. Emmet emerges, a time traveler who, in exchange for a small mission, will agree to take you with him into the new era. Jumping forward a few hundred years in time you will find yourself in Oasis Landing, a profoundly different world, technologically advanced and populated by many robots: you will be able to interact with the natives of the future and create emotional bonds with them. Even the objects have been revisited in a hi-tech key both in terms of design and functionality: the refrigerator, for example, will synthesize nutritious food that will satiate the sim for longer while the wave technology shower will keep it clean for longer. You can travel around the country by jetpack, airplane or taxi, while if you prefer public transport, you can use the monorail, operated by the Zephiro public transport service, which crisscrosses the length and breadth of the country. When you are at Oasis Landing, time is paused: you won't have to worry about your past life, you will be able to buy a house and live there permanently and create new relationships; should you feel nostalgia for the past, just use the portal to go back in time. Utopian or dystopian? Another novelty is represented by the Almanac of Time, a precious book that you will find in the inventory, through which it will be possible to explore the alternative futures of Oasis Landing, identify any descendants and find useful information on how to obtain the ~statues of remembrance~ . From the ~Events~ tab of the Almanacco del Tempo you can decide to discover scenarios with a different future, alternative to the normal one: the utopian and the dystopian future. If you opt for the former, Oasis Landing will appear as an earthly paradise made of sparkling colors and giant flowers, where everyone lives happily and in harmony with each other; if you are more intrigued by the dystopian future, the futuristic town will appear as a desolate land, where heaps of garbage occupy the sidewalks of the streets, while the sims will have to take shelter from meteorites that risk pulverizing the surrounding landscape. The choice of one or another futuristic dimension will depend exclusively on the actions and choices made in the past. So everything is in your hands: in the life of the sim you will finally have an important role, giving up that of passive spectator. And it is, perhaps, one of the most interesting aspects of the expansion. The Plumbots and the Statues of Remembrance The most striking novelty of this expansion is represented by the Plumbots, robotic creatures endowed with emotions similar to the sims and who are at the service of the latter. Thanks to some skills, such as the Bot Building, you can build one of these robots customizing it in shape, colors and character traits: you can use them, for example, as a maid to keep the house always clean, even while you're at work, as gardeners to take care of the plants in the garden or as a babysitter to look after the children. You will be able to establish important relationships with them, even sentimental ones: everything is allowed, except having children! Finally, if your Sim's dream is to become famous, there's no better way than to be immortalized in a Statue of Remembrance that pays tribute to their exploits. There are five different statues for Sims to aspire to, each requiring different actions to perform and certain achievements to achieve. Once the requests have been met, the final prize will include the placement of a statue in the image and likeness of the sim inside the Oasis Landing Remembrance Park.", "date": "2013-12-12", "grade": "6.5"}
