Koei Tecmo in fact intended to introduce an unprecedented open world structure with this episode, revolutionizing some aspects of the experience. A necessary and dutiful change, if we consider that the series was heading towards its twenty-first birthday without ever having put into practice a real renewal, indeed giving life to numerous spin-offs (some of which were rather successful, however) which kept intact the usual formula: given a certain map, it was necessary to clean up the areas from enemies by moving where indicated from time to time. The formidable ability of the leaders of imperial China, protagonists of the ~Romance of the Three Kingdoms~, translates on the screen into the ability to face hundreds, if not thousands of opponents simultaneously, however with a view to a combat system that has never managed to get out of certain schemes of strong repetitiveness and relative inconsistency. After a few days in the company of Dynasty Warriors 9, tested both on PlayStation 4 Pro and on PC, we can finally reveal what has changed and if this chapter can really be considered the rebirth for the franchise developed by Omega Force. Spoilers: nope. All my China The Dynasty Warriors 9 campaign is divided into thirteen chapters and mainly puts us in the shoes of Cao Cao, with the possibility of unlocking numerous other warriors throughout history and controlling them within the related storylines, but without upheavals. We appreciated the presence of screen texts in Italian, which allows you to follow the intricate (and not particularly engaging) plot of the game between sieges, alliances, betrayals and heroic deaths. From the point of view of variety, however, not much has changed: completing the quests is often a matter of moving from point A to point B, possibly exploiting the rapid travel if it is available, defeating an enemy and perhaps coming back to report it . What appears decidedly different is the game map, particularly large, which remains unchanged regardless of the progression in the story, maintaining its own secondary quests and allowing us to freely explore the scenarios, perhaps discovering new places or coming across groups of enemies to be defeated in order to be able to free up a new workstation. There are aspects of the experience that suggest a clear influence from Assassin's Creed Origins, although the Omega Force production does not in any way boast the visual quality, detail and care of the Ubisoft title. In fact, during the first stages it will happen to climb a tower to ~synchronise~ with the surroundings, identifying new points of interest, or to pursue a specific mission that will lead us to climb a peak using the grappling hook supplied, to then carry out an awkward ~leap of faith~, gliding towards the ground without taking any damage and unlocking the related achievement. Cross and delight... no, just cross The implementation of an open world structure was a potential advantage for Dynasty Warriors 9, but of course one had to see what this open world was full of; and it is precisely here that the proverbial donkey falls: one moves within expanses as wide as they are empty, the villages are all the same as well as the castles, and this only makes the exploratory phase cloying and insipid; so much so that on longer journeys on horseback, following a direction indicator that often throws a tantrum, we get quite bored and we would like our four-legged friend's stamina to never run out, so as to make at least the journey to the destination of the moment is faster. For a series like this, which has always made repetitiveness a distinctive trait, almost a boast, creating a niche of people who appreciate this aspect of the experience, it goes without saying that being faced with such a context could be very risky . In fact, punctually, the clashes with the patrols that inhabit the open world of the game are all strictly identical, with the same commanders and the same formations: eliminating them becomes a monotonous exercise, and some precautions introduced regarding the combat system are not enough to make battles more engaging. In fact, the possibility of making variations by holding down the right back button has been added to the traditional fast and slow attacks, so as to open the guard of the toughest enemies, throw them in the air and then hit them with a combo on the fly, inflicting damage while they are still on the ground or exploiting an ~ice rain~ which falls within Cao Cao's repertoire. The rest dn the maneuvers it is entrusted to the weapon that we will decide to equip, more or less powerful and more or less rapid, but beyond these aspects the philosophy that governs the fights of Dynasty Warriors 9 is always the same and not enough has been done to value it; indeed, the combination with the open world has made certain mechanisms even more repetitive. Playstation 4 trophies There are forty-four Trophies in Dynasty Warriors 9, and many of them can be obtained simply by completing the campaign, thanks to the unlocking of the various characters. Also completing their stories will allow you to obtain further Trophies, as well as dedicate yourself to exploring the open world, discovering new places. The technical question In short, the open world does not solve the historical problems of Dynasty Warriors, on the contrary, in many ways it emphasizes them. Furthermore, elements such as the possibility of carrying out stealth attacks during the night have been implemented very poorly and are an option that you are unlikely to be willing to consider. After all, the spaces always remain very large, there is no real perception of presences and therefore everything is reduced to pressing a button for the surprise hit when we are identified by a guard. Added to these critical points is the technical question, which in the case of this chapter is surprisingly incisive, but negative. On PlayStation 4 Pro the game offers two different display modes: the first should emphasize the resolution and limit itself to thirty frames per second, but in reality it is very jerky and probably does not go beyond 15-20 frames; the second, focused on performance, should in theory run at sixty frames per second, but barely reaches thirty. This second option allows you to play without major problems, but there is no shortage of drops when there are many enemies and, above all, the pop-up effect returns in an overbearing way, never so evident: entire blocks of opponents appearing a few meters away or even they move mysteriously, the horse itself is sometimes invisible, but the difficulty in streaming content is also noticeable by the slowness with which the textures of the settings are rendered. This is a substantial step backwards compared to what Omega Force had managed to do with the various editions of Dynasty Warriors 8, and it is inexplicable how such a situation was taken lightly until launch. On PC obviously the question is different, the streaming of the contents works, the adjustments are numerous and it is therefore possible to obtain even the sixty frames per second (although keeping them stable is another matter), but there are many other aspects that would need a fixed and which show a not particularly brilliant conversion work.", "date": "2018-02-13", "grade": "6.5"}
