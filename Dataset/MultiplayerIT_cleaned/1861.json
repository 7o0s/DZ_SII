{"name": "Tiger Woods Pga Tour Golf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-golf.html", "text": "Birdies Tiger Woods for GBA follows the versions for compatible and consoles quite faithfully, and it is an excellently packaged product with a pleasant realization. I'll get straight to the point on the big flaw of this product, which precludes an otherwise totally positive evaluation: EA thought well of not ~exaggerating~, inserting only one 18-hole course. Today's standards, both for golf games and for portable games in general, require a much more substantial amount of meat in the fire. There are two main modes, one with specific objectives divided into 12 missions, and one with the possibility of head-to-head and possibly championships (always on the only path present). The mission mode offers a well-focused, fun and challenging enough challenge, but alas not too long-lived. A couple of hours of intense play should be enough for you to get the better of all the missions present. The championship mode is more demanding, but after passing the 12 missions you will have experienced more than enough all the available holes, and you will hardly have much incentive to play it for a long time. Realization Technically Tiger Woods does not surprise, but it is appreciated for its cleanliness and functionality. The menus are excellent and easy to read, the rear views of your character choreographed enough if rather useless. Aiming from the first-person point of view is almost impossible if you are not close to par, given that the visual depth is very low and that the view does not always follow the real position of the ball to the millimeter. However, the game is designed to be used with the overhead view, which does its job perfectly, leaving the rear a purely graphical role. The player animation is excellent, the music and effects sparse but adequate. The control is typical of Tiger Woods, and is quite immediate but not without depth. The cartridge has a backup battery that will save the tournaments in any hole and any game progress. Supported multiplayer not only with an unpleasant link game (unfortunately multicartidge), but with a highly enjoyable turn-based tournament for up to 4 players with a single GBA. Conclusions The GBA's versatility proves to be excellent once again, and it's nice to see a worthy golf representative at the bedside of the Nintendo laptop. Unfortunately, EA cut the legs off an otherwise very good game, putting only one path and no secrets (when I finished the missions, I was very sad to see that I had won absolutely nothing). And if the game can be played and finished willingly, the handful of hours it offers are too few for a product that costs more or less as much as the versions for tabletop machines, but which is much less long-lived. A real pity, let's hope for a more full-bodied and enjoyable 2003 version. Pros: Discreet physics of the ball Good depth Technically valid Cons: Very limited longevity Sound just discrete Only fans will like it Miniature golf Golf is one of the sports that has been simulated for the longest time, and certainly the one that has undergone the least number of changes over the years. It is surprising for less elderly players to play a game of Leaderboard on C64 (perhaps under emulation), and realize that the 3-click system, pointing and even visuals are the same as in games made today. However charm, tranquility, precision and strategy manage to coexist happily in golf games. A discreet charm that keeps them away from the top positions of the rankings, but which guarantees a silent but omnipresent basin that keeps different productions ~at stake~ every year. And when we talk about houses that make seasonal sports games, we are essentially talking about Electronic Arts. Therefore, the presence of a Tiger Woods also on the handsome Gameboy Advance is not surprising, with the clear impression that this is only the first of a long series also on the Nintendo portable. 1", "date": "2002-12-23", "grade": null}
