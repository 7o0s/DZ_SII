Art, satire, spectacularization on and off the screen, mass and customary phenomenon. And much more, of course, all expertly contained within the work of this pair of artists. In fact, there are many who love the comic strips of Holkins and Krahulik, so many that from simple digital strips Penny Arcade has become a real institution. Charity, fair, even a trilogy of video games. A constant evolution, at least at first glance, but apparently put on hold by this new chapter in the saga. For anyone who has already touched the previous two episodes, it is in fact necessary to immediately show the cards on the table: Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode Three is structurally very far from the titles that preceded it. A return to the origins, as if the two artists, this time in collaboration with Zeboyd Games (the developers of Cthulhu Saves the World), had voluntarily wanted to go back to being children, taking a step back to the times when 16 Bit graphics reigned, with the same, however smoothed and updated, identical limits of once upon a time. But how much of this is really a problem? Humor in power Gabe and Tycho are back, ready to immerse themselves in an adventure with goliardic horror hues, a mix in which irony and grotesque merge to color a RPG with clear references to Japanese role-playing games of the 90s. The first novelties that will be evident to an expert of the franchise are undoubtedly the lack of dubbing and the absence of the phase of creating one's own character, which just like the old JRPGs of the past left the player with the possibility of impersonating the protagonist on duty and use it to advance in the quest. A return to the origins, as already specified, which will be explored properly only after having suggested the story that will lead the protagonists to explore New Arcadia, the city where the game is set. Episode 3 picks up where Episode 2 ended, however leaving the door open to the novice on duty who decides to buy this third chapter without ever having even heard of the previous ones. An almost obligatory choice because, despite the various references to scenes and gags of its predecessors, Episode 3 is an adventure that stands on its own legs and for which knowledge of the universe in which it is set only serves to make it more enjoyable an enjoyable story nonetheless. This is made possible thanks to the inclusion of many lines with a comic background that alternate between ironic mockery of the most famous role-playing games and demented dialogues of the protagonists, some totally disconnected and devoid of real meaning, put in the pile only to snatch without hard to laugh. After having the Necrowombicon stolen by Dr Raven Darktalon Blood, the two protagonists set off to save the world in the most obvious of quests, aided by wacky characters they will meet in the course of events. A journey through occult gods, mysterious findings, clues of the most varied and epics in other dimensions, all seasoned with the usual humor that made Penny Arcade famous in the first place and Zeboyd Games to follow and which, thanks to sometimes crazy stylistic ideas , balance upwards a certainly not entrancing plot. Almost paying tribute to the game map to the Super Mario of the dawn, Episode 3 allows you to scroll through the various sections from above through outlined paths, focusing on a trivial, and in the long run very repetitive, exploration of the dungeons its playful structure and leaving it to a few cutscenes the honor of developing the narrative. A game conformation with nothing new that certainly does not wink at the purest fun and that with its retrogame references is clearly aimed at a niche audience. Concept that reaches its peak of expression in combat. 16-bit combat A game view in which the characters occupy the right of the screen and the enemies the rest in a static turn-based battle was really a long time not seen. And indeed the adopted gameplay solution makes you smile, where the sure joy of the fans of the genre in picking up an interface known as that of the old JRPGs, is the demonstration of how a combat system based on the alternation of turns still has today a sweet nostalgic taste that never tires. To enrich the backbone, a bar intervenes (in perfect Grandia or Final Fantasy X style) which clarifies the order of action of characters.already and enemies, based on the speed of the individual and dividing the timeline between Waiting and Action phases, so as to provide thanks to certain skills a sufficient strategy to make each clash slightly different. The progression system of the protagonists is based on classes, grotesque and clearly full of irony, which can be assigned up to a maximum of 3 for each character together with the usual equipment of a weapon and an accessory for each one. The union of all these elements creates a pleasantly archaic system without any depth, unfortunately characterized only by the illusion of having some depth, as each element stops at the bare minimum to ensure progress and justify one's sense of existence. The tactical depth is reduced to the bone and everything will be summed up, willy-nilly, in performing the same usual points accumulation actions to use the skills, hoping in the meantime not to be badly beaten in every fight. Why yes, Episode 3 is a difficult game. If not taken with due precautions, it will not be unusual to find yourself embroiled in battles bordering on frustration, where despite doing everything possible you will find yourself hopelessly defeated. Undoubtedly a source of satisfaction if overcome, but it is legitimate to ask why, given the structural simplicity of a game without sub-quests and interesting objects to recover, we have chosen to set a level of difficulty so high that, although it can be adjusted at any time, it makes the Normale experience already very demanding in itself. The well-finished sound helps to forget a few fights too many, with well-chosen melodies that do not tire along the approximately 8 hours of play that are needed to complete the adventure and which, given the negligible amount at which it is proposed ( 3.99), provides one more good reason to undertake it.", "date": "2012-07-18", "grade": "7.0"}
