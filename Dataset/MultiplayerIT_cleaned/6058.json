Driven by nostalgia for ~classic recipes~ and by community pressure, the expert French software house Eugene Systems, author of the good Act of War, R.U.S.E. and Wargame, has decided to take a step back and propose a product strongly inspired by one of the best chapters of the EA saga, that Generals (2003) set in the decade 2020-2030 and built around political fiction themes based on the fight against terrorism. In Act of Aggression we find all the ingredients necessary to bring the genre back to its former glory, and after having already appreciated the beta, of which you can read our in-depth analysis by clicking on the following link, we can only confirm the goodness of the work. In Act of Aggression Eugen Systems brings the essence of old school RTS financial bubble In the code we previously tested, the single player campaign and the tutorial were completely missing, fundamental elements for evaluating the overall performance of a good RTS and above all understanding its dynamics in depth. Before launching into the intimate analysis of the aforementioned characteristics, which among other things come together in a single ~package~, we provide some additional details on the plot, which we had already partially explored in our previous article. Among the current issues that arouse the greatest concern, with potential catastrophic effects on a global scale, is the resilience of the Chinese economy, which has come under the spotlight in recent days due to the bursting of the stock market bubble with the related dangerous fluctuations . Starting from these assumptions and adding a classic fictional political thriller script, the screenwriters of Eugene Systems have imagined a new, terrible global recession triggered by an elusive ~Shanghai Crash~ (the crash of the Chinese stock market) in 2019, which however would be orchestrated by the outside - a real terrorist act - by a secret organization (The Cartel) with the clear purpose of bringing down the United States and rising to the new world superpower. In opposition to the mysterious Cartel, made up of industry and information tycoons, corrupt politicians and military, in addition to the stars and stripes army we find the highly advanced Chimera faction, the undisputed protagonist of the single player campaign and the result of cooperation between the various member states of the United Nations. Private military corporations such as the Weyland Defense Corporation (WDC) and the Yueng Corporation also converge in the political fictional cauldron of Act of Aggression, declarations of independence by improbable Mexican separatists led by the insurgent of the moment (Raul Escobedo) and the inevitable machinations of government agencies in pure Tom Clancy style. All this, to accentuate the Hollywood blockbuster flavor, is accompanied by (simple) cutscenes shaped on the clich of the international news with dramatic tones, with the classic zoomed-in geographical maps, ~breaking news~ music and top secret briefings with the headquarters and the conspirators. In short, from the point of view of the presentation you know exactly what to expect, but even if it sins a little in terms of originality, the story of Act of Aggression performs its task with dignity. The best of itself, however, the work of Eugen Systems expresses it once you get on the battlefield. Good and bad Although the campaign actually represents an introductory parenthesis to the factions and the abilities of the individual units to be deployed in the skirmish mode, the real heart of the game, it is still sufficiently engaging, putting an effective learning curve on the plate, despite some unexpected and premature difficulty peaks. The countryside is divided into two parallel sections; on the one hand we have the ten missions dedicated to the Chimera faction and the United States (which come into play at a later time), on the other the point of view of the villains in five scenarios, which are unlocked by progressing in the first narrative strand. As already mentioned, the tutorial flows directly into the main mode, introducing new units, weapons and structures to be built step by step, up to unlocking the most powerful and devastating arsenal in the last stages. All missions offer both objectsprimary and secondary tives, the completion of which is visible in the selection menu. The main targets generally range from escorting to killing (or capturing) the classic VIP on duty, passing through the conquest of enemy structures and bases, retrieving information from databases and building new outposts with the development of related technologies. The secondary objectives, indicated in orange, can instead be linked to the survival of specific units or to the completion of the level in a pre-established time. Some of them are quite complex to reach, and conquering 100% in each mission is anything but a walk, also because the artificial intelligence can be very aggressive and sometimes puts the player on the ropes, as in the last phase of the third mission which forced us to reload the save numerous times. As far as the three playable factions are concerned, they naturally have rather different characteristics both in terms of units and technological trees. The Cartel is undoubtedly the most complex faction to govern, since its means, although very powerful and often supported by stealth and evasive technologies (Scorpio tanks can, for example, create smoke screens), are particularly delicate under enemy fire. The United States of America offers a more traditional and robust approach, thanks to tanks (such as the Abrams), armored vehicles of various types, heterogeneous infantry and aircraft well framed in the collective imagination, while Chimera represents the most versatile and fascinating faction of the lot thanks to the use of advanced prototypes. Just think of his devastating unit of ~Exosoldiers~, which in addition to equipping a rifle effective against men and vehicles, carries an armored ~nanosuit~ capable of regenerating health. Although infantry in RTSs almost always serve as cannon fodder, in Act of Aggression they play a particularly important role, given that in addition to being able to imprison enemy soldiers, with a direct impact on the player's finances, they can also conquer occupied buildings, paving the way for vehicles blocked by possible heavy fire. The soldiers are also divided into multiple units ranging from simple marines up to specialists equipped with sniper, mortar, gatling gun and weapons effective against various means. At the Bersagliere As in any self-respecting old-school RTS, the aim of the game is to recover the resources present on the field, in this specific case oil (the main currency), aluminum and the so-called Rare Earths, in order to expand one's headquarters and consequently the war potential, to be unleashed against one or more opponents (online skirmishes reach up to very tight 4vs4). Another factor included in the Act of Aggression micromanagement system is represented by electricity, which must always be kept under control in order not to run into catastrophic blackouts in the production line. The United States, for example, can maintain the energy balance by building small photovoltaic plants, which however turn into one of the enemy's favorite targets. With the exception of some specific infrastructure, new buildings can be developed around the headquarters and within a guiding grid, which in turn can be expanded through special constructions, such as the precious resource depots. The deposits of rare earths, as the name itself suggests, are the rarest and most precious elements to be identified through scouting (each faction has its own means of research), and represent the key to making the most devastating weapons in the game, such as example the B2 bombers. Obviously there are also the so-called ~Super Weapons~ such as nuclear missiles, however in Act of Aggression it is possible to defend oneself from any threat by developing the appropriate countermeasures. The advancement within a map must be prepared maintaining the usual balance between speed of execution/construction and military strategy, organizing the various units according to a precise logic that balances offense and defense. For example, with the Chimera it is possible to send the delicate but powerful Comanche helicopters in advance, particularly effective against the dangerous turrets of the Cartel, and then follow up the ground attack with infantry, tanks and armored support equipped with anti-aircraft. There are many units as well as the different skills of the technological tree, the management of which is unfortunately undermined by a very little usable and intuitive graphical interface, as we had already pointed out in our previous test. With practice and experience the situation certainly improves, but a reorganization pMore effective than this fundamental tool would be desirable, given that navigating between upgrades and the various ~Defcon~ protocols, which unlock increasingly powerful buildings and units, is unnecessarily cumbersome and represents a sort of brake on the flow of operations. At the time of writing, the developers are still working to balance the balance of some units, paying particular attention to community requests and feedback; for example, certain stealth and regenerative abilities have just been recalibrated, while many players engaged in the beta are clamoring for the cost of the mighty American Abrams tanks to be lowered. It is very likely that this refinement process will continue after launch. The maps dedicated to the Skirmish mode, for which both the duration of the game and the intervention of the Super Weapons can be set, are around twenty in all and are divided by the maximum number of players hosted. Set in various parts of the globe such as Mexico, China, Russia, Holland and the United States, they offer various types of terrains and topographies capable of fully satisfying the needs of the RTS enthusiast. From a purely technical point of view, Act of Aggression is a feast for the eyes thanks to the very detailed scenarios and individual units, supported by splendid particle effects, realistic global illumination, well-finished animations and above all by an incredible sense of power when unleashing the more powerful weapons and carpet bombing. With our test configuration, indicated in the next box, we selected the ~Insane~ preset with all details maxed out, and in 1080p we suffered no hesitation in game fluidity. The scalability of the famous IRISZOOM engine by Eugen Systems is nonetheless remarkable, thanks to an infinite number of graphic options ranging from the more classic items such as the anti-aliasing and anisotropic filters up to the management of the quality of the units, of the land, of the water, of the shadows and shaders, as well as tasselation and render rendering. Overall we are faced with a well-kept work, also accompanied by excellent sound effects and a good dubbing in English; only the soundtrack seemed a little anonymous to us, tiring after a few games. Act of Aggression is subtitled in Italian, but curiously to set our language it is necessary to insert it from Steam, in the game properties menu.", "date": "2015-09-07", "grade": "8.3"}
