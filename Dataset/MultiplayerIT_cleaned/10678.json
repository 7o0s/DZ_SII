{"name": "Metroid Dread", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metroid-dread-recensione.html", "text": "Metroid dreads. Right from the title it chose for the game, Nintendo wanted us to believe that the underlying theme of this new Samus Aran adventure was terror, Fear. The fear of an unknown planet, the anxiety of seven killer robots chasing us and the fear of a danger believed to be extinct, but which still threatens the galaxy. And it's true, the game is full of moments of tension, and never like in Metroid Dread do you find yourself jumping on your chair in fright, running away, hiding, hoping not to be hunted down. From the first moment Samus sets foot on planet ZDR, up to the credits screen, it is clear how much, even before fear, MercurySteam and producer Yoshio Sakamoto wanted to communicate a feeling of continuity with the past and a balance between modernity and tradition. It has taken almost twenty years to see a new 2D Metroid pick up where Metroid Fusion left off on the Game Boy Advance, and in the meantime a whole generation of indie developers have taken over the metroidvania baton, modernized its language and fixed new standards for the genre. Yet, despite twenty years having passed, fans of the series will immediately find themselves at home: in the structure of the map, in the way of telling the story, in the progression of the upgrades and in the frenzy of the clashes, the development team has been careful to create a game that looked irrefutably Metroid, using modern technologies to enhance the power of Samus, the excitement of the chases and the spectacularity of the battles. Dread closes a circle left open twenty years ago, and it does so with an explosive and funny episode which, like its protagonist, has all the DNA of Metroid within it. Ah, for the Metroid Dread review we tried the game on Nintendo Switch OLED, but you can find the impressions on the console in the article dedicated to the new model with a larger display. Metroid DNA Metroid Dread, Samus prepares to land on ZDR For MercurySteam, the work done on Metroid: Samus Returns for Nintendo 3DS was something of a mess. However appreciated, the remake of Metroid 2 collided with all the limits of being, precisely, a modernization of a Game Boy game, but it still allowed the Spanish studio to become familiar with the language of the Nintendo series and with its traditions. With this ~practice~, the developer has revived in Metroid Dread everything that the series has refined over the years: from clichs - such as the so-called ~physical amnesia~ which sees Samus losing her powers at the beginning of the adventure - to the maze of corridors and rooms that make up a map that turns out to be immense, labyrinthine. Slipping into a precipice before meeting a boss communicates that there are no escape routes and increases the tension of the fight, while clues are often hidden in the seabed that tell something more about the setting and sometimes act as a prelude to what is to come After. In some cases, mechanisms activated in one area end up having important repercussions on another, and returning to explore old areas with new skills opens up new paths and a completely new way of crossing the environment compared to the first hours of the game. In Metroid Dread, performing a melee attack on the run gives enormous satisfaction Samus' adventure is solitary, the bounty hunter does not speak to anyone (least of all with herself) and the only information on the planet ZDR and its enemies is provided to her in specific rooms by Adam, the ship's artificial intelligence . As in Metroid Fusion, Adam is often verbose and didactic here too, and having a ~friendly~ voice so present throughout the game contributes to the development of the story, but also makes the feeling of isolation of the first episodes of the series disappear. Unlike Fusion, fortunately, however, Adam tends to leave more freedom of discovery to those who play: there are still some moments in which he suggests to Samus where to look for the next point of interest, but he (almost) never does so by placing an indicator in the map and in general the experience is much less guided. On several occasions we find ourselves pleasantly lost and, as if it were a puzzle to be solved, we look carefully at the map in search of closed passages or still unexplored areas. To facilitate backtracking and navigation, the developers have however made available various tools: in addition to the classic teleportation stations, on the map it is possible to highlight all the doors or objects of the same type, colored markers can be placed to remember areas important, while the rooms that hide a secret light up on the map. The latter is fperhaps a little too lenient help, but especially in the advanced stages and in the end-game it proves indispensable to find all the hidden objects. Power is everything At the beginning of Metroid Dread you get to know this Chozo warrior. Who will it ever be? It had already been guessed in the past months, but the almost eight hours needed to finish the game confirmed it: Metroid Dread is undoubtedly the most adrenaline-pumping, aggressive and fun chapter in the series to play. From the beginning, Samus has at her disposal a series of abilities that allow her to move quickly and fluidly, to overcome obstacles without stopping and to attack enemies more ferociously. The ability to aim 360 while running is a first for the series which, combined with the ability to slide, vault obstacles on the run and execute an uppercut to neutralize incoming attacks, allows Samus to traverse each room with a explosive fury. If in Samus Returns you were forced to stop continuously in front of every single enemy, in Metroid Dread this no longer happens, and you are encouraged to play in a more aggressive and flowing way, in a perfect balance between the most modern elements experienced over the years recent and more offensive feeling of Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. Compared to previous Metroids, the camera has been moved away a bit to allow the player to have a wider view of the room and plan the path to follow in real time. One of Metroid Dread's many enemies is preparing for a bad end Samus has never been so explosive, quick and full of grit: she can fire during a slide and get up with a jump kick, stun an enemy with an uppercut and eliminate them with a cannon blast, and as new skills are unlocked she becomes even more lightning fast and unstoppable. If Samus Aran is the most powerful bounty hunter in the galaxy, Metroid Dread's moments of exploration and combat are there to remind her. As if that weren't enough, MercurySteam also wanted to convey this same grit in the interlude scenes and in the fights with often gigantic bosses, where the protagonist shows off a glacial confidence in poses and stunts so casual as to make her seem like a real braggart. Just the bosses are another aspect on which the Spanish team has clearly placed a lot of attention, after having had their hands tied with Samus Returns. Not all battles are memorable, some deliberately hark back to the past of the series, and fans of monstrosities like Mother Brain in Super Metroid and Nightmare in Metroid Fusion will have to settle for less disgusting or terrifying opponents. In Metroid Dread there is no shortage of old acquaintances for fans of the saga However, all of them are titanic and push the player to use Samus' acrobatic skills to dodge, jump and slide while looking for the weak point to bomb like there was no tomorrow. A couple of clashes, then, are certainly among the best successful that the series has ever churned out. It wouldn't have spoiled some fights in which to exploit Samus' abilities in a more original way, but to compensate and add a little variety and a real sense of panic we think of the E.M.M.I., the seven killer robots who scour the different regions of the planet . The E.M.M.I. The seconds in which you try to delete an E.M.M.I. arriving are among the most adrenaline-pumping of Metroid Dread That of the E.M.M.I. it is an idea that Sakamoto has kept in his drawer for over fifteen years, and which was born as a direct evolution of SA-X, Samus' nemesis who in Metroid Fusion represented a fearsome and indestructible presence, from which to hide and escape. Unlike SA-X, which appeared at predetermined points in history, E.M.M.I. instead they are relegated to specific areas that Samus must necessarily cross during exploration. They are fast, capable of perceiving distant noises, and can only be destroyed after finding a special disposable weapon: this means that, for the vast majority of the time, Samus has to try to hide, perhaps using her classic morphosphere to slip into narrow tunnels, or become invisible for a limited period of time. However, the narrow spaces and the incessant rounds of the E.M.M.I. they will inevitably lead to being caught, starting a frantic chase in which to look for the ideal path to be able to sow the robot. In some cases you have to activate switches or create passages while in the meantime you are trying to escape, an interesting idea and that perhaps could have been explored a bit more. In their behavior the seven robots are all more or less similar, but each meeting introduces some skill or somevariant to be considered in such a way that each chase is always a little different from the previous one. In Metroid Dread you visit various regions of the ZDR planet, each with its own creatures Then when she is hunted down by an E.M.M.I., Samus has one last desperate chance to break free and survive, but to do so requires such severe timing that it is extremely difficult. And it's better this way, because in this way the tension always remains high, as well as the panic and fear of being doomed, but those rare times when you finally manage to free yourself, the satisfaction is incomparable. From the very first meeting with an E.M.M.I. battered, Metroid Dread teaches players that these powerful enemies are deadly but can be destroyed. It is perhaps also for this reason that none of them manage to be as terrifying as SA-X in Metroid Fusion, but their speed and tenacity in chasing Samus are enough to always keep the tension level high. When you enter an E.M.M.I. area, the roles are suddenly reversed, and from unstoppable hunter Samus transforms in an instant into a helpless prey. Yet these sequences are well distributed on the map, keep the pace of the game high and well balance the level of challenge of the entire adventure, while the musical accompaniment gives character to each area and makes entering a dangerous area even more marked. Final with a bang ADAM is still a little too present, but at least this time he doesn't give precise indications on where to go Since it's been almost twenty years since the release of Metroid Fusion, and since this will be the first episode of the series that many will have ever played, Nintendo wanted to make sure that the story was understandable and engaging even for those who play Metroid approaches for the first time. A short introduction summarizes the few really important events of the previous episodes, introducing Samus, the Metroids and the X-parasite that was thought to be eliminated at the end of Fusion but is spotted on ZDR. Thus begins a journey between the regions of the planet, from the rocky caves of Artaria to the rivers of lava flowing in the factories of Cataris, passing through the deep sea of Burenia or the inhospitable forest of Ghavoran. In between, Samus will discover more about the secrets of the Chozo and will find himself facing an even more dangerous enemy than the E.M.M.I., with a bombastic and spectacular finale, where there are no shortage of twists and moments that will surely excite all fans of the series who in recent years they have fantasized about the sequel to Metroid Fusion. Dread brings to a conclusion the narrative arc that began thirty-five years ago on the NES, closing the circle of a story that was openly inspired by Alien from the beginning and that part of that inspiration can also be found here. Samus' new suit in Metroid Dread has some great colors, don't you think? Perhaps a few more hours spent on ZDR would have allowed MercurySteam to better develop some barely hinted ideas and to make some story twists seem less hurried, but on the other hand Dread doesn't even get tired: the pace is always high, the tension always present, and in the end what remains is the curiosity to find out what future the series holds and if, after Metroid Prime 4, there will be a relaunch of the series in 2D. Let's hope this time we don't have to wait another twenty years.", "date": "2021-10-06", "grade": "9.0"}
