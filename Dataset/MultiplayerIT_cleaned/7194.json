Due out on April 17 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game will attempt to justify the additional outlay from part of the fans of the football series through the introduction of some interesting features, such as greater care in the construction of stadiums and fans, improved animations for the players, great attention to the presentation of the scenarios and the addition of specially designed modes for this new experience. Konami could not stand still and watch, this is clear, and so it tried to play in advance by releasing World Challenge, a DLC for Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 which is sold at a price of 9.99 euros and which adds to the base game precisely the chance to try their hand at the World Cup, albeit unofficially. We tried the package these days, so here are our impressions. World Challenge adds a new mode to PES2014, but the content doesn't justify the price of the DLC A solid foundation Made over a span of four years and powered by a new graphics engine, a modified version of the now famous FOX Engine, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 offers a renewed experience in its main elements, which almost entirely renounces the ~rails ~ that have always characterized the Konami franchise in favor of a freer approach, which takes into account the weight and balance of each individual player to offer a realistic and engaging rendering of dribbling and tackling, as well as unprecedented ways to manage passes and shoot. In the same way, one of the features introduced in the previous edition, the Player ID, has been optimized, which takes some of the most important players in the world and faithfully reproduces their maneuvers on the pitch, but in this case without exaggerating and therefore providing an excessive advantage when checking samples. All these changes have a price, in this case a physics of the ball less brilliant than usual, with the sphere being lighter and therefore making impacts less convincing. Not a minor defect, mind you, indeed a factor that heavily affects the enjoyment of the experience, even more so in the eyes of those who have remained tied to the series over the years precisely because of this peculiarity. Furthermore, one cannot help but notice the inconsistency of a technical sector which boasts good performances in the standard action but which suffers from ridiculously low frame rates when moving on to the pre-determined sequences (celebrations, entry of the teams, replay), problem this that the developers still haven't fixed several months after the game's release in stores. The big challenge Once purchased, downloaded and installed, the World Challenge DLC modifies the Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 home screen, adding a new mode called ~World Challenge~. You can tackle it in the traditional way, thus managing the entire team, or as a single player, whether it's an existing player, one created for the occasion or one we have shaped through the ~Become a Myth~. In both cases, the competition starts from the preliminary stages, i.e. from the qualifying rounds, leaving open the question of call-ups and therefore allowing us to try out the best talent our nation has to offer before determining which formation we will bring to Brazil and who will face off against other teams to win the coveted cup. Beyond the only element officially reproduced in the DLC, the Adidas ~Brazuca~ ball, World Challenge does not bring substantial changes to the structure and gameplay that we already know well, and which boast in the 2014 edition various adjustments capable of increasing or decreasing the degree of realism of the matches, especially as regards the system of passes, through and through, but also of finishing. There is a tangible change that concerns the behavioral routines of the artificial intelligence, a sort of ~enthusiasm~ that loads the team when the result is unlocked, going to pump the characteristics of the individual players, and in the same way some variations are visible in the appearance of the most representative characters of each team. That said, the reality of things sees this DLC as a simple customization of modes already present in the initial offer, which is also evidenced by the very low weight of the download. In short, a few lines of code to activate certain functions and get to grips with the editor: elements that do not justify the premium nature of the pacchetto, which could very well be distributed free of charge, moreover going to integrate itself with a view to post-launch support that until now had made users miss very little.", "date": "2014-04-14", "grade": null}
