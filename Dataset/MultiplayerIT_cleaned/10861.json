{"name": "Wild West Guns", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wild-west-guns.html", "text": "In its Wii incarnation, Wild West Guns has been globally appreciated by audiences and critics, albeit criticized for its poor longevity: an aspect which, we must say immediately, has unfortunately not been perfected in this iPhone conversion, remaining the main limitation of the product . But let's go in order: Wild West Guns looks like a pure and simple target practice, free from any type of plot or logical connection that unites one stage to another. The user's task is therefore simply to overcome each of the six levels obtaining a score that allows him to unlock the subsequent stages. Each section consists of three events that ensure a good variety of action: you find yourself shooting balloons, flying sombreros, vultures, moving targets and even bandits, all within classic scenarios such as a speeding train, a saloon , a dusty village etc. The control system couldn't be simpler, requiring only a tap of the finger on the touchscreen to fire and a shake of the iPhone to free oneself from the grip of some particular opponents. Compared to the WiiWare version, here Wild West Guns has been enriched with two new types of weapons that appear randomly during the game action: it is a shotgun useful for hitting multiple targets simultaneously and a machine gun thanks to which fanning bullets without caring too much about accuracy. Instead, the mechanics that form the background to the action remain, so there is no energy indicator, nor is there the need to reload one's weapon after a certain amount of bullets: on the other hand, the user can multiply his score by hitting targets in succession without making mistakes, or even hitting the enemies in the head or shooting at some element that appears for a very short time in the play area. In terms of pure and simple modes, Wild West Guns is divided into five sections, of which only two are available from the beginning: by completing the game on Normal and Hard, it will therefore be possible to unlock the Survivor, Reload and Sniper variants. Unfortunately, two big shortcomings limit the replay value of Wild West Guns: firstly, the game becomes really too difficult in the long run, and secondly the succession of the stages remains the same in all modes, making everything excessively monotonous after a few sessions . And it's certainly a shame, because the Gameloft product could count on solid foundations: the playful experience is immediate and fun, the scenarios are widely destructible and the touchscreen control is absolutely precise and satisfying. Also from a graphic point of view Wild West Guns settles on excellent levels, with very detailed settings and well-kept and well-animated sprites. PRO Fun and immediate Good graphics Precise control system AGAINST Short lived It quickly becomes monotonous Too difficult at high levels", "date": "2009-02-23", "grade": "S.V."}
