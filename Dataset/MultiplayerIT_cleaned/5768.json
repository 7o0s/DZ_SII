{"name": "Moonscars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moonscars-recensione.html", "text": "Castlevania, Dark Souls and a generous dose of Blasphemous are the ingredients of the new soulslike metroidvania developed by Black Mermaid, debuting on PC and console. Moonscars is a game that right from the start showcases a clear stylistic code, which emerges between the pictorial traits of characters and settings, the virtuosity of some two-dimensional animations and an almost monochromatic palette. It is a dark and disturbing world, the one created by authors of the game, yet we will have to explore it far and wide in search of passages, walls that can be destroyed, switches that open doors or operate elevators; saving whenever possible at mirrors that simultaneously bring all slain enemies back to life, and using the bone dust collected up to that moment to unlock new skills. However, we will be willing to do this and more to ease the pain and anguish of Gray Irma, a clay statue in which a mysterious Sculptor has breathed life. For what? We tell you about it in the Moonscars review. History Moonscars, Gray Irma asleep Clay, bones and a drop of immortal blood: this has been used by the mysterious Sculptor to give life to his creatures, shaped in the image and likeness of human beings but actually endowed with abilities far superior to those of a normal person. Like Frankenstein's new monsters, however, the warriors have rebelled against their creator, abandoning him one by one. Gray Irma, the most perfect of these creatures, awakens after being overwhelmed by monsters, in pain: a voice He orders her to find the Sculptor, and so he takes up his sword once more and makes his way through the pathetic beasts that besiege the castle in search of the only person able to help him. However, this is not an epilogue: the mission of the protagonist of Moonscars has just begun. Gameplay Moonscars, a fight sequence Both the metroidvania elements and the soulslike contaminations appear clearly evident from the first sequences of Moonscars. The character we control is equipped with a sword with which to strike enemies, even with a charged slash that can eventually hurl the opponent against the spikes that often dress up the walls and floors of the scenario. The jump allows Gray Irma to move on the platforms, while parry and dash constitute her defensive manoeuvres, in particular the second one: a forward projection that lasts for a few moments and, if done at the right moment, allows the warrior to avoid taking damage. A fundamental resource, especially at the beginning of the campaign, when our vital energy is so low that we can't resist more than a couple of blows. At this juncture, the level of difficulty of the experience appears decidedly punitive, perhaps even too much, but the game rewards our patience quickly, giving us improvements that allow the protagonist to substantially increase her resistance, as well as restore health through the pressure of the left backbone, consuming the same indicator that is charged by fighting and that regulates the special attacks.The latter represent a valuable addition to Gray Irma's repertoire: they tear apart the basic hostile creatures, weaken the most resistant ones and reveal themselves also useful for exploration purposes, for example to destroy the walls that open certain passages and create the classic shortcuts from one area to another. However, the skill tree looks bleak, so much so that one gets the feeling that the initial powers and related improvements are basically all that the game has to offer in this regard. Moonscars, a boss fight The platform mechanics suffer on Nintendo Switch from some problems in the precision of the controls, since it often happens that the character does not jump as he is asked to do when he reaches the edge of a platform, which sometimes results in the need to redo a boring climb, or worse to suffer some unexpected and undeserved damage ending up on the aforementioned spikes or on some enemy. There are also three extra weapons at our disposal, all characterized by considerable power but also by slow execution times, which make them complicated to use in the best way in certain situations, see for example the boss fights; as well as some bonuses that amplify Gray Irma's abilities, and are obtained after eliminating a certain number of enemies. Moonscars, the classic metroidvania platform structure The ~build~ that can be created through this feature in the context of a single attempt is effective, especially in the more complex game phases, but game over is always around the corner. egLuckily, as happens in several soulslikes, upon returning we will be given the opportunity to reach the place where we died and recover the remains of the Gray Irma who preceded us, thus regaining the resources collected. We will be able to spend them at the dark mirrors: locations which allow the saving of the position, the rapid movement from one point to another of the scenarios, the interaction with characters and merchants who are in a sort of limbo but also the birth of a doppelganger that we will find again upon exiting the mirror and which he will try to kill us. By beating him we will get back the extra weapon he stole from us or we can choose another one. Moonscars, Gray Irma attacks with spear In terms of the variety of enemies, the guys from Black Mermaid have done a great job: although the Moonscars design side suffers from the monochromatic approach, which inhibits a minimum of visual variety, the opponents we will find ourselves facing are numerous and divided into various typologies, with well-defined attack patterns that must be memorized in order to implement the necessary countermeasures. A discourse that naturally also extends to bosses, large or small: the outcome of the clashes is always linked to our ability to read the moves of the monster on duty and dodge to avoid damage, or quickly recover some health if we have the opportunity, trying to sink the blows whenever possible. As mentioned, the challenge after the first few hours is calmed down: someone could turn up their noses, we certainly don't. Structure Moonscars, the bonuses unlockable within a single attempt Moonscars refers to the metroidvania tradition and this also and above all applies to the level design, linked to the alternation of platforms, doors and mechanisms to be activated in order to open certain roads and passages, but also to understand where to go in order to access the next scenario, which is not always intuitive. Let's say that the typical elements of the genre are all present in the game, even in a predictable way: the experience draws on widely consolidated dynamics, and so it is really difficult to be surprised. Then there is the question of the graphic style, which while on the one hand gives a precise personality to the title of Black Mermaid, on the other hand makes the locations really too similar, making our path monothematic. Technical realization Moonscars and its almost monochromatic style If it is true that the Nintendo Switch version suffers in some moments from completely unjustified jerks and uncertainties, which we hope will be fixed with the next updates, from a technical point of view Moonscars is a solid and convincing product, strong in excellent two-dimensional animations and a style which, as we have already talked about, brings advantages and disadvantages. We consider the graphics to be very easily recognizable as a strength, but we insist on shades of gray interspersed with flashes of bright red for the entire duration of the campaign, even in the menu screens, maybe that wasn't such a great idea. However, we respect the coherence of the authors, which is also expressed through a soundtrack devoid of songs that remain impressed, yet capable of contributing to the general atmosphere.", "date": "2022-09-30", "grade": "7.4"}
