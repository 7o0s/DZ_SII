The latest episode, Super Fancy Pants Adventure, landed last September on Steam and now also arrives on the App Store in premium format, at a price of 5.49 euros. A sum amply justified not only by the quality of the new platform-based adventure designed by Brad Borne, but also and above all by its numbers, with a view to a campaign consisting of no less than fifty-six medium-sized levels. Naturally, the narrative incipit is negligible: it is enough to know that the traditional protagonist of Fancy Pants is grappling with a difficult rescue mission in which he will have to travel ramps very quickly, jump on platforms, slide on pipes and fight brandishing the ever-present pencil like a sword. It is this last mechanic that stands out above all the others, because judging by the essential graphic style, one would never think that the game could convey such a successful sensation of impact. And instead the clashes in Super Fancy Pants Adventure are exciting, every shot is valued and you are therefore encouraged to fight even when perhaps you could simply pass by, tackling the stages at speed like any Sonic. The pencil hurts more... During the early stages, the experience of Super Fancy Pants Adventure seems to underline the good things the series has done so far, in a sort of fun review that puts all the elements already seen and consolidated in the previous episodes on the table. However, some interesting novelties also arrive when the protagonist comes into possession of new tools, for example the ability to ~surf~ on sheets of paper to overcome large chasms or the much more convincing ability to operate a stylus pen to shoot Ink bullets on enemies. In all this there is no shortage of elaborate platform sections, stunts, chases and maneuvers capable of enhancing the physics that regulates any movement in the cartoon world created by Borne Games. You have to collect items to restore your health, but there are also many secrets to discover, such as mini-levels that are hidden behind certain doors and which, in some cases, reveal new details about the gameplay. The very characterization of the scenarios, different from each other in tone and design, aims to enhance an exploratory phase which at times takes on fairly complex and intriguing connotations. In support there is of course the minimal but fascinating graphic style to which we are now well accustomed, which in this new adventure puts itself at the service of a direction that is never predictable, with changes of view and interesting variations on the theme, placed at the service of the story and of his characters. Everything perfect, then? Unfortunately not: the Super Fancy Pants Adventure experience is somewhat ruined by the touch controls, inexplicably devoid of any adjustments. The buttons on the screen are too small and transparent, but above all it often happens that the directional arrows get stuck, forcing us to lift our finger and try again a couple of times for the character to move in the desired direction, perhaps while we are in the middle of a fast and excited phase. Support for MFi controllers makes it possible to remedy this lack, but in any case the application should be updated with a patch that can solve the problem for all users.", "date": "2018-02-02", "grade": "8.5"}
