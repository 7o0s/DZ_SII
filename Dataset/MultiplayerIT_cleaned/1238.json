{"name": "Pitfall - The Lost Expedition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pitfall-the-lost-expedition.html", "text": "Game structure The control system of The Lost Expedition is precise and quite intuitive: the left analog stick of the Dual Shock 2 is assigned, as usual, to the movement of the character; the right one is used, however, to collect treasures. The view is controlled by the secondary back keys and the d-pad grants access to inventory items, while the pad keys allow you to fight, jump, activate the first person view and sneak. Finally, the primary back buttons make Harry crouch or roll to reach otherwise inaccessible areas (anyone know Metroid Prime?). The construction style of the levels is very reminiscent of what was seen in the various Crash Bandicoots, even if there is greater interaction and much more freedom of movement. It is no coincidence that it is necessary to solve some puzzles and obtain certain skills to reach the various locations, therefore it is absolutely necessary to be able to explore the stages far and wide. A nice map shows us at any time our position and that of the place to reach to ~continue~, but unfortunately it has not been thought out very well by the developers and is rather difficult to interpret: it is one of the things in the game for which you need to have a some patience. On the other hand, the new Pitfall is a pleasure to play: the movement is precise even if you have to pay attention to the centimeters (when you go along a branch to jump onto another or when you go from liana to liana), the character is always agile and the only annoyance is sometimes represented by the visual control. To act as a ~glue~ to the various phases of the game there are several animated sequences: very well dubbed in Italian (a round of applause to those responsible for the local version), well done and full of intelligent humor, which does not fail to elicit a few smiles. Technical aspect Pitfall  The Lost Expedition boasts really, really well done graphics. The characters are drawn in a precise caricature-like style, the animations are well done but above all the scenarios are rich in detail and everything moves at 60 frames per second. The only drawback: sometimes there are some clicks. As far as sound is concerned, the game features a series of nice effects and functional music for the action, not numerous but well placed. I have already praised the Italian dubbing: excellent choice of voices and convincing acting. As I wrote previously, the game runs linearly but the interpretation of the map is very inconvenient, so you need to take references and to do this you will necessarily have to go a long way in vain, retrace your steps and promptly realize that you have chosen the wrong path . Everything else is excellent, however: while not boasting the length of titles of the caliber of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine or the aforementioned Metroid Prime, Pitfall  The Lost Expedition is a product that offers some valid reason to play it again ( for example the presence of the first two Pitfalls, emulated perfectly) and in my opinion it sets new points of reference as regards the quality of the contents in the context of the interlude sequences. Comment If you own PS2 or Xbox, Pitfall  The Lost Expedition represents an excellent choice in the genre of platformers with adventure elements. The atmosphere that the game can create, the quality of the graphics and the sympathy aroused by the character leave no doubts about it. The few but significant defects of this product, including the presence of some ~cumbersome~ aspects and the short length, together with the lack of truly original ideas, deny it that extra half point in the numerical vote... Pros: Excellent graphics, especially the level design Cut scenes full of inspired humor Precise control system Cons: Some uncertainty of the graphics engine Not very long Map difficult to interpret Activision has entrusted the developers of the Edge of Reality team with the onerous task of bringing back the Pitfall series, to make it the protagonist of the current videogame scene. Or to try to do it, at least: everyone knows how difficult it is nowadays to relaunch characters from the past without a truly convincing product. Does The Lost Expedition meet these requirements? Yes and no. This new platform-adventure boasts many quality elements, but put together in a sometimes careless way. Among the things to save is certainly the beginning: you find yourself in the role of ~Pitfall~ Harry fighting a huge demon-jaguar, surrounded by a barrier of flames. When thecombat seems decided in favor of the adventurer, however, the diabolical feline gets up and knocks the character down. From there starts a retrospective story that takes us to the beginning of the adventure: Harry embarks on an expedition to Peru in search of treasures, but the plane on which he and his companions are traveling crashes due to a furious storm. Awakened in the middle of a jungle, the character will have to find his friends and beware of numerous enemies: evil monkeys, furious natives, diabolical rivals and the environment itself.", "date": "2004-07-23", "grade": null}
