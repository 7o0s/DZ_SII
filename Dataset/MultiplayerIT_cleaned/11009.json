{"name": "Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-recensione.html", "text": "Dimensional steps Putting together a cast of characters from two worlds so distant required some stunts at the script level: the story assumes that a mysterious force has caused the opening of numerous dimensional gaps between the two dimensions, teleporting the inhabitants from here to the randomly. Moreover, the wrestlers are often caught by attacks of ~Rage~, a homicidal fury that takes possession of the individual, affecting his reasoning skills and even preventing him from distinguishing friends from enemies. This expedient also serves to make the leveling of the characters' skills credible: the power of Rage somewhat disrupts all the innate characteristics of the heroes, for example making Superman vulnerable and other human characters stronger than normal. In story mode you can only choose whether to side with Mortal Kombat or DC Universe, and then the characters we're going to control will be changed automatically following the evolution of the story. By choosing Mortal Kombat, for example, the adventure will begin by controlling Liu-Kang, while if DC Universe is preferred, the hero at our commands will be Flash. One of the first things you notice in the story mode is the total absence of fatalities: according to the script, every single character must remain alive. Not quite the ~Mortal Kombat style~ we remembered. For the world of Mortal Kombat we find: Scorpion  Sub-Zero Sonya, Shang Tsung, Kitana, Jax, Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, Baraka, Shao Kahn. DC Comics characters are Batman, Joker, Catwoman, Flash, Superman, Wonder Woman, Deathstroke, Lex Luthor, Captain Marvel, Green Lantern, Shao Kahn and Darkseid. Gentle Fatalities and superpowers The first tooth to remove when talking about playability is precisely the one concerning the trademark of the series: the fatalities. In this Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe fatalities are the exclusive prerogative of Mortal Kombat characters and DC Comics bad guys, since it is natural that superheroes could never kill their opponents in cold blood: for them there are Brutalities, rather violent but not lethal moves. Yet even in the case of the Fatalities, it remains very bitter in the mouth, especially for old fans of the saga. These final moves are absolutely neutered, sweetened, light years away from the blunt violence to which Ed Boon and his associates have accustomed us in the past. All this because Midway has tried in every way to have the game cataloged with the ~Teen~ rating, that is, the one that certifies a product also suitable for 12-year-old children. And a Mortal Kombat with little violence seems like a real paradox. For the rest we certainly notice some differences compared to what we have seen in the most recent incarnations, but none of these are particularly significant. The combat mechanics, which mix some elements of 2D fighting games with some of the 3D ones, are quite basic and not particularly deep, but have the advantage of immediacy. The setting of the controls is nice, where the left analog stick controls the three-dimensional movements and the digital cross allows only 2D movements, like in the old days. Most of the special moves are nice to look at, but some of them feel a little imprecise in execution, and it's annoying that practically every character has his own method of teleporting, an ability that is usually exclusive to two or three fighters in a row. for game. Gentle Fatalities and superpowers The small innovations we mentioned are represented by Rage, Klose Kombat, Free Fall Kombat and Test Your Might. Rage is a power that is accumulated by fighting, and once released by pressing the appropriate keys, it sends the wrestler into a sort of ~berserk~, complete with eyes and body illuminated by a golden glow. During the influence of Rage, our character can block the opponent's combos and at the same time not be blocked while executing his own; moreover, the damage inflicted is slightly higher than normal. Klose Kombat, which is activated by performing a special grip, allows you to attack with a sequence of four shots, each of these corresponding to one of the main keys of the joypad. However, in order to send the attacks and inflict damage, it is necessary that the opponent does not guess the keystroke entered. Free Fall Kombat is similar to Klose Kombat but interacts with the scenario: the attacker throws himself into the void with his opponent, trying to make him stay underneath to cushion the fall. The outcome of the Free Fall is decided once again by the sequence of four keys that each of the two opponents must enter. Finally, with Test Your Might, the attacker charges his enemy and pushes him for everythingthe game scenario, knocking down walls, gates, statues or anything else in front of you. To free himself, the victim will have to quickly press the joypad keys faster than his opponent. The story mode has a rather limited longevity, and even finishing the game by controlling both sides and enjoying all the numerous cutscenes it is easy to finish the work by staying under 7 hours. In the classic arcade mode there is the incentive of fatalities / brutalities, but the developers have included a very limited amount of unlockable extras, which have always been vital for replayability. The online mode certainly adds something, but even then we doubt that the experience will last over time. Graphics and sound The graphic rendering of the wrestlers is very pleasant. Polygonal complexity and effects are good, as are most of the animations. The character design is very spot on, and the rendering on screen is satisfying. The routine that allows you to damage clothes and form visible wounds on the wrestlers as they suffer blows is well done. What often fails to convince are the game environments, a cut below the 3D models of the characters. As for the audio sector, the usual Mortal Kombat voices seem slightly more deflated and less convinced than usual, but both the off-screen announcer and the voice actors earn plenty of bread. Final comment Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is more or less in line with the quality of the latest chapters of the Midway saga: a decent game that guarantees a sufficient level of fun, but does not excel in anything and of which many players may get tired after a few hours. Fans of the saga will find it very difficult to swallow the new fatalities with rose water, and those who should approach Mortal Kombat for the first time can find fighting games of much different thickness on the market. In essence we are talking about a discreet game but with an interest curve inevitably destined to fall in the short term. Pros Interesting and bizarre mix of characters Overall fun and enjoyable to watch Cons Fairly limited longevity Castrated Fatalities", "date": "2008-11-27", "grade": null}
