The game shares the first-person action and crosshairs of Gun Survivor, but adopts an ~on-rails~ structure typical of lightgun shooters. On the occasion of its launch, Nintendo has seen fit to commercialize Wii Zapper, or a gun-shaped accessory in which to insert the Wii-mote to get a better feeling in first person shooters. For the avoidance of doubt, however, The Umbrella Chronicles is far from being a lightgun shooter, and those who expect such a product will be at least dazed during the first few games. You cannot ~aim~ at enemies: you use the controller's aiming system to move the crosshair on the screen and then fire by pressing the B trigger. Also, the game requires the Nunchuck module to be connected to get the full experience : the graphics are calculated in real time and our movements in the scenario are predetermined (if we exclude the presence of crossroads), but we can use the analog stick to move the view just enough, for example, to allow us to collect a glimpsed object (by pressing the A button). The Nunchuck is also important for scrolling through the available weapons, which can be activated via the C button (much more convenient than the d-pad for this operation...), which however Capcom has not managed in the best way: to change the gun default with something else you can't access a menu that pauses the game momentarily, so we'll often find ourselves having to scroll through three or four weapons before finding the one still loaded, and in the meantime we'll be vulnerable to any enemy attack. The recharge function is positively surprising, which is obtained simply by shaking the Wii-mote and which never misfires, even if for this purpose the Zapper adapter could represent a significant obstacle. In addition to firearms, during the game we will also be able to collect grenades, almost useless during the early stages but of fundamental importance against the more advanced bosses. To launch them, just hold down button A and then press trigger B (fortunately we didn't opt for a ~manual launch~...), determining the direction of the shot with the viewfinder. Finally, each character is equipped with an ~ordinance dagger~ which comes in handy when birds or bats swoop down on us: we can slice them by holding down the A button and moving the Wii-mote as if it were the knife. Shoot everything The fact that the graphics of The Umbrella Chronicles is not pre-calculated also translates into a certain level of interaction with the environment, which unfortunately decreases as we progress but which in any case allows us to destroy a bit of everything: lights and chandeliers, crates and boxes, cabinets and monitors... behind them can be hidden a weapon to collect, a healing plant (to restore some energy), a can of disinfectant spray (which constitutes an extra life, in practice) or an Umbrella file with notes on the organization. The moment of truth As in the classic episodes of Resident Evil, also in this case we will repeatedly find ourselves facing moments of danger, in which the game asks us to press a certain button to perform an emergency action. So let's get ready to shake the Wii-mote or press the A, B or both buttons at the same time as soon as we are asked: a delay in this sense can mean a loss of energy or even game over! Technical realization As for the graphics, a miracle was not expected from this title and the forecasts have been confirmed. The age-old discourse on the technical potential of the Wii has little to do with it this time: The Umbrella Chronicles resumes the work already done for some episodes of Resident Evil, therefore reproducing the characters and scenarios faithfully but without improving them in any way. This means that in fact the best things are seen in the first stages, children of the most recent episode (RE Zero), while they worsen slightly later, even without presenting abysmal differences. A sore point is certainly represented by the low-resolution textures, a legacy of a now outdated console generation, while the creation of the zombies and the various creatures is at good levels. Nothing that Resident Evil 4 hasn't done better down on the GameCube, sure, but relative to the lightgun shooter genre we're in good shape... just a shame about the occasional slowdown. Interestingly, the quality level of the cutscenes are not up to current standards, but they do what they can to maintain a certain consistency even in the sections.ni unpublished and never expires in the mediocre. Widescreen mode is supported as well as 480p progressive display. The sound sector is excellent, thanks to a selection of highly atmospheric music (although far from being the best ever heard in a RE) and good quality speech. Weapon-related sound effects are played partly by the Wii-mote's awful speaker, partly by the game itself. Moving on to the important discourse relating to the control system, as already mentioned The Umbrella Chronicles is not a lightgun shooter and therefore you don't have to aim at the screen to shoot enemies, but rather move the viewfinder using the Wii-mote pointing. In this sense, the game is sometimes difficult and requires a precision that is difficult to achieve without a lightgun as regards the ~immediate~ fire, while the movement of the viewfinder has its own reason when you have to hit moving objects. In any case, you need to find a position that ensures the controller a certain stability, and therefore the Wii Zapper adapter could have its say thanks to the two-handed grip. The occasions in which the aim is not accurate are honestly few, but they result in episodes of frustration that are so much ~old-fashioned video games~. A good? It's better as a couple The game includes a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode, which can be accessed in most stages. With a shared health bar, we'll find ourselves shooting enemies much more effectively, and even the simple starting pistol will transform into a sort of machine gun if you manage to concentrate fire on a common target. Since the number of enemies does not vary, it is clear that playing in two is easier, as well as quite fun. Comment Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles came out more or less as expected, therefore not an absolute masterpiece but still an excellent shooter, which tries to intervene on the limits of the genre to which it belongs wherever possible and represents a welcome trip down memory lane for any fan of the Capcom series. It is a good feeling to find the various characters who have lived through the vicissitudes of the villa and Racoon City. The stages reproduce the original locations in an absolutely faithful way, with the same enemies and bosses, and the weapon upgrade system is a welcome extra in terms of customization. It's a pity that to change the supplied weapon you have to scroll through the whole arsenal without being able to pause the action, but in the end it is the only ~true~ defect of this production, beyond the limits imposed by the track structure and a technical realization that does not shine from any point of view but which does its job effectively. The Umbrella Chronicles boasts a good number of missions, numerous usable weapons and the presence of an evaluation system that will push fans of the series to collect all the objects and take all the crossroads to complete the game 100%. In short, a fun pastime while waiting for Resident Evil 5. Pros: A must for RE fans Great weapon upgrade system Shoots well with the Wii-mote... Cons: ...but it's not a lightgun Technically only fair Very frustrating at times The origin of evil This new Resident Evil does not refer to unpublished events or create a parallel story to the one already told, but takes up the events narrated so far and puts them together to constitute a sort of ~summary~ of the events of the Umbrella Corporation. Specifically, we will find ourselves fighting following the plot of Resident Evil Zero, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (plus an unpublished final section), in the shoes of the characters who have succeeded each other in the fight against the powerful multinational and the its viruses. We will be able to relive the salient phases of each of these episodes, face their threats and bosses using a new perspective, as well as access the backstory of the story after completing the ~standard~ chapters: we will find out what happened to Rebecca Chambers between Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil , and also we will better understand the role of Albert Wesker through a series of episodes in which we will be able to take control of him. The developers have worked in order to reproduce the scenarios of the various episodes with absolute fidelity, and the natural selection of the stages (reproducing all the phases would have been too much) does not detract from the value of each chapter, told through numerous cutscenes and dialogues between personages. The difficulty climbs as you progress, getting really high during the final boss fights, but generally you just need to restart after game over to face enemies in a more conscious way, especiallyall because their arrangement and above all their modus operandi does not change. At the end of each internship our performance is evaluated on the basis of various elements and we are assigned a final grade, the goodness of which determines the number of stars earned. These stars can be spent on upgrading weapons at multiple levels, in order to create a customized arsenal based on your tastes and style. Generally the game begins after selecting a second weapon in addition to the default pistol, but during the action you can pick up machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades and anything else to make things easier for us.", "date": "2007-11-29", "grade": null}
