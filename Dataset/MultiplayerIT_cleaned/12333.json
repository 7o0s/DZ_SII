Augmented reality mobile gaming is a real phenomenon, even after all these years, but as original and unique as it is, we are faced with a product that has single-handedly totally saturated the industry it helped to invent. To the point that Niantic itself has not been able to repeat the success of the original even with an important intellectual property such as the Wizarding World universe of JK Rowling, with the game Harry Potter Wizards Unite.Let's find out in the review of The Witcher: Monster Slayer what goals has the always ambitious CD Projekt RED set itself. Augmented reality The Witcher Monster Slayer: One of the first monsters encountered and the materials we collected once defeated. Unlike Warner Bros, CD Projekt did not rely on the industry leader, but on a small Polish studio specializing in AR products called Spokko. The end result, as already mentioned, is a very similar title to Pokmon GO, but with a handful of features that can make a difference. The first is in the setting: if Pokmon and Harry Potter in some ways have an overlapping audience, The Witcher can draw on a more adult audience, and consequently offer stronger emotions. If on the one hand this declines the already known gameplay on new shades, the doubt remains that this could be enough to convince Strigo lovers to go around with their cell phone in hand for hours and hours. The second difference is in the actual mechanics which in the case of The Witcher: Monster Slayer have characteristics more similar to those of a real RPG, but naturally played live. Finally, and this is undoubtedly the most interesting aspect, Monster Slayer has a story, side missions and NPCs to meet and interact with. The Witcher GO The Witcher Monster Slayer: The griffin, the first monster in the story, near its nest and then portrayed in the sequence following its defeat. It's a midsummer Sunday morning when we decide to try The Witcher: Monster Slayer for the first time. We are biased, we admit, because we don't expect anything more than what we've already experienced in the past, and Monster Slayer actually seems to reciprocate our low attention. It's the next day that the experience changes completely. This time we start playing in the middle of a regional park, which with its tree-lined spots manages at times to look just like Velen, the great north of Temeria; there is even a river, the Aniene, in the background of our journey, and nobody around. Suddenly, as we climb among the trees that the warm wind forces into a hypnotic dance, thanks above all to the soundtrack that the headphones shoot into our ears, we realize that we are no longer playing a video game, but that we really feel like Witchers . After creating the character, taking a quick look at the menus and tearing apart some filthy beasts the previous day, we are finally inspired enough to fully enjoy what good Monster Slayer hides. Surprise narrative The Witcher Monster Slayer: it's not like playing in the middle of nature, but seeing fantasy characters between an Audio and a Seat was at least a lot of laughs.

The leap in quality of The Witcher: Monster Slayer, what we never expected, takes place after a couple of fights with some creatures randomly encountered on our way, and has the voice and features of Thorstein, a merchant to whom a beast alata has captured the horse and all its goods. Deep in trouble, Thorstein hires us with the promise to pay us once we find his belongings and we, of course, accept. A red area appears on the map about half a kilometer from where we are at that moment: we immediately set off. Along the way we meet monsters that are a little too strong for our current level, others that we gladly face for experience points and the inevitable loot; the journey is also useful for the many shrubs that allow us to collect other fundamental ingredients that we can use to create alchemical potions, ointments and bombs. Arrived at the pre-established place, here is what remains of our client's horse, perfectly superimposed thanks to augmented reality on the path that cuts through the sun-scorched plain in which we find ourselves. We bend down to see the details better, to ~click~ on the points that will allow us to better analyze the equine remains, practically only a head, only to be taken abackby the big griffin author of the heinous crime. It doesn't end well for us, it couldn't have gone otherwise; after getting back on our feet, a chat with Thorstein awaits us in the shade of the only tree in the area. It's hot, too hot for Witcher blood, and every shaded area is a treasure to be made the most of. We decide to chase the griffin which we will meet later on, and which we will beat after two different attempts. Steel and Silver The Witcher Monster Slayer: as you can see, most of the time the game doesn't look so much different from the classic Pokmon Go. On the right, one of the very few content for higher levels. The combat system closely resembles when devised by Epic with its Infinity Blade, where the user is called upon to trace the direction of the blows on the screen with his finger. In the case of The Witcher: Monster Slayer, the difference will be made above all by the pauses between one blow and another: if these are long enough we will load powerful blows, if instead they are reduced to a minimum the blows will be transformed into fast ones; leaving the finger on the screen instead we will enter the parry which however will not completely cancel the damage, however these will be reduced to a minimum when we perform a perfect one, therefore activating it just before the opponent's blow. From time to time, when we have scored enough hits, a circle and a symbol will appear that will quickly pass through it: if we touch it when the two overlap, we will be able to perform the most powerful move in the game. Then there are the signs, which must be used first by pressing the appropriate icon and then subsequently drawing the correct rune with your finger. When we meet a creature, before the fight its weaknesses will be revealed to us, allowing us to carefully choose the equipment to use during the fight, whether for example to use the steel or silver sword, and if we have any available whether or not to use bombs and ointments. If we are defeated, the only penalty will be losing all the useful objects that we have decided to bring into battle, even if we have not actually used them. It's a problem because these items run out, and without things tend to get pretty difficult, if we want to fight more powerful creatures than the more common and less profitable ones out there. As anticipated, we will be able to build bombs, ointments and potions along the way, using the ingredients that we will collect by killing creatures and collecting plants; if patience is low and gold is a lot, we will be able to buy them directly from the shop exactly like in the CD Projekt RED role-playing game. If you're really a slacker, you can also shell out and buy the adventurer's kit for around five Euros, which will contain just about everything you need to guarantee you one or more days of thoughtless fighting. One kilometer a day The Witcher Monster Slayer: my friend, we just walked 2km under the sun, if you want to talk come here in the shade so I can start making a handful of potions... What happens next in the adventure we will not tell you, it is worth finding out for yourself because there are also several puzzles in between, but know that the next journey will take us almost a kilometer away. A remarkable journey, and no less exciting than the previous one. With the gold collected in the battles won, we decide to buy a new armor, our first silver sword and an alembic that allows us to create everything necessary to fight monsters more effectively, even if for each job it is necessary to wait several minutes, about 15, in real time. At the end of this long day with The Witcher: Monster Slayer, the most important event will prove to be the fight with a huge stone golem that will take almost an hour between battles and defeats to finally see us as winners. It was a long and tiring journey, but the unexpected and overflowing satisfaction. We return home sweaty, ready for a shower, the physique is not Geralt's, but the satisfaction is similar to what we have seen on his face in a thousand adventures.", "date": "2021-07-21", "grade": "7.5"}
