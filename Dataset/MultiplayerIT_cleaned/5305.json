{"name": "Lunga vita alla Madre Russia!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173722-the-tomorrow-children-lunga-vita-alla-madre-russia.html", "text": "When The Tomorrow Children was announced a couple of years ago, what stuck in the minds of many was the highly inspired artistic aspect and a willingness to try to bring the management drift of a video game into a more ~politically incorrect~ arena. For this reason, despite the lack of news for a long time and only one beta this spring (very closed), now it's really possible to give voice to that curiosity. Just in these days the game founders package has been released, at a cost of twenty euros on the Playstation Store. Over the months, the game will come out of its early access version and become a real free to play. For now, however, it is possible to play it through this version, which also grants you a number of game elements. Before going into the merits of what works and, alas, does not work in the Q-Games title, it is right to clarify this point. What we have tested is not the definitive version of the title, at least as regards all the free to play mechanics. These will be introduced later and will change the cards on the table as regards progression, moving or not the needle of the balance towards the now classic pay to win. In light of this, we armed ourselves with ice axes and raised our fists to the sky: there is the Motherland to be rebuilt! The Tomorrow Children is as beautiful to look at as it is unsuccessful in gameplay A big roar and then emptiness The title of Q-games positions itself in that inflated category of post-apocalyptic works of our time. The way he does it is not exactly original but bizarre nonetheless. An experiment gone wrong led to the near extinction of the human race and left behind an endless expanse of Void (called the Void in the game). Within it it is not possible to survive unless you rebuild a settlement and make sure that it is repopulated. All this translates into absolutely aseptic environments, dominated by an off-white that fills the horizon and ground tracks that quite shamelessly recall Lars Von Trier's masterpiece, Dogville. Your goal, as a projection of a human being (strictly female and called mate) is to join forces with other players and, city by city, restore Russia to its former glory. In this work you will be guided by a sort of dictator, a man of propaganda who will speak to you through a television and a transceiver and who is very reminiscent of the infamous Jigsaw. The narrative aspect, however powerful, ends here, and from this moment on the endless search for resources, the reconstruction of cities and the repopulation of the entire nation begins. Arbeit Macht Frei Yes, it is true, the sentence that gives the title to the paragraph is certainly not communist (it was posted on the gates of the Nazi concentration camps), but its meaning, work makes you free, explains well what The Tomorrow Children insistently seeks to achieve. His main problem lies in the way he professes this. Initially blown away by the infinite amount of menus and possibilities, you will believe that you are faced with something so profound that it will take weeks or months to master it. After a couple of hours, however, the sensation changes and the game proves to be a large machine with few cogs. After about ten hours you will have definitively understood that the only thing The Tomorrow Children fully succeeds in is that of conveying a feeling of boredom and repetitiveness such as to make you feel empathy, paradoxically, towards those who are the protagonists of the game . It all boils down to the constant search for just four resources by digging, cutting trees and punching holes in walls to keep a city that requires repopulation. This mechanic - which goes through the collection of nesting dolls that contain the soul of the inhabitants - is the only real goal that can make you advance in the game. Reached the goal, your work will be complete and the only possibility will be to change the city and start from scratch in an endless cycle of tremendous boredom. The multitude of possibilities that the game initially shows you is a red herring. Resource management, building construction (complete with puzzles to generate production), buying and selling in shops and all the rest prove to be tremendously superfluous and inconclusive, which will soon lead you to lose the desire to create a beautiful city multifunctional if only due to the impossibility of returning as soon as it is repopulated. This is why the list of possibilities at stake turns out to be both incredibly long and totally superfluous once you understand the two mechanics.basic story of the title: find nesting dolls and build houses for them to live. Here is The Tomorrow Children's biggest mistake: believing that it is enough to insert a million mechanics without even thinking about amalgamating them with what is the main purpose of the game. And all this is a great pity, considering the potential, especially in terms of imagery. Note of color for the dubbing (totally Russian) and for those that are the characteristics that it is possible to increase of your alter ego and that replace the usual ones with parameters such as ~eloquence~, ~patriotism~ and so on, giving a further sensation of fall prey to the Soviet regime. Playstation 4 trophies As far as trophies are concerned, The Tomorrow Children cannot be said to be generous. The developers have entered only eleven objectives of which: six bronze, four silver and one gold. The coveted platinum is also missing. Acquiring them won't even be too easy, it's about getting to level 30 with your ~companion~ and killing up to 200 Izverg. Congratulations on fortitude! Aseptic is beautiful, saturated is ugly The Tomorrow Children, regardless of what personal tastes may be, returns a crazy glance. The aseptic environments that make up the backbone of the entire game world collide with a design of the structures and angular characters, as if to simulate wood carving. The total absence of earth color conveys the sensation of the vastness of the void and everything manages to amalgamate so well, as to result in one of the most original and inspired works of the moment. Even the recreated environments or the procedurally generated islands where you can go to recover resources are a touch of class: they combine Soviet culture and the bitter irony of the choices of a historical period that have brought tragic consequences to our world and to all its population . Just as the same result is achieved by the improbable mechanical enemies who represent the only - and not very effective - form of antagonist in the game. It is obvious that the mechanical Godzilla wants to do nothing more than remind men of the horror of the atomic bomb and its consequences in terms of genetic mutations. For this reason we continue to consider The Tomorrow Children a great artistic and communicative experiment which, however, fails exactly where a video game cannot afford to make mistakes: the gameplay. Too much meat in the fire risks burning and generating smoke, and that's exactly what happened to the Q-Games title.", "date": "2016-09-13", "grade": "5.5"}
