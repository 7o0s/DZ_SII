Precisely with this last narrative stratagem the second part of the substantial expansion of Pillars of Eternity opens, never too praised a classic role-playing game that has brought back to its former glory the epic tradition of the various Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale , just to mention the first ones that came to mind. Bearing in mind that whoever is reading these lines will know Obsidian's work perfectly and has probably already completed the first episode of The White March, we will immediately focus on the novelties of the gameplay and on the evaluation of the additional content. One last piece of information before proceeding, Part 2 is sold at the same price as the previous one, 14.99 but it is possible to purchase a sort of Season Pass containing the entire add-on for 23.99. The epic of The White March ends without too many jolts. In a positive but also a negative sense For everyone As also happened on the occasion of the first part of The White March, this second piece of the add-on comes with a long series of gameplay improvements that will be made available for free to all owners of the original game through patch 3.0, which will be released at the same time. The stronghold has undergone yet another tweak to improve its integration with the rest of the game. Now the random missions that we will be able to assign to our resting followers will have better described plots, richer in loot and decidedly more adherent to the story of Pillars, but we will also be able to receive the request for an audience from a series of characters that we will be able to help, condemn or just listen. Some of these encounters will also lead us to travel through Eora to follow an unedited narrative line that will jeopardize our possession of Caed Nua. Then there are some decidedly minor changes such as the addition of the new Story game mode, which effectively eliminates the fights, allowing players who are not interested in this aspect to enjoy the story and the depth of the characters without worrying about the rest, or the functional redesign of the skill bar that now more clearly breaks down consumable talents and spells by rest and by combat, as well as offering better navigability of quick-use items. But the most important news concerns two aspects that have direct consequences on the gameplay especially near the end game. In fact, patch 3.0 introduces the damage caused by the knockout, that is when our character falls to the ground unconscious due to the end of his resistance. In this case he will end up with a fairly important penalty depending on the type of damage that caused his stunning: a broken rib, burns or frozen limbs, concussions and so on. Obviously this damage will have rather important consequences on the fights and can only be eliminated by resting. The other element is the complete overhaul of the Athletics and Survival stats. Now the former determines the intensity of a new skill that all characters possess, called Regained Momentum and which allows you to recover a certain amount of stamina once per combat, while Survival defines six different types of bonuses that a player can access party member in the moment of rest, a bit like when you sleep in a tavern or in the stronghold. This precise and constant work by Obsidian in improving the aspects, even secondary ones, of its role-playing game is certainly to be commended, effectively pampering its users and showing a propensity to listen to feedback, often really ruthless and violent, which is rarely possible find in our sector. At the same time, however, we feel compelled to point out that the biggest negative element of Pillars of Eternity continues to remain absolutely vivid and unaffected. We are obviously talking about pathfinding, or the ability of the characters, especially those directly controlled by the player, to reach the areas indicated by us. A phenomenon that afflicts the otherwise splendid work of Obsidian in a negative sense and which seems to continue to worsen with the passage of time. Even this second part of The White March is not exempt from it and, indeed if possible, the new locations and some particular encountersMind many tend to highlight game engine deficits more in this aspect. It is clear, at this point, that the developer can no longer do anything to solve this problem and we sincerely hope that the inevitable sequel will be made from the beginning taking this problem into account. For our part, we have to admit that moving the various characters individually to make them climb a ladder, or getting bogged down for hours in micromanaging each party member to make sure he hits the correct enemy and doesn't get some disengagement shots when we were limited activating an ability has now definitely unnerved us. For few And then we come to talk in detail about the second part of The White March. Let's start immediately by saying that it concludes in a pleasant and detailed way what started with the previous piece. The story, in its entirety, engages at times with the main plot of Pillars of Eternity and manages to appear well written and consistent with the setting. Again we will meet about three brand new settings combined with the partial restyling of the village of Stalwart and a couple of other minor locations. All for a quantity of hours of play that exceeds, by heart, the time taken to complete the first part of the expansion. To want to go into this aspect in detail, it is not that there are more things to do in this second episode than in the previous one but there is a further increase in difficulty and above all some sequences that seem designed to try to stimulate a strongly stealth-oriented approach. In fact, a good part of the new environments offers more entry points and a well-studied exploration allows you to avoid the larger groups of opponents, in cases where it is not possible to get around the clashes by properly exploiting the dialogue options to which we have become accustomed the original title. From this point of view we can say that the second part of The White March perfectly follows the path taken with the first half and the developer's greater practice, combined with the experience gained with the title, has allowed him to offer more original or in any case less related to the usual ~clean up the area before moving on to the next~. In this sense, the interactive sequences also help, which forcefully break up the rhythm of the action and offer much more complex puzzles and environmental situations to solve and deal with, even if it seemed easier to ~cheat~ by selecting all the available options in the absence of malus or penalties in cases where you happen to make a mistake. There is also a new character introduced with this second part. This is Maneha, a barbarian Aumaua from the coastal area that we will meet in the center of the village of Stalwart as soon as the add-on is installed and, very interestingly, it will be possible to use it immediately even if you decide to start with The White March from the start. Its narrative line is closely linked with one of the environments of the expansion and, however short and perhaps a little too superficial, it will pleasantly accompany us to the epilogue of the gaming experience. Instead, where it is difficult to notice the big news is in the graphic aspect of the add-on. Artistically, in fact, as could be expected, this second part does not differ from the previous one and the new settings are all strongly anchored to the Bianca Marca style: therefore snow and ice everywhere. We have noticed greater care in the interiors that we have come across and above all in the new opponents that we have had to face which are enriched with some very interesting additions and definitely above the norm in terms of dimensions. It is also interesting to note that a good job has been done to try to distinguish, just enough, even the numerous groups of humans that we will meet and that on more than one occasion have made us sweat a lot because of the combinations that The White March placed us in front. Nothing to say on the musical front and it's a shame considering that from this point of view we would have expected some news while the themes seemed practically the same to us, apart from the addition of a single track. On the other hand, the dubbing in English remains exceptional and the written translation in Italian is excellent.", "date": "2016-02-16", "grade": "8.0"}
