No, we didn't have the wrong game, blame Sucker Punch, who have often and willingly nominated it as a yardstick, a title that after its release raised the technological barrier to new levels, in terms of pure graphics and narrative exposition, and spurred the Seattle-based developer to improve significantly from this point of view. The love towards the Naughty Dog title can be seen not only from the declarations, but also within inFAMOUS 2 thanks to the quotes and direct references that flow on display among the buildings of the game. In reality, the original title had already impressed us pleasantly, a successful mix of action and platform phases, with a control system among the best in the genre and a narrative system that takes a nice upswing after half the adventure, up to an all-new ending. anything but trivial. With these assumptions and statements it was reasonable to expect a further step forward towards the Olympus of small videogame jewels, unfortunately this was not the case, and inFAMOUS 2, while remaining an excellent game, suffers from some too hasty and unbalanced choices towards one component rather than the other. The vehicle of my power Let's go in order. The events narrated resume those of the original title, where Cole MacGrath had acquired powers related to electricity following a devastating explosion and had restored peace (or chaos, depending on the choices made) within the city of Empire city. In reality, the events were greater than him due to the existence of the Beast, a creature with immense powers that according to a vision would have led to the destruction of all mankind. inFAMOUS 2 begins by telling of a first clash that took place between Cole and the Beast which saw the defeat of the main protagonist, who with the Empire City irreparably destroyed headed for a new city in the southeast of the United States, in an attempt to strengthen his powers and finally put an end to this menace. inFAMOUS 2 therefore takes place in the fictitious city of New Marias (clearly inspired by New Orleans), divided into two large parts separated by the sea and by a gigantic bridge which is not initially accessible. The structure of the game instead takes up the canonical one of free roaming in the third person, where Cole uses the X key to jump and cling to any ledge, wire, window; he can scale buildings and use all of his many powers, which we will come back to later. Dictating the law in a city that in 2004 was already marked by a flood is the militia, a paramilitary organization which, thanks to its leader, Bertrand, has assumed the right to maintain order in the city through unorthodox methods and hunting down the Conduit, individuals capable of conveying different elemental powers in the same way as Cole. Through the map, which can be called up using the select key, various types of missions are available, available progressively according to one's actions and divided into categories. First of all there are the main ones related to the story, which are accompanied by sequences created with the game engine and sometimes instead, as in the first chapter, by animated interludes in American comic style of excellent artistic quality. An ~open~ structure like that of inFAMOUS 2 lends itself well to proposing various secondary missions, obviously not necessary for completing the game but which bring various benefits as a gift. First of all, that of gradually making the city safer in the form of a system of conquest of the territory, which thus allows you to go around the streets a little more undisturbed without having to do your utmost in constant clashes or sudden escapes. Then obviously the possibility of acquiring more experience, which can be spent to obtain and enhance new powers, and which is linked to the development that the player wants to give to his character. Also in this sequel, in fact, the morality factor comes into play, which depends on a whole series of actions that can be taken. The most interesting are those that must be done during the story, on how to deal with certain situations or not, in how one interacts with the citizens of New Marais, given that it is possible to cure them with an electric shock and trap enemies without finishing them or to bio-drain them all without blow to injure or even cause explosions involving even unfortunate innocent people in the vicinity. To support this structure there are a total of 60 secondary missions, some of which belong to the group of good and bad ones, which are mutually exclusive as one is completed and which, in addition to giving a fair amount of experience, affect on the Karma of the protamain agonist. At the top left there is in fact the indicator of Cole's inclination, with Karma divided into three positive blocks, which lead to the level of Hero, and three negative ones, for that of Infamous. Obviously it is not possible to obtain both and the consequences are noticeable on how the citizens react to their passage (asking for help or throwing stones, fleeing or trying to lend a hand), rather than for Cole's physical appearance, clean, healthy and with a celestial aura in the case of good Karma, corrupted, dirty and with a red aura otherwise. Dulcis in fundo, experience points can be spent to enhance powers, some accessible only on the basis of one's Karma level and with slightly different functions. Each of these can be used in conjunction with the L1 key, which acts as a viewfinder, and if for example Cole the Hero uses a single bomb (with the square key) that attaches to people and explodes, the corresponding Infamous one focuses more on destructive power, dropping three. Or again with the triangle key a sort of electrically powered missiles are used, which in the first case are guided towards the heat source, while in the second there are still three without any control other than what comes from the aim. Playstation 3 trophies inFamous 2 offers 52 trophies, of which 9 are silver and 2 are gold. First of all there are those related to the main story, then to collecting all the fragments of the explosion (which are over 300), the audio recordings and obviously the positive and negative choices related to karma. A gold trophy is dedicated to completing the game in hard mode (there are three available) while there is someone also linked to the editor, from creating missions to playing at least 10 of those created by other users. From sunrise to sunset This whole structure would not be valid if it were not supported by an adequate control system with which one immediately becomes familiar. Taking advantage of a feature also of the first inFamous, Sucker Punch has implemented a collision ~correction~ system that allows the player to not be 100% accurate when jumping near ropes or ledges, effectively eliminating the possibility of making ruinous flights on the ground. To quickly manage and interchange the increased number of powers in the possession of the main protagonist (among which the beautiful and devastating Tornado stands out) it is possible to use the digital cross on the left or on the right; to this is added the excellent management of the checkpoints, which allow you to always start over just before the last action you were doing and to concentrate on the real fun. An important novelty is then represented by the supporting actors who accompany Cole MacGrath: beyond Zeke, a faithful friend (not so much judging the events of the first chapter...) who will also be present in this sequel as a support in some moments of the story and companion of chats, we have the two supporting actors Conduit, Kuo and Nix, ice and fire, who at different points fight alongside the main protagonist, and their different ideas on how to tackle certain missions will lead him to make choices towards one or the other other inclination of karma. These sections are among the most entertaining, because the gameplay explodes and becomes spectacular thanks to the remarkable on-screen mess, the aforementioned powers and control system. The action phases in inFAMOUS 2 are in fact really excellent, everything works perfectly, there are no dead spots and each fight is fun, immediate and never tiring, with some giant bosses that help break up the ~standard~ fights even if we are not faced with nothing particularly exciting as the conformation of the environment could instead suggest. Then announced almost as a surprise, the editor is a pleasant addition in terms of longevity, especially if you are not satisfied with the missions that the game has to offer. The list of choices and variables is quite high: it is possible to establish the point and end of a mission, insert objects, checkpoints and enemies up to the texts to give a minimum of history to your creation. There are also several basic logics that allow you to interconnect multiple actions with each other, and each created mission can be saved and made available online for all players, who after completing it can vote for it and add it to their favorites. The nice thing is that these missions appear directly on the game map and in an integrated way through green icons, in this regard the Sucker Punches have chosen a dozen of them from the beta and inserted directly into the game (should also be the case for the distributed version in stores). We have met somesome very nice, including some articulated timed runs for buildings which are inexplicably reduced to the bone in the primary and secondary missions, and which instead would have gone perfectly with the control system. Taking a peek at the vote (tell the truth, you did it immediately after reading the first line of this review) it therefore seems that inFAMOUS 2 is an inferior title to its predecessor... but is it really like that? The answer is no, because although the developer has dramatically improved the technical sector, refined the control system and made the title more epic thanks to the boss fights for example, he has actually lost something from a narrative point of view, with key moments told worse, holes in the narrative and an ending inspired only in the ~mean~ version; but above all in the balance between the various components, where by greatly reducing the platform phase in favor of the action one, the variety of missions has decreased together. In the first chapter there were in fact several huge structures to climb that gave airiness to the gameplay and did justice to the excellent control system, as well as considerable satisfaction in terms of fun. In inFAMOUS 2, on the other hand, it is not possible to find the equivalent of the mega police station, the tower on the landfill rather than the construction site, a real shame considering the numerous possibilities that the game could offer in this sense. Let me be clear, the title developed by Sucker Punch remains extremely enjoyable, fun to complete and long-lived thanks to the new additions (we completed the main story around 12 hours, at 64% completion), but fails to do that much-desired leap in quality two years after the original title. It is from a technical point of view that the greatest steps forward have actually been made, we are faced with a graphics engine that from the very first moment ~shoots~ the video with greater polygonal detail but also better textures and bright colors, giving at the same time greater fluidity and greater impact, thanks also to particle effects, character models and the bosses themselves. There are still some aliasing problems, albeit mitigated, but in general the work done to improve the original title is perfectly successful. New Marias is teeming with neon, people, and detailed buildings, it is particularly beautiful at dusk or dawn and is much more detailed than Empire City, a pity for its flatter structure, also a symptom of a shorter time dedicated to development. From the sound point of view the dynamic music is convincing and does their honest job with some upward peaks, inFAMOUS 2 also confirms the same team of Italian dubbers and the result is among the best in the panorama. The translation of the texts was also spot on and the choice not to always report any English term in Italian, as for the Conduits, which in Italian might have become the Vehicles. Final note, those who played the first inFAMOUS will have a small bonus in terms of experience, energy and inclination of karma, depending on how it was completed.", "date": "2011-05-27", "grade": "8.8"}
