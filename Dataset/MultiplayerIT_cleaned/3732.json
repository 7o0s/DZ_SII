{"name": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-recensione.html", "text": "Shu Takumi, born in 1971, began working in Capcom together with Hidetaka Kamiya in 1994. The collaboration began under the aegis of Shinji Mikami who, after a trial period, decided to place him in charge of the Dino Crisis project. Due to the difficulties encountered during the development of Resident Evil 2, part of the team already working with Shu Takumi is diverted to the famous survival horror, and Dino Crisis is thus completed by a new director. Tukami returns to the control room directing Dino Crisis 2, a game that is so successful that it convinces Capcom to give him carte blanche for his next idea. Instead of immediately aiming high, Shu Takumi is satisfied with a tiny team composed only of a handful of loyalists with whom he carries on the Ace Attorney project, released in Japan on GameBoy Advance in 2001, and three years later in the rest of the world on Nintendo DS. In his homeland success is immediate and overwhelming; here the impact is less unsettling but, thanks to its undeniable quality, Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright in Europe, manages to captivate a sufficient number of fans to transform itself into a cult. Shu Takumi will also take care of the next two sequels himself, completing the trilogy he had in mind and which now, after being re-proposed on Android and iOs a few years ago, also arrives in high definition on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and pc. Objection Phoenix Wright (Gyakuten Saiban the original title) is a simple but damningly effective game: a deadly cross between a visual novel, a typically Japanese genre that does not always involve decisive interaction on the part of the player, and a graphic adventure with an original approach to puzzles and riddles. In the role of defense attorney Phoenix Wright (but not only), the user must first collect the necessary evidence by examining the scenarios made available by each case, and then use them against the prosecution to dismantle the theses. Usually, each case will be divided into three long days in which the investigative part will alternate with that in court. Naturally it is not a simulator, and the law is applied here with simplified rules compared to the real ones; those who study law, and do not have the slightest desire to adapt to the game universe created by Capcom, will inevitably turn up their noses, but all the others will be able to count on an apparent truthfulness perfectly in line with the setting. The investigative parts allow you to move freely between the scenarios which will sometimes reveal further details if visited at different times; here the game is a real graphic adventure with a cursor used to look for details and clues and characters with whom to dialogue and interact also based on the elements that we will have in our evidence inventory. The part in court, on the other hand, is almost entirely played on words, and comes to life once the various witnesses go up to the so-called bar. Each of these tells his version without stopping, once finished the player can use each sentence of the statement to ask further questions (usually pre-arranged) or show evidence that contradicts the details. The different cases, about five for each of the three episodes included in this collection, however, provide for many variations and as many twists and turns that will make each deposition a continuous surprise, as well as a battle that in terms of rhythms, music and graphic effects seems all too similar at a Street Fighter match. Of course you won't see the diligent Phoenix Wright punching the offender to the KO, but the impact of the writing and the twists (and this feeling of punching with intuition and words) convey very similar sensations. Yes, your honor The different cases present in this super package of wonders range in genre and tone, putting us in front of reckless and gloomy murder cases, as well as amusing stories with the most grotesque characters, passing through the inevitable and always effective paranormal thriller. Many of the cases are also linked by a very entertaining and engaging main storyline, even if often perhaps a little too bizarre for those who don't like a certain style of Japanese writing. However, the quality of Shu Takumi's pen should not be questioned: the three games are masterfully written, and the myriad of extras will never have anything to envy to the protagonists in terms of visual characterization and beyond. Phoenix Wright's, also thanks to the debut platform which certainly did not allow a comfortable reading, is a simple, dry writing, but which remains inexplicably rich in nuances and details such as large diamonds. Thanks also to an English translation of primissibut category, here the only one available, so not even this time will you be able to enjoy it in Italian without any external help. A pity, given that with this new wave of releases and a rather modest work behind it, the Italian fans of the Capcom opera could have easily multiplied. This latest version of the original trilogy is essentially the one that has been available on mobile platforms for some time, with some adaptations here and there and a further layer of cleaning to the graphical interface that we do not exclude has already arrived on iOS and Android as well. However everything seems to work wonders, we can't shout into the Objection mic! as we loved to do on DS, but the high resolution with which the scenery and characters are displayed pays off in equal currency. In the graphic update, however, something has been irretrievably lost: the style has undergone some retouching in the contour lines, where in our opinion there is too much revision, and in the colouring, here the victim of that typical and indescribable glossy effect that covers part of the original heat. It must also be said that the resolution of the different laptops for which the three games were designed did not allow the display to be flooded with details, and the general style today appears a bit too simple to fill a 42-inch screen. let alone larger sizes. Most of these glitches fade naturally when played, just like the originals, on the portable Switch.", "date": "2019-04-09", "grade": "8.0"}
