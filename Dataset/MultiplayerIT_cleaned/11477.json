{"name": "Digital Chocolate Caf: Impiccato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/digital-chocolate-cafe-impiccato.html", "text": "Through its virtual Caf, Digital Chocolates have realized the dream of many players of titles on mobile phones, to create a real community in which it is possible to move around with one's own personalized avatar, get to know each other and above all challenge each other in the various titles available; for the record we recall poker, blackjack, solitaire and hanged man. Hangman is one of the oldest and most popular games among students from all over the world, a piece of paper, a pen and a sentence to guess by choosing the right letters, after a few mistakes a gallows with an unfortunate hanged man will appear on the paper. This traditional game has been completely taken over by DChoc who have limited themselves to dividing the phrases into different categories: music, cinema, TV, sport, celebrity and casual. As mentioned, every time we miss the ~call~ of the letter we will see the gallows appear on the screen, the terrible indicator that in no uncertain terms will sanction the moves we can still make before game over. An obvious flaw that we have noticed may be underestimated, whenever we fail to guess the sentence, the A.I. he will provide us with the solution so as not to leave us with doubt. The problem is that by trying again to play in the same category it will be easy to find the same wrong words just before, and this means that passing the level will be a matter of course. There are more than 1000 different indications to hit, so a good variety even if we have to admit that after a few games the repetitiveness is evident. The score bonuses entered by the developers in the case of particular ability to guess the various topics in succession are certainly not sufficient. From a technical point of view, the Digital Chocolate Caf: Impiccato is certainly very nice, particularly colorful and with good animations, graphics that greatly enrich the already valid package offered by the Caf (albeit for a fee). Our opinion is that the Hanged Man is excellent when combined with the other titles available to users of the community created by the developers, playing this new game exclusively is not satisfying enough and after a few games boredom will appear.
