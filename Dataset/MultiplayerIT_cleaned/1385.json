{"name": "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time_b.html", "text": "Xbox Vs GC Like a rolling stone - Combining Prince of Persia with the title of this legendary song by the immense Dylan is easy. Since last November, the Ubisoft home title has been served up in all sorts of ways; and if in this assorted party no one has given up sick, it is also true that latecomers like Xbox and GameCube have made themselves much desired on the European lands. Well, the graphical differences between these two conversions are quite minimal, if not highly negligible. In fact, the Microsoft version differs in slightly greater texture detail and slightly cleaner overall image quality. It being understood that in both versions, the real fulcrum of the graphics sector are the splendid animations of the gymnast prince. Ultimately, to choose which of the two versions to buy, it will be necessary to consider quite other criteria than the almost identical technical realization. Matthew Trinelli From 2d to 3d in one big 128-bit leap The story is quite simple, but intriguing at the same time: in the role of the young Prince of Persia, after our armies have defeated the Maharaja, we will come into possession of two ancient magical artifacts, a dagger and an hourglass. Driven by the Vizier's lust for power, by mistake, we unleash the sands of time using the two magical objects and almost everyone around us turns into horrible creatures, including our father, and here we stop. But we stop in telling it, in reality it is only the beginning of the great adventure that we will live together with the heir of Persia. The whole game looks like a spectacular and never frustrating platform, we will wander through the many levels looking for the right way, the lever to activate, the puzzle to solve. Said like this, it would not seem like anything special, but we must try to imagine our character immersed in an enchanted atmosphere, within a magnificent and spectacular architecture, recreated with the skilful use of polygons and effects. Lost in the magnificent rooms of the Maharaja's palace and the effect of this loss is recreated very well by the panoramic shot that can be activated with the white button of the joypad, which will relegate us to being only a small, very small part of the scenario. So lonely and lost? Well not entirely, given that for most of our adventure we will be accompanied by Princess Farah, who will prove to be a useful ally, not only in battles with her long-range bow, but also in solving the various puzzles we will encounter. By choice of the developers we will never be able to impersonate the Persian pin-up who will remain relegated to a mere non-player character, moreover benefiting from a discreet and functional artificial intelligence, except for rare blackouts which will make it more difficult to coordinate the simultaneous action of the two. The Prince will find himself facing innumerable dangers, often finding the right path will not be difficult, also because he is guided by the cinematic shots that open each new level, but it will be more difficult to proceed in this direction: rotating saws, infinite precipices and all the more common and deadly at the same time. We will only be able to survive thanks to our reflexes and the innate extraordinary skills of the protagonist. Agile the little prince? Feline! Running along the walls in perfect Matrix style, acrobatic somersaults, vaults on the barre and perfect mastery of every movement. Furthermore, we will be helped by the magic dagger which, in addition to being very useful in combat, will allow us to repeat the wrong actions several times, going back in time. The effect is visually beautiful, thanks to the use of blur, and also perfectly integrated into that magical world in which our character struggles, proving to be very useful in the most difficult situations. Furthermore, again thanks to the sands of time, when we reach the checkpoints, where to save, we will be taken by some black and white visions that will show us our near future and the main adversities we are going to face (decidedly cinematic as an idea and really successful ). Everything described above is only a part, certainly relevant, within the game, but that's not all. Indeed, the Ubi Soft title is also full of enemies to face, terrifying as zombies and bad as never before. We will have to use all our skills, combined with those of the dagger, which, if perfected, will allow us to slow down the opponent's movements or to act at incredible speed. The clashes, successful and damned fun, albeit a little frustrating towards the end of the game, make the experience completely rewarding. I'll start from here next time! If the gameplay is really successful and in able to involve for fifteen hours, the graphic part of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is no different. As mentioned before, the architecture of the building and the exterior is excellent, entirely polygonal scenarios rich in details with textures that are bright and never angular, perfectly integrated into a ~grainy-sandy~ aura that magically envelops the entire screen. The shot using the white key, which we mentioned above, gives us thrilling images, not very useful for the purposes of the game, but capable of recreating an unreal atmosphere and taking us back in time to ancient Persia. The camera, in addition to offering panoramic images, can also be used in first person, by pressing the black button, excellent for looking around and grasping what we had missed at first glance. In general, however, the very Hollywood-style shot works well, sometimes unfortunately it does not offer the best perspective, but it is a compromise wanted by the developers to make the experience as cinematic as possible. The prince, harmonious in his movements, has about 750 different animations and the perfect calibration of the controls allows us to exploit all his abilities to the full and without the slightest effort. The polygonal models of the characters are perhaps not made up very complex, but they appear well defined and, compared to the counterpart released for PlayStation 2, some improvements can be seen, such as, just to give an example, the hands of the prince which on Xbox have five fingers recreate each one for itself and not in a single polygonal block. The soundtrack is good and engaging, as are the effects in general, and the idea of making the prince speak in the first person, as if he were telling his adventure, is excellent. It should not be forgotten that the prince, even if from Persia, will express himself with good emphasis and interpretation in the language so dear to us, Italian. Comment Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the best action platformers of the last year and, rightly so, it picked up awards at last E3. In the GameCube and Xbox versions it is confirmed as an excellent title capable of perfectly recreating, innovating it, the spirit of the original two-dimensional Prince of Persia with the only problem of choosing which of the two versions to play. Given the substantial equivalence from a graphic and technical point of view, the marketing price plays a decisive role in favor of the version for the Nintendo console, given that it is sold for  29.90 against  45.90 for the Xbox version, still very palatable. However, regardless of any decision in this regard, the Ubi Soft game is an almost obligatory purchase, given that the new adventures of the Prince cannot be missing from the soft library of any self-respecting gamer. Pros: Fantastic atmosphere Complete immersion Impeccable technical realization Cons: Sometimes not perfect camera Spectacular, but ultimately frustrating fights February 2004, video game enthusiasts, even the youngest, by now know everything about Jordan Mechner, a decidedly inspired game designer who created Prince of Persia in the late '80s, and the long hours of ~archaic-motion capture~ to which he subjected the brother who were the basis for the animations, at the time incredibly fluid of the title. But why did we take this historical information for granted in our preface? Well only because the PlayStation 2 version of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was released in stores no later than two months ago and the many characters used to talk about the Ubi Soft game have already delved into these topics. Instead, we prefer to throw ourselves headlong into the analysis of the Xbox and GameCube versions of the title, so follow us to discover the story of our Prince.", "date": "2004-02-20", "grade": null}
