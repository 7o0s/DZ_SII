Generated in series by a rather cynical alien race absolutely dedicated to research, the protagonists (in the plural, because one dies in each game) of the action RPG developed by Kitfox Games access a teleporter which projects them from time to time into a different world, all to explore, full of treasures to discover but at the same time of terrible dangers. Studying a species we've never seen before can certainly be interesting...until maybe it opens its jaws and tries to devour us. This is the type of situation to which we are exposed in the game, strengthened by a survival structure in which progress remains confined to a single expedition, but which leaves a memory in our character's DNA that can be handed down, in this case the credits collected in the field and expendable to improve the physical characteristics of the clone. In the same way, crystals can be spent, which are inserted into a sort of space slot machine that returns random objects, of more or less high value depending on the investment: helmets, bombs, little monsters and above all clubs, swords and hammers capable of make our offensive much more effective. Shattered Planet is a well-crafted roguelike action-RPG that's free to play and full of things to discover The whole world has him We said that the life of a clone is short, but in Shattered Planet you can at least choose which death to die. The teleportation device is in fact calibrated to project us into different categories of planets, increasingly less hospitable and therefore with a greater incidence in terms of hostile creatures. It is useless to immediately attempt a sortie in the most advanced areas, because we would only survive for a few moments: the time to catch a powerful alien slap. The survival spirit of the experience, corroborated by the growth system and a great emphasis on looting, pushes us to start calmly, exploring the less dangerous planets and trying to last as long as possible, moving from one teleport to another and scraping together a small treasure in credits and crystals that we can then spend once we die... er, once we're back on the ship. The control system adopted by Kitfox Games is completely based on the touch screen and works simply by touching the box we want to reach, while in the same way it is enough to touch an enemy to attack him in a turn-based sequence, provided he is in an area adjacent to the our. The visual rendering of this system, which is renewed with each game thanks to the presence of random values for the generation of the scenarios and the placement of the creatures, relies on a clean graphic style, sometimes cartoonish, but characterized by mechanical movements. In the end, the picture that is outlined is that of an interesting product, capable of creating a certain addiction, usable for free without the inevitable in-app purchases proving to be fundamental or placed there in an annoying way.", "date": "2014-04-09", "grade": "7.6"}
