{"name": "Saturnalia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saturnalia-recensione.html", "text": "In Roman times the Saturnalia lasted about seven days and, in addition to being characterized by large banquets, the exchange of gifts, shows and a general atmosphere that today we would define as carnivalesque, they saw the temporary overthrow of the social order, with the slaves who, wearing the pilleo, i.e. the cap of the freedmen, could behave like free men at the tables of the masters, obtaining the right to express themselves as they wished. Despite the apparently relaxed atmosphere, it was an essentially religious festival, which celebrated the arrival of winter (it took place around the winter solstice, between 17 and 23 December) and which exorcised many of the fears of men of the time, both to foresee a specific greeting among the participants: ~I Saturnalia~. Seneca speaks of a city that ~sudat~ during the festive period, complaining about the dissoluteness of the customs (after the religious rites of the first day, it seems that the Romans enjoyed themselves quite a bit, between orgiastic parties and unbridled, cheerful and transgressive activities) and the fact that many, in the periods leading up to the event, dedicated more energy to organizing it than to working. It seems that the saturnalia were born to celebrate the god Saturn and his happy kingdom now gone, bearer of abundance in the crops without the need to sweat on the fields, god who appeared in the form of a red mask during the party, entrusted to a ~princes~, that is, to one of the revelers chosen for the occasion. The exchange of gifts served to appease him and the other infernal deities who during those days were thought to wander among men (Pluto and Proserpina). What does all this have to do with the review of Saturnalia? You may be wondering. Obviously our goal is not to write a page on a fragment of the culture of ancient Rome, but to give as many references as possible to understand the work of Santa Ragione, who intertwines with great historical knowledge, myth and social vision, transporting us to a Deep and mysterious Sardinia, where ancient rituals mix with modern themes such as labor exploitation and the fight against patriarchy, but also with other more classic ones concerning the family and interpersonal relationships. Mysterious Sardinia The landscapes of Saturnalia are very ~Italian~, despite the maps being procedurally generated It is no coincidence that Saturnalia is set on December 21, 1989. We are in the imaginary village of Gravoi, procedurally generated at the beginning of the game, where however many real places are recognizable, such as the Mining Art Museum of Iglesias, Su Nuraxi of Barumini ( an archaeological site protected by Unesco), Porto Flavia and the Castle of Serravalle, just to name a few. It is as if Pietro Righi Riva and his cohorts had wanted to concentrate a large portion of Sardinian geography in one place, probably also thanks to the involvement of regional politics. In reality, the entire game shows a very careful search for the local culture, audible in the soundtrack, made up of songs from the Sardinian tradition, and visible even in the most minute architectures of Gravoi. Even the interiors of the houses reflect this profound desire for verisimilitude, between objects and the construction of the environments, which is not a little surprising, considering the mutability of the map. There are also period references, such as a man who lives in an iron lung or some electoral posters, including one by Bettino Craxi (perhaps a quote from Thief: The Dark Project?). But what does Saturnalia tell us? We are in the middle of the winter solstice and in the town of Gravoi the feast of Santa Lucia is about to take place, which in addition to the Catholic religious rites, also includes a parade in the style of the Barbagia carnival (do you know the mamuthones with Mamoiada masks? ). It is here that the stories of different characters intertwine: a pregnant girl who wants to leave the village taking her child with her, a boy who has returned after years of absence who fights with drugs, a photojournalist in search of his father who disappeared years earlier and a girl with family problems. Gravoi is a real labyrinth that hides more than it seems. In fact, on the evening of the party, strange presences begin to appear and disturbing things happen. The only ways to survive seem to be to escape or dig deep and stop an ancient ritual, but not before solving the many mysteries surrounding the country and its inhabitants. All this translates into a third-person investigative survival horror, in which you have to go around the country solving puzzles and avoiding being killed by the presences that populate it, which appear from time to time and start actively looking for the character guided by the player. making some really scary sounds. Game structureIn Saturnalia there is also room for Bettino Craxi Saturnalia has a very interesting game structure. Although, as already mentioned, it has a survival horror soul, the player finds himself faced with a kind of sandbox adventure, in which he can decide from time to time, through a kind of spontaneous selection that takes place directly in the gameplay, which characters to drive and which goals to pursue. Going around Gravoi and visiting the various places, in fact, you will find documents and objects that unlock missions related to individual characters or to the whole group, such as finding some tools or turning on the lights of the large mine located under the town. There are no obligations related to which ones to face first and which ones to face later, apart from some urgencies and the ending, so you are free to go wherever you want and discover the clues you need to solve the various mysteries in the order you prefer . Cleverly, the game collects all the discoveries made in a kind of concept map that can be consulted at any time, in which all the links between the clues can be seen. The exploration of Gravoi also provides aids: the characters can remember the direction of the place they are going to by observing the maps scattered around the country. Survival horror Saturnalia has a very peculiar atmosphere Of course there is also the creature to consider, the classic immortal stalker who has the sole objective of killing us. Wandering through the game environments it is inevitable to meet her. The characters have no way of defending themselves, so they can only flee like hell, at least as long as the stamina bar holds, evade her perhaps hiding in some wardrobe, in a confessional or wherever there is enough space, or distract her using firecrackers to attract her his attention and then sneak off in the opposite direction. If you wish, you can also use the flash of the supplied instant camera, the negatives of which can be bought around the country, to blind her briefly. There is also space for the reference to the first game by Santa Ragione, Fotonica Consider that a killed character can't come back to life, so it's not obvious that you'll reach the end of the adventure every game. If all characters die, a new Gravoi is generated and the game starts again. The creature makes exploration particularly tense, also considering the particular graphic style of Saturnalia, which applies the cross-hatch technique to 3D graphics. Visually, the game is made up of very clear-cut chromatisms, almost like spots of color that break up the texture of black and white, with dense purplish mists and dark areas that can only be tackled with matches, sometimes the only available light source, which partially occlude the view. The overall effect is not only pleasant, because it manages to create a great atmosphere, but gives the game a strong stylistic personality, magnified by the use of techniques that are not very popular these days in the world of video games, such as rotoscoping animations (you know Prince of Persia?). An experience to do Despite being procedurally generated, Gravoi can offer some really beautiful glimpses Overall Saturnalia works and manages to captivate until the end, thanks above all to its open structure, which makes the story replayable several times without ever appearing heavy or too repetitive. Some mechanics seem a bit sketchy, such as the possibility of ducking when approaching walls, which doesn't always work as it should, but in general we liked it very much for being able to propose an original story, linked to local traditions, but at the same time universal, going to solve one of the problems of Wheels of Aurelia, the previous title of Santa Ragione, which was far too ~Italian~ in content, so much so that it was difficult to understand by those who did not know a bit of local history (including Italians). It should be noted that the game will be given away by the Epic Games Store for a week. So on PC it will be playable without spending anything. In short, you really have no reason not to try it.", "date": "2022-10-27", "grade": "8.5"}
