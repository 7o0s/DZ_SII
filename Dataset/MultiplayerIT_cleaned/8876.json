The winner of the IGF 2007, originally developed by Bit-Blot on PC, tells the adventure of Naija, a sea creature willing to spend all of herself to discover the truth behind her own history and that of the civilization to which she belongs. The great starting point for an experience that from a playful point of view settles in already well-excavated grooves is the underwater setting that has been celebrated since the first release as well blended with both the gameplay and the technical realization. In short, this is the port of a game that was already positively received some time ago and of which therefore it is not the quality in an absolute sense that intrigues, but rather the effectiveness in converting its mechanics to the iPad touchscreen. Device for which this version is sold exclusively for 3.99 euros. Will it be worth dipping your fingertip into damp caves and insidious monsters? Submarine song While the term metroidvania is not exceptionally beautiful or elegant, it is also a perfect summary of the type of adventure that Aquaria has permutated from the various Castlevania and Metroid. By moving your finger on the screen, we move Naija and accompany her in the exploration of the underwater tunnels that make up an articulated game world, initially unsettling and gradually more and more open to the acquisition of new skills. There are all the typical elements of the genre: new powers and attacks, enemies in quantity, blocked areas to return to later and a not too annoying backtracking that stimulates you to move from one corner of the map to another. Those who have eyes and ears to appreciate the quality of the 2D images and the sound accompaniment, really well cared for, will be more than satisfied with the (little) money spent even just putting the artistic realization on the scales. From a technical point of view we can say we are equally satisfied, with the iPad 2 on which we tested it which allowed us to play smoothly and without any kind of delay in input management. More problematic - and here the donkey falls in part - the management of the controls: tracing the trajectories of Naija with the index finger is practical and natural, much less directing the attacks from a distance, to the point that in the most complicated situations the action becomes quickly frustrating. A problem of speed and accuracy that would have required a deeper conversion work. As it is, Aquaria is by no means unplayable and for most of the hours needed to complete it you won't have major problems, but those who are particularly sensitive to the perfect balance of each situation will come up against passages that are less convincing than others. The process of acquiring and using new skills, such as that of moving certain objects, transforming or illuminating areas otherwise hidden by an impenetrable darkness, is linked to the execution of short pieces of music, to be played by selecting the correct notes. An idea that is not new but very atmospheric that joins other mechanics, such as simple crafting, which contribute to putting more meat on the fire. There are some minor problems, such as an interface that is not always very elegant, but overall the level of production is high and differs from the hit and run experience on which a large part of the mobile offer is concentrated.
