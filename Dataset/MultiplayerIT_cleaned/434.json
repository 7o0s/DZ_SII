{"name": "Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-liberty-city-stories-4.html", "text": "GTA for everyone With a rather original choice, in sharp contrast with the vast majority of other software houses, Rockstar Games has decided to convert the aforementioned Liberty City Stories from PSP to Ps2, in order to allow even those who do not own the Sony laptop to enjoy of the adventure created by the Leeds studio. Yes, because the team authoring this chapter is not the same as the main series, since the latter has been engaged for several months in the GTA project on Ps3. As already suggested, Liberty City Stories is based on the first two episodes, and is therefore devoid of the changes that characterized San Andreas in its game structure; so forget about being able to swim in the water, or to use the weapons or means of transport that only appeared in the last incarnation for Ps2. Similarly, it is not possible to manage the protagonist's clothing in depth, which is limited instead to the choice of a series of pre-established sets. The origins in the project on the PSP determined some choices in the game mechanics in order to make it more suitable for use on a laptop; this is resolved above all in the presence of missions for the most part short and with a linear structure, which can be completed in a matter of minutes. The story, we have already said on the occasion of the review on PSP and for the preview of this ~new~ incarnation, largely follows the clichs of the series despite having been written specifically for the occasion; the player's alter ego goes by the name of Tony Cipriani, a no-good gangster employed by the Leone mafia family for a whole series of illegal missions aimed at gaining control of the city. Obviously the undertaking will not be the easiest, given the presence of other families with the same intentions and anything but disposed to a peaceful and collaborative coexistence. A good dose of deja-vu and a progression without particular twists makes the plot not exactly unforgettable, even if its function within the game economy is not particularly decisive. We sincerely believe it is useless to explain what kind of game GTA is, since the enormous success of Rockstar Games production has made it one of the most popular and well-known titles of recent years. Take me to Ps2 Already at the time of the test on the original version, even with a full promotion, we had underlined among the defects the fact that the series was beginning to feel the weight of the years, especially in a version -like that of Liberty City Stories-, which in fact it is based on the mechanics of the first two episodes. The passing of the months has unfortunately not made us change our mind, and indeed the passage on a home console has brought with it some side effects that are not insignificant. In this case, in fact, the judgment obviously cannot be influenced by the enthusiasm for the technical goals also achieved with the exciting PSP version, nor can the structural choices be found perfectly at ease, such as the aforementioned brevity of the missions, which on the contrary found full justification from the point of view of use on a handheld. playing Liberty City Stories on Ps2 can only leave a subtle taste of retrogaming, effectively representing a step backwards in the evolutionary chain studied by Rockstar Games and created with San Andreas. As far as the aesthetic aspect is concerned, the desire to make this conversion a direct porting, without touching anything or almost nothing of the original, is evident; unfortunately, however, as is obvious, what turned out to be exciting and particularly attractive on the small PSP screen is not exactly the same once viewed on home screens of quite different sizes. In fact, the programmers limited themselves to adding a few meters of visual depth and little else, but in fact these are details that are almost impossible to perceive; on the contrary, what is rather evident is the unjustified and unjustifiable uncertainty of the frame rate, unfortunately shaky on more than one occasion despite the Sony hardware being far from pushed to its limits. The textures are also mediocre, very far from those, already certainly not impeccable, seen in the aforementioned San Andreas. Where, on the other hand, there is nothing to complain about is in the sound, the strong point of the entire franchise; excellent voiceovers for all the characters are in fact accompanied by a robust and varied tracklist taken from the late 90s, thanks to the different radio stations available. Nothing to do instead for the multiplayer mode, which was mercilessly eliminated thus remaining a PSP exclusive; conversely, on Ps2 the presence of the second analog stick determines a definitely superior control system. Comment Porting a game from PSP to Ps2 isfrankly an event that it would be difficult to define electrifying, and unfortunately on balance not even the GTA name on the cover manages to reverse this premise. Liberty City Stories on the Sony handheld was an outstanding example of programming and technique, but not exactly the pinnacle of the series in terms of content and story. Transported to Ps2 in an absolutely direct way, the Rockstar Games product proves to be a game capable of entertaining fans of the series above all, but which, when compared with San Andreas, undoubtedly demonstrates the enormous progress made over the years. The budget selling price, which in our opinion would have been anything but implicit for many other software houses, however demonstrates how the same manufacturer has a clear understanding of the value of Liberty City Stories in a Ps2 key, and at the same time underlines its respect towards of consumers. For about twenty euros, we feel like quoting the timeless Iva Zanicchi: OK Rockstar, the price is right. Pros Budget price As entertaining as ever Rich longevity Cons Disappointing direct conversion Useless if already played on PSP Hard to digest after San Andreas If we were to indicate the games of the console generation that is about to end that have had the most impact on the industry, surely Grand Theft Auto would deserve one of the most prominent places. After the first 2D episodes for PC and PSone that only hinted at the potential of the series, the turnaround in three dimensions has unleashed an authentic phenomenon capable of selling millions of copies with growing success in its three incarnations for home consoles. The latest installment in the Rockstar Games franchise has embraced the handheld cause by appearing on the PSP; titled Liberty City Stories, it was actually a spin-off of the first PS2 chapter, set in the same city, with a completely new story and some gameplay changes taken from Vice City.", "date": "2006-06-20", "grade": null}
