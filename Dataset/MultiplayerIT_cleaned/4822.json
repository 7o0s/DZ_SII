{"name": "ARMS: i pugni nelle mani", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/184108-arms-arms-i-pugni-nelle-mani.html", "text": "One ring, three rounds and an opponent to knock out before time runs out. At first glance there would be little doubt that ARMS is in all respects a fighting game, yet Nintendo's new intellectual property, just like Splatoon, is so out of the box that it is hard to place it in a single genre. Even the game's producer, Kosuke Yabuki, last January seemed clumsy in trying to explain for the first time what it was that made it unique. During the presentation of Switch he described it as ~a combat sport where you punch like in boxing but aim and shoot like in a shooter~. If you still don't understand, don't worry. After all, it's not every day you see a multiplayer game where the object is to hit your opponent with oversized boxing gloves attached to the ends of two extendable arms that look like springs, ribbons and spaghetti. critical art In a fighting game like Injustice 2, before being able to tackle the campaign the player is asked to go through a long, complicated and tedious tutorial in which to perform (and possibly memorize) a whole series of combos, reversals, special techniques and aerial attacks. You are inundated with a great deal of information, and in the end it feels like you've only scratched Batman's moveset. In full Nintendo style, ARMS is at the opposite end: there are no input sequences to execute with surgical precision, nor long combos to memorize. A tutorial lasting just one minute allows you to know the few but fundamental commands that you will need in all future challenges. Holding a Joy-Con in each hand, you move by tilting both controllers in a certain direction, while flicking forward to throw a punch. By rotating the wrist during an attack it is also possible to curve its trajectory, so as to adjust its direction or chase the opponent while he tries to dodge. By moving both Joy-Con forward you perform a grip, crossing them you put yourself in a block position, where jumps and dodges are entrusted to back buttons. There's nothing else to know, and already in the first game this control system seems decidedly natural. Every movement, punch and flick of the wrist is reflected spontaneously within the game, and right away you feel in absolute harmony with your avatar. Mistakes, when they occur, don't seem to be related to Joy-Con accuracy issues, but to the player, who panics and moves recklessly in the most electrifying moments. Those who hate the idea of throwing themselves in a fighting game always have the option of using sticks and keys in the traditional way. Everything works properly and is just as precise, but in this case a little freedom is lost: the left stick controls both the angle of the punches and the movement of the character, and for this reason it is not possible to move in one direction and throw a hit in the other. Similarly, with Joy-Con you can control the effect and direction of both punches independently, while with traditional controls you have to wait for the first one to reach its maximum extension. Whether played with motion sensors or classic controls, ARMS is approachable and intuitive, but don't mistake it for a spruced-up version of Wii Boxing, because under the guise of a family game lies a very deep title. ARMS starts from the A-B-C of fighting games, following the ~rock, paper, scissors~ formula that traditionally links punches, parries and grappling. Throwing a blow means remaining vulnerable until the arm is retracted, and so every single move must be studied carefully. When comparing ARMS to boxing, Yabuki didn't do it by accident. The skill in the game doesn't lie in executing combos, but in using your head, studying your opponent and adapting your strategy to his style. Matches between more experienced players will mostly end as time runs out because, just like boxing, ARMS is a game with its own rhythm, where you move methodically, try to have a solid defense and fight back with responsiveness as soon as openings are created. This hand can be iron and it can be feather The ability to use and control the two arms independently is not only the beating heart of the entire combat system, but it is also the most brilliant aspect of the game. For example, you can attack with one arm to push the opponent to move in one direction, and then chase him with a second blow. A punch can be used to interrupt an opponent's attack or penetrate a hold. Best of all, each arm can be equipped withweapons that give special characteristics to each attack. There are slow and powerful ones or quick and weak ones, long-range weapons or gauntlets whose trajectory is easier to control; there are shields, whips, missiles and shots that bounce unpredictably; some weapons freeze the opponent, others paralyze his arms, still others throw him in the air or obscure his vision for a few seconds. Considering that all weapons can be unlocked and used with any character, it will be possible to experiment with an enormous amount of combinations, looking for the one that best suits your style or that best balances your character's weaknesses. Mechanica is the classic strong but slow giant, but the right combination of weapons could make it effective against even the most agile characters. In contrast Min-Min, fast but not too powerful, can transform into a hopping tank that fires six missiles at a time. In ARMS it thus becomes essential to know not only the different fighters, but also the individual weapons, their characteristics and range. The way a character is used and the strategy adopted changes drastically depending on the equipment, and one eye on the opponent is enough to understand what his approach could be. A Kid Cobra with long range weapons will tend to keep his distance and control the match from afar. The same character, armed with a shield and a slow weapon, will surely try to stick to the opponent. This obviously raises more than one eyebrow on the balance issue, but from what we've seen so far any combination of characters and weapons can be countered with the right strategy. However, it is perplexing how these weapons are to be unlocked. Every time you win a match you receive coins to spend in the Palio delle Armi, a minigame in which you can get new equipment completely at random (a bit like the Overwatch chests). If a duplicate comes out, the weapon in question transforms into its ~Plus~ version, almost identical but capable of causing more damage. At the time of writing this article, these upgraded weapons can be used safely in online friendlies and ranked matches, a questionable choice and one that we hope will be corrected with one of the first patches of the game. Inglourious heroes In the days preceding the arrival in stores, the official ARMS Twitter account began to spread some information and curiosities about the history of the characters and the game universe. In a tweet we read how the mask that each fighter wears is a tool to stabilize the extendable qualities of the arms; another message tells how scientific experiments on arms date back centuries and centuries before the game. Too bad that none of this is mentioned in the ARMS single player, just hinting at the background of the characters but leaving everything to the imagination of the fans. Weapons of mass As in any fighting game, the charisma of ARMS is expressed above all through the roster of fighters. These are ten very stereotypical characters, whose design is clearly inspired by objects that extend or stretch. Min-Min is an oriental girl who runs a ramen shop, and of course her arms are long noodles; Ninjara attacks with a pair of long chains, while Ribbon Girl is a pop star who uses ribbons. The rest is a carnival of bandages, springs, snakes, braids and jellies, with more fighters being introduced for free in the coming months. As expected, each character belongs to a classic archetype, has different characteristics and is equipped with special abilities. The currently available arenas are also designed to accentuate the mobility of the fighters and stimulate certain strategies: the smaller scenarios make ranged weapons almost useless, others have trampolines to jump on or columns to protect behind. From time to time, items appear that allow you to regenerate health or the indicator of the special attack and which add a little unpredictability to the match (but which can be deactivated if you prefer an unaided clash). In terms of content and game options, ARMS at launch is however quite essential. The single player experience is limited to the Grand Tournament, a succession of 10 matches that can be played in one of seven difficulty levels and which is preparatory for accessing online ranked matches. Both in multiplayer and alone, modes such as Volleyball, Basketball or Target Shooting give the impression of being simple mini-games useful for breaking the rhythmor between matches. Teamfights can then prove to be the most fun or the most frustrating online experience, depending on whether you're playing with a friend or a stranger. The two members of each team are in fact bound by a rope, which stimulates a tactical and collaborative approach between two friends (especially if they have the opportunity to communicate with each other in person), but it is the cause of uncontrolled fits of anger when the partner team keeps interrupting your attacks or gets thrown left and right pulling you along with him. Whether you're playing against a friend locally or an opponent online, it's obvious that ARMS's strong point is fighting against another real-life player, and it's a shame that Nintendo's fighting game arrives at launch without a number of features that stimulate you to compete online or to improve yourself. A rank system is barely hinted at, while any kind of online ranking is missing; there is no spectator mode nor is it possible to see other players' replays. Unlike Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, then, you can't view your stats and performances or send any type of message or emoticon to your opponent, let alone create small head-to-head tournaments like in Super Smash Bros. The hope is that, like was with the original version of Splatoon, Nintendo keeps its promise to enrich ARMS in the coming months through new modes, unpublished content and live initiatives capable of extending the life of the game well beyond the summer period. +89", "date": "2017-06-07", "grade": "8.0"}
