This in itself does not make it the absolute masterpiece of the beat'em ups, but it explains well why it is extremely revered by ~geeks~ from all over the planet, always looking for quality products, possibly rare and complicated, even better if equipped with a fantasy or sci-fi setting: both Dungeons & Dragons included in this remake, i.e. Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara, satisfy every characteristic just listed. To take care of the reissue was Iron Galaxy who, despite the unspecified problems with the Wii U version, finally managed to bring this pearl to Nintendo consoles as well, without any loss of quality. Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara, this is the name of the collection, adds to the originals all the polishes that a kid who grew up on bread and Xbox360 could expect: many extras and unlockable contents, a plethora of objectives, replayability of each completed stage, arbitrary difficulty and above all, online multiplayer and high definition graphics. D&D interpreted by the golden age of Capcom. With hordes of monsters to kill. Need anything else? Straight from the 90s Let's dwell for a moment on the last point, high definition and, in general, the visual aspect. With a brief specification: what we write essentially applies to both Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara, with the slight difference that in the second one everything is done a little better, and all those ~little bits~, added together, generate a considerable waste. However, the main characteristics are common to both titles, so it would be prurient to talk about them separately. In general, when the series peeked out among the arcades of the 90s, it immediately distinguished itself from its peers for the valuable graphic component: for the size of the characters and for the quality of the animations, but above all, this everlasting gift, for the graphic style and the overall design of the product. The anatomical constructions and color palettes were made with exceptional taste and skill, as only Capcom could (can?) afford. And everything has remained miraculously beautiful and refined, now translated into HD, with the possibility of managing the screen to one's liking, stretching it to 16:9, playing via gamepad (with excellent chromatisms, a detail often underestimated), or simply keeping the original format, with various options for distributing the frame. The games dedicated to Dungeons & Dragons visually often get lost in the sea of banality, with an anonymous graphic design, subject to the freedom of customization left to the user: also in this case Capcom circumvents the problem, proposing its own strong, powerful interpretative key ( one of the most incisive among those linked to the brand), coincidentally by inserting characters that are so different, but already well defined. Between swords and magic There are therefore various classes, as is to be expected from a game based on Dungeons & Dragons, but they are linked to a specific character: among wizards, for example, the race cannot be selected. No, there is only the wizard proposed by Capcom, the thief, the dwarf and the elf (witch) already preset. All for the sake of characterization, of course. The game is a traditional beat'em up, with the stages to be traversed from left to right (quite short, actually), hordes of enemies and bosses at the end of the level, with various sprinkles of RPG: lots of items to collect, spells and secondary weapons . The fact that the same button is used to attack and withdraw objects is a bit annoying, otherwise the control system is perfect, in terms of immediacy and complexity: the basic attack can be declined in various ways, both by pressing the button repeatedly and simultaneously with the directional cross (there is also the half moon in Street Fighter style), the secondary object is chosen with a button and used with the one next to it, so as to optimize the times, and includes spells, potions, weapons and shield . Yes, the shield leads us directly to the main problem of this work: the defense is very well done, reactive like the rest, and it is the prerogative of the fighters, much more skilled at not getting hit than the magicians. But, if already in the original game the most obvious flaw was the imbalance in favor of magical characters (not only for the damage inflicted, but also for the stasis that accompanies the preparation of the spell), everything is exacerbated by the infinite lives granted in this home version. If you simply aim to finish the game, just reselect the magician after each death and reuse the entire roster of spells, not even caring about the patterns of the enemies: an execrable approach that tears apart the soul of the game, and that no one should undertake, but which is protected by the title, and therefore should be reported . This is undoubtedly the biggest flaw in the product. As expected, the game gives its best in multiplayer, a mode that contemplates up to four users, even online: pleonastic to add that, although there are no technical difficulties, from this point of view the Wii U version is the least suitable. Finding partners online is, for now, a difficult task.", "date": "2013-09-26", "grade": "8.0"}
