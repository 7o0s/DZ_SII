Instead of suffering this bizarre and uncomfortable situation in a negative way, the two decide to happily embark on an adventure and go through a whole series of scenarios avoiding obstacles and collecting as many bones as possible. This is the incipit of the present Tongue Tied! by Mojo Bones, which under this skin of absurdity hides a platform of excellent workmanship. Dynamic duo Like any good self-respecting mobile title, Tongue Tied! it rests on extremely simple mechanics, which however manage not to be stale thanks to the joint intervention of all the other key elements of the gameplay. The user's task is to help Mick and Ralph reach the end of the 60 levels included in the application, combining the foundations of the platform with a curious and effective exploitation of physics. The peculiar bond that unites the two protagonist dogs is in fact the leitmotif on which the whole experience is based, and which demonstrates a remarkable solidity despite the bizarre premises. With a few simple interactions with the touchscreen it is possible to make the unlikely duo carry out all the moves necessary for their survival: dragging a puppy and releasing it produces an elastic effect which has the double effect of making him and his companion splash on the side opposite and destroy the containers full of bones that are along the way; instead, just a tap and the selected quadruped will drop itself using its tongue like a liana, and from here it will be possible to drag it on the screen to make it reach the furthest bonuses. These basic commands can be combined in a whole series of real tricks (illustrated by a special section of the main menu) that allow you to increase your score, the real engine of the gaming experience. Already numerically rich in internships characterized by a challenge rate that is anything but trivial, Tongue Tied! it gives further motivation to anyone wishing to embark on the arduous task of obtaining the gold medal at all levels: it is a stimulating challenge which however highlights the -few- defects of the Mojo Bones product. The level design is appreciable but seems to rely too frequently on the trial and error ploy, while the control system is not always very reliable, and it happens, for example, that the start of a swipe is mistaken for a tap resulting in a game over . Nothing that could seriously affect the pleasure of the action, but these two reasons could bring a lot of frustration to those who set out in search of the best scores. At the current price at which it is sold, however, it is really difficult not to recommend Tongue Tied!, if only for its remarkable production values: in fact, the 60 levels are accompanied by over 30 challenges relating to the same stages and a delightful technical realization. The graphic style recalls that of the Hanna & Barbera cartoons, especially as regards the two protagonists, very convincing in their look and animations: the sound is also good, especially with regard to the absolutely themed music with tones of cosmetics.
