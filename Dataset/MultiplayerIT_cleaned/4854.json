Among the various islets, the island of those who love fighting games has certainly not had the problem of dry weather lately, but that of the waves yes, and these hit the coast by forcefully dragging away dreams and wooden houses in the form of DLCs and models dubious commercials. It really doesn't matter which god fans rely on: Capcom? Street Fighter V and its launch we all remember; NetherRealm? Remarkable content for the release but an aggressive DLC model that is practically taken for granted immediately afterwards ... and then there is Arc System Works, a house that is nothing short of renowned among fans of Japanese fighting games, which however has always had a vice that places it in the middle between the two software houses mentioned above. The blessed Arc System, in fact, create titles of excellent quality within the genre, only to then update them from year to year by dint of perfected versions with a few more characters, with all due respect to their users. Expecting a long phase of stability from the house's titles is therefore now utopia, and the custom has reached the point of making their extraordinary works perceived in part negatively, which reached their climax with Guilty Gear Xrd and its improved version, Revelator, which we reviewed not too long ago. And punctual as taxes, yet another revision of the title has arrived among us, Guilty Gear Xrd REV 2, which adds two characters and further revises a system already refined like few others. This time Arc System must have sensed some discontent among players though, because REV 2 doesn't hit stores following the team's usual sales strategy. Guilty Gear Xrd REV 2 doesn't add much to Revelator, but perfects a great game: the review! The missing piece, but not the final one Let's immediately clarify Arc's new move on the fighting game chessboard: if you already own Revelator, REV 2 will be available for purchase in the form of an update for around twenty euros, while if you don't have the predecessor in your PlayStation library you will find it for a lower price than usual, around forty euros. This is undoubtedly a clever tactic, especially if we consider that - where Revelator still represented a substantial sequel to Guilty Gear Xrd - the new born of the house does not put a large abundance of content on the plate. After all, the fulcrum of the operation are, in fact, two new fighters: Baiken, an old acquaintance of the series much loved by fans, and Answer, a ninja in a suit and tie linked to Chipp and completely unpublished. Both, to be honest, are almost worth the cost of the ticket alone, because Arc System's mastery in creating playable characters has now reached frightening levels, and once again we are faced with absolutely exhilarating warriors to learn how to use to the fullest extent. their potential. Let's take Baiken for example: it takes up the vast majority of the moves from the past incarnations of the character, but must be managed almost entirely around a mixture of sudden countermoves and dry blows with very high damage; oozes power and evil from every pore, resulting damn adrenaline to use. Answer, for its part, closely resembles Bang from Blazblue, thanks to the ability to dash from talisman to talisman and extreme mobility; however, it maintains a strong uniqueness and boasts a fighting style that is really difficult to predict. One could criticize the use of elements already seen in the series or in other games of the house for the new characters, but the doubts disappear when you try them for a few hours: their arrival represents a necessary piece in our opinion to give even more variety to an already textbook roster. That's not all that REV 2 brings to the table, however. Tweaking the punches When it comes to actual content, REV 2 balances most of the characters, minimally tweaking the complex combat system on which it is based (but without real changes to the mechanics compared to the predecessor). However, at the moment, discussing more marginal modifications or imbalances between warriors is useless - months of tests are needed before understanding whether or not the work done is adequate - therefore it is appropriate to consider the most evident modification: an increase in the time for enter move inputs after activating the Roman Cancel. Small digression, for those who don't have the faintest idea of what we are talking about: the Roman Cancel is a technique that allows Guilty Gear to interrupt moves with a specific timing, in order to lengthen the combinations, recover any errori made in attack or exploit specific special attacks to put more pressure on the opponent during the offensive. Xrd was already the most accessible of the Guilty Gear due to the time allowed for the execution of the moves during the Cancel, but REV 2 improves things further, making it practically possible for anyone to exploit it in the most disparate ways thanks to a few additional moments. For heaven's sake, keep in mind that Guilty Gear Xrd REV 2 is not a fighting game for beginners: despite having a very accessible combo system that allows you to easily put together series of basic hits (and bringing with you a ~simplified mode~ from Revelator that facilitates the execution of special moves enormously) boasts a frightening variety of maneuvers, and it can be traumatic to see the difference in skill between a novice and an expert player online. Having said that, however, it remains a suitable choice for someone who really wants to learn the art of 2D fighting games, because in addition to not requiring cobra-like reflexes to execute effective combinations, it contains one of the best tutorials ever seen, complete with thoughtful challenges to learn how to contrast individual characters and learn the fundamental foundation for every other exponent of the genre. Barrel with interest Apart from these minor changes and the two additions to the roster, REV 2 has just one more gift for fans: an extra piece of campaign. We've already told you how the game's Story Mode isn't its high point; it is still a sort of very complex anime, difficult to follow for those who are not big fans of the series - although there is no lack of an encyclopedia of sorts to explain its peculiarities - and without playable segments. Here, REV 2 does not improve things in any way, but in addition to offering arcade modes dedicated to Baiken and Answer, it attacks a new final scene to the story, which... is unfortunately not conclusive. So don't expect a total closure of the events of Sol, Ky and company, at least another revision is to be expected before the complete package (predictable anyway, given that various historical characters of the saga are still missing despite appearing in various animated scenes). We close with the online, which unfortunately we have not been able to test in particular detail given that the lobbies are practically deserted before the release of the title, but it has proved to be more than stable in the few matches we have faced. REV 2 doesn't even revolutionize the curious ~social~ structure of the lobbies and rooms, complete with cute customizable humanoids that roam the maps, yet it should have solved the problems that the former gave during certain games when too full. Otherwise the netcode has remained virtually identical, so expect extremely similar performance to Revelator while beating people online. As usual, however, no protests regarding the technical sector, always a wonderful lesson in the use of cel shading, capable of making the 3D models of the characters look like moving drawings of rare beauty.", "date": "2017-05-24", "grade": "8.2"}
