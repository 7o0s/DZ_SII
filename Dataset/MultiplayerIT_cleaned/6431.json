Mind you, we're not saying that President Iwata's old company doesn't have the flair and expertise to aspire to produce interesting and balanced puzzle games, it's just that Intelligent's legacy has always gone very well with high-profile classy and strategic puzzles. With Pullblox on one side and BOXBOY! on the other hand, if this is the concept of brainy competition at budget prices that Kyoto is pursuing among its best internal teams, we can only rejoice, hoping to be just at the beginning of the race. Stylistically, BOXBOY! it's as simple as you can imagine: the stroke is immediate, light, a few lines, a few piles of pixels to simulate particles to color a black on white that elegantly accompanies the progress and believe us, nothing more is needed. With a square box as the protagonist, the heart of the lively experiment lies entirely in the creation of other adjacent boxes; an apparently trivial assumption but developed in an intelligent way because after all, in these titles, what matters is always and only the level design. Curious, simple, fun and cheap: BOXBOY! is the big new addition on the eShop What boxes Presentation, story, plot, animations, sound. In BOXBOY! it's all incredibly minimal but so graceful that it makes you instantly fond of it, a sign that Nintendo's attention to detail does not limp one iota. As per the Japanese puzzle game tradition, the team chooses the idea and models it along all twenty-two game worlds, placing them alongside environmental elements that dilute and dilute any design overloads, managing to propose different obstacles to each scheme. BOXBOY! progressively increases the difficulty and complexity of the puzzles with shrewdness, giving the impression that what is in front of you can be completed as long as you stop, think and make a first attempt. Which will most likely fail, forcing you to perch yourself in a fun and not frustrating trial & error: when the first real puzzles arrive, the game will have accustomed you by now to the fact that there is a solution, you just need to change your point of view. The gameplay numbers are just a couple: the first involves the maximum number of boxes that can be formed per attempt within the specific level, the second the total amount of usable blocks so that the only collectible present - the crown - does not disappear, leaving you with the 'bitter in the mouth. This is where BOXBOY! comes alive: the coveted prize dissolves as soon as the counter goes below zero, forcing a painstaking study of the elements available. Sipping the blocks in search of the only possible solution becomes a necessity and a greater source of inspiration for HAL Laboratory, which raises the bar without ever overdoing it, showing great respect for the player. There's also a help key, but what's the point of using it? Surrounded In addition to creating shapes to throw here and there, the art of surrounding yourself with blocks will be the weapon to get the upper hand. Considering that for almost all of the game you can create only one block at a time, it's up to you to shape platforms, defenses and trampolines to support, let slide or use to reach high points. BOXBOY! it convinces by the variety on offer, which does not get recycled and with good consistency keeps the interest high in the progress, mixing the elements that will gradually be added to the list. That's not all: in the face of contributions in medals - obtainable by completing levels - the internal shop provides costumes, music, advice and challenges to enrich a very full-bodied endgame. Just when you think you've finished the process, know that you've just done half of it... the easy one: increasing environmental richness and complexity, the second part of BOXBOY! it will give you a lot of satisfaction, forcing you to operate your brain in a rather creative way. The only drawback is the audio sector: the only track present (and its variant in the finale) is splendid in the immediate future but tremendously tiring in the long run. When we write ~in the long run~ we mean it seriously: it seems incredible, but for just 5 Euros you will take home not only qualitative but also quantitative excellence. At the end of the last puzzle, the timer still marks more than ten hours of pure play, without bothering the timed and points challenges which, if done after mastering the mechanics, add at least a couple of hours to the lot.", "date": "2015-04-07", "grade": "8.5"}
