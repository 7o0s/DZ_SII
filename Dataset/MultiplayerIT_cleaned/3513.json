{"name": "Spyro: Reignited Trilogy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spyro-reignited-trilogy-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Last November 2018, the most famous purple dragon ever happily returned to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a remaster packaged ad hoc by Toys For Bob (those of the Skylanders, among other things) and published by Activision: today we're back to talking about it with the review of Spyro: Reignited Trilogy for Nintendo Switch. After about a year of exclusivity on the consoles mentioned, in fact, the three chapters of the original series are also ready for a second test ride on Nintendo Switch and PC, thus officially becoming usable by literally anyone. As always, the question of a port on the hybrid of the Kyoto house becomes interesting, mainly for two reasons: the technical question of the conversion itself, and then the added value of portability. How will it have gone for little Spyro and company? Converting to Nintendo Switch: TV Mode Tooth away, pain away: the conversion of Spyro: Reignited Trilogy on Nintendo Switch is not particularly successful, and in the course of our hours of play we really noticed several flaws, probably explainable with a conversion attempt that turned out to be actually a compression for its own sake. Not even particularly victorious, since as you will know by purchasing the physical version of the game on Nintendo Switch you will still have to download a day one patch of around 8 gigabytes: quite a lot for the average console. However, the quality of the port is fluctuating, and particularly differentiated depending on whether you choose to play in dock mode (i.e. in TV mode) or in portable mode. The first really noticeable flaw in TV Mode is a general lowering of the graphic level of Spyro: Reignited Trilogy. Now, the purpose of this speech is not to make a comparison between the various game versions to find a winner, but it must be remembered that on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 the Activision title had a resolution of 1080p (up to 4K) and a frame fixed rate at 30FPS. At the same frame rate, which however in many cases and above all in the most agitated situations becomes dangerously dancer, going down a bit, the graphic detail of Spyro: Reignited Trilogy cannot even aspire to the levels of rival consoles from a distance. Not bad, you will say: because if you buy Spyro: Reignited Trilogy on Nintendo Switch it is certainly not for the technical sector offered by a less performing console than Xbox One and PlayStation 4. An understandable reasoning, but in TV mode the general glance is really difficult to swallow: sometimes we even doubted that it was actually 720p. Backgrounds are generally blurred, shadows and reflections grainy, and a persistent blur becomes increasingly distracting the farther the eye gets. Load times between worlds are also slightly longer than on other consoles, but this detail is certainly not the most problematic. Particle effects and lighting would also have required a little more effort during the conversion, but perhaps it is in the water sources that the technical problems of the port can be summed up: they seem dirty, blurred, as if suddenly the pollution had corrupted Avalar and the Forgotten Worlds. Laptop and tabletop mode The issues we've covered so far involve Spyro: Reignited Trilogy played in TV Mode. Things change (albeit partially) once the console is removed from the dock to play in portable mode. The miracles are clearly only apparent, justified by the small size of the screen, which allows you to overlook the defects of the graphics sector, and probably due to a porting that had its starting and ending point precisely in the mobile version of the title. It's not the first time that titles on the Nintendo Switch are at their best in handheld mode rather than once docked. And precisely in portable mode here is that Spyro: Reignited Trilogy seems more fluid, more detailed, generally more successful: perhaps thanks to our having played the first few hours in TV mode. The small screen size helps a definition that on balance falls further, perhaps hovering around 480-600p, but we'll need Digital Foundry's analysis to be sure. At times you will notice on the screen of your console a real grid, a pixelated grid that certainly does not indicate a good overall resolution. In portable mode, from time to time a few too many slowdowns and some lowering of the frame rate continue to peep out, but nothing exaggerated for the player. Nothing to report regarding the particularities ofthe Nintendo console: a barely mentioned vibration system accompanies the oblivion for the true potential of the HD Rumble. It's hard to believe more decent results couldn't be achieved for a conversion of the Spyro trilogy; however, the fun factor isn't compromised... at least in portable mode. The contents Let's spend a few more words for the latest arrivals, perhaps for the players who didn't even notice the arrival on the market of Spyro: Reignited Trilogy last winter and therefore know little about its contents. The package in question, also on Nintendo Switch, contains the remake version (i.e. made from scratch, as if they were modern titles) of the first three chapters of the original trilogy on PlayStation 1, namely Spyro The Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage ( known by us as Gateway to Glimmer, i.e. Passage to Barlume) and finally Spyro 3: Year of The Dragon. These platforms, which have now become obsolete mainly due to the small size of the various levels and the extremely low level of difficulty, have marked the childhood of many gamers, and the characters present, as well as atmospheres and worlds still have a lot to say to the collective imagination . Among other things, three very pleasant adventures are offered at a budget price of 39.99 euros.", "date": "2019-09-04", "grade": "6.0"}
