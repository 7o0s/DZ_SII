{"name": "Resistance 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resistance-2-recensione.html", "text": "Comment Resistance 2 keeps all the promises announced in recent months, but perhaps does so in a different way from what could be expected after the assumptions of the first chapter. Paradoxically, in fact, the single player, while flexing its muscles on a technical level and being enjoyable and fun, represents the ~weakest~ part of this production, also by virtue of a somewhat disconnected narrative system in its parts and the charisma of the protagonists not really memorable. However, when you move on to multiplayer the music changes considerably, Insomniac has in fact packaged an exceptional online game, certainly the best on PlayStation 3 and among the most valid ever, with an excellent cooperative mode, a classic multiplayer for up to sixty players that works well and a network infrastructure virtually free of lag or frame rate drops, mostly seasoning everything with a growth system characterized by levels, classes and experience that invites the player to dedicate hours and hours to the multiplayer component, a real flower of the cap that makes the title absolutely unmissable for users of the Sony console. It was an honor, sir! Pros Excellent multiplayer and coop Funny Perfect control system Graphic impact more than good Cons Some drops in quality in the technical sector Underdeveloped narrative system More variety in single would not be sorry The approach to the story and the game operated by Insomniac, the developer of Resistance 2, in some ways radically changes compared to the first chapter, as well as the style. The changes start from the narration of the events, which are no longer told in the third person but directly experienced by the voice of the protagonists and in particular of Hale, the focal point of the fight against the Chimera. The battle moves on a large scale, several giant monsters peep out, the clashes become more bloody, according to an orientation aimed at making the battle between humans and aliens more ~realistic~ and atmospheric. The single player campaign is divided into seven chapters and shines for variety, it starts right from Iceland to cross San Francisco, Chicago, Louisiana and other settings that always refer to really existing locations, obviously revisited in a post apocalyptic key. Everything is tied together by a narrative thread illustrated by the classic animated sequences and by documents that can be collected during the exploration, and which are more than useful for deepening the story. The flow of the levels instead takes up the first chapter and the classics of the shooter genre, where you have to make your way to the sound of firefights, escape in certain situations rather than activate some devices. No concessions to the rest, but space, as mentioned, for large-scale conflicts with dozens of enemies on the screen and clashes against giant creatures, to say the least, which perhaps continue in several points of the level and which certainly represent the best part of the experience in single. The fights against Kraken and Leviathan, for example, pit the player against creatures much larger than Hale, and are often part of the background of the game, starting right from the Goliath of the first level, which must be shot down with shots from the Laark , the rocket launcher available in the game. Unlike the original title, where it was possible to select all the weapons in one's possession from a special menu, Hale can now only carry with him the various types of grenades and two weapons at the same time (interchangeable using the triangle key) each of which is equipped of primary and secondary fire, assigned respectively to the R1 and R2 backbones. With L1 you access the aiming of the weapon while with L2 it is possible to crouch or run by means of continuous pressure, for the rest with the X you jump and with the square you reload the weapon. Just the weapons, often surreal and crazy, remain one of the points in favor of the Insomniac production, even if they do not reach the variety of the first chapter. In total there are about a dozen, and they see the return of some old ones, such as the Bullseye and its tracker or the beautiful Auger, capable of shooting through walls, and the introduction of new ones, such as the Magnum pistol, which can detonate projectiles planted at a distance or the Wrath mini-machine gun, equipped with extreme firepower and the possibility of releasing a force field capable of absorbing the blows received. Their distribution during the course of the adventure is well balanced, the use is always fun and immediate, also thanks to various types of secondary fire that allow you to adopt different strategies, frontal or not, to get the better of the enemy. The artificial intelligence behaves quite well, also thanks to itand the fact that the battles are often fought against dozens of enemies at the same time, where there are some who surround the player, others who take cover, still others who come towards you, giving good variety in this sense. Often the clashes take place together with many teammates, just to simulate the enormous conflict in progress, even if it is quite unrealistic that the enemies prefer to attack the player directly, as soon as he returns to their visual cone. Otherwise it is possible to remain even a little out of sight and attack them from behind, which only works well for the bigger and slower moving ones. The choice of the type of gameplay, although far from being innovative, is in any case spot on, the adventure is extremely enjoyable and fun, thanks to the few dead moments, the balancing of the clashes, the settings and the control system. truly among the best ever for a console FPS. Without sacrificing game speed, in fact, the precision of the movements and the response of the pad are practically perfect, and you can immediately gain confidence and obtain excellent results, even online. However, what prevents the single-player campaign from passing from a good rating to an excellent one is the lack of extremely memorable moments, as well as the absence, for example, of sections on board vehicles such as those present in the first chapter, which would have helped certainly to the variety. Finally, the story seemed to us a little too disconnected and fragmented in its explanation, where even the animated sequences denote a certain approximation in their direction, and where many pieces are not explained properly. Even the ending, far from being obvious, leaves too many unresolved and open questions, which could have been explained without undermining any continuation of the saga. It is true that Insomniac has done a very targeted work of ~viral marketing~ by releasing a lot of information to deepen the story, including the official site of Project Abraham, but we would have expected something more directly within the game and a greater charisma for the main protagonist, who certainly had more when his events were told in the third person in the first chapter. Technique and tactics The graphic impact with Resistance 2 is clearly higher than that of the first chapter and keeps up with the times, sometimes proposing things well above the average, without however missing some defects. The environments are very large and equipped with many details, with a choice of vivid colors and an adequate variety of textures. In particular, the Orick forest in California or Chicago enjoy excellent particle effects, well-structured HDR, details that make the setting convincing and pleasing to the eye. In some cases, the animations of the enemies are amazing, except for sporadic bugs, while the choice to often and willingly represent large creatures in the background rather than ships, Chimera towers and so on, helps to return an engaging graphic impact and in line with the best productions of the type. On the negative side of the balance we have instead a fluctuating quality for textures and interiors, some pop-in problems (appearance of textures lagging behind the polygons) and the canonical lack of interactivity with the environment, aspects that shift the judgment of the graphics sector more on an artistic than a technical level, where the most well-kept locations, which in any case represent the majority, are sometimes flanked by some decidedly less impressive ones. Also because on a technological level there is nothing to say, the shadows for example also enjoy different simultaneous sources of lighting, not to mention that the graphics engine moves an impressive amount of characters simultaneously without the slightest uncertainty. The sound fulfills its purpose without returning memorable traces, while the dubbing is completely in Italian in the text and in the voices, which stand in the classic limbo of without infamy or praise. Online, and of what pasta! The original title had been one of the most appreciated by PlayStation 3 users in terms of online gaming, but in this sequel Insomniac has surpassed itself in all respects, both as a modality and as an actual infrastructure. Setting aside the possibility of tackling the main campaign in cooperative mode, the developer has transferred everything to a new section built ad hoc for the purpose, in which up to two players can take part locally (via horizontal split screen) or by moving online from alone or together with your partner to face six different settings and up to eight players, an absolute novelty in tto the sense. The aim is to find and face waves of Chimera of different species, while completing some objectives similar to those present in single player mode. In this case, the resistance of the enemies is even greater, as is their number, which depends on how many players are currently in the match. To participate in a session, you must choose one of the three available classes, which differ in skill and type of equipment. In fact we have the soldier, able to handle the most lethal weapons and to absorb the greatest number of blows, the special one, in possession of the ability to produce ammunition for everyone on the playing field and finally the doctor, who in the face of a very limited firepower and resistance, has the possibility of being able to heal opponents. The cooperation between these three classes is therefore essential to complete the mission, and it is made even more interesting because the subsequent ones have completion requirements and become increasingly difficult. And again, each class has levels, which are reached by acquiring experience points and which are used to unlock new primary weapons or buy upgrades to increase the characteristics of your armor and weapons, such as kinetic gloves or other. Dulcis in fundo, each character, after a certain number of kills, can enter ~berserk~ mode and take advantage of a further ability available, such as that of producing more lethal projectiles rather than seeing from afar or absorbing half of the enemies' blows, all factors that increase the fun, the sense of cooperation and that work very well, thanks also to the fact of being able to use the voice chat to coordinate. As if that weren't enough, every time you start the same coop mission, the map section can be different, which guarantees great longevity, for the mode that is certainly better done than the entire package. Online, and of what pasta! For the traditionalists obviously the whole competitive part is not lacking, with the classic options for single and team deathmatches of up to 60 players, a new record for the genre on consoles, the classic capture the flag (renamed core control) and the skirmish mode, which meets the chaos generated by all these players simultaneously by further dividing their team into sub-units of five elements, where specific missions are assigned to each in a dynamic way. The Skirmish therefore fully manages to give the idea of being in a bigger conflict and to give ~order~, but we must say that we also enjoyed the classic team deathmatch, again by virtue of the excellent control system and the rather wide, which allow you to use numerous steps according to your fighting style, it being understood that the skill with the pad counts more than the strategy. Also for the competitive section we have medals and rewards, which also allow you to customize the skin of your character, and the same thing happens for the offline campaign, which returns experience points for rising in rank, according to a perfectly integrated system in every aspect of game. The network infrastructure that contains everything is then exceptional, thanks to the presence of voice chat, matchmaking, the possibility of creating clans, inviting friends and making private rooms, an incredible statistics system, seasoned with a plethora of filters, also reachable online on the Myresistance.net website. Furthermore, during our numerous game sessions we practically never encountered lag, the voice chat always worked perfectly and the graphics engine did not lose a frame, not even with dozens and dozens of characters on the screen, signs of the goodness of the work operated by Insomniac. To close the circle of an excellent multiplayer and a good single player, which stands at about ten hours, there is no shortage of extras such as character sketches, information on each type of weapon, an arcade mode (which allows you to play the game with default number of lives per level) and the ability to apply some graphic filters, not counting the 39 trophies present.", "date": "2008-11-14", "grade": null}
