{"name": "Super Paper Mario - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-paper-mario-recensione.html", "text": "Between two dimensions Each of the thirty-two levels created, divided into chapters of four each, is expressly designed to enhance the power that Mario has at his disposal right away: in fact, just press a button to switch from a two-dimensional to a 3D view, thus having two stages in one. Everything is played on perspective so that, for example, if you find yourself unable to overcome an excessively high obstacle, it will be enough to change your point of view to get around it and therefore solve the problem; on the other hand, however, an excessive amount of time spent in three-dimensional environments causes the appropriate bar to be consumed, at the end of which a slight loss of energy is suffered. As the adventure progresses, three other characters join the mustachioed protagonist and make themselves available to be selected exclusively as an alternative to him, never alongside him. On the other hand, each has a unique ability, essential to overcome certain passages or solve specific puzzles: Bowser can unleash a powerful flame from his jaws, while Peach glides with his umbrella and Luigi takes huge leaps. As if the elements presented did not guarantee sufficient variety, the curious Pixl soon manifest themselves, tiny beings capable of enhancing the one or the one next to them. With the exception of Consilia, which allows you to point the screen with the wiimote highlighting otherwise invisible details, you can select one Pixl at a time: if you want to take advantage of Bombo's bombs, therefore, you will have to give up having Kilo's hip shot immediately available or the slimming power of Sottilino. Their use has been beautifully balanced, so that each of them is necessary or at least recommended for a variety of occasions. The dark side of Super Paper Mario Alongside Count Ash there are other characters with not too crystalline intentions. During the game, these are almost always faced in the guise of end-of-chapter bosses and demonstrate that they have been endowed with a personality above the average of the production, resulting pleasant to meet and never banal. If Dimensio and his ability to change the surrounding environment prove to be less dangerous than expected, the only outwardly sweet Mimi and her fearsome transformations confirm how appearances are often deceiving. Obviously without forgetting Pugnazzo, a wiry and naive big boy who will often be worth talking to, obviously after having argued with his fists. Mixed fried Nintendo As mentioned at the beginning, Super Paper Mario amalgamates typical aspects of the two series from which the name also draws. The role-playing elements are to be found in the constant growth of the character's characteristics, which improves its statistics by obtaining experience points. Even the menu with objects, both offensive and defensive, is a juncture that implements a strategic component, although the level of difficulty unbalanced downwards does not force its use by sacrificing its depth. The platform soul is more incisive, which is revealed right from the strictly real-time fights, as assisted by assorted weapons and powers. The level design itself is linear and leaves it to the thousand gimmicks - hidden walls and profusion of perspective games - to impose a title coat of arms suitable for a home console. Overall, the impact with the gameplay is therefore exciting, demonstrating how the sum of the parts is greater than the total. Unfortunately, the state of grace does not last for the more than 15 hours necessary to conclude the main story, making the last Nintendo work a sort of descending videogame climax: the final chapters remain good but less enjoyable than the first ones, so that we arrive at the longed-for conclusion short of breath. Specifically, one realizes how certain situations end up repeating themselves and the care for the surrounding elements decreases in particular in the encounters with the NPCs, in ever decreasing number and with ever less insightful functions; bizarre by the way how this slight decline takes place hand in hand with the presentation of new environments, which go beyond the traditional Mushroom Island or the Haunted House. The end-game is also valuable, which offers a few hours of additional play to a greater degree of challenge. In fact, previously inaccessible areas will become available, revealing new treasures or overall well-designed side-quests. The ~Pozzo dei 100~ is also amusing, a dungeon that is difficult to complete, the conclusion of which however brings a welcome and secret surprise. Old-Gen or Next-Gen? The difference is in the commands The decision to publish Super Paper Mario exclusively for the Wii does not seem to haveexcessively influenced the implementation of features that enhance the peculiarities of the controls. The motion sensor of the wiimote is in fact used for a handful of commands, i.e. exploiting the power of the little helper Consilia and performing short mini-games aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of certain objects. Too little bearing in mind the potential offered, but perhaps a path inevitably taken when in the presence of a work now nearing completion. Graphically, the Intelligent Systems guys managed to create a pleasant world from almost all points of view, thanks to a comic style that required more energy to enrich the image with details than to fully exploit the muscles of the console. The settings have a lot, a lot in common with those always seen in products starring Mario and everything around him that has been created, not shining for originality or style but having fun and settling perfectly within the relaxed and playful atmosphere proposed . Support for the 16: 9 format and 480p are now standard on the Nintendo console, while the only really relevant flaw occurs when, having brought the 3D perspective, one realizes how the level is enclosed within imaginary barriers , almost giving the sensation that it is floating. The animations of the protagonists and enemies are good, with the latter category superbly represented by certain bosses: in particular, there will be a huge dragon to defeat, whose dimensions almost elevate it to a separate stage. The audio is good, which makes use of a certain amount of effects and musical tracks that always adhere to the context, while the absence of speech - replaced by text on the screen - is a lack to which the series has accustomed us. Comment In conclusion, Super Paper Mario is an acute note of cardinal importance in the Nintendo line-up, thanks to an original idea properly implemented and enhanced to its maximum extremes. Unfortunately the discontinuous quality of the proposed situations - albeit always settled on excellent levels - and the limited exploitation of the wiimote, clip the ambitions of an absolute masterpiece. The purchase remains essential and will be for all European players the appetizer to a winter season strong in the other, highly anticipated Mario, that Galaxy who promises to repeat the success of the episode for Nintendo 64. Pro Fun and well designed Great variety Technically suitable for the context Cons Suffers from a decline in the final stages Does not take full advantage of the offer of the machine Having to write about Super Paper Mario is doubly pleasant: it seems in fact to have been chosen - in Europe - to ferry the Wii out of a rather dull phase and promises to make a small revolution, combining two aspects kept separate until now in the videogame career of the 'Nintendo plumber. The title had a complex gestation, which saw it first announced for GameCube and then diverted to the new flagship, releasing it last spring in the United States. As for Zelda Twilight Princess, cross platform development represents the greatest unknown, leaving it to be verified how much the peculiarities of the new control system have been deepened. As always or almost in the history of the brand, the spark that ignites the experience is to be found simply in the idea behind the gameplay, rather than in the plot just mentioned or in the atmosphere already seen. The union of role-playing elements taken from Paper Mario and other typical of the classic 2D platform, therefore, are the arrows to the quiver of a bow which, as we will see, is all about amazement and fun. The narrative cue sees the protagonist away in the bizarre world of Svoltadil, a small village located in a remote space-time dimension from which to have access to the eight guardian worlds of as many ~Hearts of Purity~, essential to be able to defeat the perfidious Conte Cenere, guilty of kidnapping Princess Peach and trying to expand his dark domain.", "date": "2007-09-11", "grade": null}
