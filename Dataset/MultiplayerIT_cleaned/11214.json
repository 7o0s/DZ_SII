{"name": "My Aquarium - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-aquarium-recensione.html", "text": "Let's make things clear right away: talking about the game in this case makes very little sense. My Aquarium is in fact an entertainment application which, however, goes beyond the video game from practically all points of view. Having said this premise, the consequence is that it is not a question here of evaluating a game, but a sort of interactive video pastime, little more than a screensaver, however not without a certain charm and (fortunately) placed in the lower price range. expected low for the WiiWare offering. Considering the plurality that characterizes the current Wii audience, it may be an understandable choice at this point to consider Nintendo digital delivery as a vast software container, and not necessarily a service dedicated to ~DOC~ gamers. The premise of not expecting a game with the download of this title is a necessary condition for the appreciation and therefore for the evaluation of this product, which will probably only appeal to those who are interested in taking care of a virtual aquarium. Having said this, it must be admitted that My aquarium performs its duty satisfactorily: there is a good (albeit largely improvable) quantity of modifiable elements and details, there is a large variety of fish complete with an accurate description for each of them and the interface is comfortable and intuitive. The level of interaction is obviously rather low: beyond the organization of the aquarium (insertion of backdrops, objects and fish) there are very few things to do, and everything is limited to a sort of ~contemplative~ pastime. what exactly is the hobby of the aquarium, but finding ourselves in front of a virtual environment one could also hope for some more possibilities, such as a deeper level of ~exploration~ of the fish habitat, an even greater quantity of elements to insert and maybe a slightly more particular and customizable look. Sushi in fish bowls My Aquarium allows the management of different aquariums, from the organization of the habitat to the selection of fish. There are 40 different fish species from which to draw your specimens, although these become selectable only by continuing in the game (14 at the beginning): the aquarium cannot be overpopulated, and it is necessary to select species that are compatible with each other (sometimes they can come to eat each other). Around the fish it is possible to modify the background, the general theme, the lights and insert different elements of the scenario, above all plants, stones and various organisms typical of the seabed (corals, shells and similar things). The placement of the various objects takes place by moving them directly with the Wii Remote, with the possibility of placing them in various points of the seabed and at different depths with respect to the background. The graphics tend towards realism with good results, aiming to recreate the illusion of transforming the television into an aquarium, although everything tends to be a bit aseptic, without the possibility of inserting objects or elements with a particular look to dilute a little serious atmosphere. Once all the elements and the fish in the tank have been arranged, the title exhausts a large part of its potential, given that after the organization phase the things to do are drastically reduced: we can feed the fish (by selecting the feed from various choices), observe them from nearby (it is possible to ~touch~ the screen and observe the reactions) or see them ~dance~ to the rhythm of the music (there are about thirty classical pieces to be selected as audio accompaniment) by setting the ~special dates~ on the calendar, in which this sort of spectacular event. Saved aquariums can also be sent to friends via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. There is practically nothing else to add, once the ideal composition has been reached it is possible to modify it, or create another aquarium from scratch, perhaps hoping that new choices will subsequently be made available in addition to those already present. Comment Even with the right mentality to judge a sort of pastime application and not a video game, it is difficult to remain enthusiastic about My Aquarium. In fact, it performs its function as a virtual aquarium well, but the impression remains that it wants to get by with minimal effort. If you have to settle for a virtual aquarium, you would perhaps like to have the possibility of being able to customize it in a more profound way, to be able to enjoy large tanks that can be explored in a sort of virtual tour. My Aquarium, on the other hand, remains firmly linked to the idea of transforming the screen into a realistic aquarium, confirming itself as a sort of interactive screensaver. If you are looking for this, then perhaps 5 euros does not even represent an excessive outlay, otherwise for the same price you can find much more memorable experiences on the Virtual Console.Pro Simple and intuitive interface Good graphics Lots of fish types Cons Low level of interaction Possibility of customization not immense Not suitable for those looking for a game", "date": "2008-09-08", "grade": null}
