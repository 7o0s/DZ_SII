{"name": "E chi chiamerai?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71474-ghostbusters-il-videogioco-e-chi-chiamerai.html", "text": "Version tested: PCThree months behind the Sony console versions, the legendary Ghostbusters arrive on PC and Xbox 360, complete with blaring sirens, proton packs and hordes of ghosts. On the texts of Dan Aykroyd (the same one who gave birth to the Blues Brothers) and Harold Ramis, screenwriters of the films as well as interpreters of the characters of Doctor Ray Stanz and Doctor Egon Spengler, the player, in the role of a recruit of the renowned company of exterminators of the paranormal will have to face the unexpected return of Gozer the Gozerian, Sumerian (and not Babylonian) god faced and sent back to the closest parallel dimension in the finale of the first film of the series. That's all? Of course not, in a real race to quote and cameo in both episodes, you will have the opportunity to face and meet again, as well as well-known and lesser-known ghosts (among which stand out the old lady from the library, the mashmellows man and the slimy Slimer) also human antagonists such as the prosecutor Walter Peck or old friends such as Janine Metz (the secretary). Unfortunately missing the bungling lawyer Luis Tulli, played on the big screen by a Rick Moranis (Honey, the kids shrunk, Spaceballs) and Peter's girlfriend Dana Barret, alias Sigurney Weaver. We add that the voices are largely those of the original actors and voice actors (unfortunately the voice of the late Oreste Lionello is missing in the Italian version) and that the plot will develop intertwining with the animated series The Real Ghostbusters leading players to face evil directly into the parallel dimension of origin and a superfine minestrone will come out that will satisfy the demanding palates of fans of the most famous quartet in New York. Ray, when someone asks you if you are a God, you have to say YES! Regardless of the plot and the script, topped off with a series of jokes, anecdotes and ironies worthy of the films, what is Ghostbusters: The Video Game in fact? Despite some research sections, in which you have to go around settings (unfortunately linear and very circumscribed) detector in hand hunting for various ectoplasmic residues and traces, the title presents itself with the setting of a classic third-person action game . The main difference is obviously in the weapons used: although later in the plot you will have a series of experimental equipment in your hands, most of the adventure will be tackled using an ~unauthorized proton accelerator~, with which to trap the ghosts and bring them directly inside a trap in which to lock them up once and for all. In terms of the game it is about weakening the ghosts by repeatedly hitting them with the main beam and then capturing them and dragging them (using the mouse) into the radius of the trap to see them sucked inside. Unfortunately, the first problem of the PC conversion of the title is precisely the difficulty of combining the practicality of a joypad with the more complicated traditional controls via mouse and keyboard: it is simply extremely discouraged for those who do not have a good pad to play this video game, given that the control of the beam via mouse, regardless of the hours spent tinkering with the sensitivity values, always proved to be inferior to the intuitiveness of a good analog stick. As far as the interface is concerned, the attempt was to recreate a cinematic experience as much as possible by eliminating any energy from the vital bar and relegating a series of LEDs and lights on the proton pack to this function: health status and in fact, armaments appear directly on the character, increasing the level of participation by several points. There will be several upgrades that can be purchased during the game, not only greater freedom of movement or speed, but also new weapons, among which the ~good slime~ seen in the second chapter of the film saga stands out. All that remains is to cross the streams! Serious, indeed very serious flaw: just as the lovers of the cooperative modes present in the console versions of the game go crazy, it is a real cold shower to discover that the Ghostbusters PC one has no support for network play. A choice destined to disappoint and to raise a series of questions in the heads of gamers who see themselves deprived of what, on balance, was one of the most anticipated experiences (and proved to be among the most satisfying) of this product. Choose the form of the destroyer Technically speaking, the Windows version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game maintains the strengths and weaknesses of the PlayStation 3 counterpart: in a particularly appreciable setting, in which thecan good three-dimensional models of ghosts and human beings, moreover animated in a wonderful way, are combined with slightly disappointing movies and a physics engine that should be given a slight adjustment. The special effects are well made and abundant, among which the light effects linked to the proton rays and traps naturally stand out. The voices and the acting of the dialogues are excellent, in which you can see the touch of the professionals. The original soundtrack of the films is unattainable.", "date": "2009-11-02", "grade": "7.4"}
