For example, having been able to give dignity and substance to the genre of ~children's games~, which too often in the past was synonymous with modest if not downright depressing experiences, or still being able to offer a tangible element of novelty every year avoiding the simplest and most obvious way of the ~homework~. The alternation in the development between Vicarious Visions and Toys for Bob was in this sense an extraordinarily apt decision, capable of guaranteeing a development period for each chapter sufficient to encompass the creative process, the realization one and finally the optimization one while maintaining that annual frequency that is evidently essential on a commercial level. In confirmation of what has been said so far, it is enough to know that for this year's release a variant has been introduced capable of heavily modifying the balance of the gameplay proposed so far, adding a completely new element: we are talking about the vehicles, divided according to them vault in the categories of land, water and air, intended to be used in precise and large sections within the levels and thus constituting a sort of broad diversion from the ~classic~ progression stages on foot. Skylanders SuperChargers is a turning point capable of renewing the formula by increasing its variety No parking For those who have followed the development of the Skylanders series since its inception, it will be easy to remember the introduction of the Swap Force jump as a key element in the evolution of the franchise, which from then on had the opportunity to offer a depth of all other category. The feeling that SuperChargers could have a similar importance in the future developments of the Activision series is evident from the moment we find ourselves controlling Hot Streak for the first time, that is the car included in the Starter Pack and destined for obvious reasons to be the most representative and most used means of this episode: between arenas, ramps, boosts, evolutions and breathtaking tracks to be tackled at maximum speed there is very little time to blink, in a frenzy that never becomes chaos. And it is probably the sections on board the cars where the team has managed to offer the most immediate and convincing gameplay, whereas the aerial and underwater ones appear slightly less successful: the former often result in somewhat repetitive dogfights and with little grit, the latter instead due to the greater slowness of the vehicles and the inertia of the controls inevitably appear less exciting and intense. In any case it is really difficult, if not impossible, to find clearly boring or uninspired passages in Skylanders SuperChargers, confirming the quality and experience of Vicarious Visions now perfectly capable of shaping the material of which the series is made to your liking . What makes the addition of vehicles even more interesting is the possibility of improving their characteristics and capabilities through the installation of new components, intended to also affect their aesthetic appearance: a system that adds value to the formula, inevitably making it more interesting. Also worth mentioning is a constructive detail of the vehicles which, unlike the characters, are not immobile and placed on a sort of pedestal but are ~free~, and with moving parts such as wheels or propellers: a factor which further brings the ~toys to life~ to real toys, always keeping intact the excellent construction quality and the remarkable aesthetic creative effort that has always distinguished the series. However, as we said at the beginning, those who appreciated the formula of the previous episodes should not despair: the new features introduced get stuck mixing with the classic formula of the section on foot, with the usual balance between exploration, combat and platform elements consolidated over the years. And of course you can use all the Skylanders in your collection, confirming the compatibility that has always been an immovable pillar of Activision production. Skylanders Kart Skylanders SuperChargers is an important episode for the series also due to the fact that it introduces online multiplayer for the first time: all this not within the main adventure, but in a separate mode focused on racing aboard the vehicles at your disposal . Also in this case the courses are divided according to the use of land, air or water vehicles, and are presented through a gameplay formula heavily inspired by Mario Kart. This obviously could only be a problem on Nintendo consoles, where actualseriously direct competition with such a sacred monster can reduce the appeal of the Skylanders SuperChargers offer; but on the other consoles it is undoubtedly possible to appreciate the work done by the American team more serenely, which, although not setting new standards, can be appreciated by guaranteeing some pleasant challenges. The greatest weakness of this mode is to be found in the small number of tracks available, only six, which can only be increased by purchasing particular bundle packages that contain trophies capable of unlocking new tracks. The decision to limit the number of human players to four out of the eight8 pilots participating in the races, where the rest are controlled by the CPU, is also questionable. On the other hand, the graphics component is truly remarkable, which even within a cross-gen context is capable of offering an excellent glance on the latest generation consoles, with a stable frame rate at 60 frames per second and an important level of detail , all enriched by spectacular graphic effects. Finally, the decision by the developers to take a sort of step back in the money-sucking mechanics that until now had been one of the founding elements of the Skylanders experience, and more generally of the ~toys to life~ genre, should be appreciated: compared to the past in where the presence of areas or contents accessible only with characters of a certain element urged the purchase of new statuettes insistently, in SuperChargers this component has been heavily reduced, in a renewed sense of respect for the final consumer who will certainly please above all parents. The only sections that really need an additional toy with respect to the contents of the Starter Pack are those related to water or air vehicles, where instead the aforementioned elemental affinity finds space only to ensure greater effectiveness of the attacks in the individual areas. In a nutshell, although the means cost more than the characters, just buy two more to be able to achieve roughly all that Skylanders SuperChargers has to offer. A good decision, which we feel like applauding and which we hope will not turn out to be a simple exception to the rule in the future.", "date": "2015-09-30", "grade": "8.6"}
