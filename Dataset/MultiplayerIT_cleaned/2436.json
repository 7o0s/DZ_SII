In short, it is the classic stencil that we have seen applied to the most varied settings and franchises in recent years on mobile platforms, in this case particularly rich in elements to keep under control and equipped with a truly peculiar characterization, given the story and the characters of reference. Whether this is enough to make it stand out in the middle of the ocean of similar games is not easy to say, also because it can be a subjective assessment, but the task performed by Devsister is at least correct, even commendable in some respects. Cookie Run: Kingdom has a rather classic turn-based RPG component As we usually see in games of this type, everything is structured according to the guidelines of turn-based RPG and management, with the two elements detached in terms of gameplay but organically inserted into an overall growth of the characters and of one's faction in general between quests to complete and care of the kingdom to grow and prosper. However, everything is made a little stranger than usual by the fact that it is based on ginger biscuits and various sweets: the story tells of a kingdom destroyed by an evil enchantress who defeated the five guardian biscuits by stealing their precious ~Soul Jam~, with which he can now dominate the universe of sweets thanks to his armies of ~Cake Monster~. The fate of the world then falls into the crumbly hands of the simple biscuit GingerBrave, who will have to recruit an army of very sweet fighters with whom to launch into various progressive clashes, at the same time trying to restore the glory of the kingdom. The story is clearly something crazy, but it is told with considerable irony, making fun of even the more traditional fantasy RPG clichs, which makes everything particularly enjoyable, with high quality cutscenes, animated with remarkable craftsmanship. Between fighting and kingdom management The gameplay is divided into two watertight compartments represented by RPG-style turn-based clashes and kingdom management, with the construction and optimization of structures. The latter provide resources and upgrades for the characters, while the quests allow you to obtain treasures, currencies and other elements that can be spent in the construction and evolution of buildings, therefore there is a relationship of interdependence between the two sectors of the game, but the mechanics remain quite different and not very mixed. On the other hand, it's a mix we've been used to for quite some time now, so the discrepancy between the different actions feels pretty familiar at this point. In Cookie Run: Kingdom kingdom management is one of the two main elements The quests are unlocked by exploring the outside world and are structured according to the classic mechanics of progressive clashes: it is a question of composing the party and seeing it advance in various fights against waves of enemies up to the final boss, interacting in a very elementary way through the activation of special skills for each character, managing cooldown times in the best possible way but without particular effort, given that much depends on the leveling of the fighters rather than on the need to develop strategies on the spot. A minimum element of depth is given by the need to build a party that is as balanced as possible, which falls within the push for the collection of characters through the gacha system: there are really many fighters to collect and, given the imaginative style chosen for the representation, they are all very varied and bizarre, reflected in different abilities and attacks to discover. The reflections of this variety are not always visible in battle, to tell the truth, but at least the difference between the macro-categories of ranged or melee combat helps to create a strategic element to take into consideration. Being also a gacha, Cookie Run: Kingdom contains many characters to manage and evolve The other sector of the game is the construction and management of the kingdom, which develops like a normal ~plugable~ management system as we have seen many in the mobile sector. Also in this case the game focuses on the old waiting mechanism and on the possibility of reducing them by spending in-game currencies, but if you stall a bit and use the game in small doses it is possible to bypass the problem easily.mind, moreover the quantity of actions that are proposed mitigates the fragmentation of the action making us dedicate ourselves to something else without affecting the pace too much. In short, although the whole structure of the game is based on the usual mechanism that points towards micro-transactions, Cookie Run: Kingdom is much less cynical than other similar titles and does not make it impossible to avoid falling into temptation. The characters in Cookie Run: Kingdom are obviously very unique", "date": "2021-02-25", "grade": "6.7"}
