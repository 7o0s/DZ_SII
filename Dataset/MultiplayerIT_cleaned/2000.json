{"name": "Slam Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/slam-tennis.html", "text": "Virtual Tennis Vs Slam Tennis Slam Tennis draws heavily on the Virtua tennis lesson. The settings, the movements, everything seems to be connected to the Sega title. Even the feeling of the controls and strokes seems taken verbatim. In fact, the first moments of the game were full of thoughts like ~already tried~ ~clone~ ... but then something changed. Slam tennis offers a more cumbersome but more versatile control system than VT. All four keys of the pad are used for different shots, unlike Vt where in the end it was always the same shot mostly, and occasionally a few lobs. Strangely the game also feels more realistic. Many times your jokes will end up out of a hair, or at the net, but not only. Even during a rally it will not be uncommon to see your opponent sending it to the net, or yourself, or a ball being muffed by the curb of the net and falling right there, catching you in absolute counter-time. In the Sega title the action was based above all on being able to displace the opponent and then cross or make him raise the shot to make a dunk. In Slam tennis everything is more or less the same with the difference that the net must be taken into consideration. The rest is carbon paper of the Sega title, as well as a large array of sub-games (such as knock down the targets, hit the rings ...) in the pre-established time, including the power bar for the joke. The game modes are varied. The Arcade allows you to play a single match in a tournament following non-tennis rules, i.e. with two hits each and the score increasing by one point at a time. The exhibition which can be single or tournament is instead the normal section in which real tennis is played, choosing the number of games, sets, etc ... finally there is the ~strange~ mode which asks us to face a lot of tests also details to be able to proceed. Gameplay The Infogrames game boasts numerous settings and several real-life professional tennis players, as well as a large number of fictional characters (both male and female). The fields are all well done and decently characterized (although some levels like the one in the disco are really annoying and out of place, but at least in normal play they don't come across). The animations are very good, even if in the replays there are imperfections in the collisions with the ball, while the 3D models of the players are not as good (especially the women leave much to be desired, both as faces and as modeling in general). It is a problem that is especially noticeable in replays, but being a tennis game, and therefore with not too much workload for the graphics department, something more could be asked of an xbox. On the other hand, the physics of the ball is excellent, again with a slight motion blur that gives it a greater sense of speed. The sound leaves the time it finds being a tennis game and therefore to be lived in religious silence. I was a bit dumbfounded by the localization which seems to me to have been hastily... at the end of the match some statistics appear on the match in which a mysterious ~aces~ item appears... it took me a while to understand that it was the ~aces~  that is the direct points on the serve. But no, it really seemed appropriate to translate this too, but in general I noticed a certain drop in quality in translations with terms that weren't always appropriate. Concluding Concluding this Slam tennis is really a nice game. Challenging, fun and well done. It has no simulation claims (even the presence of a special shot that is obtained by charging an energy bar demonstrates this) but it is a perfect mix between Virtua Tennis and a real simulation. The possibility of making mistakes very easily by hitting the net or suffering a deflection makes the game less static and monotonous and also forces you to go under the net more often, thus making the use of lobs useful. Excellent replays that follow the action in a really super way, with multi-angle and close-up zooms in detail and in a window. Too bad for the characters a bit ugly. So you know what I tell you!? Virtua Tennis 2 is the best yet, both for the feeling, for the animations and for the immediacy, but this Slam tennis is an excellent product capable, if well improved, of competing on equal terms and even surpassing the master. The ideas are there and the realization can be improved in the few, to be honest, weak points. Personally I would avoid re-implementing the somewhat silly Arcade section, especially set in absurd paintings such as the disco and I would concentrate everything on the actual game version. An otthyme game anyway, with some flaws, but a must buy for those who like tennis and for those looking for an excellent reason to invite friends over and have fun, because the title supports multiplayer for up to 4 players (in doubles of course). I conclude by reminding you that Slam tennis also exists in the Ps2 version, of which the Xbox version is probably a direct port (given any graphical shortcomings especially in texture definition). good level for Virtua Tennis there are subgames Against arcade mode strange graphics of the characters that can be improved no official license some settings are to be forgotten (arcade) few subgames Materials Image Gallery Special Tennis Film Slam Tennis Since a couple of years ago Sega introduced its magnificent Virtua tennis as a coin op and as a Dreamcast version, the tennis genre has found new life and has come back into vogue and in the last period seeing many software houses churning out titles dedicated to balls and rackets. The much-heralded version of Tennis2k2 now seems to have vanished into thin air in the ps2 version, while for xbox things seem to be even worse, as the whole Sega sports line is at risk in the old continent (why then?! Mystery... as if we were only following football !!!). In short, there were no valid alternatives to the saw title, and no one was now hoping for a change of situation. It is at this point that this tennis Slam appears like a bolt from the blue. The title immediately suggests a very arcade approach to the genre, but this is good, given that even the Sega title was certainly not a rigorous simulation", "date": "2002-09-30", "grade": null}
