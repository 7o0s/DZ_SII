{"name": "Recensione: Dead or Alive Ultimate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-dead-or-alive-ultimate.html", "text": "Beachwear collection 2004-2005 Ultimate is a two-disc box set. The first re-proposes the initial chapter of the series, exactly as it appeared on the 32-bit consoles, the second disc hosts a ~revised and enhanced~ re-edition of Dead or Alive 2, which aims to match the graphic splendor of the third chapter released on Xbox, rightly considered ~Best looking game~ of fighting games. Both games support a tasty and rich Online mode, a godsend for all owners of the Live kit. The online capabilities of the two discs are nearly identical. Doa Ultimate offers 15 wrestlers and (mostly) female wrestlers, three of which are to be unlocked. Compared to the old edition of the game, the number of unlockable clothes and costumes has been exponentially increased, which is around 20 per character. Of course, it's a pleasure to see Tina or Kasumi in a stunning new outfit every time. Both games support a tasty and rich Online mode, a godsend for all owners of the Live kit Beachwear collection 2004-2005 And all this also serves to avoid that when playing online you meet a fighter dressed in the same way. Ultimate finds its strong point necessarily in the online game. Simple, immediate and engaging. Up to eight players can find themselves in one room, where, after chatting and chatting a bit, the one-on-one fight will begin. Other users will wait their turn watching the fight via a nice moving camera system. Although waiting for the game may seem ~useless~ to someone, the spirit that this Ultimate revives is the one that hasn't been tasted since the release of Street Fighter 2 in the arcade. Even in the Capcom masterpiece, during the rowdy Arcade competitions , had to wait their turn, and the game was constantly accompanied by a subtle emotional tension. Ultimate online! Of course, there are many other online modes in ~Ultimate~. It would not be at all wrong to say that the online service of this title is everything to fighting games that Halo2 was to subjective shooters. Three words to define it: simple, fast, satisfying. In ~Ultimate~ it is also possible to create a Tag-Team and directly challenge other players, or face a Survival and post your own records in the world rankings, or even create and organize tournaments. The shadow of the lag, bogeyman of all online players, is indeed just a shadow. Occasionally the game will experience some minor hitches, but only during 8-person ~rooms,~ and mostly sporadically. It is obvious that playing online is not quite like doing it offline, and it is natural to feel the differences: those perceived in Doa Ultimate in no way affect the playability of the title. The shadow of the lag, bogeyman of all online players, is indeed just a shadow Ultimate online! No matter which character you select, you will always be impressed by the visual beauty of this game. A nail-biting 60fps, an avalanche of polygons on screen and top-notch textures are the ingredients of any Doa, this one in particular. The models of the characters are those, wonderful, of Doa3. While the backgrounds have been completely redesigned, reaching an absolute level of excellence. Numerous interactive elements have also been inserted into the landscape, and just like in Doa2 the 21 levels available are multi-level. Moving inside the rings it will be easy to fall somewhere and continue fighting, whether it's a waterfall, a roof or a high-tech building. The work done by Team Ninja is visible and rewarding. And above all, you will never have the impression of playing something ~already seen~, the greatest fear of buying a remake like this. Good news for all ~High Definition~ gamers: ~Ultimate~ supports a 480p Widescreen visual mode. final comment Surely one of the criticisms that Dead or Alive has always been made is that of being a ~geek~ and not very technical fighting game for purists of the genre. Equally certain is that in this field it is not comparable to sacred pearls of the genre such as Street Fighter or Virtua Fighter. With the inclusion of the online mode, and the consequent exponential increase in the number of opponents that we could challenge, there will certainly be a surge in technicalities over time. Apart from this, we are faced with the most beautiful fighting game to watch on the market, whose graphics absolutely leave you speechless (also for the beauty of the lottery games, of course!). Last but not least, the amazing online service set up by Team Ninja, truly varied, simple and functional. Pros: Online mode curatissima Superb graphic design Two games: the first Doa makes nostalgia Cons: Lack of technicality Offline loses a lot of its charm Although the now ~elderly~ Dead or Alive series is almost in its tenth year of life, it is difficult to forget the first time we saw that devastating ~Mune Yare~ effect, or the wobbly chest. In recent times we have instead witnessed an expansion of the brand also in secondary genres, such as for example with ~Xtreme Beach Volleyball~. Finally a raw fighting game is back, a re-edition of that first chapter that saw the light on SegaSaturn and the sequel that appeared on the Dreamcast in all its glory. But it is not a simple commercial operation, given that the work done on this ~Ultimate~ is massive: the graphic restyling and the addition of the online mode make every lover of Dead Or Alive and fighting games in general happy.", "date": "2005-02-25", "grade": null}
