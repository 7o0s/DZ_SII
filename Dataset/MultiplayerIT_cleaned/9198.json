How can you not find it irresistible? The protagonist is a chubby and rosy monster, who uses his tail as a life indicator. The settings are the main European capitals, rendered with pastel tones and cartoonish graphics. And finally the gameplay is that of runner, only that you have to break things. The allure of destruction Lately in the App Store almost a niche genre is being created, which has monsters as protagonists who decide to go and take revenge for the oppression of humans. With titles such as Destructopus, Doodle vs Brute or Wacky Lands Boss, the classic ~bad guys~ finally take their revenge, and the player follows their deeds as they sow terror among droves of more or less innocent ~good guys~ (depending on the case). Demolition Dash follows this trend, and sees us take control of Zilla, a dinosaur who would like to be bad but is more irresistibly tender. Not only is it all pink (a color that has always not denoted aggression), but it is also decidedly overweight. And a yellow-and-pink striped tail that doubles as a life gauge: every time you collide with an enemy, you lose a slice of the tail, until the inevitable Game Over. The presentation of Demolition Dash is really excellent: very fluid animations, wonderful scenarios... the only small criticism that can be made to the game is that it hasn't customized the different cities too much: running around, what distinguishes Moscow from Paris is practically only the city profile behind us, and one can never perform deeds such as destroying typical monuments or meeting local inhabitants: a real lost opportunity, because annihilating babushke and KGB policemen, rather than royal guards and people who fox hunting would have been priceless indeed. Run Zilla, run! The beating heart of Demolition Dash, despite the title, remains that of the runner. Zilla runs without stopping to the right, and the player has two very simple commands: the jump, on the left of the screen, and the roar, on the right. The level begins and ends with a dip in the ocean, but everything in between is a breakneck race where you have to be careful to avoid enemies (cops, armored cars, tanks and helicopters) as you run non-stop. The first schemes are decidedly simple, and you can indulge in delusions of destruction, without paying too much attention to the rest... but the difficulty increases rapidly and you need to pay attention to where the jump will end, when you will make a roar , so you don't crash into a tank or fall off a roof. In fact, even the structure of the levels becomes more and more platform: roofs of buildings, balconies, platforms: Zilla will have to demonstrate unsuspected gymnastic skills in a fat dinosaur to reach the end of each level. As if that weren't enough, each scheme (and there are 3 for each city) has an always different secondary objective. Destroy a certain number of tanks, collect a certain amount of balloons, score a certain score. The presence of these secondary objectives adds a lot of longevity to the game: finishing it is not difficult, but some of these missions will be really complex to complete. And once the World Rampage mode is over, after going through 24 levels and 8 different cities, the Endless Run is unlocked. Here you run to complete Achievements of various types, with no time limit; with the upcoming update, new missions and new objectives are also promised, which should infuse a little more lifeblood into this mode as well.
