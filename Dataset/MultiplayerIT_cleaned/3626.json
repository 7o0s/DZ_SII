{"name": "Nonstop Knight 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nonstop-knight-2-la-recensione.html", "text": "The idea behind Nonstop Knight 2, the protagonist of this review, is one of those that fall within the new wave of video game genres born above all on mobile platforms, where a different way of using the video game has corresponded to the birth of new genres capable to better respond to the needs of the game in portability. This explains the creation of a hack and slash RPG that basically plays itself, a sort of ultra-simplified Diablo in which we have to exclusively dedicate ourselves to the activation and selection of special skills and the management of the equipment and evolution of the protagonist . The mechanics are obviously simplistic if looked at according to the standard evaluation schemes of the classic video game, but it takes on a particular sense if one thinks of a fragmented use, perhaps a little distracted and with the device held with one hand. Leaving therefore from the point of view of the real RPG, it turns out that Nonstop Knight 2 is based on a functional and also interesting idea, simply its gameplay is built on elements that are normally complementary to the actual game action and which here instead rise to constitutive principles. On the other hand, it is a common feature of many games that are particularly widespread in the mobile sector, such as clickers and idle games, which exploit the idea of a fragmented and portable pastime to build game mechanics on top of it that can also be addictive. Demonstrating the validity of these solutions is the constitution of a remarkable community already for the first Nonstop Knight, to which this sequel is aimed in a privileged way, considering its characteristics. The second chapter is in fact simply a more of the same, almost indistinguishable at first but characterized by a series of improvements and evolutions that go in the direction indicated by the feedback from users. The result is a game completely dedicated to those who had already appreciated the first one, a sort of improved version of the progenitor rather than a new beginning or substantial evolution. Restless knight The protagonist of Nonstop Knight 2 is a knight who explores dungeons, fights enemies and collects loot in a completely automatic way, leaving the player the possibility of activating special abilities, with the decision on which one to use and when to do it. The pace of the game is very fast and the cooldown of the moves is decidedly short, therefore it is not really a question of strategically studying the actions to be carried out but rather choosing broadly when it is better to use a zone attack or a concentrated one, or an evasive maneuver to momentarily get away from problems. In any case, the combat system is not exactly challenging and the most strategically relevant choices lie in the composition of the skills to be used and in the management of the equipment. After a certain amount of killed enemies, the possibility of facing a boss opens up, with the presence of three clashes of this type for each dungeon: these are progressively more demanding challenges, which once overcome allow the passage to the next level. Unfortunately there is a decided lack of originality and care in the construction of the scenarios, therefore the progress from one dungeon to another is not exactly accompanied by a certain interest in seeing the new settings and this is certainly a limit even for a game with mechanical peculiar like this. It is clear that the management of the character is the main point on which the gameplay of Nonstop Knight 2 is concerned, given the almost total removal of the interaction during the actual game action. On this front, we note the various evolutions made from the first to the second chapter, which are above all refinements on the same basis: the loot is much richer and more varied, now divided into coordinated sets in order to stimulate the collection of all objects belonging to certain series . Each single object has different characteristics in addition to the basic attack and defense statistics and can be further improved with the expenditure of coins and materials for crafting, which makes the personalization of the protagonist deeper and richer, also thanks to the amount of passive talents that they can be collected by advancing from level to level. Furthermore, the selectable skills evolve, remaining linked to the characteristics of the basic ones but becoming increasingly powerful, with their strategic role therefore consolidating over time. The game is a free-to-play that does not set particular limits to those who want to avoid spending: of the two currencies, i.e. gold coins and gems, the latter are fundamental for the potential of the equipment and also forr being able to continue the game in the event that energy is completely lost, but in any case these are events in which the choice to pay or not is rather free.", "date": "2019-06-18", "grade": "6.5"}
