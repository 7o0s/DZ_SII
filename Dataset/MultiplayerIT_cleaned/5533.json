{"name": "Ti spiedo in due", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167589-rocketbirds-2-evolution-ti-spiedo-in-due.html", "text": "Action shooter based on anthropomorphic birds, from the wily chicken-Rambo protagonist to his many opponents, including pigeons, penguins and even owls, Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken made its debut in 2011 on PlayStation 3, after conquering numerous users thanks to the original Flash version. A few years later, here we are trying out the sequel, Rocketbirds 2: Evolution, which right from the start does not seem to distance itself much from the original chapter: the nemesis we will have to face, the dictator Putzki, inexplicably returns to the fore after his defeat in the first episode, and the Hardboiled Chicken will have to find out how he managed to resurrect, within a single player campaign consisting of six levels in which the shootings are interspersed with traditional puzzles based on mind control, on the finding of magnetic tiles and on interacting with various non-player characters. Rocketbirds 2: Evolution is a good title, with biting humor and thick puzzle elements Cross and delight Having quickly completed the tutorial that accompanies us in the early stages, Rocketbirds 2: Evolution engages the fourth and offers some frenetic clashes, in which, however, one of the weak points of the system created by Ratloop immediately emerges: the twin stick shooter-style approach is elusive and imprecise, forcing you to remain still in order to hit the targets, thanks to a very thin line of fire; even if doing so risks taking huge damage and incurring game over. To be honest, it is the controls in general that are a bit too slippery and without ~weight~: an unforgivable sin for a platformer, although this factor is fortunately smoothed out by the other elements of the game, such as the aforementioned puzzle solving. After a few shootings and the elimination of a first mini boss, in fact, the protagonist comes into possession of a cell phone that allows him to control the minds of enemy soldiers and push them, for example, to open doors or, in the more powerful version of the device , to fight against their own comrades and then self-destruct. Identifying the right angle from time to time to lock onto the target makes this aspect of the experience more interesting, hand in hand with identification on the map (which can be called up via the d-pad or touch pad, complete with scrolling and pinch function -to-zoom) of the areas where our intervention may be necessary. Further facets are added later, with the recovery of another special agent that we will have to load on our shoulders and carry while we explore the enemy base, leaving him in the vicinity of electronic devices so that we can infiltrate them and continuously covering his back. Playstation 4 trophies The twenty-nine Rocketbirds 2: Evolution Trophies are obtained by completing the six chapters of the campaign, collecting all the collectibles scattered throughout the levels and performing a series of particular actions, such as making the Space Owls end up in the slime, letting Putzki shoot himself in the first chapter and save all the hostages. Mom, look! A chicken! The dialogues between the various birds, recited in a very pleasant and convincing way in English (with subtitles in Italian), draw the picture of a product with a crude but effective humor which, however, as mentioned above, fails to capture much distances from the first episode. Even the variations on the theme are the same, with the Hardboiled Chicken finding himself floating in water or in space, equipped with a set of thrusters, and defending himself against attacking enemies in a purely shooter context. There are several engaging moments, like the bosses, but the action component of the game fails to fully express its potential due to imprecise controls, an unbalanced arsenal and some frustrating solutions that are implemented when our character is hit by repeated bursts, losing the ability to react and taking damage that can also lead to game over. The same campaign, which in the first episode could be replayed for a longer duration, is completed within three hours proceeding in a relatively expedited way, and only the Rescue mode thinks about providing a little more substance, a brand new cooperative in which four players, online or locally, can try their hand at always different recovery missions, as they are generated by a procedural system based on four scenarios. If the mechanics and structure of Rocketbirds 2: Evolution closely resemble the first chapter, as far as the technical sector is concerned, we can instead speak of a real evolution. Without prejudice to the musical accompaniment, also entrustedthis time to the beautiful songs of New World Revolution, the graphics abandon cel shading in favor of a more realistic style, characterized among other things by an interesting parallax effect that gives three-dimensionality to the scenarios while maintaining a two-dimensional game context.", "date": "2016-05-03", "grade": "7.0"}
