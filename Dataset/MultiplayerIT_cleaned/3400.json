{"name": "Scars Above", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scars-above-recensione.html", "text": "Awareness of one's limits is a tremendously important aspect in any workplace, but it is all the more so when one finds oneself competing to carve out a space within a saturated and complex market such as that of video games. It often happens that inexperienced development teams do not possess the ability to relate their projects to what that market offers, and the result is very unpleasant cold showers. We have avoided it, it is true, but reading between the lines you will probably already understood what are the problems of Mad Head Games' debut, which presents itself on paper as an interesting mix of action, shooter, RPG and even soulslike mechanics, but in fact it collides with the reality of a really, really approximate realization: We talk about it in the review of Scars Above. Story: the mysterious object Scars Above, the protagonist found herself in a dark forest A gigantic alien structure suddenly appears in Earth's orbit and a team of scientists and engineers is sent aboard a spacecraft to establish first contact and study the nature of what has been called ~the Metahedron~. However, when the unit approaches the mysterious object, an inexplicable phenomenon occurs which projects the SCAR group (Contact, Analysis and Research Expedition) onto a desolate and hostile planet. Under the command of Dr. Kate Ward, we will have the task of save our lost comrades and find a way to get home while we desperately try to survive the onslaught of monstrous creatures that inhabit this world, and from which we can defend ourselves by initially resorting to an electric knife and the pulse rifle Vera, to then enrich our arsenal of new tools. Along the way we will find the inevitable audio files that will document the dramatic experience of our colleagues, who apparently woke up some time before Kate and ventured into this difficult environment, soon becoming victims of the dark energies that inhabit it, but sometimes leaving us a trace and suggestions on how to deal with these adversities. Carried out by well-interpreted dialogues in English, subtitled in Italian, the story of Scars Above is in some ways inevitably derivative (after all, we have recently addressed the theme of the astronaut lost on a hostile planet in the review of Returnal for PC) , but lets itself be followed and seems to have something to say, in particular thanks to the subplot of the alien army that fought and was exterminated on that world. Gameplay: Good ideas but confusing Scars Above, Kate opens fire on one of the most common enemies in the game, the gouge that pops out of the ground As we mentioned at the beginning, on paper Scars Above looks like an interesting title, an action shooter equipped with RPG elements and soulslike contaminations that materialize in the presence of columns where you can save your position and restore your health, at the price, however, of the reappearance of enemies eliminated up to that moment. This solution adopted is supported by the traditional passages that act as shortcuts between one section of the scenario and another, useful precisely to avoid having to face the same opponents again once a certain area has been completed, albeit in terms of difficulty the approach becomes hardcore only in a few situations and towards the final phase of the campaign, divided into four chapters. Scars Above, one of the first bosses of the campaign: you have to warm up his orange balls to beat him The big problem is how these ideas are put into practice, because right from the very beginning the experience packaged by Mad Head Games almost has the flavor of a sketchy project with temporary assets that still has to face a long and in-depth review process and finishing, both as regards the graphics themselves and all the interactions with the scenario, including fights. Kate can hit the monsters that inhabit the planet she is on using a sort of machete, but regardless of how clumsy and its maneuvers are rough, as well as the detection of collisions, it is an option valid only against some small arachnids and which is instead completely useless when you are faced with the various creeping creatures, explosive spiders, prairie beasts, the flower-snakes, the armored yetis and of course the huge bosses that often mark the transition from one chapter to another. Scars Above, a sort of corrupted yeti from whose bowels long tentacles emerge Better to shoot, therefore: beyond some brief investigative sections  la Batman: Arkham, the vocation of Scars Above is to act asa third-person shooter but with the limits of an action role-playing game, stamina included: the protagonist can run (an action rendered very badly visually, practically decontextualized from the scenario) and roll over to dodge attacks, but paying attention to the physical resistance that can run out at the most beautiful and leave us at the mercy of the enemy on duty. Ammunition sometimes becomes a problem, reloading the equipped weapon is tedious and there are situations in which we are asked to find an imaginative way to stop a huge monster, identifying its points weak or blocking their advance in some way to then sink the blow, but it is not always easy to interpret these situations, and often we proceed by groping. Scars Above, one of the columns where you can save your position but restore already killed enemies The skill tree comes to meet us, which allows you to enhance Kate and therefore make her more resistant, speed up reloads, increase the capacity of the magazines and backpack, as well as optimize the battery that activates the many gadgets available to the protagonist, which add a some depth to the experience allowing us to activate barriers, launch spheres of flammable liquid to be ignited with the Thermal Charger, capsules that create spaces of stasis in which everything slows down and so on. Again, the plant itself testifies to enthusiasm and ideas , but then in concrete terms the gunplay turns out to be very approximate, the uncertain collisions and the cumbersome substrate that weighs down the management of the arsenal, especially in the most agitated sequences, inevitably ends up generating episodes of frustration rather than offering a tough but fair challenge. legitimized by the solidity of the mechanisms. Technical realization: dated and careless Scars Above, a look at mysterious alien structures We often talk about how the technical realization shouldn't be considered as a determining factor as regards the quality of a game, but this speech cannot ignore the effectiveness of the solutions put in place. In fact, nothing prevents the creation of a graphically less ambitious experience, equipped with simple geometries, but held together by convincing and mature stylistic choices, which are a concrete support to everything else. In the case of Scars Above we are instead faced with a product which desperately tries to aim high, in the direction of the most famous third-person action adventures, but fails in a very evident way, putting in place highly dated effects (it's been a while since we saw a puddle that doesn't react to contact?), really bad animations (the running of the protagonist takes us back twenty years), generic and low quality assets. Unsurprisingly, on the test configuration, the game runs at a basically stable 60fps at 2160p and with all presets maxed out, indeed it would have been legitimate to expect something more.", "date": "2023-02-28", "grade": "6.0"}
