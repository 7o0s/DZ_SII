{"name": "Imperium Civitas III - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/imperium-civitas-iii-recensione.html", "text": "These Romans are crazy, always immersed in traffic, it takes hours to travel a few kilometers on modern motor chariots equipped with MP3 players, explosive steering wheels and reclining seats. You should then see them when on the weekend they try to reach a lawn or a beach for the classic outing with friends... but what are three hours of traffic compared to a rancid sandwich eaten on a three square meter lawn occupied by a thousand screaming people (who then regularly leave filthy that not even snails on a mirror)? Where do the urban planning and traffic problems of the capital come from? Imperium Civitas III allows us to discover it while having fun. Not really, but we can say that some neighborhoods of Rome have grown following the same principle that you follow at the beginning of the game, when you don't know the controls well and you try to create your first city, or rather at random. We're joking, never (the writer of the article is Roman, so don't give yourself mad joy with insults), also because to do worse than building speculators you need a lot and then in Imperium Civitas III there is a handy tutorial that allows to familiarize yourself with the interface in a practical and fast way, thus allowing you to develop skills that are not required to administer a city today. In the role of a Patrician family of one of the most powerful and vast empires that Earth's history has known (maybe there was a bigger and more powerful one on Alpha Centauri, who knows), we will have to build and expand cities located throughout the territory conquered by the Romans. Put this way it seems easy, in reality there will be more than a few complications to deal with that will force us to carefully plan our every move, whether it concerns the architecture of the city or military issues. Build, build, build By starting a new campaign and choosing the place to build our first city, we will find ourselves in front of a desolate map with the resources indicated and with only a few basic buildings to act as the foundation for our future glory (if glory is). Without delaying too much, we need to examine all the key points necessary to ensure a decent life for the inhabitants, or where there are water sources to build an aqueduct, raw materials to extract, workable fields to accumulate food and piers to build fishing ports. Having understood in which direction to expand the city, it is necessary to start populating it by building lodgings for the plebeians, the real engine of every economic and military activity that we intend to develop. The interface is very comfortable and becomes practical after a few minutes of play: the building you want to build is selected from a circular menu, first looking for the category to which it belongs. For example, to build a barracks we must first select the set of military buildings and then the structure of our choice. Each constructible building has one or more functions, which can be activated by selecting it with the left mouse button and clicking on the items in the internal window that will open. Army management is also very intuitive, but more on that later. Let's start by employing the plebeians in the art of deforestation (for the collection of timber) and in that of working the land (it will be necessary to make them eat). Having built the first district and some economic activities, we embellish everything with a fountain, which can be especially useful for helping citizens discover hygiene. Is there no water? Let's extend the aqueduct and we're fine. Everything goes so smoothly that when the first fire comes we are almost disappointed. Barbarian humanism The slow start actually hides a whole series of pitfalls and problems that will soon have to be addressed and which are typical of sandbox games since the days of Sim City: is the population unhappy? Let's build a beautiful amphitheater to have some gladiator slaughtered for the joy of the people. Is there discontent? Here is immediately ready a beautiful temple that will explain to the people, just emerged from a beautiful bloody massacre between sinewy men and proud beasts (the values of the past, these unknown ones) who is to blame for the poor fishing (of Neptune, of course) and for rampant crime. Unfortunately you can't build television networks, so to make people dazzle you have to be satisfied with what the convent passes. We could still go on with the examples, but I think it is clear that every need of the population corresponds to a building to be built to solve it. Not that fixing all the problems is that easy, but complications aside this is the basis. Obviously, with the expansion of cities, so do the problems and with them the things to do to solve them. Among the various factors to considerderare, there is also the military one, that is the defense of the city from external and internal dangers. Are there tribes of barbarians at the gates of our nest? Let's send troops and forget about it. We know, they were there first, but we too are human beings and we like to kill to affirm our virile power, what can we do? Military management is very simplified and there isn't much to do other than create armies to throw at enemies. The fortifications and the leveling up of the units add a little spice, but nothing that makes you cry for a miracle or tear your hair out (which is almost gone anyway). Ups and downs Compared to other titles of the same genre, Imperium Civitas III looks good from a visual point of view, with detailed buildings and a good complexity of the scenarios. Without exceeding the system requirements, it manages to be pleasant and can be appreciated for some touch of class, resulting fluid in every occasion. It's nice to watch your creature in its full glory, with buildings in operation, discreetly modeled humans roaming everywhere and flames burning buildings left too long without maintenance. What interests most about a strategic/management video game, however, is certainly not the technical aspect, but the substantial one, i.e. the level of complexity of the simulation. From this point of view Imperium Civitas III represents an excellent compromise between complexity and usability, thanks above all to the well-designed interface which guarantees painless access even to the neophyte. It takes little to learn how to play and little to master the different sectors, even if the intelligent construction of the campaign guarantees increasingly complex scenarios and a longevity of many hours. One of the major flaws is the lack of will to take the genre a step further by choosing instead to remain in known and already widely traveled territories. Even the military part is rather weak and superficial, giving the idea of a not too thoughtful addition rather than an indispensable feature of the game's economy. Not that it is completely to be thrown away, mind you, but compared to the management part, its inadequacy is evident (basically you build troops and send them against the enemy until they are eliminated). Of course, it is probably very difficult to make the micro-management of a city coexist with the management of troops and battles, but then it would have been better to automate the latter making it one of the other elements of city life. Comment By virtue of the budget price and the undoubted quality of the management part, Imperium Civitas III deserves a full promotion. It is certainly worth playing, also because it is able to give long sleepless nights in front of the monitor and can be used to pick up the buxom neighbor to show her your latest discoveries in terms of Roman history.
