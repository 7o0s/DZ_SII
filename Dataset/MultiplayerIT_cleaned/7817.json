For those with a minimum of historical memory it is easy to answer, just go back in time to when, in 1982, the videogame transposition of ~E.T. the extra-terrestrial~ for Atari 2600 was such a big fiasco as to determine, by itself, the crisis of the entire sector and the decline of one of the most successful publishers of the time. There are even legends that tell of millions of unsold copies of the game buried in the New Mexico desert. Since then the situation hasn't improved and the term ~tie-in~ is often associated with low quality productions, which focus solely on the attraction of the license to attract unsuspecting buyers. Over the years there have been very few exceptions to the rule, which have occurred, not surprisingly, at the same time as an increase in production costs, a factor that has made it necessary for publishers to have greater control over the work of the development teams. However, it seems that these rules are not that stringent, given that in recent months we have seen tie-ins that are not exactly brilliant, such as 007 Legends and Aliens: Colonial Marines, or really mediocre, such as The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct. Well, Fast & Furious: Showdown falls right into the category of poor quality transpositions, products made in a hurry (exactly!), with very low budgets, with the sole aim of attracting less expert users thanks to the popularity of the license. reinvigorated with the theatrical release of ~Fast & Furious 6~. Between dream and reality What would be the best possible formula for a Fast & Furious tie-in? We are well aware that clandestine races have always been the main ingredient of the film saga, therefore the course part should not be missing and we should also focus decisively on the tuning factor, both in terms of upgrades for the cars and in terms of pure and simple aesthetics : spoilers, rims, paints, vinyls, neons and so on. A nice system based on experience points would guarantee the necessary progression to start from the traditional small car and then get to afford ultra-modified racing cars, while solidity would be guaranteed by a Need for Speed-style sandbox structure, or with the possibility of going to various areas of the map to participate in the related events, always in the name of entertainment and speed. The icing on the cake of such a production could be represented by a further substrate to Grand Theft Auto, given that in ~Fast & Furious~ you don't just run but you fight and there are also firefights. Switching on Xbox 360 and putting on the Fast & Furious: Showdown disc, unfortunately, the time of dreams ends and we come across the harsh reality, which as previously mentioned is that of a decidedly bad transposition. The meager main screen reflects our doubts, allowing us to access the thirty missions that make up the story mode or to try our hand at a challenge mode that only minimally guarantees an extension of the duration of the game. In fact, just three hours are enough to complete the Firebrand Games title, and the presence of a local cooperative multiplayer mode does not improve the situation in any way. Xbox 360 goals There are fifty unlockable achievements in Fast & Furious: Showdown. Most of them are obtained simply by completing the thirty missions that make up the main mode and the challenges, while for the most valuable ones, particular operations must be completed, such as respecting a certain time in a stage. We have to move a car The developers of Fast & Furious: Showdown have followed recent trends and avoided making a tie-in based specifically on ~Fast & Furious 6~, preferring a more vague approach to the film saga and thus offering us a series of different situations which, according to the storyline, they would occur between chapters; with the common denominator of the lack of Vin Diesel: evidently the rights to exploit his image are separate from the basic license. So we will not only have to deal with clandestine races, but also with some improvised action section, in which perhaps our goal is to shoot the cars that are chasing us or to hook the communication towers with a grappling hook to pull them down. The tasks are generally divided between the two protagonists of the stage, and in fact you can switch from one to the other by pressing the Y button or activate a second controller to proceed in co-op with a friend. Whatever our preference, the substance unfortunately does not change: the game suffers from rather serious problems, ranging fromfrom handling the car (unless it is normal for a car not to be able to make corners even when drifting, while a truck with a trailer can, dabbling from time to time with NOS) to literally unwatchable physics, in which the decomposed and improbable reactions from the other vehicles are the order of the day. Suffice it to say that the famous final sequence of ~Fast & Furious 5~, the one in which two cars drag a very heavy armored vault, is represented in one of the first levels and in the worst possible way, with this huge safe being rattled from side to side. the other side of the screen as if it were weightless, while the chains that connect it to the cars pass merrily through any obstacle or enemy vehicle. The problems also extend to artificial intelligence, with opponents who often eliminate themselves by hitting a vehicle frontally before even reaching us, and clearly also concern the technical sector, literally a generation behind between low-definition textures, angular polygonal models and dishes, devoid of any effects, which move within bare and lifeless scenarios. Not to mention the noticeable dips in frame rates once things get a little hectic. Fast & Furious: Showdown is a bad tie-in and certainly one of the worst games of the year", "date": "2013-05-27", "grade": "3.0"}
