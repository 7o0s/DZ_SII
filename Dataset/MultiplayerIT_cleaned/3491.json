{"name": "NBA 2K20", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k20-la-recensione.html", "text": "Preparing to write the review of NBA 2K20 also means having the awareness of finding yourself in front of what in recent years has been considered by many to be the best sports simulation around, not only in the restricted panorama dedicated to basketball but also in what it embraces all disciplines. And how can you blame him, considering that apart from a few small stumbles, the work done by the Visual Concepts team has improved year after year, offering quality and playability on the parquet capable of exalting all fans of the NBA basketball championship . The most heated criticisms over time have been those related to microtransactions, of which not even NBA 2K20 as we are about to see does it by hand. However, 2K Sports' business model must not overshadow the good things done by the developers, who are also able to do a job this year that impresses with its peaks in quality. If you are curious to know what NBA 2K20 has in store for you, all you have to do is continue reading. What's new: a high-level Career In terms of mode, NBA 2K20 remains practically identical to its predecessor, entrusting the only real novelty to the presence of the WNBA league, or the women's league with its twelve teams. Although in reality EA Sports had already thought about it at the time with NBA Live following the route traced with FIFA, for the NBA 2K series it is in fact the first time that the WNBA is included. With NBA Live 20 desaparecido at least for now, it's still nice that the reference basketball simulation has decided to take this step, even if confined to some very specific modes and therefore not available in all of those present in the game. The second novelty concerns My Career, a type of mode in which the NBA 2K series has always been strong, in some cases also making use of special collaborations such as that of Spike Lee for NBA 2K16. This is definitely the case again this year, as the story of the career mode was fine-tuned with the involvement of the production company SpringHill Entertainment, founded by LeBron James and Maverick Carter. The other excellent names concern the cast, among which those of the actors Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson who lend their faces to some characters in the story stand out. After the Chinese parenthesis, the story returns to American soil to tell us the story of its protagonist nicknamed Che: a nickname rather in line with his nature as a leader attentive to the needs of his companions. Right from the start, our Che will be divided between what is right to do in the face of other people's choices of dubious morality, up to questioning his ascent to the NBA championship. Between falls and rises, the story mode of NBA 2K20 does not betray expectations, putting a mature and compelling story on the plate. Especially initially you don't play much, it's true, just as it's true that the choices are only limited, but since there are ways to simply play basketball in the game, it's undoubtedly worth getting caught up in the narrative aspect of the game. As far as the editor is concerned, the character is fully configurable both in terms of physical appearance and abilities, selecting basic parameters such as weight and height, and then moving on to athletic skills and fundamental potential which he can then express along the way. The modalities What has been described so far undoubtedly represents the heart of what Visual Concepts has achieved for NBA 2K20 in terms of content, but My Career and the WNBA are obviously not the only modes in the game. In fact, the most loyal fans of the series will be able to navigate the menus that lead to playing single games or entire seasons without any problem, up to My League and My GM. The latter mode allows you to take care of a team by dealing above all with the managerial aspects, renewed through the addition of some action points that define the activities that can be carried out between one game and another, plus a skill tree that gives a role-playing cut to the our work as a GM. Of course, My Team is also always present, an online mode that has been classified as the Ultimate Basketball Team for years now. Just My Team was the main accused by the controversy related to microtransactions, present practically everywhere in NBA 2K20. If elsewhere the use of real money is proposed as a somewhat hidden possibility, inside My Team at times it seems to be actually inside a kind of casino, complete with slot machines, roulette wheels and sparkling lights. Unfortunately, the risk is that of having to deal in online modes with people who have built their team with the help of euro, putting real skill in the background. As mentioned, elsewhere the situation is fortunately different: the My Career mode in fact allows you to take out real money to give a ~boost~ to the protagonist's skills, but the progression speed of our character is sufficient not to make you feel the need to spend money. Unless you want to become the new Michael Jordan in three seconds. Playstation 4 trophies NBA 2K20 brings fifty-one Trophies. Along with the usual platinum obtainable by completing all the other objectives, we find two of the gold type, ten silver and thirty-eight bronze. To get them you have to work hard between the different modes in the game, with particular attention to the My Career mode where you have to perform some feats on the field. The gameplay In the absence of serious reasons to make revolutions, at the end of the current generation the game dynamics of NBA 2K20 are proposed in a conservative guise. Already being able to count on a top-level simulation apparatus, the choice of Visual Concepts was to smooth out the defects present in last year's edition, intervening above all on the movement dynamics of the players. Those who know the series are therefore able to feel at ease after a few minutes, possibly resorting to the training system to refresh or learn about the less clear aspects of the game. Once we get on the parquet, we realize that the attention of the NBA 2K20 developers has been directed above all to the physics of the athletes. A slightly slower pace of play than a year ago is coupled with a renewed fluidity in the movements, also thanks to the addition of new animations that act as a link between one move and another. From this point of view, the defensive phase is perhaps still a little behind, due to an excessive static nature of the players marking, especially when there is a fair amount of movement by the forwards. Playing with WNBA teams, one feels the difference that one would expect compared to the use of men: lower strength and explosiveness must necessarily be compensated with the circle of the ball, thus attempting to reach the basket through team play. Physically, the women's models might have required a little more work. Graphics and sound: like on TV The technical sector of NBA 2K20 offers a glance that is truly remarkable in some shots. The graphic quality of this series is nothing new, but it's still nice to see how even at the end of the generation the guys from Visual Concepts have put themselves to work to improve the yield of the field. As far as athletes are concerned, stars like LeBron James are obviously the ones that are more well-groomed and closer to their real appearance, but we can also say that a good job has been done on secondary players. The presence of connections from the sidelines and interlude shows makes the overall experience very close to the livable one watching the matches on television, with the exception of a few shots that capture the subject a bit stunned. The soundtrack takes us through the menus with the usual series of songs capable of transmitting the right ~vibes~, while once we take the field the commentary follows the action quite punctually. Note the presence of some loading screens a little longer than average, even after the publication of the patch with which this type of problem was addressed.", "date": "2019-09-18", "grade": "8.8"}
