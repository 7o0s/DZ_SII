{"name": "King's Bounty: The Legend - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kings-bounty-the-legend-recensione.html", "text": "Don't call it a clone Browsing the Internet or looking for information in the forums near your home, you may happen to see the phrase ~Might & Magic clone~ associated next to the name ~King's Bounty: The Legend~. In truth, already after a few tens of minutes, the title of Katauri Interactive demonstrates how much the term clone appears extremely improper and reductive. The titles along the lines of Heroes of Might & Magic, rather than Warlords or Age of Wonders establish their playful roots - turn-based combat - on a terrain strongly oriented towards strategy, the exploitation of resources or in any case their planning more generally. King's Bounty instead, in a similar way to what happens in the Disciples series, exploits and enhances its RPG component to recreate a context capable of offering, without interruption, elements typical of (Action) RPGs and, precisely, of the ~old~ ones fantasy turn-based strategy. The origins Older players may have played the original King's Bounty. Published way back in 1990 by the same developer - Jon Van Caneghem - who then, again under the New World Computing label, would give birth to the Heroes of Might & Magic series. Cult saga of the 90s which, together with the RPG counterpart  Might & Magic, in fact  has gladdened the hours of many fans of the genre and not. So much New World Computing, that the two aforementioned series have not resisted the impact with the new millennium and, sadly, are occasionally dusted off by Ubisoft for some spin off. The Magic Number After selecting one of the available professions - Warrior, Paladin or Magician - the player will find himself controlling his hero on an (almost) three-dimensional game area that can be freely explored in real time. The first approach is unsettling, in the sense that the basic structure of the game has all the typical stylistic features of more or less action-oriented role-playing games, complete with a main quest divided into different phases and, in support, a series of secondary missions solvable  sporadically  even in different ways. Unfortunately, both the narrative plot and the quality of the dialogues and texts of the missions generally settle on medium-low levels. It's a pity, because there would be no shortage of ironic or noteworthy ideas... which, however, are too often wasted by a style that is too childish and superficial. In addition to the attack, defense and magic points (mana) values, the hero's characteristics are described by a skill tree - divided into three areas of specialization - very similar to the one used by the most popular MMOGs on the market where, thanks to the use of different types of runes (yes, they are also three) it will be possible to enhance (guess it? Up to a maximum of three times) the characteristics of your hero - aka the Royal Treasure Seeker. These runes will mainly be earned upon leveling up, but they can also be found by dedicating themselves to exploring the map or - during the advanced stages - by converting a part of the gold in our possession. the basic structure has all the stylistic features typical of role-playing games The Magic Number Areas of specialization cover the physical, psychic and magical areas. Rather than offering a multitude of enhancements with dubious benefits, the developers have preferred to focus on a relatively small number of elements but with clear differentiation. Although depending on the chosen profession, at least initially, the fighting style may be excessively unbalanced towards one tactical approach rather than another, the growth system and the nature of the objects and upgrades in play guarantee a gradual and flexible evolution, in able to better customize the gaming experience. A world to explore Initially it is natural to underestimate the importance of the exploratory phase, understanding it as an obligatory but empty appetizer to the heart of the game: the fighting. Instead, the planning of the areas to visit, as well as the dexterity necessary to avoid too impervious clashes (a sort of game within the game), represent essential elements. In addition to being the backdrop for the unfolding of the main plot and the various missions, the map hides treasures, crystals (which can be used mainly to memorize spells) and special flags that attribute the so-called command points. The latter add up throughout the game and represent the total number of units that can be hired - and commanded - by the hero. The presence of command points and the careful positioning of enemies on the game world (which do not ~level~ as the game progresses), have allowed designers to predict, roughly, the player's behaviors and choiceshours, effectively limiting freedom of action but elegantly remedying the typical problems of free roaming games. From this point of view, the same method of recruiting troops, which provides for a finite number of troops (which repopulate only when certain events occur) for each recruiting station, is a clear way to keep the difficulty level high . On the other hand, the fights could disappoint more than one player, especially if they are looking for wide-ranging clashes, characterized by a great variety of units and choices. King's Bounty fights look more like a game of chess than an actual battle A world to explore The mechanics provide a classic system based on action points and with an expected movement on an area divided with hexagonal cells. Multiple units of the same type are grouped under a single ~pawn~ that has health equal to the sum of the components. Normally, the player will be able to command up to a maximum of 5 pawns, this number can be temporarily increased through spells or special powers. While the opponents can easily reach even double. Basically there are melee, ranged attack and magic units. There are even special features that can be used only once during the clashes or that are recharged after several rounds. The hero, on the other hand, does not take part directly in the action but ~limits~ himself to influencing the attack and defense characteristics of the units on the field and casting spells. In practice, the fights of King's Bounty look more like a game of chess than a real battle. The very management of the units' hit points and their attack and defense values minimize - but do not cancel - the random component and enhance planning and acumen skills. This means that especially in the first hours of the game, when the hero's skills and the type of troops available are rather limited, the clashes risk being ~forced~ and one-way, just like a sort of (hugely) enhanced version of the millennial game ~rock-paper-scissors~ or, if you prefer, the typical jRPG combat system. In truth, the merits of the system of rules and combat designed by Katuri come out only over the distance and only after having fully become familiar with the game mechanics. Rage and magic During the - long, very long - vicissitudes proposed by the game, our hero (in the true sense of the term) will have the opportunity to get hold of a mythological ~Rage Casket~ which, certainly not immediately, will allow us to exploit the services of four different Spirits of Rage. The latter offer the possibility of using as many different additional spells (for a total of sixteen) which will follow an independent and parallel path of enhancement and development with respect to that of the Hero. In a nutshell, the more a Spirit is used, the more experience it will gain at the expense of those less used. Each of them feeds on special rage points that increase during the fights - up to a certain maximum limit - by killing enemy troops or by losing your own (to a greater extent). Unlike mana which recharges in moments of rest, rage points are consumed during the exploration phases: a detail that is only apparently secondary. As if that weren't enough, in King's Bounty our hero will be able to start a family with lots of dependent children. Wife and children represent additional bonuses and additional upgrade slots. There is even the possibility of a divorce, complete with the division of assets - in our case: gold and special objects... Fairytale graphics Graphically King's Bounty does not disappoint and, indeed, amazes. Both the two-dimensional elements and the modeling of the three-dimensional environments always appear inspired and varied, even if not exactly with a great personality. Following the Blizzard school - which began with Warcraft 3, continued with World of Warcraft and presumably followed by the next Diablo - King's Bounty follows the path of vivid color combinations characterized by saturated shades, tending towards pastels. All to give life to a real fairytale world. On the other hand, the audio system is decidedly subdued. Both from the point of view of the anonymous soundtrack and of the effects in general. Comment King's Bounty: Legend is something of a videogame paradox. Admittedly anchored to the logic and mechanics of the past, it manages to offer fresh and very personal gameplay. There is no shortage of forcing and ingenuity which, especially in the first hours of the game, risk undermining the experience. Yet, just like a dieel, once he's gone, no one stops him anymore. Also by virtue of a play system so charismatic that it can afford the introduction of ever new game elements even after several hours of play. Certainly, if you are a die-hard fan of action games only this is not the title for you, but if you are a fan of the genre it should not be missing from your collection, although the fights may be too simplified for the most demanding.
