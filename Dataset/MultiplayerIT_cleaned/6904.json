It must be said that the guys from Future Games of London have succeeded, enriching this Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge with a scenario undoubtedly endowed with its own personality: Robin is a boy who lives in a house built on a large tree, committed to saving inhabitants of Darkwood from the harassment of the sheriff and his henchmen and then train them to fight the enemy. The successful design of the characters and a delightful 16-bit style graphics do the rest, for a title that still knows how to defend itself also from a playful point of view. All on the same tree Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge could be defined as a mix between an RPG, a strategy and a village simulator, all imbued with the immediacy necessary for a mobile title. The game is basically divided into two parts, the first relating to the various combat missions by completing which you get money and resources useful for expanding your community, and the second where you manage the life of Robin and the other inhabitants saved from the clutches of the sheriff. The base camp is represented by the huge oak tree which houses the protagonist's house, and which can be expanded by constructing new buildings: already in the very early stages of the game, during the tutorial, you find yourself busy building houses for the newcomers, academies for train them in the art of war, warehouses to hold food supplies, workshops to tune equipment, and so on. Each job requires certain quantities of silver, wood and time to complete, all elements that can be collected by completing the missions but which the less patient can also buy with real money through the appropriate in-game shop. However, Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge is not a too invasive structure as regards in-app purchases, and players who do not want to spend a penny will still be able to continue the adventure without excessive hassles. Which, moreover, offers a more than satisfactory amount of content and will keep those who want to get to the end busy for a good handful of hours. Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge is not unforgettable but it is still a pleasant free to play Regarding the more strictly RPG part of Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge, this takes place during the various missions which are almost all reduced to scenarios with very simple objectives such as eliminating a certain number of enemies, protecting an ally, destroying a structure and so on. In these phases of the game, the shot from above allows you to have a broad view of the field, with a control system which instead is based entirely on simple touches to be made on the touch screen: a tap on a character to select it, a another to indicate where to move and another on an opponent to attack him with the weapons supplied are the basic functions, and everything works very well in the initial stages of the adventure, while in more advanced and complex fights you feel a little missing more immediate commands on their soldiers. It must also be said that, since the gameplay is deliberately simplified to meet the mobile audience, the fact that the missions all look a bit like each other does not help the longevity of Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge, which objectively could get boring well before the credits. Another point against the Ubisoft product is the need to be connected to the internet to play, given that upon launch the software immediately relies on the servers to allow progress to be transferred to other devices as well. While remaining a pleasant title - also thanks to a truly delightful audiovisual sector - it is undeniable that Little Raiders: Robin's Revenge lacks that something extra to stand out in the boundless iOS playful panorama.", "date": "2014-09-20", "grade": "7.4"}
