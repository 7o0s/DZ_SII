{"name": "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex-2.html", "text": "Among the titles available up to now for the PSP, the FPS genre has not been excessively exploited, indeed after the release of Coded Arms we had to wait for Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex (from now on only GITS) to see anything again. If the first could easily embody the type of frenetic shooter focused exclusively on action, GITS is proposed in a different way, focusing more on the tactical component with some brief hints of RPG mold, or at least these were the intentions of the developers. Technically GITS makes a decent impression, the polygonal models are good even if they often lack variety, the textures are quite defined even if the spaces in which our character will move are small, repetitive and unfortunately sometimes interrupted by uploads. From a scenic point of view, the Ghost in The Shell license has been exploited really badly, apart from the Tachinoma and the weapons of the protagonists there is very little of the cyberpunk future created by Masamune Shirow. GITS also features LAN multiplayer, no online battles but only with a few friends with PSPs. It is possible to play as both a member of Section 9 and a Tachinoma in single or team deathmatches for up to six players. We can use the weapons collected during the single player but strangely our character settings do not remain in memory. The clashes are sufficiently well done even if at times we encountered a little delay in the connection, probably due to an imperfect software synchrony of the wireless network. Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex had almost made us ~dream~ at the time of its announcement but after this thorough test we cannot be satisfied. The adventure is too simple, Shirow's universe has been exploited too little, the level design seems done too quickly to be able to achieve the goal, not to mention the RPG component which should have given depth and instead is only hinted at . Right now there are very few alternatives to GITS so we still recommend you to take a look at it, if nothing else the technical part is sufficiently well done. Pros FPS on PSP Technically decent Cons Too simple and rushed level design Doesn't exploit the world of Ghost in the Shell as it should The title developed by Production I.G. and produced by Bandai is a first person shooter set in the world created by the great mangaka Masamune Shirow, world-class icon of science fiction comics. We will have four characters to choose from to face the adventure: Motoko Kusanagi, Batou, Saito and Togusa all members of Section 9; we will have to try to solve the mystery behind a terrorist attack that took place without any provocation, but only in order to avoid the publication of the H-88 report. What lies behind the phantom H-88 report? Only by reaching the end of the game will we understand more. The missions are very linear, they usually take place in not very large environments and with various objectives but in principle to complete them we will have to make extensive use of our arsenal. The pure action missions will be replaced by those of the stealth type or others in which we will have to act as an armed escort. Before seeing a well-done mission we will have to play about a dozen or so, initially in fact the ~levels~ seem to have been created too quickly, and to define infiltration missions stealth it takes a lot of courage. Unfortunately this component has not been exploited at all, for example if we are discovered during one of these missions we will always have the possibility of saving ourselves by killing the sentinels in a limited time, who, although expert guards of the future will not be equipped with any tool to give the 'alarm really not very credible. In principle, other stages will see us solve simple puzzles, often killing our target and his personal guards. Then fire at will and nothing more. Sometimes while playing we had problems identifying our goal, but not because of our inability but because the developers didn't bother to create a polygonal model that differed from his bodyguards. Things are not improving in the missions in which we will act as bodyguards, we will not be able to get away from our ~protg~ and however vigilant we will always be surprised by the enemy who will suddenly appear before our eyes. Each character in Section 9 has its own unique abilities, but if we face the missions first with one character and then with another, unfortunately we will not notice any changes, a bad blow to the replay value of the title. The arsenal has more than 50 mdifferent models of weapons and of these we will be able to show off throughout the adventure, also being able to recover those left on the ground by dead enemies and unlocking new ones during the action. The RPG elements are almost all concentrated on the Tachinoma, mini tanks of the future, controlled by an A.I. autonomous, who will follow us in our missions. Each Tachi has its own personality which in theory should vary its behavior during the missions, unfortunately this does not happen if not minimally. The only thing that will give us satisfaction will be equipping these mini tanks with the best possible and imaginable weapons of destruction. Finally we must remember that during the missions it will be possible to enter the Tachinoma and pilot them, only that we will not derive any benefit from them, nor will we be able to make particular maneuvers as happened in Ghost in the Shell for PlayStation.", "date": "2006-01-31", "grade": null}
