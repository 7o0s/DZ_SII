The reason is simple: the apparently questionable choice to continue using a limited tool like Adventure Game Studio has allowed Gilbert to worry much less about programming his games and invest more time and attention on essential aspects, such as good puzzles, a well narrated noir plot and really interesting characters. The same and identical recipe which, fortunately, is the basis of the new The Blackwell Deception. A ghost friend Let us clarify immediately that, despite being the fourth chapter of the saga and although there are several references to the previous episodes, Deception proves to be easily accessible even to a neophyte audience, taking up the mysterious story of the medium Rosangela and her spirit guide Joey Mallone in the umpteenth self-contained adventure. A new murder sets off a noir-investigative story in which the protagonist, thanks to her paranormal powers and the help of her partner, interacts with the living and the dead with the dual mission of leading the ghosts to the afterlife and discovering who or what is behind a series of mysterious killings. Yet those who have had the opportunity to play the previous three episodes are undoubtedly able to appreciate the way in which the series has evolved over the last few years: many of the narrative ingenuities seen in Legacy, Unbound and Convergence have finally disappeared here, and after some schizophrenic attempts Gilbert finally seems to have decided to follow a clear and coherent direction as regards the characterization of his characters. Rosangela is no longer the sociophobic and complexed girl of the first episodes, showing in Deception various unpublished aspects of her personality, both through the continuous and amusing dialogues with Joey, and because the plot will lead her to meet old friends and ask questions about the meaning of her paranormal abilities. Mysterious and perfectly narrated, the game's plot only raises an eyebrow in the last few minutes, when a hasty ending and perhaps premature credits leave the impression that something has been forgotten along the way. Once again all the sentences of each character have been dubbed in a professional way to involve the player even more, but although the voices are almost always pleasant and spot on, they too often end up lacking emphasis or credibility in some particularly emotional moments. Unfortunately however, even if the English of Deception proves to be rather elementary, those who don't know the language end up bumping into the absence of any type of Italian localization, a lack obviously linked to the small size of the project rather than to a disinterest of the developer. New gadgets and little news As in the previous episodes, the peculiarity of The Blackwell Deception lies in the possibility of switching from the character of Rosangela to that of Joey at any time, using her skills to solve some puzzles. For example, the jacket-and-fedora ghost can float in the air, pass through walls or move through buildings without being noticed by flesh-and-blood characters, but his inability to grab objects pushes the player to look for alternative ways to interact with the scenario or to ask for the help of her medium friend. By controlling Rosangela instead, we find ourselves faced with a more traditional approach, despite the fact that the protagonist is able to communicate with both the living and the dead. A very successful novelty is represented by the introduction of the myPhone, a mobile device clearly inspired by the most popular smartphone of the moment and which Rosangela can use to obtain new information and clues on the puzzles to be solved and on the people involved. By accessing the online search engine, for example, it is possible to enter names and acronyms to obtain telephone numbers, addresses or consult any news reports, an idea that is only partially explored in Deception, but which adds a very successful text adventure component to the overall experience. Equally welcome was the choice not to insert a hint system that was too lenient, and if in other adventures a key is enough to know the solution to an intricate puzzle, in the game by Wadjet Eye Games one is always driven to think: not that the puzzles are particularly difficult, mind you, but to get small hints and cluesyou need to consult your own notes or ask Joey's opinion. Finally, with Deception, the author wanted to introduce some small innovations also in stylistic terms, although in this case with some ups and downs. Little can be contested against the catchy soundtrack, composed among other things by very pleasant jazz songs, but the graphic design is partially weakened by inconsistent juxtapositions, with backdrops and pixel art sprites that find it difficult not to clash with the illustrated portraits of personages. However, everything takes a back seat when you find yourself in front of spectacular views of New York City faithfully redesigned in pixel art or extremely detailed backdrops, to the delight of fans of old-fashioned adventures.", "date": "2011-11-02", "grade": "8.2"}
