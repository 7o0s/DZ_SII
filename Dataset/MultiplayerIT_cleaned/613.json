In this case, using a special police force, which uses the city's camera system to track down writers and which has no qualms about killing someone, especially when there are no witnesses. Trane is one of these writers, at the beginning of the game he is thrown out of the house because of his dangerous pastime and we will have to help him build a reputation around New Radius. Time to organize our ~book~ and we will be able to throw ourselves into the fray: twelve settings each made up of various stages, in which we will have to complete missions that will transform us into legends of graffiti. Trane can write and stick custom stickers just about anywhere, and often we'll be faced with mini-challenges like ~cover this wall with ten stickers in one minute~. The fundamental objectives of each stage, however, are mostly represented by the creation of graffiti in particular points, almost always with the aim of covering the drawings made by one of the many gangs that roam the city. Important objectives can also be the fights with the members of these gangs, fights that usually occur when we are close to completing an ~area~. It lasts the life of graffiti artists... Fights are far from uncommon in Getting Up. The amount of of graffiti that can be created & egrave; huge. Game goals As mentioned, the various Getting Up stages are characterized by the presence of a certain number of ~missions~ to be completed. When it comes to ~scratching~, you have to put the character in front of the surface to be painted, activate the appropriate mode and move the right analog stick to fill the preset strokes of the graffiti we have selected with color (and which must necessarily appear in our book), being careful not to form drops of color. When, on the other hand, there is a fight to be had, one must plan a strategy according to the opponent and rely on the parry or evasive maneuver when he attacks. Then, of course, we answer: between kicks and punches, Trane can execute spectacular combos (which are enhanced by a momentary ~bullet time~) or devastating holds, or he can still pick up a whole series of blunt objects (with their own energy bar) that amplify the effectiveness of his shots. Once the combat system has been mastered, it is possible to face even more enemies at the same time without too much difficulty, remembering however to collect the cans of beer (energy) when the health indicator is running low. One of several sections where you climb or traverse difficult sections. Sticker or graffiti? The settings are well done, even if not very varied. Control system If drawing and combat are applications that work quite well in Getting Up, the same cannot be said of the character's agility in difficult situations. When we're being hunted down by cops and we're low on energy, the game doesn't make things easier for us: Trane's climbing skills come out at the wrong time (for example when you turn to flee but you're close to a ~scalable~ object) , and so frustrating situations occur that often lead to game over, situations that could have been limited by a little more attention to the control system. On the other hand, the character has an easy time when it comes to jumping from one point to another (even for respectable distances) and when he has to collect objects, therefore ~uncomfortable~ episodes in which you have to be precise to the millimeter are avoided . Is not serious; the case of throwing yourself down; for a bad graffiti... ... also because there is always time to redo! The metro is not available at night. a quiet place. Technical realization The western school guarantees content and depth, the eastern one an undoubtedly better technical result. This is what comes to mind while playing Getting Up: the Atari title certainly boasts good graphics, but is unable to handle them with the fluidity seen in some Japanese products. So on the one hand we have a good design and nice characters, on the other a dancer frame rate (especially on PS2), an average set of textures and the almost total lack of special effects. The environments are quite large and detailed, but tend to repeat themselves in appearance and interaction is often limited to the possibility of ~scratching~ everywhere. The sound sector is extremely rich and ~signed~, and if you like the genre it could really excite you, but the effects don't shineor absolutely for the quality and the same can be said of the Italian dubbing. Cross-platform Getting Up promises graffiti and fisticuffs on PS2, Xbox and PC. The technically better version is obviously the latter, above all for the level of detail and fluidity, but in general the differences are not too marked. Comment Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure is a great game, especially if we look at the substance: twelve locations, each divided into various stages, are definitely a lot for the current average of video games. Not to mention the drawings that Trane learns to make as the story progresses: some graffiti are really beautiful and fun, and before each mission it is possible to choose which ones to ~take with you~. The game structure is always engaging, the plot is compelling and in many ways innovative. It is a pity that this content is not supported by a first-level technical realization, especially on PS2. But it is also true that, having to choose, one can be satisfied with an uncertain frame rate when everything else is taken care of and well done. End of module Pros: Good and engaging game structure Excellent plot Long-lived and varied Cons: Only fair technical realization Italian dubbing not up to par Control system sometimes cumbersome If drawing and combat are applications that work quite well in Getting Up, the same cannot be said of the character's agility in difficult situations. Extremely publicized, for a whole series of reasons (not least the controversy aroused by the ~graffiti~ issue), Getting Up finally arrives in stores. It's the bet of Marc Ecko, who passes with ease from designing clothes to writing screenplays for video games: a game in which the drawings on the walls are considered not only an artistic expression, but also a means of sending important messages. To take the concept to extremes, Ecko has set his story in New Radius, an imaginary metropolis governed with an iron fist by a mayor who has promised to eliminate the problem of ~graffiti~ and who intends to honor his commitment by any means.", "date": "2006-02-17", "grade": null}
