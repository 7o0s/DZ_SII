A technically modest console, based on the idea of the GamePad which however had done very little to leave its mark, weighed down by system software worthy of the last century and penalized by Nintendo's usual backwardness towards the online sector. ~Nobody wants a Wii U~, it was said, and the numbers mercilessly confirmed this lack of interest from the public, even more sensational given that we were talking about the successor of that Wii also known as ~mister 100 million~. One year later we are still faced with hardware that is certainly not next-gen, the GamePad is still a not very incisive and often marginal solution in game economies, the system software has only partially mitigated its innate defects and online is still seen by the Kyoto company as a sort of cerberus to be faced with fear, step by step. Yet Wii U is no longer a dead man walking, but on the contrary a system that in the meantime has defeated distrust and has entered the homes of many players around the world, perhaps making itself truly desirable for the first time. Finally, a commercial product to look forward to with optimism. The reason? Soon said: Super Mario 3D World, Bayonetta 2, Wind Waker HD, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros. A string of bombs dropped with surgical precision, a series of absolute quality exclusives capable of redefining the contours of an experience that has become objectively attractive for every gamer. At the end of this extraordinary cycle, and waiting for the next one on paper just as exciting, Nintendo has chosen to place a very tasty icing on its splendid cake. A mushroom-shaped cherry. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is a little gem that you really shouldn't miss out on Long live the money Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is a minor project for Nintendo, for sure: the ambition and resources used for its development are not even comparable with any of the nineties listed above. Yet, at the same time, the protagonist's deeds reveal a creative ferment and a boost in game design that makes Captain Toad the most ~indie~ of the games published by the big N in recent months. What would appear to be a contradiction in terms instead becomes much more acceptable and understandable by discovering the story behind the finished product that we now have in our hands: in fact, the genesis of the project has its roots as far back as 2011, a period in which the EAD team Tokyo they were studying gameplay prototypes to be applied to what would later be Super Mario 3D World. Among the many ideas, the one of creating small compact worlds, mini levels to be rotated at will via the controller, stood out. In an initial phase, the protagonist character of these micro worlds possessed the ability to jump, an element which however went in direct contrast with the dimensions of the explorable areas. At a later stage, the idea of using Link as the main character was evaluated, but Miyamoto rejected the proposal, however, inviting the team to continue the development of the concept. Captain Toad was therefore the right man in the right place: he appeared for the first time in Mario Galaxy, nice and with the right personality, and above all equipped with a backpack so heavy as to prevent him from jumping. Perfect, then. That prototype consequently came to life in the aforementioned Super Mario 3D World as a minigame, planting a seed destined to germinate with this Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. What is certain is that we are faced with a decidedly unconventional hero, not to say unlikely: without any particular ability, devoid of special powers, and only able to walk through the levels and at most go up or down the stairs and press switches . Certainly not a lion-hearted one, on the contrary, nor moved by philanthropic instincts: more simply he is a treasure hunter, with the desire to get rich by looking for gold and precious stones. Bad luck has it that in one of his adventures, with his partner Toadette at his side, the couple runs into the evil Wingo, a giant bird who in an instant takes possession not only of the treasure, but also kidnaps the poor little mushroom. This is essentially the incipit, but also practically the entire narrative plot used to connect the 64 ~basic~ levels of the main adventure, divided into three books. During the progression it will happen that you then find yourself controlling both the captain and Toadette, albeit with no type of difference in practice with the exception of the aesthetic element. Mario who? The gameplay takes up exactly the same mechanics tasted brieflyin the brackets of Super Mario 3D World, but applying them to a much wider context in a greater variety of levels. This essentially means that the Nintendo adventure passes through a multitude of microworlds that enclose the puzzles on which the game mechanics are based: in summary, the goal of each level is always to reach the Hyper Star usually positioned in an area apparently inaccessible via switches, moving walkways, ladders, cranks, pipes, cannons and all sorts of devilry. The management of the camera, the rotation of the same and the exploration of the environments has here not only the aim of providing the ideal point of view for the development of the action, but instead becomes the central protagonist within the game mechanics: its use is in fact fundamental to understand the structure of the level, find the positioning of the key objects and more simply to find the solution to the puzzles. The wise use of perspective, and of all that it hides, is the keystone of the experience of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker: an original, fresh and extraordinarily stimulating solution, which continually surprises for the variety of situations that EAD Tokyo is managed to come up with. Getting your hands on the star therefore allows you to conclude that specific stage, but going to its conquest with your head down is definitely not the ideal choice for a self-respecting treasure hunter: on the contrary, the best thing is to work to collect even the 3 diamonds scattered throughout the level, often well hidden. Usually it is precisely the recovery of the latter that requires the greatest effort, which can often translate into having to repeat the challenge several times. To say that you have completely archived a level, then there is also an extra task to complete, which however is revealed only after the first ~attempt~: for example, collect a golden mushroom, or get to the end without taking damage, or pocket a certain amount of coins and so on. An incentive to retrace one's steps which, however, is never perceived as a stretch, or worse as a not very noble means of forcibly extending the longevity of the title. On the contrary, thanks to the extraordinary setting of the difficulty curve of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, we find ourselves experiencing these further steps as something natural, an autonomous desire for perfectionism which - being concretely achievable - gives continuous and constant satisfaction to the player . And it's a good thing that's the case, because diamonds are in all respects the pass to progress in the adventure: every handful of levels, in fact, you find yourself in front of a kind of ideal gate, destined to open wide only if you have a number enough of the gems in question. It is clear how a mechanic of this type absolutely needs a quality level design, and from this point of view Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker represents a sort of authentic manual, a Bignami capable of explaining, much better than many words, for which why Nintendo is so loved by gamers. In the few square meters of the worlds that make up the game there is such a density of contents and ideas, all coherent with each other and perfectly functional, that they truly make the experience a continuous pleasure. To ensure further variety to a progression that never actually shows to be out of breath, the team has also added some variations on the theme, which translate into levels during which the protagonist finds himself inside a mine cart in run on the tracks. In these cases the gameplay transforms, requiring you to shoot turnips at enemies and objects using the GamePad screen and its gyroscope as a crosshair. A pleasant diversion, to which are also added bonus stages based on the super pickaxe or the double cherry thanks to which Captain Toad can totally indulge in his greed by simply dedicating himself to collecting as many coins as possible. Matter of perspective As for the technical component, the graphics engine is the same as Super Mario 3D World, and the very close kinship translates into an aspect that is immediately approachable to that of the plumber's last splendid platform. However, the developers have interpreted this element as a starting point, and not an arrival point: if it is true that most of the levels recall locations in the Fairy Kingdom seen in the aforementioned blockbuster, the extraordinary variety of settings and the focus on decidedly small portions makes in fact the progression is always stimulating not only from a purely content point of view, but also from an aesthetic one. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is a delightful game, very colorful and anything but poorly technicalcarefully: by pressing the X key to bring the camera closer, you can appreciate even more clearly the high level of detail, the attention to detail, and more generally the goodness of the work of Nintendo's artists. The lighting technology is always remarkable, the real flagship of the graphics engine used in the first-party titles on Wii U. Longevity, also considering the reduced price at which it is sold, is more than sufficient: we took just under 6 hours to get to the end of the third book and see the final sequence (which, by the way, hilariously reveals how the game - attention, minispoilers - is in fact a ~prequel~ to the facts of Super Mario 3D World), but remaining well far from the goal of 100% completion. There is also a book made up of extra levels, allowing among other things to go through some of the stages taken from 3D World in a sort of bizarre reversal of roles. Finally, the announced compatibility with amiibo should be noted, destined to be integrated through a future update and of which at the time of writing, however, nothing more is known. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is therefore a beautiful game, but not perfect for this. The biggest flaw is probably related to the camera: the totally manual management is in fact necessary and mandatory to support the very foundations of the gameplay, but in some cases its operation appears slightly frustrating and cumbersome. But it is the low budget nature of the project, and the limits that have obviously been imposed, that give rise to situations that leave a bitter taste in the mouth: the cloying presence of only one save slot makes it less easy to use for those who share the console with siblings, parents or friends, and there is also no particular type of integration with the Miiverse. And it is really a pity that there are in fact only two bosses within the entire game, which are recycled three times each even in rather different levels: considering that the extraordinary creativity of the game designers finds a shining expression also in these situations, it would have been nice to see it applied with more bosses. But on the other hand this could be one of the elements to be developed in a possible sequel, which we really hope will be justified by the sales of this brilliant debut.", "date": "2014-12-09", "grade": "8.0"}
