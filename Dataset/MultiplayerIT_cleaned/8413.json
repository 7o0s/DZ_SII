A mix of design, fluid frame rate and graphic definition that interfaced with hardcore gameplay, based on track memorization and of the best trajectories. Although the series created by Psygnosis has somewhat lost its following over the years, as it has not been adequately relaunched, attempts at imitation are still wasted, even on mobile devices. Chillingo tried it on the iOS platform, at the end of 2009, with its Speed Forge Extreme (here is our review), delivering to iPhone owners a technically well done but not extraordinary racer, with good lighting effects but an unstable frame rate and a generally crude and uninspired design; especially as regards the circuits, which in a production of this kind should instead be great protagonists. The first thing you notice about AXL: Full Boost is instead the attempt to create a scenario that is as ~synthetic~ as possible, cold metal that flows at sixty frames per second while our spacecraft floats through it one meter from the ground. Also in this case the ~wow~ effect is missing, because the excellent fluidity, which however never shows the side to the slightest uncertainty (at least on iPhone 4S, but it seems that the code has been well optimized even for older devices) , is not assisted by special effects up to the situation. However, in the end the result appears more than good, also and above all thanks to the vehicles, which boast an interesting design and above all a variable shape, which ~opens~ in a very spectacular way when we brake. This last maneuver plays a fundamental role in the economy of the gameplay, because if we have some ~orbs~ collected on the track we can produce a very rapid boost to overtake the opponents, and these shots are activated precisely by ~charging~ the braking by holding a finger on the touch screen. Hard impact The dynamics of AXL: Full Boost are characterized by sometimes questionable choices but which, in any case, it is possible to come to terms with through practice. The same control system via accelerometer, the only one available to us, must be well adjusted so that we are able to better govern the spacecraft in the narrow canals that lead us towards the next hairpin bend, inside a truly full-bodied structure with a good degree of challenge, offering a total of over seventy races on sixteen tracks (including variants). In short, the learning curve is not among the most accessible and it is necessary to memorize the paths well in order to be able to bring home the result, especially in the more advanced stages. Such an approach can only be appreciated these days, but it will inevitably end up generating discontent in those who expected an immediate experience, with ample room for maneuver and slower speeds. The opponents on the track are generally few and the numerous variants of the vehicles at our disposal start from only three types, but these elements in themselves do not constitute a major defect. The situation regarding the weapon collection system is different, which are not equipped upon simple contact but inexplicably require braking. So let's try to clarify: if you assign the loading of the boost to braking (unless it's a hint), you can't make it indispensable also for obtaining power-ups, because then you will necessarily start with a boost and maybe it's not what you want at that moment of the race. These are design choices that should be made less rigid with some updates, or at least we hope so. Finally, the possibility of using a sort of ~autopilot~ when taking a shot near a curve is interesting: just tilt the device following the indication on the screen, at the right moment, and the curve will be passed without even a some friction with the walls.", "date": "2012-07-23", "grade": "7.6"}
