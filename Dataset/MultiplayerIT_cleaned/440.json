{"name": "Armored Core: Nexus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/armored-core-nexus.html", "text": "Assembling may not be as easy as it appears The success of the missions that we will have to carry out is based on the strategy that we will apply in the assembly of the over four hundred parts available for the construction of our mech, which will make us spend a lot of time trying to correctly balance the armaments, the cooling system, power supply, radar and virtually every single component of our robot. Pleasant time will also be spent choosing the colors and emblems with which we want to decorate our Mech, an option that any lover of aesthetics and the individuality of the means adopted in the game certainly cannot underestimate. Obviously for a fee, with credits that we will earn from mission to mission, provided that the previous assembly was wise enough and adequate to our control peculiarities so as not to make us end up out of action on the battlefield without even having had the time to realize what happened to us. With a few missions on our shoulders, and a few credits in our wallet, we will certainly be able to make our vehicle more balanced and powerful, but let's not forget that mounting weapons, tracking units, cooling systems and various, means going to weigh heavily on the energy system, which in turn will have to be sufficiently updated. The magic word is: ~balance~. Despite the huge variety of pieces that will be made available during the game, we have to admit that it's really a shame to go a little blind in the strategy we decide to adopt in optimizing our Mach . The missions that we are going to carry out do not give us great clues, in fact, on the type of terrain, the enemies and the objectives themselves that we will have to fulfill, preventing us from adapting our robot to the situations that we will gradually encounter. Assembling may not be as easy as it appears A series of additional factors, such as the artificial intelligence of the enemies which has undergone clear improvements, will significantly increase the general difficulty of the game, making us face opponents who will tend to hide, to escape, to parry our blows . Furthermore, the damage they will inflict on us will see us easily destroyed more than once, especially in the early stages of the game, when our robot will still be slow and heavy in its movements. Another element has also arisen to make life particularly difficult for us: the temperature. Well yes: our mechanoids are subject to overheating. If we fly we overheat. If we decide to dance frantically, we overheat. If we are targeted by friendly opponents equipped with grenade launchers ... eh well ... we overheat. In short, it will be good to learn as quickly as possible to keep an eye on the temperature bar, and that perhaps we will update the cooling system just as quickly, if we don't want to find ourselves with a melted down engine, literally. Which in a nutshell means ~mission not completed~. All of this raises the game's learning curve appallingly, which we could attest to with no qualms of exaggeration at around three hours of gameplay, unless you are a veteran of the series. Evolution and Revolution: two sides of the same coin As for the graphics sector, we must admit that we are certainly not dealing with any ~Evolution~, also in this case the new chapter of the series does not differ much from its predecessors. In any case, the presentation of the mechanoids, as well as that of the environments, is far from poor and the variety of colors is sufficient to make the general playability pleasant. Some environmental effects that we encounter in a series of scenarios, such as clouds of sand or pouring rain, contribute to the pleasantness of the gaming experience, made even more appropriate by the suitably techno stamo soundtrack that almost hypnotically accompanies us from mission to mission, favoring immersion in the genre atmosphere. In addition to the approximately 150 missions of the main disc, called ~Evolution~, in the package we will find a second disc, called ~Revolution~. While the first disc takes us through the discovery of the main story, which will be revealed during the assignment of missions, Revolution presents us with a series of several dozen missions taken from previous titles in the series, revisited to meet the current graphical canons. The mission menu presents us with fifteen main ~containers~ of sub-missions, which we can freely choose to undertake without necessarily following a timeline. Accomplishing missions will unlock a variety of extras, such as posters, music tracks, and gene goodiesking. The two discs will allow us to save on the same slot of our memory card, in full compatibility between the two game systems, allowing us to use the same mechanoid that we have painstakingly assembled in Evolution to carry out our missions in Revolution. Conclusions Armored Core Nexus does not disappoint fans of the Mech-Games and the series, presenting itself as a sufficiently rich and attractive title thanks to the hundreds of pieces available for an almost infinite customization of our mechanoid, a large variety of missions, also included in the second disc present in the package, which takes the name of ~Revolution~ and allows us to unlock a good amount of extras, with acceptable and engaging graphics and sound. However, the difficulty of the game has been raised, making the learning curve rather high and creating a certain difficulty in approaching newcomers to the series, who could be frustrated on several occasions by the difficulty of managing a not exactly malleable mechanoid. Pros: Huge variety of pieces available for assembly Good level of the graphics and sound sector Rather long-lived, thanks also to the presence of the second disc Cons: Inaccurate controls Rather high learning curve In the long run it suffers from monotony When the Core ruled the earth The Armored Core series, one of the reference points for every console mech-game enthusiast who sees his birthplace back in 1997, has now reached its eighth appearance, for the fifth time on PS2. From Software, faithful to the principle according to which if something works there is no reason to change it, does not deviate significantly from the guidelines of Nexus' predecessors, while bringing a series of innovations and contents that make it worthy of being played, both for newcomers to the series and for the most loyal fans. Armored Core: Nexus presents itself as a conceptually honest and linear title: all we have to focus on is assembling our mechanoid, called precisely ~Core~, and then commit ourselves to completing a series of missions which essentially involve the liberation of different areas by the opposing mechanoids or the destruction of objectives of various kinds, against the background of a scenario that sees a series of corporations fighting for the affirmation of economic dominance. We are the mercenaries, members of an organization called ~The Raven~, hired to do the dirty work.", "date": "2006-06-16", "grade": null}
