{"name": "Notti romantiche", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paris-nights.html", "text": "Moving to another city or even another country can be an amazing adventure that can literally change your life. The classic initial difficulties can be overcome with a little enthusiasm, while there are many new possibilities that stand out on the horizon. You can ~reinvent yourself~, you can face everyday life in a completely different way than before. It's all about playing your cards right, also because in the event of problems you will hardly be able to pack your bags again. In Paris Nights our alter ego goes to live in Paris to make his dream come true. Waiting for him he will find only an apartment to share with a nice roommate, everything else will have to be conquered day by day: from work to relationships, from culture to health. If you have already tried an episode of Gameloft's ~life simulator~, you know very well what to expect: once you arrive in the city, your goal will be to become a successful person, well liked by everyone and with a bunch of girls in tow. After an initial phase dedicated to ~building~ the character, through a simple graphic editor, the game offers us a series of situations in which we often just have to move from one place to another and have conversations. The first thing to do, therefore, will be to buy a subway pass to be able to move comfortably and at any time. The background story revolves around quite stereotyped situations (baggage exchange, mysterious people, etc.), but the charm of this kind of product doesn't lie so much in what you have to do, but in how you do it. Our character has a large number of skills that can be developed through the most disparate practices: training with weights produces an improvement in physical health, reading or looking at works of art increases our culture, enriching the wardrobe reflects on the style and about charm, etc. Each of these things can become essential at some point in the game, accompanied by the usual physiological needs that fans of The Sims will be familiar with: washing, sleeping, eating and spending some time in the bathroom. We will be able to interact with any character who is nearby, just press the 5 key once we are close: a four-element interface will appear that allows us to converse (choosing the topic based on the tastes of our interlocutor, who during the first steps will be indicated on the screen to make things easier for us), joking, giving gifts or even offending. All this will reflect on our characteristics, improving them, and may be worth a few romantic dates. It is clear that behaving in the wrong way, for example talking about video games with an art lover, will have the opposite effect... As often happens with successful series, Paris Nights can count on an already tested and effective technical ~backbone~, which has been further enriched for the occasion. The characters are very well drawn and animated, and the amount of sprites within each location is amazing. The places to visit are far from endless in terms of size, but there are so many of them and they are all characterized by a precise choice of colors as well as a high level of detail. In short, walking around the streets of Paris becomes a real pleasure, as does interacting with the other characters, even if only to observe their reactions and expressions. The action is accompanied by a simple but effective sound sector, which combines well-made music with nice and pleasant effects.", "date": "2009-04-02", "grade": "S.V."}
