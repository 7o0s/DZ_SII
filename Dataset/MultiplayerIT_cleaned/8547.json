{"name": "Back to the Future: The Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102706-back-to-the-future-the-game-la-delorean-inceppata.html", "text": "Needless to present Back to the Future, it is one of the cult films of the 80s - perhaps the cult film par excellence of that period - a work seen, appreciated and loved even by more recent generations, those who have not lived through the era gold of the series. In 2010, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the release of the first film was celebrated, an occurrence that was honored by bringing the saga back to the cinema, and also by giving life to some collateral events, including the publication of this serial video game. The Wii version is just an anthology of the five chapters released between 2010 and 2011, which in no way differs - in terms of content - from those already seen on PC. Everything was designed under the careful supervision of Bob Gale, screenwriter of the film production: a precious presence, because if the setting and the main characters are the same as the film, the story and events differ radically - sporadic references and quotations aside - and without one of the authors to check the details, the pieces would hardly have fitted together so well. Point and click As you may have guessed from the images on the side, the game is a classic, very classic graphic adventure. The project was entrusted to Telltale Games, a company formed in 2004 by former LucasArts employees, a software house that to define as specialized in this genre is an understatement: since its inception it has published dozens of titles, all belonging to this type. Its designers are experts, but the results have not always been excellent, so much so that they have not managed to launch a new, large, successful IP: they have mainly relied on reinvigorating brands already known and loved by enthusiasts, such as Sam & Max and Monkey Island. There was no shortage of partial failures, such as the series inspired by Bone, a well-known American comic, which never went beyond the first part. Again under license they worked this time, a much more important and well-known license than that of Bone, and to make no mistake they went on the safe side: Back to the Future: The Game is a decent graphic adventure, but overly mannered. He doesn't dare, ever. Minutes and minutes of real-time footage to mark the various sections of the game, areas that in the classic Telltale Games style can be completely gutted, every detail or object can be analysed. And everyone usually produces a further film or short skit: a positive fact in itself but which in this case, as we will see later, is annoying. The puzzles are nice, generally not too complex to cut off the novices, and above all quite short: forget long plots throughout the adventure, the episodic nature of the game ostracizes puzzles of this type. As usual, there are some rather delusional situations, in which the solution of the puzzle appears forced and unnatural, and above all solvable with other objects in the inventory: a problem common to most graphic adventures, which in these cases, in addition to presenting mediocre playful situations corrupt the suspension of disbelief. Very faithful The story is well done, it too risks little but is careful to provide new information to fans of the saga, without however distorting what has been seen in the films. It goes without saying that knowing and appreciating feature films is a determining factor in getting involved in adventures: not so much for the narrated events, enjoyable in themselves, but for understanding the characters, who are introduced without too many preambles, assuming that the audience know them. Marty McFly and the trusty, crazy mentor Doc are the protagonists of the story - naturally Marty is in charge - while the secondary characters only hinted at in the film series are explored. Perhaps too often - also due to the length of the adventure, and its fragmentation - the developers have relied on the clichs of the saga, with alternative timelines, with characters who disappear because they were never born and other similar paradoxes. In short, more than a ~and now what happens?~ sometimes it becomes a ~who disappears now?~. The dialogues are good, brilliant, as is the dubbing, which even boasts a phenomenal Christopher Lloyd: in general, the whole sound sector is excellent, truly impeccable. As we will soon see, unfortunately the same thing cannot be said of the graphics, even if stylistically the work done is good: the canon used is not ambitious, but the result is good, and strongly Western. A small lack, on the other hand, could represent a big problem, namely the absence of the Italian translation: if you don't speak English, avoid buying the game. Retirement Wii And now we come to the paragraph that justifies the just enough vote that vesay below. Back to the Future: The Game is derivative, but represents a discreet work and absolutely recommended for fans of the series or genre, even a must-buy for those who belong to both categories. But it is a purchase to be made, possibly, on PC. Because the Wii version noticeably limps. Not only have the developers not tried to exploit the hardware, but they have transported the game to the poor, old Nintendo console without any kindness: the loads are long, but above all the frame rate is wobbly. The frequency of shots often crosses the threshold that separates playable and unplayable. First among the merits we have included the various videos that start every time an element on the screen is analyzed, but on the Wii these videos lead to continuous slowdowns that break up the adventure. The movements of the characters are often robotic, syncopated. And to say that the movements in and of themselves, on the Wii, are excellent: the control stick plus the pointer of the wiimote are at the same level, less comfortable but perhaps more engaging, than the combination of mouse and keyboard.
