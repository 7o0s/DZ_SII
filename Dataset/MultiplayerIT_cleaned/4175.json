{"name": "The Crew 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-crew-2-recensione-201671.html", "text": "It seems like a few months, yet almost four years have passed since the release of the first The Crew, Ubisoft's attempt to reappear in racing games after some time. To do this, several members of Eden Games were enlisted, a French software house that rose to prominence for the latest Test Drives (and Alone in the Dark) and then fell into disgrace together with the publisher Atari. The Ivory Tower-branded production, despite the hype with which the transalpine company's titles are usually pushed, has never really made inroads into the hearts of fans, not even after a desperate attempt to revive its fortunes in 2016, when it was offered for free to the PC user. In that of Lyon they have not lost heart and have packaged The Crew 2 which is more ~big and bad~ than its predecessor, expanding its scope in all directions. Introduced at last year's E3 and initially scheduled for March 2018, it was pushed back a few months just for the summer holidays. A giant map and lots of influencers The first and most glaring difference compared to the first The Crew is the presence of motorboats and acrobatic planes which you can possibly drive without interruption, as illustrated by the spectacular initial sequence ~alla Inception~ which introduces the actual game. The Crew 2 abandons the idea of a plot that in some way served as a draft for the tests of the first chapter to enter the magical world of social networks and influencers: just as if we were in ~reality~, the player's prestige increases with the number of followers who in turn will subscribe to the profile by completing races with good placements or performing spectacular evolutions in the sky and on earth. Greater popularity unlocks ever more demanding challenges, on a road that will lead us to supplant Ken Block in the rankings of the most followed YouTubers. In this regard it is really a pity that the views of the videos that can be easily captured with an in-game tool and posted on a dedicated YouTube channel do not contribute to increasing the player's rank. The victories, in addition to the followers, also give away money with which to buy and embellish new vehicles. The aesthetic part is purely an end in itself: by changing the rims, or fitting a carbon bonnet, the car's performance does not vary one iota. To improve the rating of the Audi TT RS with which we started, it was necessary to act on the control unit, tyres, exhausts and so on, just as if they were pieces of armor in an RPG. These upgrades come in the form of boxes to be collected once the race is over, and their quality, just like in the Titan Quest hack 'n' slash, is characterized by a specific color. The Crew 2 is spread over the entire map of the United States of America (divided into four regions) reproduced in a non-real scale: to reach Los Angeles, starting from New York, you have to travel about 130 kilometers. It is accessed with the back button (we used the Xbox 360 controller), while pressing the analog triggers acts on the zoom level. From here you can decide whether to set a destination and follow it via GPS or transport yourself directly to the event hotspots: a break from the past, when before jumping from one area to another it was necessary to reveal the map. A choice that also involves a clear change of philosophy in dealing with the races, leaving aside the exploratory phase which in any case continues to be encouraged thanks to the presence of secondary and bonus and hidden missions that can only be reached by following a radar. There are four families of competitions in The Crew 2 which are in turn divided into other sub-categories: we go from racing on highways with hypercars, to drag races, to duels between busy city streets to end up with drift in the Street Racing category; in the Pro one we find both open-wheel single-seaters and prototypes of the GT series to be driven mainly on circuits, but also planes and motorboats; in freestyle there are the very American monster trucks, but also motocross bikes. An extremely arcade driving model The decision to expand the fleet so much stinks a bit, as if to counterbalance a quality of the driving model of The Crew 2 that cannot compete with other heavyweights of the genre. In this regard there is really a lot of irons in the fire to analyze, and we do it starting from the new categories, namely those areas and amphibious. The maneuverability of the single-seater propeller is pleasantly intuitive, the camera always follows the position of the aircraft with respect even during the complex acrobatic maneuvers that can be performed withn naturalness; certainly physics follows very simplified rules, but one could certainly not expect much more from a title that offers such a variety of situations. Overall it can be said that the flight model recalls, not too covertly, that of GTA 5. The races on the water didn't excite us: most of the time, in addition to pressing the throttle stick, you push the left stick down to increase speed: the brake is nothing short of harmful because it literally lands on the place the boat, with all the necessary difficulties in recovering ground on the adversaries who immediately take advantage of the slightest slowdown. On closer inspection, they are the marine equivalent of off-road tests, where there are no pre-established roads to reach the checkpoints and the sensation of freedom is truly elevated. Going to analyze the real fulcrum of The Crew 2, i.e. car races, we must see how the driving model has evolved compared to its predecessor, criticized above all for the ~bar of soap~ effect. The mass of vehicles, which still continue to be a bit too maneuverable even at high speeds, is more present, but we didn't like the excessive arcade cut that translates into cars glued to the road and the brake lever to be used only in the rare cases of 90 bends. Among other things, these sensations vary very little from one car to another: in short, as the engine capacity increases, the only appreciable changes are acceleration and oversteer. The greater degree of challenge does not derive from the cleaning of the trajectories but from a prudent use of the turbo, which recharges over time, and from the ability to find shortcuts and other ~hidden~ passages that allow you to legally cut the circuit, so to finish in front of the opponents. Often it is preferable to take advantage of the concrete barriers to face the curves more quickly, rather than choking on the gas. Unfortunately, things don't improve much if instead of the street races you face tests on closed circuits, where it would be reasonable to expect a level of simulation that is a little closer to reality. All this is also attributable to the implementation of the artificial intelligence of The Crew 2, still afflicted by an elastic effect which, although slightly mitigated compared to the previous episode, is still alive and well. Being overwhelmed one corner from the end, after having commanded for the whole race, perhaps for a little longer braking, is the rule. Opponents look like vultures waiting for the drool; when they make mistakes they manage to recover the lost ground in the blink of an eye and, if they should have too high an advantage, they almost systematically benchmark their performance on that of the player. Thus we end up deliberately maintaining the second position up to a few meters from the finish line, when we take advantage of the nox to overtake the leader. The number of participants does not exceed eight units, and this is frankly inconceivable for a title that claims to extend over thousands of square kilometres. The editions As per Ubisoft tradition, The Crew 2 is also offered in a variety of editions. That base costs 59.99; by adding 10 you take home the deluxe, offered in both the digital and physical variants (the latter only available for consoles). Both contain 3 bonus vehicles; in the one on sale in shops, in addition to the Blu-ray, there are four stickers (one for each type of race) and a map of the USA on laminated paper. Fans of the first minute have already been able to test the bonuses of the Gold Edition (offered at  89.99), because they had access to the full game 3 days in advance, and the same will happen with future updates thanks to the season pass. Finally there is the Motor Edition, exclusively for points of sale, which, in addition to including all the delicacies listed above, adds a personalized plate with the game's logo, all enclosed inside an exclusive metal package. The price is 99.99 Graphics and surroundings The heavy bloom effect maliciously masks the weakness of The Crew 2's graphic system which a few years ago could have been sufficient, but which today shows the rope. The map of the entire United States of America is enormous, there is no doubt about this, the problem is that, crossing it, you travel kilometers of identical roads, devoid of characterizing elements or architectures that make it clear in which geographical point we are. you find. Big cities are a little more defined, but far from faithfully representing the real counterparts. Thus we end up teleporting from one race to another, aware that we lose practically nothing (visually) in wandering amongon the east and west coast. The vehicle models also leave a bitter taste, some of which are made with less care than others, and even more the textures that cover them, often flat and devoid of those details to which similar titles have accustomed us for some time and in the past. against which the comparison is fierce. The fate of The Crew 2 is partially raised by the climatic effects: the transition between night and day is very suggestive, just as the changeable weather conditions are worthy of note, which the player can leave to chance or set of his own free will. Numerous options, primarily the limit of frames per second (30 or 60), allow you to set the game so that it can be managed by many systems, even medium-low ones. For our tests, carried out at maximum details in FullHD, we relied on the combination of Ryzen 7 2700X and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 and, of course, the frame rate was granite. The reproduction of the noise of the engines didn't drive us crazy, and neither did the Italian dubbing that seems to come out of a low-grade film, while the soundtrack is made of quite another stuff, stuffed with indie pieces of the most disparate genres and in any case always very close to the type of race you are facing. The same exploration of the map becomes much more pleasant by increasing the volume of the car radio to discover songs that are often outside the mainstream circuit. Multiplayer projects in progress One of the bitter pills to swallow is the absence of a real competitive multiplayer mode in The Crew 2. From a game called The Crew we would have expected to be able to join a group of friends to challenge other users around the America, but for the moment there is no trace of PvP. Ivory Tower seems to be well aware of this, so much so that it has got its hands on anticipating the future development projects of the title: two vehicles will be added every month (Season Pass holders will be able to access them a week in advance), while new ones will arrive every three months contents, free for all, which will allow to expand the variety of situations. For example, the Gator Rush, an update that will introduce hovercrafts, is already planned for September, while competitive multiplayer should also be implemented for the upcoming Christmas holidays which, for technical reasons, it was not possible to offer from the outset.", "date": "2018-07-02", "grade": "7.0"}
