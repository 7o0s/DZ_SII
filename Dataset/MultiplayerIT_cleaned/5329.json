In some ways the setting of Riptide GP: Renegade recalls that of MotorStorm: Apocalypse, given that the clean and orderly tracks of the previous editions have given way to more confused and fragmented scenarios, not exactly decadent but certainly dominated by a feeling of uncertainty , which leads to having to memorize the routes well to avoid crashing somewhere and losing precious seconds. The same career, full-bodied and entertaining as usual, sees us take on the role of a clandestine race driver, who after being released from prison is more determined than ever to quickly recover his prestige and climb the rankings. However, Riptide GP: Renegade also offers a lot in the multiplayer field, with a mode in which you have to challenge the ghosts of other users and a more traditional one in which we can compete in real-time in races with up to eight participants. The system, based on Game Center, works well and offers truly frenetic moments, fortunately never spoiled by episodes of excessive latency. Even on PC and consoles Riptide GP: Renegade is not only available for mobile devices, but also on PC and PlayStation 4 at a price of 14.99 euros, discounted to 9.99 for the launch on PlayStation Store. The gaming experience is substantially the same, but we must add the presence of a split-screen multiplayer for four participants and a technical sector clearly adapted to the different platforms, with 1080p graphics and sixty frames per second. Riptide GP: Renegade succeeds in the difficult task of surpassing the previous installments of the series Lightning on the water Right from the start, the gameplay of Riptide GP: Renegade appears somewhat more sophisticated than in the previous episodes, perhaps due to further optimizations made to the physics of the water, the great protagonist of the races, which you ~ride~ and whose ripples are influenced by many factors. The game starts by default with an accelerometer-based control system, but it is possible to opt for a touch alternative (which, specifically, we preferred) or for a physical controller. In all cases, it is necessary to have a careful approach to changes of direction, always trying to anticipate the curves to prevent the jet ski from getting sideways and making us lose our starting point with respect to our adversaries, who are always rather aggressive even if equipped with a average artificial intelligence. The execution of stunts in flight, according to a system that allows you to gradually learn new ones and derive specific advantages from them, works through the execution of gestures and fleshes out the boost indicator, capable of overturning the fate of a race that seemed marked . In short, there is a lot of depth in the sole management of the vehicle on the water, not to mention the upgrades available from race to race and the possibility of buying new motorcycles, and all this is accompanied by the usual, excellent technical sector. The impact of the first episode clearly cannot be replicated on current devices, which have by now accustomed us to extremely detailed and fluid graphics, but Riptide GP: Renegade performs very well indeed and is still a feast for the eyes. Sorry only for a choice of colors that tends to trivialize certain scenes, excessively flattening the surfaces. Nothing to say, however, about the sound, which always accompanies the action with convincing rhythms.", "date": "2016-08-30", "grade": "8.5"}
