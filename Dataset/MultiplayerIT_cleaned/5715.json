Starting from consolidated foundations, the developers manage to build original and alternative experiences, capable of recombining even the standard elements of a videogame genre such as the puzzle game in an unprecedented way. It thus happens that a game centered on the combination of colors between adjacent boxes can emerge as a single title, despite its constituent components being so deeply rooted in the puzzle tradition itself, in particular in its mobile videogame meaning. Therefore, if you read that in Twofold Inc. we find ourselves eliminating from a grid colored boxes with the same shade, therefore, do not think that it is something we have already seen, because the way in which the mechanics of Twofold Inc is built and the elements that make up the challenge are actually quite new. It is about managing a sort of space factory, or something like that, responding to particular requests, essentially summarized in numbers and colors: the aim is therefore to draw continuous lines between contiguous boxes of the same color, thus totaling a progressive number for each square (which advances by doubling, from 2 to 4, 8, 16 and so on), so as to reach the total number required for each colour. The problem is that the lines drawn must be homogeneous, with no empty spaces between the squares, and that the number of moves made to reach the required numbers is strictly counted, which forces us to dose the maneuvers carefully. All this translates into a continuous challenge to self-improvement which, although selective, proves to be hardly frustrating, despite the fact that the level of difficulty is somewhat inflexible. Adjacent numbers and colors are familiar elements in a puzzle, not as shown in Twofold Inc Numbers and colors The action takes place on a 7x5 square grid, in three different colors, with hues that change to indicate the presence of contiguous cells that can be lined up in a single stroke. It is possible to scroll the lines and columns by pressing on the arrows located on the edge of the grid, which obviously involves a change in the arrangement of the boxes and is a fundamental action for unlocking situations and solving the puzzles posed by the game, but every single movement made counts as a move, and these are counted, therefore it becomes essential to observe and calculate well every maneuver to be carried out on the field, trying to limit them as much as possible and exploit as much as possible both the initial arrangement and the chain effect that derives from the elimination of the cells and from the recomposition of the grid. Twofold Inc is the classic case of game much more difficult to explain than to play because the description is necessarily cumbersome and convulsive given the rules imposed, but actually being in front of the grid represents a completely different experience, also thanks to a short but comprehensive initial tutorial. In any case, if the idea that you have come up with is that this is a rather tough and demanding game, then you are indeed on the right track. Twofold Inc is a puzzle game that does not forgive and is able to corner you already in the first few games, yet it undoubtedly has that particular quid that pushes us to press to get back into the game quickly, the result of the mathematical but also intuitive mechanics of the game, given from the balanced association between tactile commands, colors and numbers, and from the excellent audiovisual characterization impressed by Grapefrukt, who once again managed to propose his own particular vision of a well-known genre with a remarkable identity. The only limit, perhaps not indifferent, is the repetitiveness of the action accentuated by the exclusively endless mode, which would probably have benefited from the addition of other possible game options.", "date": "2016-02-10", "grade": "8.6"}
