Once an alter-ego has been created to sit on the bench and one of the many job offers has been accepted, the player takes on the role of coach and manager together, worrying about making ends meet, managing the squad, finding sponsorships, improving the coaching staff, scouting for new talent, remembering to close Materazzi's cage before going to sleep and so on. Each team will have different seasonal objectives, and it is up to the user to satisfy the club with his work: in addition to the tasks described above, the coach must carefully choose the formation to send onto the pitch, bearing in mind that players left too often on the bench become demoralized; must therefore choose whether to use a good-natured approach that makes everyone happy or to act more decisively, always letting the best team take the field without paying attention to the complaints of those left out (all this perhaps inspired by the frankness and firmness of the late Franco Scoglio, who passed away recently: I remember when he said to Gilardino's face ~you're Vieri's bench player, he's the leader~, with the consequent dumbfounded expression of the good Alberto's film library). Rome is a difficult square, but the expert Spartaco Balambam knows neither fear nor fear. knows what pain is; Dear Franco Sensi leaves immediately with ambitions of a certain level... The coach mode increases the thickness and longevity of the EA Sports football title without weighing it down too much with mechanisms more suitable for other types of games Fifa is 2006 From this screen you can access all the menus to better manage your team. Come on wolves! Eric Cantona's record is among the extras that can be unlocked in the dedicated virtual shop. Au revoir! During this career that for 15 seasons entrusts the user with the complete guide of the team, the matches can be tackled in three different ways, that is, by taking the field in first person, following the schematic synthesis with the possibility of intervening on the match at any time. want or directly simulating the final result. I've already heard several people criticize the manager mode by pointing to the lack of depth of the managerial system, but in this case I totally disagree: in a game that certainly doesn't aim at the management aspect, such a simplified managerial model is almost perfect, and increases thickness and longevity of the EA Sports football title without weighing it down too much with mechanisms more suitable for other types of games. In addition to the various game modes, Fifa 06 also offers some extras, unlockable in the appropriate virtual shop, which to tell the truth are neither very many nor particularly greedy: we are talking about personal files of past glories, interviews with players, a film-retrospective on the Fifa series, some spectacular action taken from last season's championships and little else. In Fifa 06 you can compete in the championships of a myriad of nations (even the Korean championship) with many licensed teams, but you can also create your own players using the appropriate editor, which however left me rather perplexed: creating a player of 1 meter and 50 I found him on the pitch almost like Totti; changing it to 1 meter and 22 (!) he always remained about 175/178cm tall. Go figure these Canadians! Maradona is better than Pele Ciamm' fatt o'mazz tant pell'av! With this pearl of Neapolitan folklore we are going to talk about the beating heart of Fifa 06, the aspect for which any reader is straining his eyes over this review: playability. The hand of the Japanese grafts in the Canadian team is more than evident and, as was legitimate to expect, this Fifa 06 tries to look like PES starting from the default mapping of the joypad keys (not quite identical but almost) up to the radar of the playing field (exactly identical, almost without). Starting a game, you immediately realize that the similarities don't end there, in fact some game mechanics, especially the offensive ones, give a certain sense of de javu. Unfortunately the ~copying~ work, if we want to kindly call it that, was not overly scrupulous, and although Fifa 06 is now a game that for better or worse manages to entertain, it still has some lobvious shortcomings. First of all, the physics of the ball, although undoubtedly improved compared to last year, is still unlikely on many occasions, whether we are dealing with crosses, throws, changes of play, shots or even ground passes: often, especially in the case of , the ball follows such precise parabolas that even Giotto would not dream of them, and everything gives a very strong ~remote controlled~ sensation. The players do not make the best idea of physicality, and are capable of sharp changes of direction at inhuman speeds, which has been corrected for some time in the PES series. On the other hand, the chorus of offensive actions has improved, which also thanks to a reduced frequency of overhead and half overhead kicks now give a feeling of greater realism, especially in the setting phase; when the time comes to finalize, however, everything is somewhat disassembled by the mechanics of the shots and especially, in case the ball is inside the penalty area, by the lack of realism of the actions in front of goal. Montella creeps into the penalty area and... ...Milan concedes a goal. And Stam feels bad about it. although Fifa 06 is now a game that for better or worse manages to entertain, it still has some very evident gaps The replay controls are a bit clunky. cumbersome and difficult The cameras available are the usual, two of which are really excellent Maradona is better than Pele The through ball is managed rather well but perhaps it is even too effective, and excluding rare cases of general amnesia, the team follows the approach of the maneuver rather actively, with players ready to jump on the edge of offside or to cleverly lurk in the area to receive a cross. The ~hot spots~ from which to shoot to score almost always automatically have been drastically reduced, also thanks to a defense that does not always leave space for long-range shots. Too bad for some AI blackouts, such as the case of a two-stage save: when the goalkeeper slips the ball, the attackers remain still like beautiful statuettes to observe the scene, without trying to pounce on the ball as the good would suggest sense. The artificial intelligence needs to be improved from various other points of view: first of all, whether we are talking about a team of scandals from the Korean championship or Milan or Real Madrid, the teams all practice convinced possession of the ball and do not develop other types of maneuvers ; in the defensive phase they often erect barricades worthy of withstanding a medieval siege and subsequently, if they go behind even by just one goal, they upset everything by throwing themselves into the boarding and leaving worrying defensive holes. The teams controlled by the CPU do not seem to contemplate the foul, and I have often played three or four games in a row without ever being able to take a free-kick, so much the athletes managed by the computer seem reluctant to make irregular interventions. As for the difficulty, contrary to what happens in WE/PES where I personally always play at the highest level, for Fifa 06 I would recommend the ~expert~ level, i.e. the penultimate one, which seemed to me the most balanced and the more playable. Finally, it is worth mentioning the possibility of playing online and some goodies such as the short interludes when the game is stopped (such as complaints with the referee for a foul whistle) or, an absolute novelty for a football game, the possibility of shooting ~spoon~ penalties , Totti-style. How do you fix the bug The annoying bug that afflicted the Fifa 2006 demo strangely also returns with the final version. Let's recap for those who haven't had the pleasure yet: this bug affects a rather high number of users and affects some USB peripherals (in particular keyboards with multimedia functions) preventing navigation in the game menus (actually it blocks everything already from the first menu for the choice of language) continuously moving the selection as if holding down a directional arrow. Here is the method to solve the problem while waiting for a patch: right-click on ~My Computer~, select ~Properties~, ~Hardware~, ~Device Manager~; in the window that will open, click on the ~+~ of the ~Human Interface Device~ item and locate all the items that read ~Human Interface USB device~; try disabling one of these by right-clicking on it and choosing ~disable~. In my case I had to deactivate the second, which prevents the multimedia keys of my Logitech keyboard from working (such as the volume control, or the key to open the mail client). Don't deactivate them all, please, but try them one at a time. In this way you can use Fifa 06 normally, and once the game session is over, repeat the same procedure to reactivate the game.peripheral in question. Quick and comfortable. ;D Official strategy guide Multiplayer.it Edizioni has released the official Fifa 06 strategy guide. In the guide you will find tips for tackling any mode, suggestions on tactics and modules to adopt, on the best young promises, on how to unlock extras and any other advice you may want for this game. For more information, take a look at the official page. Cross-platform Regarding the console versions there are not many differences to report. Mainly we can say that on the graphic side things get a little worse: on PS2, Xbox and GC the uncertainties of the 3D engine are even more accentuated, so much so that on certain occasions of crowding on the screen there are sudden drops in framerate, and as you all know the resolution is lower. It should be noted that the GameCube version has fewer extras than the others, but this is certainly not discriminating, given the not exactly extraordinary desirability. The look of the footballer From a graphic point of view we are not really there. While the turf and the stadiums in general are made in a more than satisfactory way (albeit not at the levels of some amateur modifications seen in Fifa 2005), everything else shows a bit the side. The player models still give the feeling of being a subspecies of plasticky mannequins, and in 90% of the cases they bear little resemblance to the real-life counterparts. Among the animations, which vary from bad to fair, the worst are precisely the most essential ones, such as running and shooting, while some goalkeeper movements are among the few that are saved (in corners, just to stay on topic). The graphics engine is rather light, and allows high framerates even for those who do not have a doped computer (again to stay on the subject), but this is practically useless, since even with 100 frames per second the images, inexplicably, snap, and this it doesn't just happen in the PC version but also in the console versions, where there are further sharp drops in fluidity in the most crowded situations. And... and who the hell is this? In Fifa 06, the resemblance to real players is very strong. been taken a while lightly Kak&agrave;, Chivu and Montella... the only remotely recognizable of the three is the little airplane the Italian commentary entrusted to Bruno Longhi and Aldone Serena is perhaps the best ever heard Andrea Pirlo is preparing to take a free kick. Note the name and number behind the shirt, totally different from the original ones ~You are so ugly that you look like a masterpiece of modern art~  1987 Staff Sergeant Hartman The look of the footballer The fact of not making perfect counterparts of the real uniforms while being able to enjoy the rights is also difficult to understand: in addition to not boasting an extraordinary technical realization, the shirts are in fact reproduced in a sufficiently faithful way in every aspect except for the character (or font, for the most Anglophiles) of the numbers and names written on the back, completely wrong and not corresponding to the real ones. Sonically, things improve significantly. The Italian commentary entrusted to Bruno Longhi and Aldone Serena is perhaps the best ever heard, and manages to do its job discreetly even if in the medium term it shows the usual limits of variety and concatenation of sentences. The ex Inter ram is an ideal sidekick for the seasoned football commentator, and he happily replaces a Giovanni Galli who has never seemed to be in great shape in the last three editions. Following the now consolidated EA style, the music that accompanies navigation in the game menus are the usual young songs of the most popular artists at the moment among the ~MTV generation~; among the many stand out names such as Jamiroquai, Oasis, Nine Black Alps and also musicians from the Bel Paese such as Subsonica and Linea 77. As usual, the EA Trax function allows us to select which songs to exclude from the playlist, an essential feature given the presence by some French and German musicians (brrr). It had been more or less seven years since I had felt something so close to fun playing an EA Sports football title, and after this long period of darkness I was pleased to return to see a beautiful glimmer of light. But be careful: we are facing the best Fifa ever created, and this is certainly not of little importance, but it must also be said that although a good general improvement in terms of playability is appreciable, the great revolution heralded by Electronic Arts of unfortunately there was no such thing, and this Fifa 06, for various points of view, remains inferior to its direct competitor Pro Evolution Soccer, of which, let's face it, it has exploited more than a few ideas.
