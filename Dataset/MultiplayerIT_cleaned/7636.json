Of a different opinion is evidently Activision, which in fact founded the team of The Blast Furnace for the sole purpose of producing mobile products linked to their successful franchises but which are able to showcase more strictly personal qualities. The here Call of Duty: Strike Team is a clear exponent of this strategy: let's see if it is an example to follow or to avoid ... Sailing and motor Similar in terms of futuristic setting to Black Ops 2, Call of Duty: Strike Team tells the story of a handful of soldiers engaged in fighting the terrorist organization Cordis Die, a screenplay that maintains that balance between making the events spectacular and a fund of vague plausibility that has always been typical of the series since it abandoned WWII scenarios. Despite its fundamental banality, the plot is still better narrated than the vast majority of mobile titles, proving to be a pleasant glue between one mission and another. These take place in the context of three different environments, and see the user take command of a team made up of two members, alternating in one or the other's shoes as needed. The manual on how to correctly develop an FPS on a touchscreen device has evidently been properly learned by The Blast Furnace, which fields a decidedly valid control system (by the low standards of the genre, of course) and even heralds some innovative aspects . Movement and gaze are managed as usual by acting on the two halves of the screen, while a handful of virtual keys perform the basic functions such as opening fire, crouching down or throwing a grenade: the most interesting experiments concern the pointing system, with a double tap that allows you to activate the viewfinder of the weapon and two buttons located on the edges of the display that allow you to automatically position the reticle against the closest enemy, giving a hand in the phases in which you have to face more than one opponent at a time. Call of Duty: Strike Team is a successful marriage between an FPS and a real-time strategy In short, Call of Duty: Strike Team gets along better than many other colleagues - even without reaching peaks of absolute excellence - but the surprise comes when we discover the existence of a flying drone, which can be activated at any time via a button placed in the upper left corner of the screen, which turns the game into a real-time strategy game. At this juncture, the view switches to a bird's eye camera, with zoom and rotation that can be managed at will, through which to analyze the surrounding scenario and give orders to the two soldiers with simple taps to indicate the position to reach or the action to perform against an enemy or an object. Although the game is easily usable in its entirety both as an FPS and as a strategic one, taken individually both modes show different structural limits (control system and artificial intelligence, first of all) highlighting the fact that the best Call of Duty: Strike Team is obtained precisely by constantly alternating the two phases: therefore the stealth moments are particularly suitable for the more reasoned approach allowed by the drone's view, while when it comes to accumulating corpses it is advisable to do it in first person. In addition to being valid from the gameplay point of view, this dualism increases the replayability of the campaign, already guaranteed by a good number of missions, two difficulty levels and a whole series of challenges to complete to then compare your results with those some friends. It should be noted that Call of Duty: Strike Team was conceived as an exclusively single player experience: and if the absence of a multiplayer component is destined to make many turn up their noses, on the other hand the contents offered are truly remarkable. There are therefore maps intended for an intense survival mode and experience points bestowed at the end of each session thanks to which you can unlock new equipment and skills for your soldiers, accompanied by the inevitable in-app purchases which, however, here are anything but invasive or essential to continue. Finally, it does not hurt that from a technical point of view, Call of Duty: Strike Team makes a good impression,with a graphic design that appears cured in both visuals and a convincing sound especially as regards the effects and the spoken in English (appropriately subtitled in Italian). A certain instability of the application should be reported in a negative sense, which however we trust will be resolved shortly with an update.", "date": "2013-09-10", "grade": "8.0"}
