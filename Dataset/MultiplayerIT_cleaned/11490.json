{"name": "Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow_a.html", "text": "Castlevania is one of those titles that have made the history of video games, without a doubt. The series was born in 1986, almost simultaneously in arcades and on the Nintendo Famicom, riding the wave of horror-themed products such as Ghost'n'Goblins. The protagonist of the game is Simon Belmont, the last descendant of a family that has been hunting vampires for generations: armed with a powerful whip, he must make his way through hordes of demons and the undead to come to terms with Count Dracula, who every hundred years he rises from his own ashes by the work of his disciples. In the twenty-two years since that first episode, the Castlevania series has evolved, without abandoning the original 2D mechanics. The linear structure of the beginning has given way to even complex exploration phases, which transform the scenarios into enormous puzzles that must be solved through the acquisition of new skills. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, released in 2003 for GameBoy Advance, follows precisely this line. The game stars Soma Cruz, a student who discovers that he has received superhuman powers following the death of Dracula, and finds himself having to defend himself from those who would like to take them away by force. A day like any other, Soma is mysteriously transported to a huge castle in Transylvania, and here he has to face his enemies: monsters of all kinds, flying demons, animated skeletons, zombies, bats and so on. The character can make powerful jumps and has a weapon to defend himself, which can be wielded by pressing the 5 key. The structure is the same as seen in the GBA version, and includes the numerous possibilities for upgrading Soma: if the right function key is needed to view the map of the area, complete with an indication of the sections already visited, the left one allows us to access a menu where we can manage objects, powers and abilities of the character. By eliminating the enemies, new weapons, new protections and so on appear, to be equipped right through that screen. A section dedicated to ~souls~ has also been introduced (which can be activated using the 7 key), i.e. special powers that allow Soma to jump higher or stay in the air longer, walk in water, move quickly, etc. . Finally, there are also special weapons (key 9), often throwable, which increase our offensive capabilities from long distances. The opponents we will be dealing with move and attack according to rather simple patterns, but they are really numerous and enriched by the presence of big and bad bosses, who must be faced according to a different strategy each time. We are faced with a rather accurate conversion, even if the levels reached by Glu with Shadowalker are quite different, especially in terms of animation. Most likely the development team had to compromise to make Aria of Sorrow usable even on less powerful mobiles, hence the cuts made. If the absolute quality is not at the highest levels, however, the same cannot be said of the quantity: the game surprises for the number of scenarios, for their realization, for the presence of parallax scrolling on three levels and for the huge number of monsters and creatures to face. In that sense, we're well above average when it comes to mobile gaming, including Shadowalker himself (used as a benchmark for obvious reasons). It is clear that the size of the locations forces us to endure frequent loading, but the wait never lasts more than a few seconds. The control system is really simple and immediate, with the character moving and jumping using the joystick, while the number pad's are assigned to attack, activate souls and magic. Pros: Next level gameplay Rich graphics An excellent conversion Against: It should be played calmly Animation anything but smooth Problems with sound on some terminals", "date": "2008-04-14", "grade": "S.V."}
