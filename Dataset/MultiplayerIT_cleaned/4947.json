Evidently not even Gameloft must have been particularly satisfied with the work done, given that it decided to put the series in mothballs waiting for the right opportunity to relaunch it to the general public. That moment now seems to have arrived with the present Gangstar New Orleans, which abandons the old conventions to present itself in an unprecedented free to play guise: let's find out if it is a turning point capable of reversing the trend of a series in evident decline ... Despite the news, Gangstar New Orleans fails to make the leap in quality to the series We were so fired up As often happens in Gameloft productions, even in Gangstar New Orleans the plot is totally negligible: the player plays the role of an anonymous criminal who wants to take advantage of a momentary power vacuum to attempt to climb the criminal ranks of the iconic Louisiana city. The lack of truly original ideas is also highlighted by the mass of suggestions taken from other titles that are assembled here without a real logical thread: gangsters, zombies, mysticism and witchcraft coexist here without having much to do with each other, following the usual modus operandi of the ~so much more~ typical of the French software house. Usually, Gameloft titles compensate for the lack of innovations with a top-of-the-class technical component, but this is not the case with Gangstar New Orleans, which actually amazes in the negative with a far from impressive cosmetics. Net of a deliberately angular style that may or may not be liked, the product denotes a modest polygonal complexity, a fairly limited visual horizon and a general poverty of the scenario. However, one can turn a blind eye considering that we are still in the free to play area, an aspect which on the other hand leads Gangstar New Orleans to be subject to all - absolutely all - those dynamics that the detractors of the genre will find it difficult to digest. There's energy that drops with each mission and recharges over time, the dual-currency economic system, the in-game shop, unpacking of rewards, resources to collect and spend on upgrades, and much more: any expedient born of the human mind that can induce a microtransaction is present in the Gameloft title, leading in the long run to the inevitable bottlenecks destined to mark a clear division between users willing to put their hands on their wallets and all the others. Almost lost in the midst of this gigantic mass of extra-playful content, the gameplay of Gangstar New Orleans peeps out, which by itself would be anything but evil: the control system proves to be quite reliable and intuitive, the shootings manage to be pleasant thanks also to a successful cover system and a pleasant splash of RPG elements and even the driving sections look good. It's a pity that the game isn't really put in a position to express itself at its best, starting with an open world that is such only on paper: the free roaming part doesn't offer much substance and during the assignments the paths are well defined and not following them is even counterproductive given that in the final evaluation the time taken to complete the requested objective has the greatest influence. Finally, the same missions are very limited both in terms of variety and in their execution, resulting not only repetitive in the long run but also inconsistent with what, at least in theory, should be an emulator of Grand Theft Auto. In short, with Gangstar New Orleans one almost gets the impression that Gameloft has groped, trying to proceed in many different directions without following any of them with the right conviction.", "date": "2017-04-06", "grade": "6.5"}
