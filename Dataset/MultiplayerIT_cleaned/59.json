Those who know him do not necessarily love him; those who don't know him may have found a new author to study and appreciate. His The Silver Case first came out on PlayStation in 1999, and it took a good 18 years before we saw it again on PC and PlayStation 4. Today we play it in its most sensible form, strong on the portability of a console - Nintendo Switch - enriched by a further cryptic but quality visual novel. Do you like Japanese visual novels? Before continuing reading, ask yourself this question and if only if the answer is yes, continue. Because The Silver Case 2425 is a delicious little brick, but digestible only by those who already chew bread and oriental graphic adventures. It doesn't last long, it doesn't have simple writing, it isn't immediate in the controls and its English is quite complex. 24 districts The Silver Case 2425 is a visual novel that chronicles the follies of a serial killer named Kamui Uehara, in what is a fictional city called 24 Districts. You will have two scenarios, one led by the detectives behind the mad killer, the other starring a journalist. Stop, we won't tell you anything else. The original game was a bare-bones product, but a fascinating one nonetheless. Son of an extremely prolific era, Suda ventured into a narrative product in which graphics were absolutely not part of the merits; functional, yes, but certainly incapable of shining in a panorama of Japanese production that amalgamated and kept many works with similar connotations within its borders. The Silver Case emerged from anonymity later on, thanks to a journey by Suda in Capcom which elevated him to a key figure in Killer 7, a masterpiece by the Capcom Five, and for this character worthy of a videogame rediscovery. Portable case The Switch version takes up the HD setting already offered on PlayStation 4 and PC and makes it portable, certainly the best way to enjoy such a product, the experience of which can be sipped and taken with you. Graphically still poor, the increase in resolution, the new artwork, characters, textures and sound effects build an overall picture that you have to get used to. The Silver Case is an adventure in which you have to navigate between three-dimensional scenarios and solve puzzles: you will have to read, observe, aided by screen signs that help you understand what to do in a scene, but the emphasis is almost exclusively on reading the text. Lots of text. The narration is cryptic, difficult to follow, not easy to hook scene after scene, a flow of dialogues quite dry and amalgamated with little elegance, which demonstrates the inexperience that the author had at the time, despite the fact that the story and setting are captivating. Suda's work and inventiveness are primordial; it is evident that many of the traits of the product are good and enthralling, but it is the general flow that is a bit heavy to digest. There are horror, noir, underground, splashed and mixed shades as the Japanese like, collected in a narrative that alternates many dialogues with intermission scenes, maps, exploration and advancement sections, without a break. In terms of content, this remaster brings with it a couple of extra chapters, synergistic to the story, while the soundtrack turns out to be pleasantly old-school, an excellent ally for a dark and distressing story.", "date": "2021-07-11", "grade": "7.2"}
