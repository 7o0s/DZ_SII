And so between the Automatron that we already reviewed on these pages three weeks ago and about a month after the release of Far Harbor, which will offer hours and hours of new quests to be carried out in an unprecedented area, we find ourselves today talking about Wasteland Workshop, without a doubt the weakest package of the DLC trifecta. And it is no coincidence that it is also the cheapest one if you decide to buy it without having the season pass. Let's start immediately by saying that the contents of the package, as can be easily understood from the size of the download which does not even reach 100 MB on PC and console, concerns only and exclusively new objects completely dedicated to the customization and construction of one's settlements. No new quests or non-player characters, no additional weapons or equipment, no new enemies or camps. Wasteland Workshop is completely focused on offering the player new options to make their small towns even more attractive and ~alive~. With an interesting, albeit small, addition to the gameplay. A recommended DLC for compulsive settlement builders, but everyone else can avoid it Gotta catch'em all The biggest novelty of the add-on is represented by the cages: there are several, each dedicated to a specific type of animal and beast that we want to capture. The talent level requirements are minimal (at most we are asked for one point in Animal Friendship, one in Natural Empathy and four in Science!), They can be built with very few materials and require meat as bait. This is obviously dependent on the ~diet~ of the monster we want to add to our collection. Once built, we will be able to place them wherever we want within one of our settlements and after a random number of hours (usually 12 hours of sleep is enough) we will find it inhabited by the beast of our desires. At this point if it is a harmless animal we will be able to free it immediately and it will become an inhabitant of the camp to all intents and purposes, but if we have captured a ferocious beast we will necessarily have to build a beta wave emitter which will make it tame and harmless towards us and towards the other inhabitants. It is interesting to note that the captured monsters will also become an active part of our defenses in the now increasingly rare cases that we are attacked. The other addition concerns the combat arenas: constructions that respect the building concepts of the various homes and are able to leave room for the player's originality and creativity. Realizing them we will be able to make our captive prey fight. There are no particular requirements, we will simply have to make sure that we have placed the two red and blue platforms within the border and at that point, as soon as we have assigned the two captured beasts (but the inhabitants are also fine) to these elements as is done for the assignments, the battle will begin and end only when one of the two contenders is dead. There are no rewards, objectives or particular advantages in combining the clash outside of our sadistic personal satisfaction. And that's it - Wasteland Workshop offers nothing else. We also find it necessary to make a slightly broader discussion taking into account the platform used for our test, the PC. On computers, the modder community has long made it possible to capture and train all the enemies present in the game, among other things with the possibility of taking them with you even into battle, while in the DLC their presence is confined within of the settlements. Of course, the system is certainly more cumbersome and uncomfortable since it forces us to use the command console but it is absolutely nothing insurmountable for those who hang out in the mod environment and indeed we are convinced that with the release of this DLC most of the features will also be included in the most important changes. It is obvious that in the console environment the speech is a little different given that even today Bethesda has not implemented support for changes by cutting ~living room~ players out of everythingthat goodness that you can download and try for free on PC. It is also for this reason, but more generally for a general lack of really interesting content that we advise against the purchase of Wasteland Workshop. From a certain point of view, the DLC reminded us of those commercial operations that Electronic Arts did many years ago with the various packs of costumes and clothes for The Sims. Perhaps the comparison may seem forced and out of place but in the end this add-on can be really attractive only for those who still spend hours and hours experimenting with the building of their own settlements and can perhaps make good use of the approximately one hundred new implemented objects. And obviously for those who have the season pass and can therefore return for a handful of hours in the world of Fallout 4 while waiting for Far Harbor to arrive on the market.", "date": "2016-04-14", "grade": null}
