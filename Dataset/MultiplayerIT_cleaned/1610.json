{"name": "Brute Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brute-force-7.html", "text": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away One could fill a review just by listing all the details (micro or macroscopic) that Brute Force has in common with Halo. The control system, for example, is totally identical and even the possibility of carrying only two weapons at a time seems to be borrowed directly from the Bungie title, not to mention the fact that this time too we are dealing with levels full of aliens and futuristic vehicles. But don't be fooled by all this: Brute Force is not a trivial clone, but offers a game mechanic that has very little to do with Halo. First of all, the view is not in the first person but in the third, with the addition of a viewfinder to allow you to frame enemies with relative ease; moreover, no more solitary hero as a last resort for humanity, but a team of four valiant fighters (Tex, Flint, Hawk and Brutus), different in physical characteristics, such as running speed and resistance to blows, and equipment. This last feature is the one that most influences the gameplay, given that the possibility of ~switching~ in real time from one character to another is offered, as well as giving simple orders to the remaining ones controlled by the CPU. So here we will find ourselves wandering through levels structured in such a way as to propose favorable situations for certain characters, or having to break through enemy outposts relying on a cover of fire from the companions, while looking for a crack in which to infiltrate. Too bad, however, that the potential tactical implication offered by this last feature is less striking than it might seem, above all due to a limited availability of orders to be given and an artificial intelligence of the companions which, although not terrible, will make you understand quickly that doing chores yourself is actually much faster and more convenient. In short, from this point of view, but only from this, let's be clear, Conflict: Desert Storm and Ghost Recon are definitely on another planet... However, despite this little ingenuity, the title still remains decidedly enjoyable and fun, perhaps not too demanding in terms of level of difficulty and vaguely repetitive as missions, but certainly convincing in terms of playability. Brute force One of the aspects that triggered the most interest in Brute Force was certainly the extreme care in the technical sector that was evident from the first screenshots that appeared on the net. And rightly so, given that the Digital Anvil title confirms the excellent impressions aroused and demonstrates, as if it were still needed, all the goodness of the Xbox hardware. In fact, the graphics engine manages to manage huge levels decorated with infinite details and extremely detailed textures, all without ever moving from 30 FPS (except in multiplayer mode, where unfortunately some tricks are always lurking). The various characters are well characterized and moderately animated, while the splendid weather and light effects help to increase the feeling of involvement and realism; pity only for some not exactly well-kept details (see in this regard the explosions and the bad realization of the liquid surfaces), which however fail to scratch a decidedly positive final impression. As far as the sound sector is concerned, there is a good dubbing in Italian (in any case lower than the English counterpart), while the music is appreciated for its quality, even if the lack of dynamic management of the songs based on the events is definitely felt; the sound effects are excellent, especially if you can enjoy the game with an adequate multi-channel system. Longevity is guaranteed by the high number of missions and by the presence of a multiplayer mode in which up to eight players can challenge each other in sessions to the death (only locally though: strangely no compatibility with Xbox Live), however the difficulty is certainly not exaggerated and a certain repetitiveness of the single player mode could make you leave the game prematurely in the absence of friends to challenge. Conclusions Brute Force is a title that, while not reaching the peaks of excellence that we all hoped for, still proves to be extremely interesting and fun. Leaving aside the tactical and strategic ambitions, not particularly brilliant, we end up with a well-balanced and enjoyable game, technically well cared for and enhanced by a multiplayer mode which, althoughnot at the levels of delirium of that of Halo, it will not fail to give you hours and hours of healthy blasting fun. It certainly won't unseat the Bungie masterpiece in the hearts of Microsoft users, however it remains a product that we feel like warmly recommending to everyone. Pros: Very nice technically Devastating in multiplayer Original and fun Cons: Tends to be vaguely repetitive in single player The tactical component could have been implemented better A good indicator of the quality of a title is certainly the influence it has on the generations of games that follow it. Masterpieces such as Super Mario 64, Gran Turismo, Zelda Ocarina of Time and Virtua Fighter, just to name a few of the most famous, have been real milestones in the history of video games, deeply inspiring the videogame landscape as we know it. One of the most recent titles to demonstrate this combination of quality and charisma was certainly Halo: the masterpiece of mother Bungie has in fact forever changed the panorama of First Person Shooters on consoles, but not only, enjoying unthinkable public success for the genre and giving way to the rapid proliferation of clones and kindreds. This Brute Force for example, while proposing a substantially different game mechanic, is a title that certainly makes no secret of its links with the Killer Application par excellence on Xbox, but rather makes it one of its strengths, proposing itself as a worthy substitute in the hearts of all fans of the masterpiece made in Bungie, waiting for the second chapter of the Master Chief's adventures.
