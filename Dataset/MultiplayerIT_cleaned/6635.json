The ability to become completely anonymous, to hide in plain sight, tiptoe around and use the environment to pull off the perfect assassination. Here, Dojo Slash for iOS completely ignores the stealthy art of ninjutsu, focusing solely on combat. The game by South Korean developer Jinmann Kim is in fact a chaotic and messy fist fight between a ninja and an entire clan, a sort of Bud Spencer movie with oriental tunes, exotic weapons and colorful overalls. Dojo Slash is a small arcade game for iOS that pits a single ninja against an entire rival clan The finger clan After welcoming the user with a bizarre DOS (or, as it is called in the game, DOjoS) startup screen, the small Dopamine Reactor action arcade explains in a moment the few rules to keep in mind for jump right into the middle of the action. As a ninja too bold to enter a rival dojo all alone, the player must survive waves of enemies, eliminating them one by one and dodging their blows. Touching a point on the screen performs an attack in that direction, while holding down moves within the scenario. The controls are limited to that, and there's not much else to keep in mind. By making a clean sweep of enemy ninjas, you accumulate experience to spend every time you level up, choosing each time one of the three proposed skills: these range from more traditional power-ups, such as an increase in health, inflicted damage or of movement speed, to other rarer and more particular ones, such as the possibility of disappearing in a cloud of smoke in case of being hit. The peculiarity lies in the fact that with each game over all the power-ups collected are lost and you start from scratch, in such a way that, as in The Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy, the variety of each game depends precisely on the combination of power-ups chosen. However, between games it is possible to spend the coins collected by killing enemies to buy new weapons, which in addition to causing more damage also add permanent bonuses. Different colored ninjas have different behavior in battle: greens are the weakest and most predictable to dodge, yellows can interrupt an attack to start moving again, purples throw shurikens and so on. Every ten waves you also have to face a more resistant and stronger than average boss, and it is therefore clear that, despite the simplicity of the game mechanics, a minimum of strategy is needed if you want to survive for a long time. Based on the types of ninjas on the screen, the player must quickly evaluate which ones to attack first, knowing that some require more hits than others and at the same time trying not to stall too much: after the first ten waves, in fact, a moment's hesitation is enough and the screen fills up with little colorful ninjas, like so many confetti armed with katanas, shurikens and sais. At that point, being able to dodge all the attacks becomes almost impossible, and a moment later our ninja collapses to the ground, with a rain of cherry petals announcing game over. What is certain is that Dojo Slash ends up discovering all his cards in a few games: players will probably favor a couple of specific power-ups, and each game gradually becomes more and more similar to the previous one until, finally tired, we decide to hang up nailed katana.", "date": "2015-01-12", "grade": "7.8"}
