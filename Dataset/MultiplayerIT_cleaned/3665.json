Review finished, go in peace. Joking aside, we are faced with a title that stresses the formula already seen in Punch Club, the first title of Lazy Bear Games, however taking it to its extreme consequences, that is, ending up showing its playful paucity. In Swag and Sorcery the player must carry out the mission entrusted to him by the king of a kingdom on the verge of collapse: to find a certain magical object with the power to solve all problems. To do this, you need to hire heroes and send them on missions to seven different places, hunting for resources and enemies. In the meantime it is necessary to equip our base, a fantasy village, with new structures, which yield different objects and powers, so as to be able to face the challenges that become more and more demanding over time. On paper we are dealing with a nice pixel art management with role-playing game elements, but in practice Swag and Sorcery is something different and conceptually much less profound: a clicker game disguised with icons to move here and there. No real skill is required of the player: it only matters to be patient in the face of the very long resource collection phases, or grinding, if you prefer, which are essential to make our heroes grow in level and number. Gameplay Swag and Sorcery is divided into two phases: management and adventures, both terribly superficial. In the first you have to basically spend the resources accumulated in the second. Need healing potions? Provided you have the right herbs, you can drag a hero to the alchemist's studio and have them made. Do we need some new equipment for our warrior? Just drag a hero to the blacksmith shop and have him forge it. The system is simple and immediate, but is strongly linked to the second phase, that of the adventures. What is it about? Basically you have to drag the icons of the heroes onto the stable, choosing their order, select a world to face, start the mission and watch. The unfolding of the adventures is in fact almost completely automatic and the player is only responsible for casting spells, when available, and pressing the retreat button in case of problems, so as not to lose all the loot accumulated in the event of death (never permanent) but only half. Each world you can venture into yields unique resources, while each successfully completed adventure fills the bar of the selected world's boss a little, which can only be challenged when 100% is reached. So far everything would work well and would be declassified as a nice pastime, if it weren't for the fact that after a few hours of play the collection of resources becomes a pain and to get what is needed to achieve anything it is necessary to repeat the same adventures an infinite number of times . Things seem to improve when the possibility of conducting multiple adventures at the same time is unlocked (maximum three), but it is only an illusion because the grinding almost immediately takes over everything else. To break the rhythm of this perverse mechanism a little, there are some additional game mechanics, such as beauty contests, which, however, to be won require the creation of expensive elegant clothes (another grinding), and the quests, generally very trivial ( build building X, kill boss Y, collect n resources and so on), which also serve to develop the thin plot that forms the backdrop to the action. Hero management Unfortunately, even the hero management part is not at all thorough. Enlistable in the guild, heroes have very few values to consider. Their characteristics are essentially used to decide which equipment to give them, so as to determine their class. Do you want to create a warrior? Give a plate armor and a sword to a character with good strength and voil. Want to create a thief? Easy, just give a leather armor and a crossbow to an agile character. That's all? That's all. Equipment modifies the behavior of heroes during adventures. For example, a warrior placed in the rear will fight only when whoever is in front of him has been defeated, while a character equipped with a crossbow can also attack from the second row. To level up the heroes you have to spend money at the boot camp. It's the only way and the growth of values is automatic. Unfortunately, adventures do not yield experience that can be spent on improving them. In short, the player has minimal control over their fate. The only interventions allowed are the aforementioned choice of equipment and the restoration of the salt valuesute, which is obtained by paying the local church or by spending some time, and morale, by sending the heroes to the spa. Swag and Sorcery is all here and it's even less than it seems, it can be so repetitive. Good pixel art graphics and the spot on, but simple soundtrack against the wild grinding which it forces from the beginning to the end of the game, burdened by the lack of variety of adventures and the substantial inconsistency of the player's actions, can do little.", "date": "2019-05-18", "grade": "4.5"}
