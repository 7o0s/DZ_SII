The answer is yes, as Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines first and Assassin's Creed III Liberation then demonstrated. While not shining in some respects, both titles offered the possibility of running and climbing on roofs, eliminating enemies by coming from behind them, using a stealth approach and making the iconic leap of faith. In short, we are talking about productions that are far from the albeit valid two-dimensional declinations of the franchise, experiments that are perhaps too ambitious but capable, in fact, of testifying that with some cuts and some simplifications it is also possible to achieve such a complex objective. With Assassin's Creed Identity, history repeats itself: a few years have passed and a real chapter of the Ubisoft series has never been seen on mobile devices, so the curiosity to verify the goodness of the project and its adherence to the gameplay that we know well was great . Assassin's Creed Identity is a ~synthesis~ of the Ubisoft franchise designed for use on the go Back to the golden age The story of Assassin's Creed Identity takes place practically simultaneously with the most famous episodes of the franchise, in fifteenth-century Italy, and puts us in the shoes of an Assassin who fights against the order of the Templars and the powerful Borgia family. The locations present in the game are Florence, Rome and Monteriggioni, but obviously we are not talking about entire cities as we saw them in Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, but about certain neighborhoods, which can be explored with a view to relatively short missions. The single player campaign is currently made up of only ten levels, to which new ones will be added in the future, set in Forl, and is supported by an infinite series of short side quests, the ~contracts~, which are used to collect coins and experience points to spend on the RPG component of the product. In fact, it is possible to unlock new items of equipment and make them wear to your Assassin, as well as use a forge to create new and better ones; Too bad that all this has little effect on the gameplay. The same character can be chosen from a list of three different classes (Warrior, Dark Blade, King of Trickery), plus one to be unlocked for a fee (Thief - to be precise). The differences are all in the allocation of special maneuvers, given that for example the Dark Blade class can learn to throw knives at enemies to inflict extra damage during fights, while the Warrior is instead specialized in close-range fights and can hit multiple opponents at the same time. A true Assassin's Creed? Ubisoft's goal was to create a ~synthesis~ of Assassin's Creed designed for use on the go, therefore with missions short enough to be completed in a matter of minutes and maps of contained dimensions. The big unknown obviously concerned the touch control system, and we can say that an almost perfect job was done in this sense: there are important automations in the execution of the climb, buttons that change function in a contextual way (to stealthily assassinate, fight head-on, hide in a shelter or take a leap of faith from a height) and a visual indicator that allows us to understand what our character will do as we run towards a ledge or a wall, whether he will jump onto a nearby roof or he will throw himself into the street. In this regard, the descent from the buildings has been trivialized for the sake of simplicity, but beyond this the balance between the things included in the gameplay and those excluded is positive. Sorry for those situations in which the virtual stick ~goes crazy~, thinking that you want to move by touching the right side of the screen, and this in some cases can lead to the failure of a challenge or the entire mission, if this occurs example in being seen by the target we were tailing. Visually speaking The developers have drawn on the numerous assets of the mother series to deliver us convincing and evocative glimpses of extraordinary places, and from this point of view we cannot complain: on iPhone 6s the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, which is very important for precision touch controls, and displays splendid monuments such as Palazzo Vecchio, the Colosseum, Castel Sant'Angelo and S. Maria del Fiore. Unfortunately, our desire to explore cities is limited by traditional Animus barriers, but this is an understandable expedient. As often happens in the mobile sector, the textures used are quite defined, but they have been applied to not very detailed polygonal models, as seenNote when you come across portions of architecture with a circular shape. The animations are discreet (apart from the unusual ~shaking~ of our Assassin) and the inevitable glitches do not give too much trouble compared to the enjoyment of the experience. The sound sector makes a fine show of some historical music from the series, but on the effects front there is little to rejoice in: the noises of the cities, which helped to create a certain atmosphere, are practically absent.", "date": "2016-03-03", "grade": "7.5"}
