History Marvel Future Fight boasts a Captain America that is visually better than that of Marvel's Avengers, and more Faced with the incipit of Marvel Future Revolution, the mind runs fast to DC's Crisis of Infinite Earths, of course, but Marvel also faced the issue a few years ago with the collapse of the Ultimate Universe, which led to a real clash between the heroes belonging to the two worlds, some of which then settled in the traditional universe (see Miles Morales). and his ability to manipulate the consistency of matter, gives life to a single world in which different realities coexist, unfortunately not always in a peaceful way. Marvel Future Revolution, Tony Stark and Nick Fury have a little problem with the Ultrons That's why Tony Stark, Hank Pym and Nick Fury form Omega Flight, a large group of heroes from different dimensions, but united in the desire to make things right. The four characters that we will select from a shortlist that includes Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Storm and Star-Lord will therefore be recruited and will have to complete a series of missions in perfect MMORPG style to be able to support the cause. However, each of these heroes will first be introduced in a particular chapter, set in its reality of origin and with traditional enemies, such as the Green Goblin for Spider-Man or the Red Skull for Captain America, or even M.O.D.O.K. for Iron Man, and so on. After completing this phase, which serves as a tutorial, we will find ourselves in the Omega Flight headquarters, observing the splendid panorama of New Star City waiting for us to be assigned tasks. Gameplay and structure Marvel Future Revolution, Iron Man wreaks havoc among the troops of A.I.M. It is precisely after the introductory phase that Marvel Future Revolution reveals its weaknesses, all linked to the MMORPG nature of the Netmarble-branded production, which in truth does not even offer a true open world but simply fairly large and separate scenarios. Chaos reigns in the common areas, but also on the battlefield there is an incredible confusion that makes the clashes much less enjoyable due to the continuous intertwining between the enemies of one user and another who however belong to the same mission. to select four different protagonists in practice translates into as many save slots, with the impossibility of switching from one to the other instantly and therefore the need to carry out four distinct and separate campaigns rather than a single shared progression: a such a solution would have given the experience more variety. Marvel Future Revolution, the character select screen: this is Captain Marvel in all its beauty Yes, because the combat system shows all its cards a little too quickly, already in the initial chapter, unlocking the skills affected by cooldowns that characterize the repertoire of each single hero and to which we will have to resort continuously during battles that seem lay the foundations for a generous amount of grinding when we find ourselves facing opponents too strong for our level. In practice everything is very spectacular, mind you: the touch controls work well, even if managing the view while fighting is literally a nightmare, and there is a dodge button that allows at least to evade enemy attacks and opt for a ~hit and run~ strategy that allows you to defeat even bosses on paper much stronger than us, targeting them for example with Iron Man's Unibeam, missiles and repulsors, then create some distance again, recharge abilities and charge back. Marvel Future Revolution, Captain America punches some Hydra Nazis However, the problem is relatedto the tradition of MMORPGs, which are not generally known for the yield of impacts, on the contrary they tend to give us a slippery and inconsistent combat system, which feeds on more or less chaotic piles to try to always inflict a certain amount of damage and make it necessary to purchase of health restoration kits. Furthermore, the controller is not yet supported and it is a great pity, because it would really make a difference. The gameplay characteristics of Marvel Future Revolution inevitably merge with those of its structure, made up of many more or less similar missions, some more interesting than others , which make up an apparently very rich and full-bodied campaign. However, there is the shadow of microtransactions that weighs on the actual ability to play for free and smoothly: it is difficult to succeed even after completing the first two or three acts. Technical realization Marvel Future Revolution and aesthetic customizations: here is the complete set of the Ultimate version of Iron Man Undoubtedly the best part of Marvel Future Revolution, the technical realization raises mobile gaming to new standards and comes surprisingly close to the quality of a product like Marvel's Avengers on consoles, even surpassing it in certain aspects (see the design of the characters) and delivering graphics that run smoothly on iPad Pro at maximum quality and at 60 fps... at least until the device starts to heat up too much. All the heroes are voiced in English, sometimes by well-known actors (see the classic Yuri Lowenthal as of Spider-Man), and the subtitles in Italian (unfortunately they cannot be deactivated) help to fully understand the exchanges and facets of a plot which is clearly largely a simple expedient to justify missions and fights which inevitably tend to become repetitive. The element of customizations has obviously not been ignored, and here the comparison with the aforementioned Marvel's Avengers is even merciless given that the characters of Marvel Future Revolution can not only unlock costume portions linked to specific comic sagas or created for the occasion , but wearing them proudly showing them in-game and acquiring concrete advantages as a result. Of course, not everything is perfect: the sound design in general appears a bit confused and approximate, but it is above all the aspects related to the MMORPG nature of the product, there we will never get tired of saying it, creating unpleasant situations both to see and to play, such as the continuous re-proposition of the same enemies within a fight or the fact that they never stop coming back, forcing us to leave the area once the targets have been eliminated designated and letting other players take care of it.", "date": "2021-08-31", "grade": "8.0"}
