One of the first titles to use this approach was Castle Wolfenstein, developed in the early 1980s by Muse Software. It was a top-down action game in which an American soldier had to infiltrate the walls of a Nazi-controlled castle to get hold of documents vital to achieving victory in the world conflict. After a 1984 sequel (Beyond Wolfenstein), the series was revived by id Software who transformed it into a three-dimensional first person shooter, the one that actually determined the great success of the genre on PC. We are clearly talking about Wolfenstein 3D, released in 1992 but still popular among fans, so much so that seventeen years later not only are we still talking about it but even reinterpretations designed for portable gaming devices are drawn. Wolfenstein RPG, in this case, takes up the classic mechanics of the id-branded FPS and modifies them to add a role-playing setting: the exploration of the scenarios is free, but as soon as we meet enemies, the action proceeds in turns until the conclusion of the fight. Furthermore, our character ~grows~ as the adventure progresses, becoming stronger and more resistant: the classic ~level up~ of RPGs. Private Blazkowicz is back Only a few months have passed since the release of Wolfenstein 3D Classic for iPhone, so our return to the castle takes place after a substantial ~review~ of the original shooter. Shooter that never seems to get old and still today is capable of conquering both casual gamers and more experienced gamers in just a few moments, thanks to the immediate gameplay and the excellent touch screen control system. Different choices were made for Wolfenstein RPG: the virtual d-pad responds to our requests in a perhaps less punctual way, but the ~strafe~ is present by default (without modifying the controls, therefore) and is obtained by drawing a horizontal line on the screen . Of course, the presence of turn-based combat makes the maneuver simpler and less risky: moving sideways during one ~live~ shooting would certainly have been cumbersome in such conditions. Compared to the original game, this RPG version gives a certain prominence to the conversations with the characters that we find within the locations, furthermore pushing us to interact with the setting to earn points: we can destroy paintings and armor, operate switches and get food at the old-fashioned way (~roasting~ one of the many chickens that roam the castle). The collection of weapons and objects is automatic, and it is possible at any time to access the inventory to use medkits or one of the serums that we can create by combining empty syringes and liquids of different colors using special machines. We can create concoctions capable of increasing our strength and resistance, or capable of instilling fear in our opponents... the player is free to decide the combinations, based on ready-made instructions or proceeding by trial and error. Once faced with one or more enemies, as anticipated, the action proceeds in turns in which we can move and attack. In case of difficulty, the inventory always remains accessible, so if we have any tonics it becomes very difficult to leave our skin. A renovated castle For this RPG reimagining, Wolfenstein has been completely redesigned. We are always faced with a hybrid and ~false~ 3D solution, with the characters represented by bitmap sprites that are scaled according to the distance. The drawings are all new, however, and the zoom is managed by the iPhone in a masterly way, so much so that even with the enemies in the foreground it is difficult to notice a few pixels. Certainly such an approach appears antiquated and a completely polygonal solution would have made everything more convincing, also and above all in terms of animation (really lacking). The interaction with the environment is of a moderate level, nothing to do with the videogames of recent years but certainly superior to the classic version. The level of detail of the scenarios is good but there is a certain basic repetitiveness, while the sound doesn't work miracles in terms of quantity and quality.
