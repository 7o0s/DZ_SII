{"name": "Trauma Center: New Blood - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trauma-center-new-blood-recensione.html", "text": "Shall we play doctor? After an introductory sequence characterized by beautiful music, we will find ourselves in front of a structure very similar to the one seen in Trauma Center: Second Opinion, therefore with the various episodes that are unlocked one after the other and can be replayed indefinitely in an attempt to improve your score. If we wish, we can also try our hand at simple operating practice, facing situations that we may find again in subsequent cases. The plot unfolds through the dialogues between the characters, with the latter being represented on the screen using a series of really excellent drawings, which alternate on the basis of the spoken word (in English, well acted and subtitled in Italian): the system, with its obvious limitations, it works very well and has been optimized since the first episode. Before taking on the role of the surgeon, we will have to choose which of the two characters to use, but more for a question of ~completeness~ (the episodes must be completed with both doctors to finish the game 100%) than anything else. Whatever our alter-ego, in fact, there will be no differences except as regards the special ability, which in the case of Markus Vaughn can slow down time, in the case of Valerie Blaylock it can prevent the patient's conditions from worsening for a few seconds. The way to activate the Gift of Aesculapius is always the same: you have to hold down the B and Z keys on the controllers, then draw a star with the Wii-mote. Just like in Second Opinion, this is not a very intuitive or simple procedure, especially when the tension is high and you are in a hurry: in such situations, getting the lines right becomes really complicated. The tools of the trade The graphics during the operations have not changed one iota, and present us with the usual stylized polygonal model of the patient, as well as the ~cursor~ which represents the range of action of our character. By moving the analog stick of the Nunchuck in the eight directions we will be able to select as many instruments (antibiotic gel, forceps, syringe, scalpel, suture needle, aspirator, laser and ultrasound device), while other possibilities (defibrillator, open heart cardiac massage, etc. ) will be presented to us from time to time, as appropriate. Even from this point of view, no changes are noticed, but there is still the great novelty represented by the cooperative multiplayer mode for two players: it will be possible to operate in two, each using a Wii-mote / Nunchuck pair and coordinating to complete the intervention in the shortest possible time. It's a pity that this mode isn't possible online too (the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is only present for uploading results from the point of view of the rankings), or that in any case nothing has been done to take advantage of the internet connection: the game would have gained, and not a little. Before taking on the role of the surgeon, we will have to choose which of the two characters to use. Technical realization As mentioned above, New Blood has decidedly ~optimized~ graphics compared to Second Opinion: the plot is told through what is ultimately a simple slideshow, but which boasts first-class character design and very well spoken played, with just the right levels of intensity. The interface has remained unchanged, so everything is very ~legible~ and navigating the menus using the Wii-mote's pointing system proves to be a simple and intuitive practice. The infrared device is in fact the main protagonist of the Atlus title, and during the interventions it behaves in a rather precise manner, even if there are some annoying blunders: in some cases, perhaps in the most agitated situations, there is an incorrect detection of the pointer . Perhaps we are short on time and the patient is dying, so getting harm rather than the desired action can result in episodes of severe frustration. Frustration which, one could say, never as in this case ~is part of the game~, but which could at least be limited with a control of the interface rather than with the mere re-proposition of a system that worked for the first episode but which was still far from perfect. Moreover, it must be added that often the briefing before the operation turns out to be too little detailed, and we will have to figure out on our own (through annoying trials and errors) what to do to complete the operation. Comment Trauma Center: New Blood only confirms the validity of the Atlus branded series, truly one of the few ~third parties~ capable of creating a product for the Wii that is not only technically up to par, but also endowed with a strong personality. The differences from thefirst episode are far from marked, but that's perfectly fine: the graphics have been optimized, the sound is slightly richer, the story behind it is completely new and the situations are more numerous and intriguing. The presence of two characters to choose from leaves the time it finds, given that the only thing that changes is the special power available, while the cooperative multiplayer mode is certainly interesting and can represent a starting point for future applications, hoping whether you want to focus more on online, even if only to organize remote challenges. All right, in short? Well, it must be said that some shortcomings of the detection system could be worked out, as the game can already be very frustrating in itself and there was no need to make it even more complicated. Apart from this, New Blood stands as an excellent ~more of the same~, to be grabbed on the fly in case you liked the first episode. Pros Engaging and challenging like few others Tested game system Technically very well done Cons It can be really frustrating Two characters, but no difference Detection system not always infallible", "date": "2008-11-27", "grade": null}
