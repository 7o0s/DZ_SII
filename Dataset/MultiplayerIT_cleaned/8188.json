It is obviously Mario Kart, progenitor and absolute paradigm of this sub-genre, which seems to have started a racing game trend but which, in fact, has done nothing but propose a ~Marian~ interpretation of racing which becomes difficult to replicate. regardless of the specific characteristics of the Nintendo masterpiece. It is a difficult alchemical formula to manage and interpret, which hardly manages to result in a product even remotely comparable to the glories of the progenitors of the large N, so difficult that the Kyoto house itself no longer seems capable of achieving the results of the past. This must be said, because the reference to Mario Kart, even in an apparently different product and son of other times such as F1 Race Stars, is in any case evident in many respects, partly due to the need to adapt to the by now established canon and a partly due to the obvious difficulty for the developers in proposing something completely different. From this point of view, it is not surprising to find practically the same strategic scheme adopted for the characteristics of the power-ups and the relative balance of forces between the weapons, which behave in rather familiar ways. Green shell, red shell, thorny shell, bananas and mushrooms all have their equivalent within this Codemasters title, obviously transfigured into other tools which, moreover, are graphically rather anonymous. In short, the interpretation of kart racing according to Codemasters is not exactly a pearl of originality, but to give consistency to a difficult identification of the game comes the rich official license of Formula One, which manages to give the whole product a particular characterization, certainly able to attract a good slice of the public for his unprecedented vision - yes - of the otherwise serious circus of the top FIA championship. The glowing world of F1-kart Adherence to the Mario Kart canon appears extremely dutiful on the part of Codemasters, perhaps due to the desire to play it safe in a territory in which the British publisher does not have much experience, despite the fact that he is now an authority in the field of racing games in general. So, temporarily leaving out the surrounding elements and going to look at the core of the game, we find ourselves in front of the classic package: a series of drivers with related cars to choose from, three race classes with progressive difficulty and speed, challenges or points races, imaginatively designed tracks littered with power-ups to collect, and even the good old-fashioned starting light that requires you to press the accelerator at the right time to get a fast start. In short, the Codemasters Racing experiment takes place in full respect of tradition, although it contains original ideas linked above all to the theme of Formula One. The idea predominates that greater courage in experimenting with alternative solutions would have been desirable, also given the undoubted skill and experience of the developers in the field of racing, although the immediacy and above all the pervasive presence of multiplayer makes up for the somewhat fun ' caciarone to the shortcomings of the design. For example, a greater prominence entrusted to the player's pure ability to drive the vehicle (also given the experience of Codemasters in the racing field) could have given a more original touch to the structure of the game, which instead tends to rely a little too much to the randomness of the power-up roulette, capable of substantially modifying the set-up of the race at any time. Or, drivers and cars could have been characterized in a more specific way by inserting statistics capable of modifying everyone's behavior on the track - something that has also always been present in Mario Kart - instead of exclusively associating each team with only one special ability each, moreover without any link with the corresponding real drivers and cars. In the same way, the total absence of the ~power slide~ element, i.e. the acceleration in correspondence with drifts, a controversial feature which has by now settled in kart racing for several years now, eliminates a further technicality which could have made it more stimulating the driving experience. Codemasters wanted to follow another path, and not without an evident underlying coherence, focusing more decisively on the ~casual~ audience and on the possibility of attracting children and families to a driving party game. From this perspective, the experiment looks quite successful: F1 Race Stars is immediately fun and immediate, not excessively selective and certainly clearly devoted to multiplayer. There are, however, small touches of originality, in particular in correspondence with the references to Formula One, which in fact characterize this game. Contrary to what happens in similar titles, for example, here are the pits, from which it is necessary to pass whenever our car suffers too much damage and begins to lose ground. In the same way, the presence of the KERS, which gives more or less intense acceleration depending on the speed with which we manage to load it by rhythmically pressing the accelerator key within certain checkerboard areas of the tracks, constitutes an interesting innovative variant , even if excessively limited, being usable only in predetermined points of the slopes. Multifaceted challenges The possibilities offered, in terms of game modes, are truly multiple and varied between single and multiplayer, which is one of the strengths of F1 Race Stars. At this juncture, freeing itself from the legacy of the founders of kart racing and from the classic dual channel of the race and the ~battle~ with power-ups, the Codemasters game does its utmost in a series of alternative solutions which, together with the wide possibilities of multiplayer, allow the construction of really interesting playlists. In single or split-screen it is possible to create custom events by applying modifiers to eight different racing modes, creating decidedly different game possibilities and also entrusting users with the possibility of varying the balance of power-ups or applying additional game elements for customization depth of the game, always outside the main mode (Career and single races). Online multiplayer is rightly taken care of by Codemasters in this title and allows up to 12 players to compete in the same match. The particularly interesting thing is given by the fact that up to four players can participate in split-screen on the same console, in order to expand the multiplayer ~in presence~ with the online possibilities, thus combining the advantages of the shared screen with the online context, which widens the level of the challenge. Finally, the offline Career paves the way for a vast series of variants of the standard race, which combine the player's progression - above all given by the unlocking of additional game content and boundary elements for customization - also diversified mechanics, which can go to cover, at least in part, that technical void that characterizes the general, messy frenzy of standard racing, while also offering more challenges based on driving ability. Of course, these are digressions that do not have the bite of the classic race - a mode that in fact remains the central pivot of the gaming experience - but given the not exactly excessive depth of the latter, such a quantity of additional and diversified challenges is certainly appreciable . Xbox 360 goals There are 49 unlockable achievements for the classic total of 1000 points to add to the Gamerscore. Being a racing characterized by different modes and variants, the awards are distributed quite widely over the spectrum of game possibilities, even if the richest prizes are certainly those related to progression in the long career. For point hunters, however, the achievements in this case are an excellent starting point to try all the racing solutions available. Formula One Super Deformed Another particularly successful element in this Codemasters experiment is represented by the characterization, which could also represent one of the major challenges for the developers, finding themselves having to work on precious and delicate material such as the official licenses of Formula One. So the style chosen is pleasant and fun, just as the typical elements of this sport appear pleasant and functional, inserted in the context of kart racing, such as the aforementioned car repair box with its strategic influences of considerable importance in the mechanics of game, the safety car used as a weapon to reduce the gap between the drivers and then the KERS, despite the doubts the latter raises in functional terms within the gameplay. The challenge of transfiguring the official Formula One into the glittering world of purely arcade and abstract kart racing, therefore, was won by the Birmingham team, at least from a stylistic point of view, with the caricatures of the drivers that capture the essence of real faces and they manage to make them fun. If anything, the problem is given by the excessive homologation of cars and drivers who, while maintainingofficial colors and features between cars and helmets (although always in SD form), during the races they are not distinguished from each other in a particular and extravagant way as perhaps normally happens in similar games. The graphic system is built on the basis of Codemasters' powerful Ego Engine, which, freed from the task of seeking photorealism, manages to manage the extravagant but rather stylized settings of the tracks quite smoothly, with a fluidity that reaches 60 frames per second in the single player mode and some rather spectacular moments on the most daring tracks, between jumps, ramps and convoluted paths that aim to create imaginative and cartoonish versions of the various locations typical of the Formula One championship. The graphics are functional to the stylized characterization and in line with the production leveled on a predominantly casual audience, therefore we are quite far from the most spectacular applications of the Ego, but the feast of colors present on the screen fills the eyes and some touches of class, such as the effect of the wet track during the downpours of rain (another power-up that affects all opponents) embellish the aesthetics of the game.", "date": "2012-11-13", "grade": "7.0"}
