{"name": "Yo-Kai Watch 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yo-kai-watch-3-recensione-nintendo-3ds.html", "text": "It seems that the goal has finally been achieved: Europe is officially on par with the Yo-Kai Watch series, even ahead of the American continent. The funny creatures inspired by oriental folklore at home immediately achieved exceptional success, so much so that over the years they seriously undermined the primacy of the Pokmon franchise, with which they share more than one aspect in gameplay and underlying ideas. The main chapters of the Yo-Kai Watch series took us quite a while to arrive: think that Yo-Kai Watch 3 was released in Japan in 2016, and has only been available here in Europe for a few days; in America it will even arrive at the beginning of February 2019. While we wait for Level-5 to complete the work on the highly anticipated Yo-Kai Watch 4, however, Yo-Kai Watch 3 is not only the right opportunity to complete the original trilogy, but also the one to approach the franchise by those who have not yet found a way and time; you will find out why in our review. Plot: The adventure doubles Yo-Kai Watch 3 is the biggest, fullest and most complete Yo-Kai game ever: in Japan it has been released three times, first in the classic initial double represented by the Sushi and Tempura chapters, then by the third episode Sukiyaki which included all previous content plus never-before-seen content. What you can buy in Europe is the Sukiyaki version, generically known as Yo-Kai Watch 3, therefore inside you will find all the human knowledge and developed up to now by the talented Level-5 guys. Never as in this case could we say that the adventure also doubles as regards the plot of the game: in Yo-Kai Watch 3 the protagonist of all time and already present in Yo-Kai Watch 2 naturally returns, that is Nate, in the company of those pranksters from Whisper and Jibanyan; but they are not alone, since the plot will be marked for alternate episodes, now focusing on the adventures of Nate, now on those of his contemporary Anne. Anne is a completely new character in the franchise, and we hope she will be recovered because she has plenty of charisma: her exploits will bring her into contact with the world of invisible Japanese sprites for the first time ever, thanks to Usapyon's intervention; this curious Yo-Kai is looking for a mysterious scientist, but we prefer not to tell you more to avoid spoiling the pleasure of discovery. Of course you can expect, however, a more interesting handling of the main themes of the series: friendship, adventure, teamwork with regard to Nate and his fellow Yo-Kai, and even a little more psychological insight and emotional drama (without never exaggerate, though) from Anne and Usapyon; their story not infrequently also takes on melancholic hues. What we have told you about so far is the real big news of Yo-Kai Watch 3: a double narrative line that intersects and alternates for quite a few hours of gameplay, until you find its harmonic conclusion. Of novelties from the point of view of gameplay, however, there are really too few, and it is the main flaw of an incredibly rich production of content, perhaps the true swansong of the Nintendo 3DS (at least in Europe). Contents: More Yo-Kai than ever before By themselves, the titles of the Yo-Kai series always offer an impressive amount of hours of gameplay, especially for completionists: in perfect Pokmon style, in fact, the player plays Nate (and now Anne too) while the latter undertakes a series of adventures that bring him into contact with a certain number of sprites, with each of which it will be possible to fight and make friends, and then add it to your collection. Each Yo-Kai Medal obtained by defeating the cute little monsters will be added to the Medaglium (i.e. to the Pokdex imagined by Level-5) from where it will then be possible to summon them to add them to your team and thus start new battles. Therefore, apart from the conclusion of the main plot, the player can do what he most wants: explore the game world in all its breadth, discovering all its secrets, collecting all the available Yo-Kai, training his favorites up to at the maximum level by creating real invincible monsters. And here comes the fun part, because Yo-Kai Watch 3 has a lot of content: Yo-Kai Watch 2 had 300 spirits inside, while the new chapter in the series has twice as many. Now, imagine having to find all 600 Yo-Kai in every corner of the game world, including some very rare and legendary ones: clearly you will spend all the next Christmas holidays and much more time in the company of Nate and Anne. The game world then doubles in turn, as does the number of Yso-kai present, of the protagonists and of the narrative lines: this time we will no longer find ourselves exploring (only) the already vast Japanese town of Valdoro, but above all Arachidia, a real imaginary metropolis in the United States where the unpublished 'Merican Yo -Kai, or the western variants of Yo-kai. Gameplay and art direction All this good things could immediately make you explode in cries of joy, especially if you are true lovers of the Yo-Kai series: we don't even feel like holding back your enthusiasm too much, because the title is really worthy of attention, and also for newcomers given that the links with the previous episodes are not felt too much and that in any case everything starts from scratch from a collecting point of view. The problem with Yo-Kai Watch 3, which we know will probably be addressed properly with the next Yo-Kai Watch 4, is a certain aspect of the gameplay that still fails to fully convince today: the fight between the sprites. Once again, Yo-Kai are thrown onto the battlefield and then left to their own devices, doing whatever they like based on their personal inclinations; each of them belongs to a specific tribe and has particular moves, but how useful is such a variety of types and classes when real-time combat goes on its own? The player can use the Nintendo 3DS stylus to poke the sprites, cheer them on, make them perform the super devastating special move once it has charged properly, and move them within an unprecedented nine-square grid; the latter certainly adds a pinch of more strategy, but everything remains too simplistic, random and perhaps even confusing to really manage to shine. The hope is that Yo-Kai Watch 4 finally introduces a combat system designed in an intelligent way, even because pretty much everything else works now well now very well. And above all, let's take advantage of the occasion to once again praise the artistic direction and the technical sector created by Level-5 on a console that has several years behind it: Yo-Kai Watch 3 is a real gem, very pleasant to see, musically and artistically inspired, and also dubbed by us in a valuable Italian language.", "date": "2018-12-11", "grade": "8.5"}
