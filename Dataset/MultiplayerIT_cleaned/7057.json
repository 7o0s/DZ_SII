{"name": "Inerzia mortale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/133754-abyss-inerzia-mortale.html", "text": "Earth, year 3024: the planet's natural resources have run out and the only hope for humanity lies in the depths of the ocean, where a mysterious energy called ~Gaia~ seems to be hiding. Commanding a special octopus-shaped underwater vehicle, the Nep2no, a brave pilot is sent to the bottom of the sea to recover all available energy and restore hope to the world. Succeeding in the enterprise, however, will be anything but simple. Originally released on DSiWare in 2012, Abyss is presented as a very simple action game with an affordable price (1.99 euros), but characterized by a distinctly hardcore approach, which finds its embodiment in the inertial-based control system. The experience created by the Spanish EnjoyUp Games team is decidedly essential, so much so that there are no tutorials or introductory sequences to illustrate the plot of the game, but only an interface (ugly) that asks if we want to try our hand at the missions or with the competitive mode for two players. The latter consists of a sort of race to see who reaches the finish line first (or survives), to be tackled strictly locally, with one participant on the GamePad and the other referring to the TV screen while holding a Wiimote. Abyss is an inertial action game with distinctly hardcore gameplay, full of atmosphere and at a good price Missions and Countermissions The single player mode forms the core of the game, with twelve missions in which our objective is to recover six particles of Gaia before reaching the exit. Once the first campaign is completed, a second one is unlocked (Dark Mode) with eight further levels, more difficult and with some variations on the theme, for example the mechanisms that must be rotated until they stop, while trying not to crash . It is precisely this last element that makes Abyss such a difficult title, because a double impact is enough to incur game over and have to start the stage all over again. In what double sense? When the octopus-submarine we control slams against one of the walls of the scenario, the hull flashes for a couple of seconds: if we manage to normalize the movement of the vehicle we will be able to survive and continue our exploration; but if on the first impact a second is immediately followed, perhaps because we panicked and made a too abrupt counter-maneuver, there will be nothing to do. It goes without saying that the inertial system and the controls play a central role, and that a certain period of adaptation is needed to understand the philosophy behind the game and avoid dying every two by three between shouts and curses. The commands of the Nep2no, on the other hand, are apparently very simple: any of the buttons of the GamePad is used to impart acceleration starting from the mechanical tentacles, while the left analog stick rotates the position of the vehicle and therefore directs its movement. At the bottom of the sea The secret to completing the levels of Abyss with relative tranquility is to adopt a calm and detached method, making continuous course corrections through repeated keystrokes and often letting ourselves be carried away by inertia. From this point of view, the absence of an analog control to dose the acceleration is a bit annoying (the backbones of the GamePad are still digital keys), but in general it is possible to achieve a good balance and reactivity is not lacking. Just as there is no shortage of atmosphere: an adventure that takes place in the most remote depths of the ocean needed precisely the visual solutions used in this case by the developers, with a sort of texture that covers the graphics and gives them a ~grainy~ appearance , while the rocks on the seabed are completely dark and the background color (determined by the Nep2no lighthouse) changes from mission to mission. The images are displayed simultaneously on the TV and on the GamePad's integrated touch screen, so you can play the way you prefer without even having to make a selection; however a larger screen certainly helps to take measurements better, given the high rate of precision that is required to avoid even the slightest impact. The musical accompaniment is entrusted to a decent quality but somewhat repetitive electronic soundtrack, while the voice that occasionally accompanies the salient phases of the action, with its ~radio~ style equalization, constitutes a small icing on the cake where the intention of the developers was to immerse ourselves (literally) in the game world.", "date": "2014-06-23", "grade": "7.0"}
