It therefore seems little surprising that, in an attempt to offer the public games that are always of the same type but technically different and varied in gameplay, the US company was also interested in other combat sports disciplines such as those belonging to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the federation of American mixed martial arts which is also the most important of the sport worldwide, where it is known by the acronym UFC. The latter, thanks to a series of regulatory reforms that have eliminated the most brutal components of its fights and inserted rules that are more attentive to the health of the athletes, effectively enhancing the technical part of the fight, and to the greater diffusion of matches via TV, has seen significantly increase the public's approval of it globally to the point of increasing the demand for ad hoc merchandising. Video games included. Proof of this is that UFC Undisputed 2009, the first next-gen title dedicated to this discipline for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, achieved interesting success last year both from a commercial point of view, with 3 and a half million copies placed worldwide, and as a criticism, thanks to a gameplay that, albeit with some compromises and a not exactly soft learning scale, proved to be quite profound in its mechanics. Mixed martial arts As in the past edition, the development of the new title dedicated to the UFC universe, UFC Undisputed 2010, was dealt with also this year by the Yuke's team (the same as WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW - Ed). A warranty. The game maintains the salient features of the previous chapter, but at the same time expands its structure and tries to make things easier even for those approaching this type of product for the first time. But don't get us wrong: even if some commands and related actions have been slightly modified to also accommodate casual gamers, as in the case of the dynamics related to ground and pound, in principle the concept of realistic and complex simulation has remained intact. In fact, in the game, as in reality, the matches always evolve in a credible way and it is not possible to win or simply engage in a melee by pressing the buttons on the pad at random. Often matches are resolved quickly with a series of successful holds or a powerful first kick in the face, other times they can last a long time thanks to the tactical skills of the contenders. But let's see in detail. UFC Undisputed 2010 presents several apparently minimal but very important innovations, starting from the menus, which are finally simpler and faster to manage than the slow and uncomfortable ones of the 2009 edition. The game modes available are basically the traditional ones such as, for example, exhibition , the classic challenges that have made the history of the UFC (as many as 15 basic), or others related to the organization of a tournament for up to 16 fighters, an event, or the one called Title Race which allows you to try your hand at a series of meetings through which to get to the belt. The latter is a sort of simplified career mode characterized by the fact that once the objective of becoming champion is reached, the title defense option will be unlocked (against 12 opponents -Ndr) but the first defeat will be game over. Samples But to stand out among all the game modes is undoubtedly the one called Career. The latter, better structured than the 2009 version, sees the player expertly guide his favorite wrestler in his difficult climb to the top of the standings for the title of world champion in the category he has chosen to face. The improvements in this mode are there and are quite evident, starting from the management of sponsors which appears more coherent, from the possibility of changing class as happens in the real UFC and from the better structured management of training and matches, in order to increase longevity and variety. You can choose real fighters among the more than one hundred present in the various rosters of the UFC, each of them faithfully reconstructed in the appearance and way of fighting, such as George St. Pierre, expert in Karate, wrestling, boxing and current champion of the Welterweight category of the o heavyweight Brock Lesnar former WWE wrestler. Unfortunately, ours is missingtro Alessio Sakara, who despite not being a top athlete would certainly not have disfigured in the extensive list of fighters in which we find athletes certainly less good than him. However, it is possible to create your own wrestler from scratch thanks to the complete editor once again made available to users by the developers, and which in this edition offers more options than last year, especially due to the presence of a higher quantity of fighting techniques. selectable and assignable fights, such as karate or Greco-Roman wrestling. Character creation, in essence, requires much more attention and effort than usual. New moves can then be learned by the fighter by practicing in the training phases and beyond. However, we must not forget to let him rest when necessary since the alternation between meetings, training sessions and breaks is a fundamental element of the game, because with the increase in the age of the athlete over the course of the seasons and the possible increase in tiredness the technical parameters of the same can undergo drastic drops. Playstation 3 trophies UFC 2010 Undisputed offers the player 37 Trophies, three of which are hidden. The ~visible~ ones are divided as follows: 17 in bronze, 12 in silver, 4 in gold and 1 in platinum. Rewards are linked to various aspects of the game, from overcoming a certain number of online matches to the type of KO inflicted on an opponent, from the number of consecutive times you touch an opponent's gloves at the start of the match to collecting all Topps UFC Trading Cards, passing through the completion of the various modes or from reaching a certain number of fans in the special internet tournament leaderboard, etc. To receive the coveted Platinum it is necessary to obtain all the Gold, Silver and Bronze Trophies. Technique and tactics When you are in the ring, the types of attacks that can be performed by the various wrestlers include high and low punches and kicks (assigned to the front buttons of the pad, their position and power then depend on the combination with the left lats), the clinch , holds in an upright position in which it is possible to hit the opponents with knees and elbows, the possibility of pushing and holding the opponents against the boundaries of the ring and the inevitable and often crucial submissions (which are now purely technical and without brute force escape or similar stuff). The latter provide for the possibility, when the position permits it, of hitting the opponent several times in order to make him give in due to too much pain or pin him, while he in turn can try to change position at the same time and thus gain the advantage. It should be noted that the ground combat has also been slightly simplified in this case, perhaps to meet the less savvy players. For the same reasons we therefore have automatic transitions, while submissions, as well as the aforementioned holds, are assigned to the right analog stick, and blocks to the right lats. Everything works with a precise response to the commands which are however more diversified than in the past and much richer, given the addition of several new moves and animations. And this translates into more satisfying fights for gamers with matches that are always exciting and above all never predictable, even more so considering the fact that by virtue of the above the difference is more marked when fighting fighters who have an opposite main discipline, this aspect leads to better exploiting their characteristics and keeping an eye on the resistance bar, necessary to continue to launch attacks with brilliance and without risking suffering a stun and a potential KO. Of course, there are still some defects such as those inherent in some ~feats~ of the CPU which sometimes irritates with double dodges performed without going from the original position or immediately after having given a blank shot, but it is nothing compared to the positive notes. Curiosity The Sony version of the game has three exclusive wrestlers: Royce Gracie, Jens Pulver and Dan Severn. Plus five never-before-seen ~classic encounters~. They are: UFN 18 - Carlos Condit vs. Martin Kampmann UFC 102 - Nate Marquardt vs. Demian Maya UFC 60 - Matt Hughes vs. Royce Gracie UFC 66 - Keith Jardine vs. Forrest Griffin UFC 68 - Martin Kampmann vs. Drew McFedries Without limits One of the most interesting aspects of the last edition of this production was also its weak point: the online game. Due to the few options available and a sometimes too heavy lag, UFC 2009 was rather limited in this respect. Fortunately, things appear improved in UFC Undisputed 2010 where it is possible, among many other things, to create real tournaments on the web, to compete the prown athlete against others and even, through the Online Camps option, create a real private club with its own virtual gym where you can train alone or with previously invited friends. All without excessive lag problems, which, however, is sometimes still not perfect. Speaking of the online one last curiosity: THQ also takes part in the strategy common to many software houses in recent times to limit the second-hand market. Therefore UFC Undisputed 2010 guarantees internet access only through an unlock code present in the packages. This code can only be used once and therefore second-hand copies of the game are useless on the multiplayer front if it has been exploited in this sense by the previous owner. It is possible to remedy this by paying a ~ticket~ sold separately on Xbox Live and PlayStation Store (at a cost of 400 Points or 4.6 Euros). From a purely aesthetic point of view, the THQ title is confirmed on excellent levels and with a general level of detail higher than in the recent past: more moves, animations and details that enhance the whole thanks to a very convincing graphics engine that gives a sensation of great realism without affecting the frame rate too much. The athletes, even the less famous, are made with care with many polygons and touches of class such as the sweat that drips on the body or the visible abrasions on the skin following the blows received. The new arenas added this year, such as GM Place or The O2, are also very nice. The audio sector is perfect with match reports, effects in the ring and music worthy of the best productions of the genre.", "date": "2010-05-31", "grade": "8.8"}
