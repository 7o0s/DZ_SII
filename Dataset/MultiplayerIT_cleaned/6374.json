{"name": "Fuori dal mondo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149052-sunrider-academy-fuori-dal-mondo.html", "text": "The typical dating simulator, nothing more than a variant of the macro genre of visual novels, involves a protagonist, usually incapable of dealing with the opposite sex, who must find a way to have a love story with one of many main characters , developing the characteristics most loved by the potential prey. The canonical setting of the genre, despite some variations, is the school one, with the characters involved in the love plots who are usually students. The school, as it is structured in Japan, allows you to simulate the possible activities to be carried out by the player with greater realism and incisiveness, without having to resort to compromise solutions. In reality it is not chosen only for issues related to gameplay, which in many cases are secondary. Let's say that it offers great possibilities in terms of identifying the average user by age similarity and as many in satisfying some perversions typical of the Japanese public (and not only), which are reflected in the characterization of the characters based on very precise types. For example, there is never a lack of the apparently very shy intellectualoid who however turns out to be a great panther under the covers (where there is erotic content), as is always part of the cast some more sexually aggressive character who immediately makes the game of seduction clear. No, you're not reading a special about dating simulators. The truth is that you can take everything you've just read and apply it without problems to Sunrider Academy, which doesn't do much to distinguish itself from the competition, at least in terms of plot and setting. Now let's find out if it has enough character to rise above the crowd. How to restore the full version of the game The Steam version of Sunrider Academy is censored, so no sex scenes. Don't worry though, because you can restore the more explicit content by downloading a free patch from the game's official site. Unfortunately we can't give you the direct link, because the above is full of cream coated girls. However, all you need to do is search Google, or any other search engine, for the string ~sunrider academy restoration patch~ and... magic. Don't say that here on Multiplayer.it we don't worry about the development of the eye/hand coordination of our readers. Time matters Sunrider Academy doesn't come out of nowhere. Those who follow the world of visual novels may have already met some of the characters in Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius (available for free on Steam). In the story you take on the role of Kayto Shields, vice president of the student council, who has a thankless task on his shoulders: to restore prestige to three disastrous school clubs, namely judo, kendo and science. At the same time he must also carry on his school career, with all that goes with it: studying, taking exams and so on. Being the protagonist of a dating simulator, the good Kayto must also be able to find a girl with whom to exchange some fluids (to restore the uncensored version of the game, which we strongly advise you to install, read the appropriate box with all explanations). If he fails, he will have to suffer the humiliation of a bad ending. In terms of gameplay, what does this all translate into? In reading a lot of text and in some choices to be made related to the main plot, which will break up the daily activities, which can be planned using a convenient calendar. We do not believe there is any need to specify that developing intelligence will help in intellectual activities, while improving athletic skills will make you more tonic, reducing the risk of disease (they waste precious time) and so on. Anyone who just wants to read the plot can lower the difficulty level until the possibility of making a mistake is completely eliminated. In a normal video game such an option would be seen as smoke and mirrors, but in a dating simulator it can fit and, indeed, will make happy those who just want to read the story without worrying about the rest. By ~rest~ we mean having to decide what to do during the day. Studying to prepare for exams? We need to find the time to do it, if we don't want Kayto to fail. What about all the other activities? How can we think of hooking up if we spend more time on books than seducing our beloved? And the clubs, how to solve them? Nice problem. Fortunately, it doesn't take much to understand how to act: once you have chosen the objectives to pursue, you have to concentrate all your strength on them. It's much simpler than it seems and fans of the genre will have no problems whatsoever in concluding the four archi nanarratives, one for each of the seductive girls: Sola, Chigara, Asaga and Ava. Will Sunraider Academy succeed in establishing itself in the world of dating simulators? Death and destruction From a technical point of view, Sunrider Academy is not bad at all, despite the fact that the developers, Love in Space, have openly declared that they did not have all the desired budget available. What paid for it was the quantity of content rather than the quality, even if it must be said, to avoid misunderstandings, that we are not dealing with a short or poorly cared for visual novel, given that each narrative arc can last from three to five hours and that the designs of the characters and scenarios are very good, certainly with some elements more refined than others, but with a high general average quality, which is also evident in the soundtrack, an excellent accompaniment while reading. Unfortunately it's not all rosy, given that there are some flaws. Meanwhile, the complete adherence of the plot to the clichs of the genre. Although Kayto is a slightly deeper than average character, some situations are too predictable. Another flaw is a certain arbitrariness of situations that can cause a certain amount of frustration. We understand that you wanted to introduce some gameplay with the possibility of failing, but sometimes really crazy things happen that stay that way until you fully understand the logic of the game. Not bad, given that as already mentioned the risk of failure can be completely removed, but a few more explanations of certain mechanics would not have hurt, given the difficulty.", "date": "2015-04-29", "grade": "7.5"}
