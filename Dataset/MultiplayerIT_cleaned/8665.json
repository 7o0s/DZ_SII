Walter Tugnut, a solid man, an American devoted to the stars and stripes with a strong jaw who wakes up one day with a fixed, apparently bizarre idea: to arm himself to the teeth to prepare for the apocalypse imminent. This seems strange to everyone, yet old Walt proves inflexible with those who try to make him give up, and on the other hand very few are willing to follow him in what appears to be the ravings of a madman. Even the friends of the NRA, the local ~rifle club~, try to make him come to his senses but nothing to do, Walter has his idea on making those tin enemies pay by making them eat his lead, only that no one understands exactly who are these enemies? The people slowly abandon him shaking their heads while the man, upright and proud, continues to arm his camper with a fluttering American flag and wait for technological armageddon, hoarding bullets and cases of beer. Particular character, the old Walt, so misanthropic and yet also so attached to humanity in general that he wants to stand as the last bulwark in defense of this against the incoming tin enemies, at least according to his bizarre theories. When everything seems to turn towards a sad future inside a room with padded walls, the incredible happens: the apocalypse really arrives, in the form of an immense invasion of armed robots intent on eliminating the entire human race. . In the general panic, between mass escapes and total despair, a man seems for the first time fully aware of himself and his position in the world, a man who has been preparing for this for years and who can't wait to get into action. Fr. Walter Tugnut has no intention of fleeing, he takes his camper and heads directly towards the nerve centers of the invasion. He's finally a man with a mission: shoot a lot of robots. Beer and bullets With a title that is as straightforward as its own gameplay, Shoot Many Robots immediately declares what it is made of, without hiding behind particular narrative substrates or conceptual frills at the base of the playful project. No byzantinisms for Walter or even for the players, this is an old school shooter, where we find ourselves advancing, jumping and shooting within levels characterized by different environments all equally full of enemies, in this case robots of various single or cooperative multiplayer. It is a title that draws clear inspiration from various classics of the past, such as Contra or, an even more fitting comparison given the basic irony that distinguishes them both, the usual Metal Slug. Shooter with a strictly 2D structure that Demiurge has faithfully followed, yielding to technological progress only in the graphic representation, based on a colorful and clean 3D masked by an elegant cel-shading. Unlike the more basic shooters, however, Shoot Many Robots adds a few features that deepen its structure and arguably ensure greater longevity to the package. Beyond the race for scores, however present and fomented by direct comparison with the online leaderboards at the end of each level, the progression in the game is also reflected in an advancement in the protagonist's experience level and in the collection of a variable number of dice and bolts, which act as a currency in Walter's particular world and which allow the purchase of ever more powerful weapons and equipment. With the management of the arsenal a slight strategic veil is therefore added to the game action, leaving the player the freedom to buy and select the two weapons to be used during the various levels from a truly immense choice of possibilities, taking into account the different statistics in terms of damage, accuracy, rate and range of each of these and with the application of further defensive characteristics or additional skills given by the equipment applicable to the body, head and game of the protagonist, ranging from improbable hats able to offer protection and maneuvers particular areas and knee pads, backpacks and bulletproof vests. The choices in terms of weapons and objects are really many and are connected to the need to accumulate a large number of dice and to progress in terms of experience, since some equipment can only be purchased once a certain level is reached, although the developers have allowed the ability to shorten the way for the laziest players with the option to buy dice by paying directly with real money. A choice that can rightly make the hardcore user shiver, to whom such a product could be addressed.zed. Dawn of the Robots The enemies are divided into different types that have different attack and defense characteristics, but in each case there are specific patterns and weaknesses to be exploited to maximize the damage against them. There aren't many enemy types and in general the game tends to favor quantity, with hordes of robots filling the screen in some cases, rather than a more reasoned approach, but it is still necessary to know how to vary attacks and defensive maneuvers in order to get to the bottom of the levels. It is therefore necessary to make good use of the two equipped weapons, possibly chosen in a balanced way based on their characteristics and knowing how to use melee attacks, slides or moves guaranteed by some special equipment if necessary, with the frequent urgency to also resort to diversionary maneuvers such as the possibility of bouncing the bullets of some enemies by sending them back to the sender. It is certainly something appreciable within a game that otherwise risks falling into monotony, a danger that the relative flatness of the level design and the lack of variety of situations do not help to keep away permanently. In any case, to be a classic shooter, Shoot Many Robots offers interesting solutions in terms of variation on the theme, between extensive customization of the character and a scoring system with progressive multipliers - according to which it becomes necessary to maintain a constant pace of destruction of the opponents, thus finding the fastest and most congenial elimination systems according to the types of robots - which affects the amount of dice given and provides a continuous direct comparison with the world's online rankings. In short, albeit with simple and classicist premises, the Demiurges have managed to pack a shooter that really has something to say in terms of gameplay, especially if you consider the Live Arcade and PSN context and the relatively low price at which it was released on digital delivery. This especially regards the single player, a mode that obviously suffers more in the long term but which still manages to maintain itself on remarkable levels thanks to the elements of character progression, while the game probably gives its best in cooperative multiplayer, both online and offline, for up to 4 players. Xbox 360 goals Like any Live Arcade, Shoot Many Robots contains a total of 200 points spread across 12 unlockable achievements. Rather than relying on the normal progression from level to level, achievements are achieved by obtaining particular results and performances, more based on the long run in terms of amount of play and experience. In any case, for those who get caught up in the action, these accolades are not too out of reach. New prospectives Even from a graphic point of view Shoot Many Robots looks like a well packaged product. A level production certainly not triple A, but edited to be destined for digital distribution, as is now happening more and more often in the current panorama of Live Arcade and PSN. Certainly the charm of the pixel and of the 2D bitmap design continues to exert a particular magic that is not easy to find in a modern graphic like the one presented by Demiurge, despite the skilful use of cel-shading tends to create a sort of way of halfway between the polygon and the two-dimensional tradition. In any case, a good variety of settings must be recorded which result in various chromatic choices and always rather interesting scenarios, although as already mentioned, the variety of situations that could occur, to give an illustrious example, in Metal Slug is not recorded. However, there are the most exciting moments, usually in correspondence with the bosses, which keep the game in line with tradition by proposing articulated fights that are rather different from the normal level process, although even in this case we do not see particularly innovative or surprising solutions in terms of of gameplay. The amount of enemies that often come to populate the game screens, as well as their similarity in graphic terms, sometimes make the action confusing, hiding those shots that require to be repelled or those types of robots that follow specific patterns and push these cases to move and shoot without much knowledge, but since it is a shooter one certainly cannot be too critical on such a point. From a technical point of view there is very little to object to, also considering the relatively modest size of the project, the Demiurges have shown great mastery in the use of cel-shading, beyond some interpenetration, some contacts sometimes dubbio, which however can be part of the general style of the game. The audio accompaniment is characterized in particular by the choice of country, folk and rock music which forms an excellent complement to the caricature style adopted for the characters and for the exaggeratedly American scenarios.", "date": "2012-03-17", "grade": "7.8"}
