The unexpected and at least sudden process of redemption, complete with a mea culpa in the background, this time fell (with full merit) to Codemasters, the famous British software house devoted to racing games which, with a sudden swipe in the sponge, decided to cancel the ~bold~ solutions adopted in GRID 2 and to fully embrace user advice and suggestions. As? Pulling GRID: Autosport out of the hat. Surprisingly announced during the recent Level Up 2014 in Berlin, the new chapter of the saga (heir to TOCA) was in fact produced in a particularly short period of time, thanks to the assets and experience gained by the developers and, above all, feedback of players disappointed by GRID 2, which came out exactly one year ago. As good as it was, in fact, the second chapter of the excellent Race Driver: GRID (2008) was unable to grasp the essence of the original production, slipping on an excessively arcade gameplay and too prone to drifts, inexplicably leaving the visuals at home from cockpit (beyond the institutional excuses on the streaming of the circuits) and for other reasons, which the most passionate about the brand have absolutely not appreciated. GRID: Autosport was therefore born from the need to fill that ~gap of affection~ caused by GRID 2 but above all to bring the series back to its former glory, in a sort of farewell to the old generation of consoles, before dedicating yourself to the new systems. The latest GRID is in fact exclusive to PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and after having recently tested a tasty preview code on Steam, we got our hands on the final version of the product. These are our impressions. GRID: Autosport represents the sum of the experience acquired in these years of success Password: fun Although in recent years it has lost a part of its commercial appeal, as well as the evolutionary momentum catalysed by pioneering works such as the first Gran Turismo, the multifaceted racing game genre is still today among the most popular and healthy, driven by the visceral passion for the world of motorsport and in particular for cars, whose charm surpasses eras and fashions unscathed. To seal the boundless passion for four wheels there will be the next autumn-winter video game season, so rich as to bring to our screens an impressive number of ambitious projects (Forza Horizon 2, Project Cars and Drive Club, just to name a few) able to satisfy any palate and, in some cases, to push one even on the pedal of originality, thinking of the vast The Crew by Ubisoft. Waiting to embrace the next, exciting future, racing game enthusiasts can satiate their hunger for engines and doors with a Codemasters present that is anything but obvious, built around the fun factor before any other feature. Framed in the crowded middle ground between rigorous simulators (Assetto Corsa) and pure arcades (Ridge Racer), GRID: Autosport in fact represents the sum of the experience acquired by the developers in these years of successes and (few) missteps, including the spirit best of the top productions declined at the service of the fans, thanks to a very careful analysis of the feedback. Just think of the Touring class, included by popular acclaim and probably the best of the entire lot available in the game, being capable of evoking the ancient glories of TOCA Race Driver 3 and earlier. But let's proceed in order. After creating the profile, perhaps connecting it to Racenet, the backbone of Codemasters' online racing game experience, the player can choose whether to engage in the very long and stratified career in single player, face a personalized competition, embark on network multiplayer or offline (shared screen) and set a plethora of options in the appropriate menu, traced in the wake of the previous works signed by the British software house. The beating heart of GRID: Autosport is undoubtedly the main mode for the single player, divided, descending, into seasons, championships and events, in turn proposed for five main categories of cars, namely Touring Car, Resistance, Open Wheels, Tuning and Citizen Circuits, also available in different power classes. Variety is therefore a central aspectthe player can decide whether to specialize in a certain discipline or demonstrate to the whole world that he is a complete pilot. After all, reaching specific skill levels in all categories allows access to the prestigious GRID Championships, the broadest and most complex experience that the game can offer, where competitions of various kinds and rhythms alternate. Once one of the disciplines has been selected and the offer of the first sponsors for the new season, the player is encouraged to give his all not only to conquer the podium, but also to attract the interest of the most prestigious brands, which allow him to drive better vehicles and obtain more conspicuous prizes (read experience), while offering increasingly stimulating objectives and challenges. In each event, in pure Codemasters style, there is always a rival to beat, and sometimes you have to contend with your teammate, to whom we can give orders for more or less aggressive driving, in order to get the best position in the classification builders (often related to the above goals). Between one race and another it is sometimes necessary to participate in special one-make races defined as CUPs, exhibitions with exotic and classic cars (Shelby Cobra, Mini, Lancia Delta, McLaren F1 and so on) which further increase the variety, already catalysed by the great difference among the five main disciplines. Dozens and dozens of hours of gameplay are required to reach the top of the rankings in all specialties, and the campaign events, increasingly longer and more complex as you level up, offer an exciting challenge capable of keeping the player's interest alive. above all thanks to the possibility of switching from one discipline to another when desired. Curiously, unlike the online component and many other similar titles, in the single player career there are no virtual dealerships where you can buy cars, but they are made available by sponsors based on the competition to be faced. The right compromise In our recent preview, based on a preview code, we underlined the differences and peculiarities of the various disciplines available, characteristics that we can easily subscribe to even during the review. As we specified, the Touring class is probably the most interesting of the entire package thanks to the racing dynamics devoted to contact and aggressive driving, while maintaining the need to stay focused on the track. In such a context, the hybrid driving model between simulation and arcade is enhanced, and the resulting fun is simply incomparable, especially considering the 16 cars involved in the tussle. The different power and genre subclasses, which include, among others, classic cars (Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500) and Super Tourers (Ford Falcon FG), also increase the sense of progression within the category, offering the player the possibility to improve with the right learning curve. A further feature of this discipline are the two rounds to be tackled (with the grid reversed) during the race weekend and the extra point in the standings for those who conquer pole position in qualifying. Endurance races, on the other hand, put us behind the wheel of decidedly more powerful and nervous vehicles, such as the Lola B12/80 and the McLaren 12C GT3, where the characterizing element is represented by tire wear. Aggressive driving is generally not recommended and it is necessary to maintain a constant race pace, however it seems that the first CPU-controlled drivers do not suffer excessively from wear problems, forcing the player to real feats to get good placements. The difficulty is further increased by the fact that the endurance races are run at night. The Open Wheels class is undoubtedly the most demanding from the point of view of the driving model, always ready to ~betray~ the driver when he exaggerates with the gas pedal or is not perfectly concentrated on the track, especially with the electronic aids disabled . Contacts between single-seaters - also divided into various categories, but no F1 - are generally discouraged, however the effects are not as harmful as one might imagine: the wheels, in fact, do not overlap or fit together, and the contacts they penalize above all for the speed sustained by the chasing cars, much more motivated to overtake than in other categories. The Tuner discipline (Tuning) is the most varied of the entire package, offering heterogeneous competitions that alternate with each other. From simple muscle car races to best-of-five-lap time trials - where you need to be carefulto ~traffic~ - up to drifting competitions, a real game within a game with heavily modified Japanese cars for the specialty. The latter is divided into really exciting qualifying and elimination rounds, in which you have to brush curves in a perfect drift to get the best score from the judges. As underlined in our previous test, the excessive sensitivity of the steering and the accelerator make these cars a real nightmare to control with the steering wheel, making the use of the joypad much preferable unlike all other disciplines. The last category available is the one called Circuiti Cittadini (Street Racing) and, as the name suggests, projects the player into very tight challenges on the streets of some large cities such as Chicago, Washington, San Francisco, Barcelona and Paris. In these competitions contacts and crashes constantly play a major role, and 'survival' often matters more than clean riding, especially when battling in the middle of the pack. The roster of cars available for the specialty ranges from the common Golf, Focus and Mini up to ~Hyper Cars~ such as the Bugatti Veyron, the Pagani Zonda or the recent and very bad McLaren P1, passing through the Gran Turismo (Alfa Romeo 8C) and coupes of various kinds (M3 E92). Overall, the driving model of GRID: Autosport is extremely enjoyable and solid, thanks to a delicious recipe that enhances its depth (especially without electronic aids) while not renouncing accessibility and fun. In certain categories there is still a certain tendency to drift, but not to the levels criticized in the second chapter of the series, especially using a good steering wheel. For anyone with a peripheral with 900 of rotation, we suggest eliminating the ~dead zone~ by 5% and reducing the steering angle, in this case too much oriented towards simulation and not suitable for the frenetic gameplay of GRID. Finally, the return of the internal views amplifies the involvement and does justice to those who had rightly suffered the inexplicable removal, while the rendering of the accidents is quite accurate, although sometimes not particularly realistic in terms of damage suffered. I light up immensely The fact that the game has not been developed for new generation consoles must absolutely not mislead players: on PC and at maximum graphic detail, in fact, the Ego Engine is presented in great splendor, offering not only breathtaking views, supported by a valuable lighting system (during the day and at sunset), but also an out of the ordinary fluidity and scalability. Among the best visiting cards for the technical skills of GRID: Autosport there is certainly the Paris circuit, perhaps aboard a Pagani Huayra, an ideal context for testing the evolution of the sun's rays as they caress the sinuous lines of the Italian berlinetta. Nothing that makes you cry for a miracle from the point of view of the polygonal mass, the shaders or the applied filters, but the visual rendering is still of the highest level and almost unsettling with the details set to Ultra. Too bad for some uninspired settings (Chicago) and, above all, for the polygonal models of the cars, a couple of hands below those seen in other racing games: they are in fact poor in details, sometimes angular and with poorly defined textures, despite being perfectly modeled and proportioned. The interiors are the most overlooked element, but thanks to the blur applied by the developers, they are able to ~endure~ when focused on the track. As far as optimization is concerned, the advanced graphics options menu offers a gargantuan range of settings: night lighting, shadows, advanced fog, particles, crowds, textures, soft ambient occlusion, terrain, details, objects, reflections, water , advanced illumination, global illumination, texture quality, shader quality and smoke shadows are just a few of the items you can set, all in favor of scalability. A close collaboration with Intel has also allowed the usability of the title even on not particularly performing systems, although it is naturally necessary to sacrifice some of the more advanced settings. Among the aspects that surprised us the most is the split-screen local multiplayer, anchored at 60 fps with 12 cars on the track: it is an incredibly engaging and challenging two-player experience, which evokes the pleasure of playing alongside shoulder also on PC. As far as online multiplayer is concerned, an excellent job has been done thanks to the total support of Racenet, with the possibility of creating your own club and sf", "date": "2014-06-24", "grade": "8.6"}
