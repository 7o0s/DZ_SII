On the one hand there are the mainstream productions: solid, anchored to very high product standards, but also aseptic and detached in their being intimately serial and designed for a very large mass of people, which nullifies any possibility of taking any risks; on the other there is the independent scene which, although it too tends to close itself within genre enclosures, is the only one that tries to really experiment, even when it relies on apparently more traditional products. Obviously in the pile we don't consider all those junk video games that now crowd digital stores and that make history in themselves. The four warring factions represent military power, political/religious power, the people, and intellectual idealism Tooth and Tail by Pocketwatch Games, the study of the eccentric stealth Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, can be described as a real-time strategy game, despite trying to rework the genre to make it faster, diluting all the mechanics that characterize it as much as possible . It tells of mice in revolt over food that fight each other according to a logic of rich against poor, or better yet powerful against the people, not without some irony and baseness in the representation. All this translates into a single player campaign in which four factions take to the battlefield for very different reasons: some for idealism, some to try to survive and some because they want to restore order while maintaining absolute power. Let's clarify one point right away: during the campaign you can't choose which faction to use, but you have to control them all, following a very specific narrative thread. Sure, each faction has its own missions and haven, its motivations and goals, but to follow the story you have to play through them all. At most, missions already played can be repeated to try to improve the result (each mission has a basic objective that must be achieved and a completely optional secondary one, often very difficult). In multiplayer, whether local or online (you can play together with a friend in split screen), there is obviously no such obligation and you can limit yourself to selecting your favorite faction, equipping it with the troops that best suit you. Revolutionary mice The mechanics of Tooth and Tail are very simple to describe: each faction has its own commander, who has the task of finding food for the troops and moving them around the battlefield... literally. Unlike normal real-time strategy games, in the Pocketwatch Games title you don't select the units with the mouse, then address them with a click, but you directly control the commander who calls them together. In what sense? Easy: you take the commander to a certain area, then press the call key to make the army move in that direction. If desired, it is possible to move one type of unit at a time, after having selected the icon at the bottom of the screen; useful option if you want to carry out a more targeted attack (for example on buildings, or on a specific kind of unit), or you can have your movements followed by holding down the call button (useful for raids). Gathering resources to raise and sustain the military is equally simple, both conceptually and in practice. In many maps there are mills which, once conquered or occupied, unlock eight boxes that can be worked by farmer pigs, which can in turn be purchased by spending food. Each square worked more speeds up the production of food, giving us resources to build the units' dens, from which our army is generated (each den has a maximum number of troops that can be generated, so you always have to build more than one). If desired, the mills can be defended by building turrets of various types or by placing barbed wire to slow down the attackers. Gathering resources is essential for generating troops Unfortunately, agricultural tiles run out very quickly, so you have to be quick to explore the map and find other mills to annex, whether they are free or occupied by your opponents, just as you need to be quick in waging war. In Tooth and Tail whoever waits loses, also because when you run out of food you can no longer produce units and defeat is practically automatic. Consider that an average game lasts about ten minutes, so you have to be very quick in making decisions. War stories Although the search for resources / unit production / attack scheme is valid for the entire game, Pocketwatch Games has thought of a very large series of variants to make each mission different from the others. In fact, in our memory we do not remember such a varied RTS. Not only are the maps procedurally generated, revealing themselves to be different in each game (and creating too many imbalances in multiplayer), but each mission has different objectives, to be pursued in various ways. For example, in one you have to lead a small handful of mice to free their comrades held in cells, without the possibility of producing additional units; in another you have to defend meat merchants, collecting crates of food to produce troops; in still another, bonfires must be lit to protect oneself from the intense cold, while food is accumulated. Each mission has its own characteristics, as well as specific objectives. In this one, for example, the wind makes it difficult to move and a timer announces the arrival of terrible flying demons The variety of Tooth and Tail is enriched by an unusually accurate and original narrative side, which develops in the refuges of the factions. The latter are large connecting areas from which you can access the campaign missions by talking to specific characters, but where you can also chat with each character present and examine the objects in the scenario. It is in this way that information is acquired on what is happening, on the morale of the troops, on their personal motivations and more, without the need to resort to the usual cutscenes. If desired, those who are not interested in delving into the story and the scenario can skip this part completely, limiting themselves to talking to the characters who assign the missions. Trapped Generally speaking, Tooth and Tail works well, but it has some structural defects, largely linked to the originality of its mechanics, which are unfortunately evident. For example, the troop movement system works until you try to develop some tactic: the action is so fast that when the enemy attacks or defends itself with dozens of units, it is practically impossible to direct individual troops using the commander . Thus we end up making armies collide as best we can, with the result decided by numbers and variety, rather than by leadership skills. Since the maps are procedurally generated, this aspect leaves no way out, given that there are hardly any moments to exploit the various facets of the game system. Junction zones allow you to learn more about the factions and their motivations Paradoxically, you can do it much better in the first missions, while in the last ones chaos reigns supreme. Imagine having to face an army made up of five different unit types and defended by turrets, which can be upon us in a few seconds (literally, since the maps are generally very small): how to place our troops having to select them one at a time and having to address them physically with the commander? Difficult, if not impossible. Another small flaw concerns the legibility of some maps. The pixel art drawn by the artists of Pocketwatch Games is very beautiful and offers an impressive amount of detail, but at the same time makes the denser maps difficult to read. We think in particular of some passages a few pixels wide, which are barely visible in the midst of all the other elements, also due to the fog of war which does not allow you to immediately have the complete picture of the map. It's not a very serious flaw because it often only slows down, without compromising the games, but it can annoy a lot when you're running... and in Tooth and Tail you're very often running, if you haven't understood.", "date": "2017-09-12", "grade": "7.0"}
