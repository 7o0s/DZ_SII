Yves: We have tried to make this game as non-linear as possible. You can freely explore many different areas at the same time, solving puzzles and puzzles in the order you prefer. However, the player will have to follow a linear plot: it is a prerequisite for being able to tell a good story and there is no better way to do it than with a relatively linear mechanic. M.it: One of the peculiarities of Keepsake is the perfectly integrated help system: after trying it, we have to admit that it is the best we have seen in an adventure for years! How did you manage to implement an integrated spoiler-proof solution? And what would you say to reassure those players convinced that any help system aimed at guaranteeing a frustration-free gaming experience actually risks ruining the fun? Yves: The help system integration was pretty painless, being foreseen from the very early stages of Keepsake's development. Since it also incorporates a walkthrough, we had to work hard to implement everything seamlessly. To those who feel threatened by the presence of the integrated solution, I only say that they will be happy when they get close to the end of the game ;) On the other hand, frustration has nothing to do with having fun (for most people, at least!) and this help system will prove to be a great alternative to having to quit the game to look for a solution online! M.it: Another feature that we particularly like is the optional dialogue system: how was it integrated into the fabric of the game? Yves: Well, its strength lies in the ability to ~fill the gaps~ that are naturally created in the exploration phases of the Academy. It happens that Zak and Lydia weave additional conversations to comment on events or delve into some aspects of the game world. This helps to give more pace to the story, as well as useful information for the player. M.it: Keepsake's incredible graphics certainly don't go unnoticed: tell us about the engine that runs the game. Yves: Keepsake's graphics engine is based on both open source projects and proprietary technologies. Among the open source tools we use are Crystal Space and CAL3D.M.it, just to mention a few: Thank you very much for your availability and for the preview material you have kindly granted us. Is there anything else you would like to tell our readers? Yves: Creating Keepsake has been a great adventure for us and we hope you enjoy playing it at least as much as we enjoyed developing it! Thank you for your support! :) A chat with the developer ________________________Multiplayer.it: First of all, could you please state your name and role in the development of Keepsake? Yves Bordeleau: Hello! My name is Yves Bordeleau, and I am the president of Wicked Studios. Beside doing administrative and management tasks, I did some game design and a good quantity of music tracks for Keepsake. M.it: What is the Keepsake referred to in the title? Yves: The Keepsake is a very important item in the game. Actually there are two keepsakes, the first one is a doll and the second one is a pendant. Lydia (the main character of the game) gave the doll to her best friend Celeste years ago during a ritual of friendship. Celeste gave the pendant to Lydia at the same time. These objects are mementos; a way for them to remember their friendship even if distance separate them. M.it: Why did you opt for a fantasy-themed adventure? We haven't seen many of them, since the times of King's Quest or Kyrandia... Yves: Well, you already answered part of the Question! ;) We definitely thought it was about time for a fantasy comeback in the adventure genre. With critical success like The Lord of the Rings movies, people were more than ready for a medieval/fantasy adventure game. M.it: What sources did you draw your inspiration from in terms of setting and gameplay? Could you name any adventure games, movies or books that influenced Keepsake's design? Yves: Like I was saying, The Lord of the Rings movies were quite an inspiration for our artists. Also, adventure game wise, we got inspired by oldies like King's Quest and Kyrandia but also from ~modern~ games like the Myst and Syberia series. M.it: Keepsake promises an assorted mix of challenging puzzles: what can you tell us about their nature and difficulty calibration? Yves: The puzzles and mysteries to solve in Keepsake varya lot in terms of difficulty. At the beginning puzzles are easy; but as you progress the difficulty increases as well. For those who are not the puzzle type we included a hint system that will definitely make their life easier! For instance, if you get stuck in front of a puzzle for some time and are about to close the game, well, the hint system is right there to save you some frustration. It will gradually give you hints on the puzzle you are facing and after a few it will even offer to solve it for you. M.it: Now, this is a predictable question but it's a really hot topic to many adventure games fans: did you go for an open approach to puzzle solving or is this going to be a strictly linear plot-driven adventure? Yves: We tried to make the game as non-linear as possible. You can openly explore a lot of areas at the same time and solve different puzzles/mysteries in the order you like. There is a general linear plot that the player will follow though; we decided that in order to be able to tell a great story and there is no other way to do it better than in a relatively linear way. M.it: One of Keepsake's most distinctive features is a perfectly integrated in-game walkthrough: we had a chance to test it and we must say it's the best we have seen in an adventure game in years! How did you manage the integration of such a spoiler-proof hint system? What can you say to reassure those players who are afraid that any measure aimed at granting a frustration-free experience might actually spoil the fun? Yves: The integration of our hint system was a breeze since it was planned in the very early stage of Keepsake development. Since the Hint System also incorporates an in-game walkthrough, we had to work quite a bit to integrate the whole thing in a pleasant way. For those who are afraid of the hint system/walkthrough, all I can say is that you'll be happy we had the idea of this feature when you'll be near the end of the game ;) And beside, frustration is in no way linked to fun (well, for most of us LOL) so the hint system is a great tool when you are about to quit the game to go on the net to look for a walkthrough! M.it: Another feature we really appreciate is the optional conversation system: how did you implement it into the gameplay? Yves: Well, this feature is neat because it fills the time when you are moving around or simply looking for something in the Academy. Zak and Lydia will start conversations about what happened or about different subjects related to the game world. This makes the game livelier and also gives the player some cool background info. M.it: Keepsake's stunning visuals cannot pass unnoticed: please, tell us something about the game's graphic engine. Yves: Keepsake graphic engine is a mix of a few open source projects as well as our own stuff. To name a few open source projects, we mainly used Crystal Space and CAL3D for the graphic part of Keepsake engine. M.it: Thank you so much for your availability and for the preview material you kindly provided. Is there anything else you'd like to share with our readers? Yves: Making Keepsake was quite an adventure for us and we hope that you'll enjoy playing it as well as we enjoyed developing it! Thanks for your support! :) And now let's venture into this valley of dragons! A suggestive aerial view of the school of magic. Keepsake immediately presents itself as a well-packaged product, even in the literal sense: the intriguing DVD case is a worthy complement to the irresistible price of the game, accompanied by an Italian color manual. After this pleasant initial approach and an absolutely painless installation, no one will have difficulty immersing themselves in the magical and colorful world of Dragonvale: in the role of the young apprentice Lydia, we will cross an enchanted valley to reach the renowned academy which trained the most powerful wizards known and in which we will have the good fortune to study in turn. We should have found our dear friend Celeste waiting for us at the entrance but in her place we will come across the exuberant merchant Mustavio, who for the occasion will show us how the game interface works in a short tutorial. After that, we will finally be able to admire the academy in all its glory: its suspension bridges, its vertiginous towers and its spiers soar among the lush hills and the numerous waterfalls that dot the valley. Getting in won't be easy, because it won't be enough to knock or ring the bell... or rather, the bell is there but you'll have to find a way to ring it! the mystery of Dragonvale is a timeless story on the themes of friendship, pain and remembrance And now let's venture into this valley of dragons! In the tutorial we will get acquainted with the merchant Mustavio. Magic pervades every corner of the school, which captures immediatelyor Lydia's curiosity and admiration. However, to her surprise, the academy appears inexplicably uninhabited. To further confuse her ideas comes a talking wolf, who offers himself as a guide but seems coherent only in the incorrigible habit of telling lies. Soon the two will find an object very dear to the protagonist and linked to a series of visions that will accompany her throughout the adventure and will help her unravel the mystery of Dragonvale. Keepsake is fundamentally a fairy tale of good feelings: if even the most cynical and savvy players will forgive some small naivety, anyone will be able to appreciate its intrinsic value because, even though it is proposed as a story of magic and adventure, ultimately The mystery of Dragonvale is a timeless story on the themes of friendship, pain and memory, which can't help but touch everyone in some way and which invites you to have fun but also to reflect. Once upon a time the walkthrough... Many puzzles are presented from a subjective point of view. Keepsake is a third-person point-and-click adventure, occasionally switching to first-person view to make it easier to examine objects up close or solve more difficult puzzles. Its interface will be familiar to fans of the genre, but it has some noteworthy variations. Lydia's movements are controlled with a simple click of the left mouse button: if the destination is close to the point where it is, it will reach it by walking, otherwise it will start running to reduce waiting times (therefore it will not be necessary to double click). By pressing the right mouse button, an arrow appears above Lydia's head, so you can locate her even in the most labyrinthine settings. Interaction with the environment is facilitated by the presence of the classic context-sensitive cursor. We will have to find and use certain objects to progress in the adventure, but there will be no real inventory-based puzzles: when keys or magical artifacts are needed to access new areas of the game, they will be used automatically, assuming we already have them . However, we will have the possibility to view and examine all the articles and documents collected, which will be indispensable for solving some puzzles. The dialogue engine is multiple choice and offers not only a key to speed up conversations but also one to pause them! Another appreciable gimmick is the optional dialogue system, which takes over in dead moments to provide the player with additional information and can be exploited further or not, at its discretion. The only aspect of the interface that we don't feel like approving is the abstruse saving system: each user can create a profile (for a total of five) and store about ten positions, but these will gradually be overwritten. Furthermore, there is no way to abandon a game in progress to load another one: you have to exit the game, restart it and reload from the main menu. Keepsake rests on a huge assortment of incredibly varied, challenging, and well-integrated puzzles Once upon a time the walkthrough... An astronomical puzzle... also in terms of difficulty. The adventure is broadly divided into two parts: in the first Lydia will have to learn about the Dragonvale Academy and prove herself worthy of becoming a student by overcoming a series of tests; in the second he will have to explore its upper levels and finally find out what happened to all its occupants. Keepsake rests on a huge assortment of incredibly varied, challenging and well-integrated puzzles, all requirements that in theory should be essential for any good graphic adventure and which in practice are rarely met: veterans of the genre will not find revolutionary puzzles in it, although not the original ideas are missing, but they will surely be impressed by the elegance with which they have been implemented and by the fluidity of the game mechanics, a summation of the best in the point and click tradition. Logical and mechanical puzzles abound, some even require the collaboration of our travel companion Zak, but the most exciting are the composite ones to be solved with the help of a riddle or some clues to decipher. The Keepsake cocktail also includes the preparation of elaborate potions and the dreaded labyrinths, but don't despair: they will never be too impervious and will be overcome with logic, not by swearing and suicidal attempts! Here and there you will have to face mini-games: do you know the magic chess of Harry Potter? Here, in the academy there are several games for the entertainment of students and teachers, in which you can try your hand at", "date": "2006-02-28", "grade": null}
