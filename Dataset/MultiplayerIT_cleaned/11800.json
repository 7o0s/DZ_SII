Nor has he ever denied his political vision, nuanced but clear in the narrative rhythm game for mobile systems Lost in Harmony, evident even if reified in a historical narrative in 11-11: Memories Retold and now made even more explicit in the much talked about adventure on the road with roguelike elements subject of our review: Road 96. On the road Road 96 is an adventure on the road Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, John Clellon Holmes, Jack Kerouac and the entire Beat Generation in general, have recounted the road with great passion, revolutionizing the concept of travel in literature, so as to give it new meanings. Road 96 wants to be a contemporary tribute to that experience, while updating its political vision. Yes, because politics is fundamental to the title of Digixart which, while never quoting real people and facts, represents easily recognizable events and ideas, hiding them in the fictitious nation of Petria, which however closely resembles Donald Trump's United States. Basically, the player is called upon to interpret a young man of less than twenty who wants to cross the northern border of the nation to go in search of his future in a free territory. At the beginning of each adventure you have to choose which of three illegal immigrants to play, because this is what they are, who have no face but have different economic resources and resistance. Each journey is made up of several interconnected scenes, but proposed in a random order. Each scene lasts between five and ten minutes and allows you to experience different situations, meeting one of the main characters who form the general narrative fabric. Furthermore, the same scene relived later can give life to very different situations, either for the feasible choices in terms of dialogues and actions, or for the unlocking of some skills that remain available from trip to trip (here the most blatantly roguelike element ), or because we already know some aspects of the character (or characters) with whom we find ourselves interacting. For example, you can learn how to break in, an ability that allows you to access some previously closed resources, or you can develop a certain shrewdness in dialogues, so as to unlock new options for them. But again: by learning the story of the policewoman Fanny and her inner conflicts, you can manage the moments that see her involved in a different way than you would by ignoring her past. The substance is that every attempt to escape from Petria is similar, but at the same time different (as also underlined by the always different starting point on the road map of the nation, which also serves to count the distance left to travel), despite the arrival is always the same: a border full of police officers trained not to let migrants pass, who, when discovered, are repressed in very violent ways. How will we overcome it? Will we attempt to traverse an arduous mountain route? Are we going to hide in a truck? Or will we bribe someone? Personages The characters talk a lot, they say some interesting things, but they're full of clichs In total, it takes about an hour to get to the end of an attempt to escape from Petria, but don't be fooled, because Road 96 is a title that needs to be played several times to be fully enjoyed, also because the protagonist's escape is just a pretext to tell a bigger story, that of an oppressed nation, which ends with the presidential election, influenced by our decisions (the game constantly reveals the arrival of the electoral round with choices aimed at influencing it). Underpinning everything is the rich soundtrack, decidedly 90s, entrusted to cassettes which, used with the radios present in the various areas that can be visited, be they a campsite or the inside of a truck, allow you to change the music of background by choosing from the songs that have been unlocked (the tapes can be found by exploring or received as a gift from the characters). On closer inspection, the fulcrum of the whole experience is precisely the characters you meet: from the aforementioned policewoman full of doubts about her job, to the hippie boy in search of his identity, to the madman who wants to make an attempt on the life of a television journalist, to a pair of unhinged robbers, a truck driver with a heart of gold, a girl with a troubled past, also fleeing from Petria. The iconography is that of the Beat Generation There are also some secondary characters to interact with, such as the occupants of a campsite or passengers on a bus. The substance is that Road 96, more than an adventure on the road, is an experience made up of dialogues, understanding of the other and taking political positions, such as when you find yourself working for a journalist of the regime and you may decide to sabotage her broadcast, or as when for to get out of the way, you can choose to give sensitive information to the police. Every now and then you also come across some mini games of fluctuating quality. For example, in one scene you have to be able to tune a radio, while in another you have to literally shoot nails at a speeding car to stop it. Honestly there is little memorable, but if we consider them as systems to break up the adventure, we can say that they work quite well (also because they are very short). Too many clichs Before the internet, television was the primary means of controlling the masses What unfortunately the title of Digixart lacks is the ability to elaborate its themes going beyond some movementist brochure clichs, unlike for example what Santa Ragione did with Wheels of Aurelia, who had the courage to discuss the issues much more openly which he addressed, going to fish topics in Italian history. Let it be clear that we do not want to criticize some values, but only to point out that their presence is not enough to have a video game text that is deep and complex enough to really describe the human being. Road 96 is didactic by nature and we often find ourselves faced with situations that are too predictable to be interesting, both in their development and in their resolution... unless you are looking for precisely this type of exposition, which certainly has the its consolatory value and still offers some interesting ideas. The same goes for the technical part, all too adhering to a certain style made up of soft features, candid faces for the positive characters and grim ones for the negative ones and saturated colours. It's not bad, overall, but it never goes beyond a certain level of consciousness, always stopping on the surface of things, even when it could be more daring. Nonetheless, some of Petria's landscapes are beautiful, reminiscent of the American Route 66 iconography, between filling stations in the desert and restaurants that seem out of this world. After all, as already mentioned, the starting model is the imagery of the Beat Generation, so it couldn't have been otherwise.", "date": "2021-08-16", "grade": "7.0"}
