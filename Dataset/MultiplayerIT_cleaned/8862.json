Among these ~secondary~ projects, in recent years the custom of offering a basic part of content completely free of charge has spread more and more: you download the client, start playing and only if you want to buy some bonus without too much effort /or a particular object you find yourself pulling a few coins out of your pocket. The so-called freemium formula is the one that Stairway Games has also decided to adopt for its Rusty Hearts, an online role-playing game that has already been on the market for some time, and to which therefore - thanks to the few releases of this period - we can now dedicate ourselves to see whether it is something valid or not. Hit hard Angela, Frantz, Tude and Natasha are the four protagonists of Rusty Hearts, in the role of which we find ourselves having to face the evil Count Vlad, intent on like many of his bad fellow colleagues to subjugate the world to his will: but not only that, given that with as the story progresses, players have the opportunity to appreciate the different sub-strands devised by Stairway Games for each of the heroes in action. To allow us to enter the mechanics of Rusty Hearts, the development team has well thought of inserting a tutorial with which to give the player the rudiments of the commands (and nothing more), giving him the opportunity to savor at the same time the story that will then be carried on as the game progresses: in reality, the goal is only half achieved, given that if what has just been said is true, it is equally true that at the end of the introductory phase there will be more questions that the player will still have on the gameplay compared to the answers obtained. Be that as it may, the beginning of the real game is what many fans of massive online games are now used to: the first step to take is in fact the one relating to the choice of the server (there is only one European anyway), after which we move on to the selection of the character, to be carried out obviously among the four listed at the beginning of the paragraph: each of them can develop their skills through the classic tree management, while the pair of weapons supplied and consequently the peculiarities of each vary character. Angela can count on a magic sword to heal the party and offer bonuses or on a scythe to attack using magic; Frantz, on the other hand, is the classic melee character, equipped with a sword and ax that differentiate him from Tude, also equipped with melee weapons but more rogue-style, carrying out fast and lethal attacks with his own gloves. Natasha remains last, also quite close to the classic canons of the ranged combat class, equipped with a revolver and musket and able to place traps for enemies. Beware of DAP! A small service communication, in case the computer where you intend to install Rusty Hearts also has DAP (Download Accelerator Plus). Know that the two applications conflict for strange reasons related to the download of the game contents: given that the writer has not been able to find any other solution than completely uninstalling DAP to be able to make everything work, keeping this thing in mind can save you from throwing away time trying to figure out whats wrong. You cost me, but how much do you cost me? One of the classic questions that we find ourselves asking when talking about a freemium game is that linked to how much it is actually possible to play without feeling the need to start spending money to enjoy the content. For Rusty Hearts the answer is undoubtedly positive: whoever chooses to pay has in return an amount of Zen (the currency of the game) linked to the amount invested, with which to buy game components ranging from elements for changing the of your character to the classic bonus on accumulated experience. The impression is, as we said, good, especially allowing those who don't pay to still have a gaming experience that can certainly be defined as complete, but at the same time giving those who decide to spend a few euros the opportunity to enjoy seeing their own character earn skills and customization possibilities faster. As for the control system, being a PC title the primary idea is perhaps aimed at a comp schemeMouse and keyboard support: ideal combination if we think of a World of Warcraft, but in the case of Rusty Hearts the situation changes. Being a title with a strong hack and slash vocation, the Stairway Games effort offers the possibility of enjoying its best with the use of a gamepad, which especially in the most agitated phases proves to be more versatile than the classic control mode of the genre of online games. Also not to be forgotten is the PvP component, a useful diversion thanks to which you can challenge groups of friends in various modes ranging from classic deathmatch to solo last man standing. The return of cel shading In the last decade we have seen a large number of titles make use of cel-shading, a technique by which the graphics look hand-drawn almost like that of a cartoon. Rusty Hearts is one of the few titles to retain this technology even in 2011, perfectly managing to make it an integral part of the setting chosen by the developers to wink at both anime and Japanese RPGs. Atmosphere and look of the various characters involved perfectly recall those of the various Castlevania, Persona, Devil May Cry and so on and so forth, placing a level of attention to every detail that makes the graphic one of the most successful aspects of Rusty Hearts. The sound is a little less inspired, which in any case can count on a good series of original melodies and acceptable dubbing, even if there is certainly better around. The Achilles' heel of the entire technical sector is made up of a few too many bugs, which can be found in different parts of the game starting from the selection of the character, where in one of the games started for the review it happened that the system wanted to force you to choose Frantz.", "date": "2011-12-14", "grade": "7.5"}
