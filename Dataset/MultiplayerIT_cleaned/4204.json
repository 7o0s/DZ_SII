Unfortunately, the Hungarian team failed to complete the trilogy worthily, with a stretched third chapter that made even the most ardent fans turn up their noses, but the slip did not affect the software house's passion for one of the favorite genres of the PC public. And so, after three years of development during the last of which we were able to try an alpha and the consequent beta, we are ready to face the final version of a title that has grown considerably from version to version. Discovering the Caligari system We already tried the full version of Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr last month, directly in the NeocoreGames studios in Budapest, where we were able to enjoy a preview of the new lighting, various clarifications on the future of the title, a ride along the single player campaign and several hours of gameplay in command of characters brought to the maximum level. All topped off with the addition of beautifully voiced dialogue and powerful cutscenes that enhance the brutal, dark and corrupt nature of the universe created by Games Workshop through five chapters filled with immense creatures, men transformed by corruption, tentacles, blood and guts . Let's talk about the campaign which is a long tutorial at the end of which the real exploration of the Caligari system begins between new systems, new space debris, installations of various kinds and ruined cities to be explored with up to three companions. And during the several hours of play we have developed a different perspective on what, although released from Early Access, is a project still in progress, a persistent online universe designed to evolve thanks to the actions of the players. Mind you though, this is certainly not an open world MMO, since we are talking about a classic action RPG divided into missions, but players will be able to shape the game world by tackling specific tasks. However, we will talk about this later. First, it is good to evaluate what is on the plate right now, starting from the classic gameplay with a three-quarter view and three classes divided into subclasses that alter the gameplay. We know the formula well, even if the setting and some mechanics allow the NeocoreGames title to have its say. Let's start with the titanic space installations that welcome us in huge dark corridors, corrupted by evil, dimly lit and full of terrifying creatures. Our aim is to find and purify corruption, but not in the role of the classic Space Marine, but in those of an assault investigator, a secret agent who belongs to the highest ranks of the Imperial Inquisition and who can therefore afford to transgress the strict rules of the Empire to defend it with every possible resource. And this is a founding element of the genesis of a title that does not have to submit to the strict rules that Games Workshop reserves for Space Marines. Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr chooses a whole new sector, new personalities and characters who can afford to dodge, to use psychic powers and to investigate, guaranteeing both developers and players a freedom, however subject to rules and linked to a continuous dialogue with Games Workshop, uncommon for games set in this universe. And this includes the gameplay that uses a decidedly unusual mechanism for the genre. The action RPG NeocoreGames, in fact, is based on a system of destructible covers which, used correctly, radically alter the challenge rate of the title by putting us in front of a gameplay made up of reasoned movements, more reflective than the action RPGs we are used to . Playing without paying too much attention, mind you, is possible given that the title allows you to tackle the missions outside the campaign in the desired order, which allows you to farm the easier ones and lower the difficulty of the missions related to the story; but looking for the challenge, choosing missions whose difficulty value exceeds the value that indicates the potential of our equipment, is important to make sense of the covers and avoid that the reflexive gameplay combined with the low difficulty translates into a boring grinding in the search of pieces of equipment, also differentiated by various specific bonuses, have the most suitable characteristics for our character.To infinity and beyond The three characters of Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr are differentiated by some main traits, but the nine sub-classes lead to very different experiences from each other. The Assassin is the only one to dodge and can use the sniper rifle which deals more damage with the aimed shot but can also use melee weapons like the Crusader who, in some ways similar to the Space Marines, enjoys a resistance superior and specializes in close to medium range combat. The Psyker instead uses devastating powers that can also chase enemies, but has to deal with the accumulation of warp energy which has negative effects if abused. And to discharge it you need to use the basic attack, in an interesting reversal of the classic mechanic that uses a weak attack to charge the energy with which to use the most powerful skills. These are not linked to the character but to the weapons and which can be changed in the game, thanks to the double equipment, allowing the player to alternate between two sets of attacks which can include flames, bursts, aimed shots, explosive projectiles, edged weapons, powerful weapons that overload, attacks that unbalance the enemies and others that allow us to shoot backwards. And it is essential to make the most of these possibilities to face at maximum difficulty, to obtain the maximum loot, enemies who, although limited to Nurgle, rebels and assorted chaotic emanations, snap, shoot, throw grenades, protect themselves, attack in packs, use turrets and support bosses capable of performing powerful area-of-effect attacks or even running over them, such as tanks. In short, the variables abound without counting the special ability of the armor, the grenades, the energy shields, the skill points to be spent in various specialization trees, the perks and the characteristics of a character who grows both by leveling up and by reaching certain goals. All this gives us an excellent sense of progression which, speeded up compared to the alpha, makes us want to explore the peculiarities of each subclass, in search of the character that best suits your tastes and the most effective synergies. In addition, the package includes an intelligent tarot system that allows you to create customized missions, even in the loot that can be obtained, in addition to articulated crafting complete with a specialization tree, projects in quantity and materials of various types that can be obtained by disassembling objects and exploring the maps. And in the pile there are also the prizes linked to glory points and guilds, which allow you to obtain other bonuses with an additional skill tree that makes the NeocoreGames title one of the most opulent action RPGs around, capable of entertaining for dozens of hours a Warhammer 40,000 enthusiast. But at a certain point, thanks to the lack of variety of missions that change just in the case of wave survivals and the use of a vehicle, the time comes to deal with that endgame which for titles of this genre is a heel of 'Achilles. And this is where the promise of an ever-changing game world comes into play, punctuated by seasons that will introduce new enemy races, special items, events and mini-campaigns based on priority tasks, of which the campaign gives us a taste, which include new info, modifiers, and side damage. And the behavior of the players in these missions will be able to change the outcome of the narrative arc, modifying one or more areas of the Caligari system. Even the extreme farming of a particular area could favor the emergence of a new force in another area of the game world, but since it is an evolving dynamic, such as the system of morality, let's put an end to speculation, hoping that the promise is maintained on a par with those concerning new mechanics: huge free content patches and further optimizations, really necessary given the dancing framerate and some out of tune textures, in addition to those already implemented which have reduced crashes, enhanced lighting, improved reflections and increased the volume of graphic effects, giving an extra edge also to new areas such as the urban area and the customization of our inquisitor that allows you to change the style, colors and even materials of the armor.", "date": "2018-06-15", "grade": "7.5"}
