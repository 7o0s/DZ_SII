{"name": "Catherine: Full Body", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/catherine-full-body-recensione.html", "text": "It was 2011 when Atlus decided to come out on the market with a title that loudly recalled the style of the highly appreciated Persona, but which at the same time reinvented the game formula. Away with the JRPG component and welcome puzzle game, a puzzle as simple in its base as it is ingenious in its implementation. To act as a narrative glue then, a story told in full Atlus style, with the classic care for the texts and for the anime-style sequences. To embellish everything for our country, somewhat along the lines of what happened recently with Judgment, the Yakuza spin-off, Catherine arrived subtitled in Italian, making it much easier to use than the other Atlus titles. After eight years and a love that has never really faded, we are ready to give you the review of Catherine: Full Body, a revised and corrected version of the original that also adds another character to the triangle: Rin. A story of love and betrayal The story narrated in Catherine does not differ much from the shades dear to the Japanese studio. Investigating problems and the psyche of man, but moving away from the important themes of Persona and the student environment. Do not think, however, that Catherine's story is serene and without important arguments. On the contrary, the canvas set up is the least light one can expect, and the sexy and almost ridiculous pretext with which they take their first steps in the adventure soon turns into an examination of sentimental relationships, important steps to make in life and choices that shape who we are and who we will become. The protagonist, a certain Vincent, is a penniless man of about thirty, who has been carrying on a relationship with Katherine for too long without deciding to take the plunge. The girl clearly feels the need to take the relationship to the next level and Vincent spends his days sleeping and drinking with friends in their favorite place, the Stray Sheep. One night Vincent is attacked by a terrifyingly real nightmare, in which he finds himself in his underwear and with his pillow in his hand, having to move and climb a wall of huge blocks, while a voice warns him that the fall and death in the dream will produce the inevitable demise even in the real world. To complicate matters shamefully, waking up is as sweet as it is chilling: beside him in bed there is in fact a blonde girl, Catherine, beautiful and sensual, naked and unequivocally his partner for the past night. From this premise, to which we will not add anything so as not to spoil the surprise for those who have not yet been able to enjoy the game's story, we will be called to follow Vincent's life for an entire week, during which to make choices that change his karma and the consequent relationships of love and sex, interspersed with nights of nightmares. So far nothing different from what was already present in the basic edition of Catherine. To embellish, at least apparently, this Full Body version, we think about the insertion in the triangle of a further mysterious figure: Rin. Full Body, as well as representing a clear physical allusion, is in fact a term used in English to describe those full-bodied wines, as it is also explained to us at the beginning of the adventure. The addition of Rin, a girl rescued by Vincent himself and victim of amnesia, who will obviously fall in love with our heartthrob, represents both a tasty addition and an unpleasant third wheel. He will end up playing the piano right inside the Stray Sheep and will enrich the adventure with new dialogues, new animated scenes and, obviously, further final drifts. We want to be honest: we are not great supporters of this type of operation to which Atlus has accustomed us for some time. This is even more true for a title that thrives on the Vincent-Katherine-Catherine triangle and which, in this dynamic, blends perfectly and reaches writing heights that are hardly approached by other adventures of this genre. It is true that it is possible to almost completely ignore Rin, managing to keep the game and its narration in the style of the original. The fact remains that, regardless of this, the new girl has not managed to completely enrapture us, still preferring the plot we remembered. It is difficult to go into this detail without going into the risk of a spoiler, but what we would like to be clear is precisely how much Rin leads to almost totally divert from such a sharp path that it almost reached perfection. For this reason it is a great pity not to have the possibility, as happens for the classic version and remix of the puzzles, to also enjoy the freedom to return to the classic narrative, without Rin and without the addition ofscenes from Vincent and Katherine's past. The square gameplay As mentioned at the beginning, Catherine lives in two sections and moments that are profoundly different from each other. Those who know Atlus productions know what we are talking about. This title is no exception and constantly alternates a dialogue and free exploration phase with that of raw gameplay. During the day and in the evening it is in fact possible to roam more or less freely around the Stray Sheep, converse with the crazy guests of the pub, play Super Rapunzel via a cabinet (it was only ~Rapunzel~ in the original version) and read and reply to messages on your mobile phone. Although there is no actual passage of time, spending time talking will ideally carry on our day, until the inevitable return home and the consequent beginning of the nightmare. This second phase of the game is characterized by a series of stages to complete, during which we will be called to climb very long walls of cubic blocks. The puzzle part of the game (moreover so accurate and appreciated that it managed to win a place even in the competitive scene) deserves a proper study for this Full Body version. In fact, a Remix version has been added to the climbing of the normal walls. This is nothing more than a variation on the theme which leads to having a certain amount of blocks connected to each other. These can vary in color and functionality, giving a certain degree of unpredictability to those who already know the various routes by heart. In addition to the simple climb, there are also some specific bosses, who will only rush you even more or hinder you along the way and who often take up archetypes of the couple's problems that are faced in the course of one's life. Just as it was possible to choose different levels of difficulty in the original, also in this Full Body version it is possible to simplify or make the puzzles more difficult. These range from speeding up the disappearance of blocks under our feet to the impossibility of canceling incorrect moves or reaching checkpoints. Unlike the original, a mode called ~safe~ was added immediately, which allows the player to constantly send the climbs into autoplay or to skip them altogether from the menu. It is evident that making this choice (which was already present in its first release but only once the campaign is over) is equivalent to distorting the adventure and its gameplay, but we are always of the opinion that it is better to have one more choice than one in less. Specifically, Catherine remains above all a beautiful story that is equally well told and for this reason it may make sense to decide to move in this direction. Alongside the campaign, with a profoundly variable duration but which on average will take you about fifteen hours, there are also a whole series of accessory modes. Babel, as it is easy to guess from the name, is nothing more than a sort of survival mode, characterized by different stages and which will reward you based on the amount of floors climbed before the inevitable death. The Colosseum, on the other hand, hosts Catherine's competitive modes. In fact, it is possible to decide to collide with another player locally or online, giving rise to crazy chases to the top, which add an unimaginable degree of longevity to the game. We realize that it is difficult to think of being enraptured by the idea of tackling an always the same series of puzzles, but we can assure you that the formula and the difficulty capable of bringing Catherine into play are the most stimulating a videogame puzzle can give you. The attention to detail, the objects inserted during the climbs and which give life to alternative routes and personalized solutions, as well as the will to beat one's own records or the opponents, give the gameplay a particularly successful taste. The remastered We close with a brief paragraph regarding the technical goodness of this remastered for PlayStation 4. The anime style that characterizes most of the game's cutscenes allows Catherine not to disfigure even after eight years, thanks to the superfine quality with which they were made. However, it went just as well with textures, polygons and character models. It is clear that they pay something compared to the more recent Persona 5, but the single location and the few characters present have made it possible to push on the care and general cleaning, returning a more than pleasant glance. Obviously the Italian adaptation and the superfine dubbing of the Japanese and English versions are back. Important note regarding the soundtrack, extraordinary regarding the quality and por the possibility, through the juke-box of the Stray Sheep, to modify the music, also choosing that of the latest JRPG masterpiece by Atlus.", "date": "2019-08-30", "grade": "8.5"}
