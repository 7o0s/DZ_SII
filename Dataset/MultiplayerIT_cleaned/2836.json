{"name": "The Red Lantern", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-red-lantern-recensione.html", "text": "Finding yourself is not an easy task for many people. There are those who decide to push themselves to the limit and face their fears, those who prefer to isolate themselves and be alone with their thoughts, or there are those who give up the ordinary to go in search of the extraordinary. The Red Lantern is a mixture of all these preconceptions about self-discovery, which it tries to bring to the screen in a different guise, but with some factory flaws. Let's see what are the critical points, but also the strengths of the title in this review of The Red Lantern. A misleading story The events told in The Red Lantern take place in the wild lands of Alaska. We play the role of a girl who, together with her trusty dog, has decided to abandon the chaotic life in San Francisco to face an adventure that, according to her, should help her understand who she is and what she actually wants to do with her life. This is the incipit that will then lead us to adopt four other sled dogs and become improvised mushers, or sled drivers, embarking on a journey of hope full of pitfalls and dangers only to reach a remote cabin in nature. The title puts the discourse and narrative on the main plane, emphasizing the small subplots that are created by exploring the game world. Precisely these side stories invite the player to discover more and more, at least during the first ten minutes of the game. Gameplay At the beginning of the game we will find ourselves in a van together with our trusty four-legged companion, heading towards places where we can adopt other sled dogs to create a mushing dream team. There's not much we can do at this juncture, except look around and select multiple-choice lines of dialogue. Surprisingly, we will be given the opportunity to choose which dogs to adopt, making us understand their peculiar characteristics and how useful they could be during our adventure. The interesting thing about this decision is that it must be made ~in the dark~, since the animals will be presented to us one at a time and we will have no way of knowing which dog will come next or if it will be more or less efficient than the one we are about to refuse. . So far everything seems extremely promising and interesting, but the excitement begins to wane when we realize that what we could do on the truck is what we can practically do during the actual gameplay. In fact, once we get on the sled, we will have no way of controlling it or venturing wherever we want. That's because The Red Lantern is a roguelike on rails. Which isn't a problem in itself, as there are tons of extremely worthwhile and entertaining rail games out there. However, it is precisely its realization that does not satisfy the needs of players who are playing a title where adventure and exploration are the keystone of the narrative. In fact, we will be able to carry out actions only by selecting a line of dialogue (which can basically be summarized in ~right~ and ~left~ when we meet a crossroads, or in ~I'm going to explore~ or ~I stay on my path~ when events arise random). The only variants are hunting, where we will have to press the interaction key at the exact moment in which a circle and a dot (one moving horizontally, the other jerking) meet, and fishing, during which you have to keep the hook on a specific point that moves vertically. In short, two mini-games that could make you lose your prey at the beginning, but with which you become familiar after a few minutes (if some bugs don't come into play). A particular roguelike A little above we presented the game as a roguelike. You haven't read wrong. Actually the game does not forgive, making us die within a very short time during the first game. This makes us wake up in the van with our dogs, revealing that, in reality, our game was just a dream. Whenever we fail to make the character or his dogs survive, we will find ourselves on the van, but everything we have learned during this ~dream~ will serve the protagonist to better prepare for the imminent journey (bringing more food, more firewood, or tools such as hatchets or fishing rods) which, until we get to the ~red lantern~, will always prove to be a nightmare. The game mechanics behind The Red Lantern are often derivative, but still well implemented with the characteristics of the title. We find hunger, fatigue, frostbite, wounds inflicted by enemies or side events. If we pass the checkpoints on the road even with only one of the energy bars of the dogs or the protagonistta too low, the game will end immediately. Same thing if we get hurt twice without healing. To restore the statistics, you need to camp. Here we can sleep to regenerate the energy bars (which will remain empty), light a fire to cook the meat (if you eat it raw, it freezes until we warm up again in front of a fire, which also lowers the energy of the protagonist at each checkpoint, not just that of the dogs), petting one's travel companions (which could activate unique dialogues in the event that your trusted friend has performed some particular action during the game) and give him eat, as well as use a medikit to treat wounds, both human and animal. The further we go, the more we will add elements that we can use in our field, such as traps and flintlocks. A game world without mercy (or almost) With the justification of the wild nature (and, in part, also of the dream component), the game world is devoid of other human beings. We only find traces of the passage of man, which often prove to be a useful resource for our insidious journey. Consequently, the protagonist will find herself talking to herself and to the animals, creating dialogues that are sometimes quite funny. Being the natural environment of Alaska, the game world is very suggestive, thanks also to an all in all inspired artistic direction. The goal, of course, is to get to the cabin with the red lantern, but once we've reached it, we'll be able to play again to continue discovering secrets and objects that will be added to our diary, where we can find the encounters we've made. the peculiarities of the animal world that we have observed and the supplies with which the adventure will begin. We will therefore have the opportunity to experiment with new approaches to events, which could give different implications depending on the line of dialogue that is selected. This certainly makes the title a little longer-lived, especially if you want to discover all the secrets of the game, but the critical issues of this system are not slow to manifest themselves. Repetitiveness is the watchword Despite the multiple choices, despite the chance encounters, despite the dedication to adventure, the title feels extremely repetitive. Each game will be substantially identical to the previous one, with the variation of some facilities that will allow us to get further away each time and discover new secrets. The encounters are almost always the same, activated according to the distance from the finish line and with a very low level of randomness . There is no real procedurality in what can happen to you, but only an infinite ~groundhog day~ that will lead you to experience a substantially identical adventure until you commit some trivial distraction error that will force you to start over your trip. It is a real ~trial and error~ with a substantially non-existent learning curve, since your character will learn and get what you need without you making any effort (except to try to survive as much as possible , which the game will prevent you from doing during the first few hours). Not only is the title repetitive, but it's also very short. If you are not fond of collecting, you will reach the finish line within a couple of hours. We have used three because we wanted to deepen some mechanics and see if they were actually various or just a lark switch (the second option turned out to be the most well-founded one). A wild technical sector As for the technical issue, the title is graphically quite pleasant, with a cel-shading used in a fairly acceptable way. The version we tested is the one for Nintendo Switch. In this case, the title has several drops in frame rate, which rarely manages to remain stable at 30 frames per second. But these are not the sore points. During our game we encountered a moderately high amount of bugs, graphical glitches, pop-ups and a general lackluster technical level, not properly polished. For example, sometimes checkpoints appear an instant before you pass. So, if you are dying, but still want to try to see if you can run into any event before the end, you will most likely lose because the save point suddenly appeared to you, not giving you the opportunity to organize yourself properly (perhaps to set up a camp and try to manage the critical situation with what little you had). Not only that. At the end of each game we encountered a very annoying bug for the quale all volumes of the game are reset to zero, which must be promptly reactivated one by one. Then dogs that start the sled while lying down, woodier animations than all Alaskan forests, traps that disappear, black screens after interacting with certain objects inside the camp, rifles that don't hit when you hit the target and that they hit when you miss it widely. In short, even at a technical level the problems are evident already during the first minutes of the game.", "date": "2020-10-27", "grade": "5.5"}
