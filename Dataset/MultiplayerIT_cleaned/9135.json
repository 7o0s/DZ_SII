The tricks performed aboard cross bikes, then, have a particular charm; not even the video game market has been able to resist it, both on mobile devices and on home consoles, and titles such as the excellent Trials HD show that the genre really has a lot to offer in terms of playability and immediacy. Well, it is precisely the game developed by RedLynx for the XBLA platform that Xtreme Wheels is undoubtedly inspired by: the type of view adopted is the same, as is the attempt to combine the frenzy and spectacularity of the genre with a pinch of realism, giving the bike its own specific weight and avoiding the most improbable evolutions. Our goal, in each of the twenty available levels, will therefore not be to complete a large number of aerial maneuvers to score a certain score, but simply to cross the finish line unscathed and do it in the shortest possible time. An operation that perhaps turns out to be simple in the first few tracks, but gradually becomes more complex and implies perfect knowledge of increasingly intricate scenarios full of pitfalls: from loop-the-loops to explosive barrels, passing through any obstacle against which the pilot of our motorcycle can hit his head. To unlock all the routes and complete them successfully, we will therefore have to continuously experiment with the best solutions to tackle each section of the track, and above all be able to quickly control the reactions of the bike. It's all a balance The Xtreme Wheels system is based by default on the touch screen only: on the right side of the screen we find a button to accelerate and one to brake or proceed ~in reverse~, on the left side a ~selector~ which allows us to adjust the load on the front or rear of the bike. It goes without saying that accelerating and keeping the load on the rear translates into a wheelie, a maneuver sometimes necessary to overcome certain types of obstacles. There is a lot of healthy inertia in the gameplay of the title developed by Bravo Game Studios, so much so that in certain situations you have to launch yourself into a loop of death and then let gravity do its duty and take you to the underlying portion of the track , preferably with a perfect landing. The philosophy behind the collisions appears very clear: as long as the bike crashes, there are no problems; but if instead it is the pilot who collides with a box or a barrier, then we will witness a ruthless and bloody ~bullet time~ which will show the consequences of the impact. The game also has a clear ~trial & error~ flavor, and especially in the more advanced stages it requires a large number of experiments and more or less violent deaths to understand what to do and how to do it, in which direction to move and what is the best way to pass a certain section. The explosive barrels, for example, blow up at the simple touch and therefore you have to face the areas scattered by these dangerous objects at high speed, looking for only the minimum grip necessary to move. Unfortunately we have found some limits for Xtreme Wheels, and precisely in the most important sector: that of the controls. In fact, the load adjustment selector does not react precisely to our requests, or in any case the bike does not always comply with its directives; the fact is that often some maneuvers do not come about due to this problem, anything but a minor one. Furthermore, as regards the technical realization, the game boasts very beautiful and detailed graphics, which however consequently ~weigh~ a lot and produce some uncertainty in the frame rate.
