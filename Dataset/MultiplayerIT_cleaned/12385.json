{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-07.html", "text": "EA have worked hard to offer the best product that was really simple but profound at the same time, also focusing on the technical implementation, so as not to make the official Tiger Woods license trivial and of little relevance. The game has three main modes: Quick Match, Tournament and Challenge. It is useless to talk about the first mode, we have certainly noticed that it could be among the most exploited precisely due to the pick up 'n play nature of the EA title. The tournament is the most important option, the one that will commit us the most, putting us in Tiger Woods' shoes for the 18-hole challenge to the best golfers around. In the version we tested for this review, only the Pebble Beach tournament could be chosen, but in the future it will be possible to download additional circuits on your mobile phone. The challenge mode instead offers objective races, such as completing several holes in less than ten strokes. Whatever our choice, we can always set the level of difficulty on the basis of a three-level ranking. What we liked most about Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 is its immediacy, and the big credit goes to a control system that can be mastered in an instant. The swing is controlled via key 5 on the numeric keypad, by holding it down the club will begin to swing and releasing it will start the shot. If we use the 7 and 9 keys in the same way, we will see the ball curve, respectively to the left and to the right, thanks to the effect impressed by our club. The main change compared to other golf titles concerns the lack of an on-screen indicator, which makes us understand when the right time is to ~let go~ of the shot button. We'll have to figure out the right timing on our own but after a few tests we'll be able to manage Tiger's power perfectly. The shot that will follow us throughout the game is the standard one in a glophistic title, behind our character. This view will change if necessary in two different situations, when we select the ~aim~ mode, which will show us the point of arrival of the ball from above, and when we arrive on the green, where a grid borrowed from Everybody's Golf will inform us on the slope of the land. Technically the EA product is particularly pleasant, with excellent colored and sufficiently defined sprites, the different angles of the camera are absolutely functional and facilitate the player's task; the only small problem we've found is a few shots here and that certainly doesn't affect the good work done by the developers. PRO Immediate and engaging Technically well done AGAINST Short lived", "date": "2007-04-03", "grade": "S.V."}
