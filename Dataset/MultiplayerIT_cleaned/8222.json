What will Mary's dragon do with it? Will he marry her? Will he eat it? Will he make her participate in a reality show? Who knows but does one really need a rational reason to kidnap someone and incarcerate them in a gloomy castle? Come on, we're at the ABC of video game plots and fairy tales in general. However, our heroine Giana is not just any naive little girl and decides to take advantage of her powers as a teenager, which allow her to transform whenever she wants into a bad girl with purple hair who listens to metal music and burps at the table, to go and save her sister and put the dragon on a diet. Unfortunately between her and the castle there are a myriad of levels to go through and bosses to beat up, which gives us the idea of why those who live in places like this kidnap people: they feel lonely. Well, now that we've moved, let's cheer for the dragon. The literary masterpiece above serves to justify a platform game with a classic setting, therefore with a gameplay derived from 2D titles such as Super Mario Bros., which attempts to bring back a much discussed name from the 80s: The Great Giana Sisters ( read the dedicated box to find out more). In addition to the attempted resurrection, Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is also the first high-level game funded on Kickstarter to have found its way to the market. What will come of it? Game mechanics Giana's powers, in addition to that of mutating into her dark version, which we will discuss in detail a little later, are two: transforming into a ball of fire capable of eliminating enemies and breaking through the most fragile walls; and then become a top that allows you to glide after the jump. These are much more complex abilities than they seem, because if, for example, you hit an enemy transformed into a fireball, you get the ability to use a power again, so you can exploit, for example, your opponents as mobile platforms to reach hidden areas. Other typical situations require you to bounce against the walls of a well to reach the top, or to use the top to avoid obstacles. There would also be other feasible examples, but the important thing is that you understand how complex the gameplay is. The management of the transformation is also accurate and profound. When Giana mutates, the game world changes with her in real time. It's not just an aesthetic quirk (the bouncing effect of the transformation is particularly successful), but one of the cornerstones of the gameplay. In fact, the two versions of the world differ in numerous details: for example some platforms, very solid in one of the two states, can become intangible in the other, bridges can open leaving lethal chasms open, enemies change their appearance, often also changing the own behavior, some moving platforms reverse the direction of movement, and so on. These differences have been exploited extensively by the developers to design very varied levels that offer surprises until the end of the game. For example, in some advanced stages ghosts will appear who will or will not chase Giana depending on the state in which she is, while on other occasions there will be real puzzle game puzzles (not very complex) to be solved in order to move forward. Secrets The aim of each level is to get to the exit, except in the boss levels which obviously require you to defeat a particularly powerful enemy. In reality, moving forward in the adventure is not that simple: at the end of each level you will receive reward stars, determined by your behaviour. That is, the game will take into account the crystals collected (the maps are full of them), the special gems found (always in secret areas) and how many times you died before reaching the end, then it will assign the reward. Attention, because the bonus is not neutral: if you fail to get enough stars, the boss level will not open and you will have to replay some levels to improve your performance. For this reason it becomes very important to explore every meander of the maps and avoid too rash moves not to die, a not too remote possibility given the presence of quite difficult passages. Actually even if you die often, game over never comes since there are no lives. However, the fact remains that you need to demonstrate good skill with the game if you want to get to the end, an exceptional stimulus to learn how to make the most of all Giana's powers and to understand how to exploit the conformation of the maps.Giana Sisters DS Actually Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is not the first attempt to restore honor (see other box) to the disheveled sisters. It was Black Forest Games itself, when it was still called Spellbound, who developed Giana Sisters DS for Nintendo DS in 2009. The game didn't have a big resonance and we don't even believe it was officially distributed in Italy. It was obviously a platformer, but much more classic than Twisted Dreams and much more similar, graphically speaking, to the Super Mario series. It wasn't evil. If you get it, play it. The Great Giana Sisters Released in 1987 for Commodore 64, Amiga 500 and many other systems, The Great Giana Sisters by Thomas Hertzler and Manfred Trenz (Time Warp) went down in history because it was withdrawn from the market by Nintendo for being too similar to Super Mario Bros. for the NES . In reality Nintendo never brought Rainbow Arts and Time Warp to court, as some mistakenly believe due to articles at the time that were not exactly very precise on the matter, limiting themselves to threatening to sue them for plagiarism. That was enough and the game disappeared from stores, but it spread enormously thanks to piracy. The few original copies sold became cult objects and are still highly sought after among collectors today. A job well done From a technical point of view we are faced with an excellent title. Giana and the various monsters that populate the maps are very well done, but the aforementioned elastic animation with which the maps change their appearance is of particular effect, above all by virtue of the general quality of the scenarios, which is really high. Black Forest Games got the style and color palette right, giving the two versions of the game world a very different look. Nice is the fact that even the music is transformed between one world and another, passing from a more relaxing sound of the blond Giana to a more metal one of the dark Giana. Sure, there's the downside of having very repetitive music, but we think it's normal given the desired effect. In short, Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is really well done also technically, although it is not a very large production. However, there are some aspects of the game that leave you dumbfounded. For example, there is no element that makes you participate in the story: at the beginning we see the dragon kidnapping Maria and from there nothing more, neither animated sequences, nor simple writings, nor anything else that tries to involve us in what we are doing. To know anything about our sister you have to come to the very obvious conclusion. Even the acquisition of powers is automatic, without ever being narratively justified in any way. Something better, without too much effort, could have been done. Another controversial aspect could be the aforementioned difficulty: dying is the norm, also because one hit of anything is enough to kill Giana (except if she has collected a protective crystal). As specified above, dying is part of the gameplay and it doesn't take long to learn how to overcome the various obstacles, but some players may find Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams too complicated, especially if they didn't live through the 80s and 90s.", "date": "2012-10-29", "grade": "8.2"}
