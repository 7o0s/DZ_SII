{"name": "Mondiali FIFA 2006", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mondiali-fifa-2007.html", "text": "Willkommen Zum Fussball The 2006 FIFA World Cup immediately presents a well-kept presentation of the menus, and does not disdain to show off its official license at every juncture. When the console is switched on, the Goleo mascot, the funny lanky lion, immediately welcomes the player. Since this is a FIFA exclusively dedicated to the World Cup in Germany, all club teams are excluded from the bouquet of teams available. There are 127 national teams available, which naturally include the 32 qualifiers for the German World Cup. At the head of the list of game modes there is as usual the opportunity to make a friendly on the spot, without having to worry about standings and qualifying rounds. But the heart of the game is clearly the top football tournament, which is proposed here slavishly reporting the official groups, so by choosing the Italian national team for example, we would inevitably have to emulate the path of Lippi's Azzurri, facing Ghana, USA in order and the Czech Republic. Alternatively, it is possible to play the entire continental pre-qualification programme, and in this case the range of formations to choose from extends to all the national teams existing on the planet. We will return later to talk about the game modes, we now prefer to shift attention to the substance of the title, i.e. to the ~game played~, borrowing a typically television expression. FIFA World Cup 2006 does not differ much from what was shown by the previous FIFA06; the game mechanics appear fundamentally unchanged both in the management of the offensive game and in terms of defensive movements, even if to tell the truth a significantly more sparkling AI of the opponents makes the outcome of the CPU's attack actions less obvious. FIFA World Cup 2006 does not differ much from what was shown by the previous FIFA06 Willkommen Zum Fussball Some improvements can also be seen in shots from outside the area, which can now be performed more successfully, while it seems to have become more complicated to place the shot according to one's intentions from inside the penalty area. An appreciable novelty is represented by the new shooting system for set pieces and penalty kicks. In the first case, the camera moves behind the player in charge of the shot and a viewfinder appears on the goal mirror, inviting us to choose where to direct the ball, trying to evade the opponent's barrier. In the second case, the one-on-one typical of the penalty is managed by a control scheme borrowed from golf titles: with the viewfinder you choose where to kick the ball, but the fate of the shot is decided by the player's ability to stop with timing the cursor that runs along the power bar. In the case of a penalty lottery following extra time, the game includes a further novelty: the player in charge of the shot, as he approaches the penalty spot, is called upon to control his emotional stress. In short, the proverbial coldness that makes the fortunes of penalty takers. This translates, for the gamer, into a sequence of keys to be pressed correctly, otherwise a potentiometer that shoots very fast making success from eleven meters difficult. Undoubtedly an appreciable and curious novelty, even if the surprise effect disappears almost immediately and a shrewd player will not struggle to tame the pitfalls of the new system. We resume the analysis of the game modes present to signal the return of the so-called ~scenarios~, i.e. challenges that put the player in the position of having to manage the last minutes of a victory in games that have already started or, at higher difficulty levels, challenge him to come back matches in desperate situations, like 9 against 11 a handful of minutes from the triple whistle. There is also a Quiz mode to test your knowledge about the history of the World Cup, a pity that the total number of questions is really too small. Having ascertained the presence of a game system which, despite some pleasant positive developments, remains on the levels of sufficiency already achieved by the first FIFA on DS, it is time to highlight the sore points of the game. The technical sector is once again improved in some respects compared to FIFA06, such as for example the reproduction of the stadiums (eight of which are official and therefore faithfully reproduced), now more lively and complex, complete with choreography in the stands, smoke bombs and festive showers of confetti at the entrance of the teams to the pitch. The animations, generally of an acceptable level, reserve occasional moments of comedy during the replays; in returning towards the center of the field after an unfortunate action, the players produce in gethese clumsy, they get stuck and stumble like mad puppets, situations that betray a general neglect of this aspect by the developers. An imperfection however not penalizing, as it only affects the replays. What markedly affects the usability of the title is instead the fluidity of the game, which shows an evident step backwards compared to FIFA06. The graphics engine, perhaps burdened by ancillary details that could have been renounced, very often proves to be limping, and in the most confused situations it makes the full understanding of the game action prohibitive. A graphic sector perhaps devoid of frills (to name one: the shadow of the clouds on the field. Did we need it so much?) but more solid and secure would certainly have been preferable. Comment FIFA World Cup 2006 fails to improve on what FIFA06 offered a few months ago. The steps forward can be seen almost exclusively in marginal aspects of the title, on the other hand the steps backwards concern the backbone of the game, and therefore take on a higher specific weight. It cannot be said that EA has sat idle counting on the call of the official license, quite the contrary. The effort to offer a better product is visible, but in our opinion it hasn't been worked in the right direction. Some, then, could also consider the absence of club teams heavy, as well as the immutability of the groups in accordance with those of the official event. In general, and to conclude, it seems difficult for us to be able to prefer this FIFA World Cup to the previous FIFA06. Pro Official license (not up-to-date) Well-finished menus Nice reproduction of the stadiums Cons Very uncertain graphic engine The substance is the same as FIFA06 Only the national teams, no clubs The world event on German soil is in full swing. Millions of colorful fans from all continents flocked to the ~streets~ to party drinking beer, and in the stadiums to cheer with hearts in hand. But the rest of the enthusiasts around the world follow the impressive sporting event submerged by the flooding torrent of all types of media: TV above all of course, but also newspapers, magazines, radio, webzines... and of course videogames. EA Sports, thanks to the exclusive official license, throws itself into the pile by publishing its game for nine different platforms. For NintendoDS this is the second episode, from which it is reasonable to expect significant improvements compared to the decent predecessor.", "date": "2006-06-16", "grade": null}
