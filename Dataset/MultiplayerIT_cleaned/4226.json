There are those who complain after a couple of titles of this genre about the saturation of the market and those who, on the other hand, are eager to experiment with new ideas and observe how they can evolve. For our part, we find ourselves in an almost perfect middle ground: if it is true that we are very curious to see new features and mechanics that can expand the concept behind games such as Fortnite or Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, on the other hand it is also true that we can already be more than just clones eager to hit the market only with the intention of raking in a few buyers with minimal effort. Titles such as Project Darwin, for example, are therefore welcome, but productions at Royal Heights are quietly off the radar, ready to close the shop and puppets within a few weeks without leaving the slightest added value. We are also curious to understand if such a sparkling market can structure itself with a free to play model or if it will instead be able to build the foundations by paying an even quite substantial entrance ticket, or if it will be able to survive in the future only as an extra mode for multiplayer games , as Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has shown. In short, we are only at the beginning of this boom and it makes you smile to see one of the titles that has led the way arriving on consoles these days, that H1Z1 that really does not want to know about remaining forgotten and which is back in a free version in attempt to recover that slice of the market that rightfully belongs to it. Despite the many diatribes and vicissitudes related to the PC version, which we will therefore not take into consideration in this review of the open beta, H1Z1: Battle Royale arrives on PlayStation 4 in completely free mode ready to wage a ruthless war of numbers against his half-brother for a fee. Will it be worth a ride on it? Something new under the sun? We do not believe there is a need to explain to you again the detailed concept behind the gameplay of H1Z1, since it does not differ in the least from the canonical Battle Royale. One hundred players parachuted into a war zone must survive by arming themselves with makeshift equipment found on the field, then trying to slaughter the other contenders in a fratricidal competition that will see only one winner. Pushing the foot on the accelerator then takes care of a constant pressure implemented by uncontrollable external agents, which reduce the playable area at regular intervals forcing the survivors to converge in a specific point, a mechanic useful for keeping the games always very lively and interesting. In short, neither more nor less than what has already been seen elsewhere, for a result that is appreciated given the solidity of the formula but which does not really add anything new. The gameplay must then think about refreshing the situation, pushing players to stay connected to the servers and find something that Fortnite and Playerunknown's Battlegrounds don't already offer. The first big difference is found as soon as we leave the pre-game lobby, with our character parachuted without warning into the play area. In fact, it is not possible to have a precise point in which to drop but we will have to accept fate and hope to find a congenial area upon our landing. However, H1Z1 does not skimp on various weapons and vehicles, present in large numbers throughout the region. Thus they begin to collect the first makeshift weapons, usually pistols and shotguns, stocking up on ammunition and then looking for bulletproof vests and helmets to better resist the damage of the shots. There are no melee weapons and there are not even shields to protect our energy bar: H1Z1 tries to be much more frenetic than its direct competitors, succeeding in the enterprise easily. However, the price to pay for being faster and more immediate is the simplification of numerous mechanics, such as the total lack of gadgets and attachments for weapons, but also of a ballistic system which, although not reaching the arcade extremes of Fortnite, tries to keep away even from the more marked realism of Player's Unknown. One against a hundred While the cloud of gas tightens the map, you find yourself involved in very rapid firefights, with a time to kill high enough to allow you to react easily to the first hails taken in the back. In fact, you will almost always have time to turn around, understand the situation and react to fire, unless you are targeted from sidereal distances by a skilled sniper who, given the reduced bullet drop curve, will not have too much difficulty keeping you under fire. H1Z1however, try never to let you go around the map on foot, making available a disproportionate number of vehicles of various kinds, from quads to cars. The clashes become a tussle of doors and rifle shots, road kills and headshots from distance, for a chaos on the screen that is difficult to find in the other contenders. Having removed sights, magazines and silencers from the weapons, the whole inventory system has been simplified, asking you only to press a button to equip a weapon found on the ground and wear a backpack to increase the number of transportable weapons, to be chosen then by acting on the circular inventory to be recalled quickly in the game as in the best first-person shooters. You play quickly therefore, thinking quickly and making often rash decisions to secure the best weapons, able to offer certain advantages, but obtainable only and exclusively from air drops that desperately try to further raise the pace of play. A good beta The open beta status obviously suggests that there will be significant changes over the next few weeks, improvements and content updates aimed at fleshing out the playful offer. At the moment H1Z1 comes with a single map and the possibility of queuing up for solo, pair or team matches, all with the aim of obtaining as many credits as possible to buy weapon skins, emoticons and the usual customizations for the our virtual alter egos. The process can be accelerated through the purchase of currencies but it is an operation that remains confined to the aesthetic sphere, a choice that is now canonical and appreciated by the communities, who can thus play the titles without spending a penny and possibly support their projects discretion. Not even the PlayStation Plus is required to access the online servers, a further incentive to push anyone to at least drop by and take a peek at this new version. Technically H1Z1 does not put the console under pressure but the fluidity is excellent, as is the stability of the servers. On the other hand, the variety of the setting shows the side, without areas that are substantially different from each other as happens on Fortnite, for example, but also the management of shadows and models in the distance, which are not always loaded in time.", "date": "2018-06-01", "grade": "7.5"}
