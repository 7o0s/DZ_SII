In the first minutes together with Blanc, the cooperative puzzle game protagonist of this review, we immediately noticed these distinctive features and without looking at the authors and designers we understood that we had an overwhelmingly French video game in our hands. Developed by Casus Ludi and published by Gearbox Publishing, Blanc is a large pencil drawing that comes to life to tell the story of the friendship between a wolf cub and a fawn desperately searching for their families after a blizzard. If the story and gameplay of this game can be heard already, it is its art style that impresses with animation technique and complexity. Images and music are well intertwined but it has frequently happened that puzzles have proved to be very frustrating going to break the magic that the game had created up to that moment. In this review by Blanc we will tell you about the great artistic work that the developers have done to bring the game to life, but also about how some game design needs got in the way of an experience which, if it had been more fluid, would have could aspire to become a classic of the indie scene. Without words Blanc is a video game completely devoid of dialogues and texts One of Blanc's identifying characteristics, together with his graphic style, is his being a video game without text and without dialogue. Being the story of a deer and a wolf cub who help each other overcome obstacles, there was no need to anthropomorphize the protagonists and give them a voice or dramatic dialogue. For those who want to immerse themselves even more in the adventure, then, it is also possible to deactivate the icons that highlight the objects with which to interact or the platforms on which to jump. In this way your game interface will be completely absent and you will seem to be living inside a real graphic novel. With the world of comics, Blanc also shares a series of stylistic elements linked to reactions and the expression of emotions. If the suffering of a dog is simple enough to communicate thanks to its typical yelp, that of a deer or a duck presents obvious difficulties. This is where exclamation points come into play, to express surprise, small lightning bolts, to express anger, and a series of other graphic devices that appear around the heads of the animals you will meet to make you understand the situation. The only flaw of this system is that, often, a negative feeling is expressed both visually and aurally but as the repertoire of verses available is very limited we found ourselves trapped in a concert of squawks in the middle of puzzles that we could not solve . Sometimes frustrating gameplay Some of Blanc's puzzles are really frustrating and break the fairytale magic of the game In terms of gameplay, Blanc never deviates much from the classic puzzle types encountered in co-op games. The two protagonists have a sort of special ability (the wolf cub can pull objects and the fawn can push them) and there is a mechanic whereby it is possible to reach high platforms (which the normal jump does not reach) by placing the two animals on one another other. If you have played Pode the mechanics of this title will be very familiar to you, sometimes too much. Blanc, however, is also playable solo by controlling both characters. On the Nintendo Switch, the right Joy-Con drove to the wolf and the left to the fawn. Initially it was incredibly confusing to make sense of the camera movements, but then we started to get carried away and coordinate the progress of the two characters in a harmonious way. Over time, in fact, the confusion linked to the movements of the analogs has turned into the sensation of weaving the story of these two animals together with our hands. Distilled joy The hope contained in running together hoping to be one step away from one's family is a very pure emotion that Blanc distills to perfection When the puzzles don't get too frustrating or repetitive, Blanc reaches its full potential as a playable fairy tale with heart-warming moments, drops of pure joy, insidious dangers, and a craving for redemption. Over the course of its ten levels, you'll pass through ruined industrial complexes, tangled forests and pristine valleys where you'll slide down slopes. You will meet other animals in need that you will helpand and with which you will make friends having as background the building of the relationship between the two protagonists. Throughout the first level, in fact, the wolf cub and the fawn cannot even get close because they are afraid of each other. After overcoming the first obstacle together and finding the traces of their respective packs, however, the two begin to get closer and help each other more and more. There are moments of tension and contentment and each level is resolved with a small happy ending because it tells of the obstacles that the protagonists had to overcome to find traces of their families. Attention to those who love animals Those who love animals may find some of Blanc's game situations particularly stressful It is important to underline an aspect that could turn into a major element of stress and frustration for a rather large category of gamers: those who have a dog. The music that accompanies the game is very beautiful, harmonious and emotional, but if you have a dog we recommend playing this game without sound. The wolf character, the more irreverent of the two, often gets into trouble and has to call the fawn for help. When it does, the game plays a dog's whine several times in a row. This verse, in our opinion, has been abused by the developers because it is played multiple times in each level putting a lot of pressure on the player. Anyone who has a dog knows that when he whines something is wrong and you need to intervene, sometimes urgently, so it's better to turn off the game audio and play Blanc as if it were a real animated graphic novel. It's also best to turn off the music when you get stuck in front of a puzzle you can't solve because the more tense tracks (like those towards the end of the game) end up accentuating the frustration if you find yourself stuck on a puzzle for more than 10 minutes. Some puzzles, then, require you to guide characters who, however, have a tendency to get stuck with some elements of the scenario. We had to restart the game several times to finally be able to break an NPC and proceed with the level. This is Blanc's biggest flaw: the breaking of magic. In a game with such intimate and emotional atmospheres (from this point of view it is somewhat reminiscent of Journey) it is really frustrating to see yourself forcibly pulled away from such a fairytale world because of a bug or a glitch.", "date": "2023-02-14", "grade": "7.0"}
