Sure, the meteorite is hollow, but that's only because it's not a meteorite: it's an alien spacecraft. Furthermore, even though it is no longer on a collision course with Earth, it is heading towards an unknown planet. And we with him. It all started with an alarm disclosed by NASA, which had intercepted a celestial body heading towards our planet, with a collision probability of 99%. A team was then set up to place nuclear charges on the meteorite to divert its trajectory. The fate of that group is now uncertain. At the head of the expedition is Boston Low, a military man, supported by geologist Ludger Brink, journalist Maggie Robbins and a couple of astronauts, Ken Borden and Cora Miles. But who wanted all this? The hidden director of the expedition is Steven Spielberg, who wanted to make a film of this story, but who, faced with economic difficulties, asked LucasArts to make a video game out of it. The year was 1993, and Brian Moriarty, the same as Loom, was put in charge of the project. Brian was the author of, among other things, three Infocom text adventures, including Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor, and remained a central figure in those early years of adventure development. His style dictated a precise direction to the project, which initially had a gloomy script, full of bloody scenes. This at the beginning, however, because later Brian left the team, perhaps due to internal misunderstandings. Taking his place was the equally capable Sean Clark, who smoothed over Moriarty's rough edges, tweaked some of the plot, and accompanied The Dig to its release two years later in 1995. Curiosity LucasArts has decided to make its past glories available on Steam, giving everyone the opportunity to play again, or for the first time, several video games that have made history. Multiplayer.it has chosen the best for you, and now presents The Dig. It's no planet for old men Coming out years later, The Dig could have seemed outdated from a graphic point of view, but underestimating it, for those who made it, was a mistake, because it turned out to be one of the best adventures of the 90s. Compared to previous productions by Lucas, it also introduces some new features. The SCUUM interface is now devoid of verbs, and the collected objects can only be combined with each other or with the elements of the seabed. This approach has survived to this day, simplified and refined, but identical in substance. The puzzles remain challenging, especially in the second half of the game, and if you've never had to hunt for sensitive pixels on the screen, be prepared to have to probe the seabed with painstaking precision. Not out of wanting to defend the old adventures at all costs, but the emotion felt in finding a new element after desperate hours of research pays off the efforts made. As far as the atmosphere is concerned, The Dig moves away from the goliardic spirit of Monkey Island and the irreverent jokes of Indiana Jones: there is a heavy air in the game, which begins with the opening of the shuttle near the meteorite and spreads for the duration of the exploration on the alien planet. The harsh jokes of the protagonists and the oppressive tension of some passages make it an unusual game by Lucas' standards (almost as much as Loom), which goes well with the music of Michael Land, here even grappling with Wagner. If you remember, this composer is also the author of the soundtrack of The secret of Monkey Island, which later became legendary among players. The Dig is a mix of concerns, both on the realization and on the narrative front. And maybe the two things went hand in hand. In essence, it is an unmissable chapter in the history of the video game, an adventure with serious tones that does not look bad over the years. The only problem is that the version available on Steam is entirely in English. But if that doesn't scare you, why are you still there reading?", "date": "2009-07-22", "grade": "9.0"}
