One would have to ask Ichijou Takaaki, the only man in charge of this attempt to dust off the glories of the good old days. In the statements, the developer's survival horror Throw the Warped Code Out, published by Degica, is inspired by cult series such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill, a pity however that the first episodes were published after the fateful '95: Capcom's debuts in 1996, the Konami saga at the end of the millennium. A temporal short circuit which unfortunately is only the first, smallest of Back in 1995's problems... More than fun, Back in 1995 focuses on the graphic aspect to remember the glories of the 90s Who starts well... It's hard to expect great things from a game whose first achievement is obtained after a few minutes of starting it, simply because you haven't decided to go back to the desktop. In Back in 1995 the player plays the undefined role of Kent Randall, a man who wakes up in a laboratory in search of his lost daughter and why the city is in terror. An apparently interesting plot that is not explored in any way: there are just a few diary pages trying to keep a practically non-existent narrative canvas glued. Soon you enter a clich of repetitive quests that quickly lead to the conclusion of this ode to nostalgia: as underlined by the Steam notes, it won't take more than a couple of hours to get to the end credits. The typical action involves going in search of some document within predefined locations and returning the objects to the character who requested them: only in this way are previously inaccessible sections unlocked, which are four in all. There are several things that are wrong, starting from the technical point of view: however commendable the effort to bring back the super-polygonal graphics of the early nineties may be, the result is well below expectations - so to speak, the first Alone in the Dark was decidedly more refined than this stepchild of the new millennium. Ichijou has tried to play with a very heavy distorting/interlaced effect typical of CRT monitors (which should intentionally be those that transmit the images of the CCTV cameras positioned in the tower where the story takes place) pushing his hand too much, probably to mask the technical paucity of production. The result is perhaps fascinating in the first few minutes, but in a short time it will be preferable to deactivate the filters, thus unmasking all the flaws in the graphics sector. Few ideas but confused Unfortunately, things don't improve from the artistic side: the reconstruction of the tower could also work, too bad it's really too full of invisible walls and closed doors, but what leaves a bad taste in the mouth is above all the surrender of the enemies, who look like sad relatives of the sugared almonds M&M's: certainly not scary, an aspect that is anything but negligible for a title that would like to belong to the horror genre. As if that weren't enough, they are also extremely easy to knock down: just position yourself at a safe distance and land a few good wrench shots to make them disappear without even being scratched, thus making both the inevitable painkillers and the presence of a pistol and a rifle almost useless as alternative offensive tools. In fact, the excessive slowness of the monsters (there are a total of five variants) means that theoretically the game can be completed even without resorting to violence. The controls in turn recall those of the first exponents of the genre, with fixed cameras and the WASD keys with which everything is controlled: you have to go back to chewing the old logic of fixed cameras which initially could disorient, but it's a matter of a few minutes to ( re)get used to the relativity of directions. There is also support for the DualShock and the Xbox 360 pad, which however have some slight inaccuracies, especially when it comes to aiming and shooting. The sound sector is anonymous: we find just a few reluctantly placed effects and a single musical motif. At the end of the day, Back in 1995 isn't scary, it's not fun, and it's not even well done. The main purpose of the programmer was to recreate the technical limitations and thus dig into the memory of the players, without however being able to offer anything more than a bad slide from the past.
