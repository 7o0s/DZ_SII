Your consciousness brews in it, no bigger than a single grain of malt. You must do nothing more. Never again.~ It starts like this: with a black screen, the ancient reptilian part of your brain talking to you, and an immediate lie. Because that tantalizing promise of eternal rest lasts only a few minutes, and the emptiness immediately gives way to the image of a flaccid middle-aged body, to the face of the victim of a hangover so momentous as to have been able to erase his entire I. No floating skulls that speak to you in a morgue, no alternative world where you can pick up fragmented memories: you are alone, devastated by an unspecified mix of alcohol and drugs, and prey to an amnesia that makes the mental blank of the Nameless look like Planescape Torment a mild migraine.Welcome to Disco Elysium, an investigative RPG where solving a brutal murder is just the perfect excuse to find yourself, escape from yourself, or watch the world burn. The choice is yours, the review is ours. Everyone kills himself in his own way We didn't bring out the Black Isle masterpiece RPG for a whim: the ZA/UM (the developers) have repeatedly stated that they were inspired by Planescape, and acting as the son of such a titan in the field of role-playing games should already freeze the aspirations of most of the authors - Numenera, for example, tried with all its might to keep up with that classic, but in the end it was unable to hold up, falling too easily under the hard blows of forced quotation and reproposition of already used structures. However, Elysium is such a rare beast that it cannot be treated as a simple rival: it is a conglomeration of innumerable inspirations, a work that is a bit Bukowski and at the same time a bit Big Lebowski, but which these two imaginaries connects with fractals that range in every direction, and that absolutely cannot be observed with the superficiality generally reserved for the names mentioned above. What we are dealing with today is, in practice, a title that refuses to deprive itself of arguments for futile reasons, for which nothing is sacred and untouchable, and where the reconstruction of the events is as important as the player's need to shape his own alter ego... no matter how shocking the end result may be. In its being all of this, it surpasses any video game that has attempted to ape Torment over the years, and manages, remarkably, to represent something new and unpredictable in the genre. It was time. Nor are we dealing with a game that appeared at random, even if the total absence of marketing behind it could make it seem like a passion project created by a sudden movement. Although its developers are unknown, in fact, their creature starts from a scenario for pen and paper role-playing games that they conceptualized apparently over ten years ago, and it took more than five years of work to give it its present shape (over to a name change, since it was originally going to be called No Truce With The Furies). The effort is noticeable: there is not half an asset recycled in the maps, the refinement of the art direction is incredible (with artistic influences from the entire twentieth-century imagery), and the complexity of the world that slowly unfolds before the player is certainly not hatchable in a handful of months, no matter how many brilliant minds are employed in the task. Production stuff with quite other numbers behind it, yet so much mania is nothing if you move on to the analysis of the narrative: the true heart of the work of ZA/UM, and capable of supporting the entire production almost in solitude. There is no devil. He's just god when he's drunk On the other hand in Disco Elysium everything is based on the writing. Returning again to his main muse, Torment, many things can be argued about, but it is undeniable that much of the charm of that immortal masterpiece lay in its being practically a large interactive book, full of beautifully characterized characters and dialogues of rare beauty and complexity. Well, here the thing is taken to the next level, because the amnesia of the protagonist represents in all respects a reset, which allows you to ~rebuild~ the personality of your alter ego from scratch with a level of detail incomparable to a simple system karmic or seeking a precise alignment. Once you have selected an initial archetype with more or less propensity for certain skills - or customized the scores to your liking - you will in fact discover that not only being moved by your own talents can be extremely harmful for you and those around you, but that the total absence of awareness can bring you so muchor to try to find a semblance of humanity, as to become a sort of psychotic and violent version of Tom Waits, with infinite shades of madness or extravagance in between. Added to this is even the ~voice~ of your skills, given that in Disco Elysium having a high score in a talent does not simply mean becoming more practical in carrying out the related task, but developing a sort of schizoid personality which leads to having to discuss with dozens of voices in the brain at every action performed. We understand that this may seem overwhelming and incomprehensible, so it is appropriate to give some practical examples. Imagine having a high score in the ~encyclopedia~ skill: here, this will unconsciously continuously communicate detailed information on more than interesting topics or on the socio-political situation of the city of Revachol (where everything takes place), but if you overinflate it it could overwhelm you with text for the most trivial thingsfrom the engineering data of a nearby car to the accurate description of a stuffed birdnot to mention making you snotty replying to people less knowledgeable than you on a given topic. Isn't that enough for you? Then consider that the voice called ~mind empire~ will continually convince you of the presence of occult forces behind everything, it doesn't matter whether these are real or not, or that physical skills will often lead you to act without thinking, to resume your old vices, or even experimenting with new chemicals The strange couple The policeman under your control is, in practice, a splinter gone mad, and it's up to you to decide whether to use his talents in the best way, looking for an effective solution to the murder around which the whole plot revolves, or being an agent of chaos who advances events like some kind of fearsome drunken tsunami. For the record, your personality and dialogue options will not vary only based on inner growth, but also as a result of learning specific mental doctrines related to lived events, which can be internalized using the same experience points as skills, require specific timings to activate (time in the game advances only during events and dialogues, not while exploring), and represent another equation to keep in mind in the crazy theorem fielded by the Estonian software house. The variety of interactions, changes in the reactions of non-player characters and absurd events is such that this RPG with over a million lines of dialogue is very replayable, which will keep most players occupied for over thirty hours (especially if not you are a fast reader). If it's not evidence of a job well done, we really don't know what is. It is understandable that, with a similar ~hero~ at the center of the adventure, the ZA / UM have decided to support the player with the most placid and reliable of the supporting actors: lieutenant Kim Katsuragi. It might initially seem like a simple videogame transposition of Manzai: a form of Japanese cabaret where the comedy of the jokes is amplified by the presence of a ~boke~ - a madman who performs silly actions - and a ~tsukkomi~ - a serious and dutiful partner - but Katsuragi is not simply a passive counterweight to your actions, and is indeed one of the best written and represented companions ever seen, as well as often being a precious help and a reasonable voice always worthy of being listened to (after all, to make some really unthinkable actions you'll have to wait for him to go to sleep). For heaven's sake, the ~good person / lunatic crazy~ combo maintains a considerable comic value even after making this clarification, however it would be simplistic to attribute the humor of Disco Elysium only to it, because the game is often hilarious, and it's incredible how his small army of writers constantly juggles hilarious jokes, detailed masses of data, hidden anomalies, politics, and a healthy dose of existential dread. Dice and clothes Thus described, the title could seem an absolute masterpiece, and in some ways we do not deny it is, given how anomalous, arrogant, brilliant and courageous it manages to be; his artistic ambitions and double-stranded dependence on the narrative element, however, have given shape to systemic cracks, which combined with some design oversights prevent him from being the perfect application of the original plan of his creators. Every single mechanic, in fact, is built around the multiple options of the dialogues, and the success in the ~roll of the dice~ increases as a percentage to the skills involved.many times in the event faced, as for any other RPG of this type. Here, however, experience points are earned only with obtaining important information, solving problems related to the case, or completing often trivial quests (including even just finding cigarettes to smoke), and the mass of skills to developing rapidly pushes the player to circumvent the difficulty of the shots with the use of various items of clothing. Yes, you got it right: in Disco Elysium clothes make your abilities fluctuate significantly, so much so that the randomness of the shots is almost insignificant after a few hours of exploration and recovery of objects. In a game calculated to offer multiple solutions to problems strictly related to how one's alter ego develops, this possibility partially breaks the formula, allowing an expert player to pass almost all the tests that the title imposes on him in a single run with a little cunning. As for the structural oversights, however, we are mainly talking about a couple of forced checks during the campaign, which must be overcome and seem to be placed there as a bottleneck to push the player to complete other events. We understand why, but even they partially interrupt the magic of what ZA/UM have managed to put together. However, little to worry about: in Disco Elysium the important thing is the journey more than the destination, and a few potholes on the road are not enough to ruin one of the most psychedelic and wonderfully intelligent videogame trips of this generation.", "date": "2019-10-25", "grade": "9.2"}
