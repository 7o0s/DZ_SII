{"name": "Law&Order: Dead on the money", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/laworder-dead-on-the-money.html", "text": "Little story of a TV success. Born in 1990, by Dick Wolf, ~Law & Order~ differs from most of the detective serials to which we have been accustomed in all these years, by virtue of a cynicism typical of the 90s (no longer therefore a clear contrast between good and bad) and also thanks to the fact that, finally, we will be able to follow the evolution of a case from the moment of the initial investigations up to the arrival in court with consequent hearing in the courtroom. In the 60 minutes of each episode, the viewer has the opportunity to watch almost two separate TV series, where the culprit found in the first part does not always correspond to that of the second. Ultimately we have a sort of ~2 for 1~ television where Parry Mason meets and collaborates with Inspector Tibbs. Or something like that actually. The videogame transposition, as expected, will faithfully follow this characteristic and will make us first play the role of the investigator and then that of the prosecution lawyer. This time we will have to deal with a mysterious murder that took place in the famous New York park of Central Park. We will first be called upon to assist Detective Briscole (voiced by the same actor from the television series, namely Jerry Orbach) in the search for the culprit and then, once the alleged murderer has been found, we will enter the courtroom together with Serena Southerlyn (also voiced by original actress Elisabeth Rohm) trying to frame the culprit. Technical investigations If right from the opening credits the atmosphere of the show will immediately come to our rescue (complete with the opening theme directly taken from the television version) after a few minutes we will realize how the purely technical aspect certainly does not represent the strong point of this title . The graphics during the ~exploration~ sections consist of a series of freely explorable three-dimensional environments but with very low quality. For those who played Access Software's first graphic adventures on CD-Rom (~Under a Killing Moon~ and ~Martian Memorandum~) or for those who have ever had the (un)luck to navigate in virtual environments recreated using QuickTime-Vr sa what are we talking about. Graphics only in low resolution and quite poor and poorly defined textures conclude our overview on the graphic aspect. Indeed, we add that most of the game time we will still be faced with semi-static scenes or during interrogations of various witnesses and suspects. The movement of the lips is synchronized with the speech, and the three-dimensional models, while not providing for a very high number of polygons, manage to be quite effective. Sure, it won't make us cry out for a miracle. On the contrary. We used to see some things in games from at least two years ago. Even the sound is reduced to a minimum. A few haggard jingles and some dull sound effects (like that of our cell phone) every now and then. However, the good quality of the dubbing should be noted which, as already mentioned, provides for the voices of the same actors of the show for the main characters. The voices, unlike all the text, have not been dubbed into Italian, thus giving fans the opportunity to hear the voices of the original protagonists. Luckily the Italian subtitles will help the less English-speaking among you. Time is money, but that's not all The game mechanics, at least in the first part of our adventures, will be timed: for the resolution of the case we will have only one week at our disposal which, translated into real game terms, theoretically turns into about seven hours of play continued. Yes, theoretically. This is because you will surely have to play more than one game to be able to focus on the most useful clues and the most likely suspects. Every action taken during the investigation will consume a certain amount of minutes, from finding every single object at the scene of the murder, to analyzing the evidence in the laboratory and questioning the suspects. Wasting too much time asking useless questions to useless people or assuming and analyzing too many clues (so forget one of the most used game styles in this kind of graphic adventures, that is: ~I take everything there is to take and examine everything there is to examine~) means exceeding the maximum time allowed for the capture of the perpetrator and having to start over. Fortunately, at the beginning of each game we will be able to select, similar to what happens in role-playing games, some features in which our digital alter-ego will excel and which will help us duringbefore our investigations. We will be able to decide to excel in two of the following skills: Efficiency, Finding clues, Interrogation and Teamwork. Efficiency will basically make us spend less time performing certain tasks. Being more skilled in interrogations will mean having fewer options to choose from when asking questions, being helped in finding clues instead will result in having visual references on the elements to be examined, otherwise you can also lose several diopters in examining 4x4 pixel large bodies of crime. Having chosen the teamwork skill instead will allow us to have, from time to time, suggestions and observations from our colleagues. Opposition! Gathering evidence and asking questions obviously won't be our only tasks in uncovering the killer. We will also have to commission laboratory investigations on the most interesting clues and we will be able to have our investigators tail the most suspicious suspects or have our psychologists draw up special psychological profiles. With a good dose of patience, some right intuition at the right time and even a little luck, the time will come to request a search warrant and play it all by going to find the decisive evidence of the guilt of our main suspect. The second part of the game, which will see us engaged in interrogations in the courtroom, while not providing a time limit within which to convince the jury of the defendant's guilt, will require us to have the right timing during interrogations. As in reality, in fact, thinking for a long time or having too much uncertainty in deciding the next question from those that can be selected or not asking an objection to an inappropriate question from the defense will mean failing in one's intentions. Before embarking on the trial, however, we will be called to choose which witnesses, clues and technical experts to bring to the courtroom to prove the guilt of our main suspect. If during the preliminary investigation we manage to highlight the most significant clues, if we call the most convincing witnesses to testify and if we manage to put under pressure, as in the best of the legal-thrillers to which Graham and his associates have accustomed us, our greatest suspect then we'll have a good chance of winning the case. Otherwise it will be better to reload from the last save and be patient: after all, after solving this case the game will already be over. The verdict ~Dead on The Money~ is an honest title that I recommend to all fans of graphic adventures with, of course, a special mention to aficionados of the television series. The deficiencies in the sound and graphics sector are forgiven thanks to the game mechanics which, although not immune from defects, manage to recreate the police investigation feeling well. The sword of Damocles represented by time, if on the one hand it will annoy us on the other, has proved to be a clever ploy not only to prolong the (narrow) longevity of the only investigation envisaged by the game but also to make the experience of a razor's edge investigation. The very structure of the game then allows us to have a rather broad freedom of action, making this title immune from the so-called ~adventurer's block~ when faced with a particularly difficult puzzle or that of the ~kleptomaniac adventurer~ grappling with a huge inventory and the infinite combinations of manipulation/action on them. Sierra's old ~Police quests~ certainly carve out a better place in our hearts but also this ~Law&Order: Dead on The money~ deserves at least a small ravine right behind the best titles ever and next to honest titles, without too many pretensions , but they manage to entertain. If only they had foreseen at least a couple more cases to solve. Pros: A fairly original title Very wide freedom of action for this genre of games TV-film atmosphere Cons: Technically dull Voices not dubbed in Italian Longevity rather limited Law and order From one of the most popular American television serials, an almost old-fashioned graphic adventure is about to arrive, somewhat unexpectedly. Those who have loved Sierra adventures such as Police Quest cannot fail to have their hearts skip a beat. Those who have loved graphic adventures and that's it can't help but rejoice in the fact that, even if pointed out as in agony for several years now, this genre still manages to offersomething new and enjoyable for all the still numerous enthusiasts. The Californian developers of ~Legacy Interactive~, literally unknown in our old continent, began several years ago to program video games in their Hollywood offices by launching a series of games called Real Life Games on the market. First aid rooms, ambulances on the streets of Los Angeles and first aid centers are in fact the settings on which some of their most popular games (or simulations as I call them) are based, from ~911 Paramedic~ to ~Emercency Room Code Red~. After a series of titles more or less inspired by famous television serials (such as a certain ER), therefore, the legaci decided to exploit their tested game system to exploit the license of one of America's most popular crime series: ~ Law & Order~, literally ~Law and Order~.", "date": "2003-08-01", "grade": null}
