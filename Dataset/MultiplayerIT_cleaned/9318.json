{"name": "Liberamente tratto da Zelda", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87629-queens-crown-liberamente-tratto-da-zelda.html", "text": "Queen's Crown is an RPG that impresses with its fairytale story, its addictive gameplay, its accurate graphics and a remarkable ~inspiration~ to the inimitable Zelda series, Wind Waker in the first place. In Queen's Crown you take on the role of Ann, a typical princess of a typical kingdom invaded by the even more typical forces of evil. Ann finds herself involved in a conflict bigger than her and invested with the task of saving the entire kingdom, thanks to the help of the Fairies, who have been missing since time immemorial. His job is to find them, one by one, and get their help. Of course, the story has nothing particularly original, but the first moments of the game, suspended between archetypal fairy tale and irony, go straight to the heart and we find ourselves involved in an apparently much more complex adventure than it is. Weapons and spells for all tastes Even the gameplay, very well thought out, helps to suck the player into the vortex of the game: Queen's Crown takes full advantage of Zelda, it is true, but thanks to the inclusion of some interesting innovations, it immediately configures itself as something more original. First of all the combat system: in this action rpg the protagonist can choose between 4 different weapons, all with their own characteristics. The classic sword, for quick attacks; a warhammer, for slow and powerful attacks; the spear, for effective but unwieldy attacks; the bow, which is able to inflict damage at a distance. Each of these weapons has its own limitations, its merits and must be used at the right time, inserting an interesting element of strategy into combat. Furthermore Ann can use magic: thanks to the help of the Fairies, various spells gradually become available, which contribute decisively to the fights, especially as the game progresses. All this makes the action sequences very entertaining: and it's a good thing, because in Queen's Crown you do very little, apart from constantly fighting against legions and legions of enemies, who reform almost instantly after being killed. Defeating them is essential to accumulate experience and level up, making Ann stronger and more capable of completing her mission. Like many games of this type, the story is based on a mission system, all basically aimed at making the player annihilate large groups of enemies of a certain type. These quests are decidedly unoriginal and in the long run end up becoming tremendously repetitive, but at least we must recognize Queen's Crown considerable attention in balancing the difficulty. Completing the various secondary missions is enough to allow the player to advance in the game, without having to resort to boring and frustrating moments of ~grinding~, where he wanders aimlessly in search of easy experience points, to level up his heroine. Grow the character The character advancement system is also of the classic type: at each new level the player can spend points on the various characteristics of strength, vitality, agility, etc. as he likes. But there is also a small innovation, to spice things up and make combat more flexible: Ann has a series of ~gems~, each with particular characteristics, which she can equip in a grid. The grid expands as the character levels up, making it possible to activate new abilities. Gems are obtained following encounters with particularly powerful enemies and bosses, but they can also be purchased and equipped to your liking, depending on the game situation. For example, in the exploratory phases you can use gems that facilitate the finding of special objects and money, while in more difficult battles it is advisable to use upgrade gems. In the game there are many different objects: weapons of all kinds, armor, amulets, etc. However Ann is only customizable via headgear and weapons, while her clothing appears identical throughout the duration of the game. The shops offer a certain variety and there is also a system for upgrading weapons and creating new tools, entrusted to the classic blacksmith. This system only starts to become useful in the final stages of the game, but it is still an element of some interest. It takes about thirty hours to completely complete the game, during which the quality and care gradually decrease. In the final stages, the game even goes as far as recycling even the bosses, and leaves the unpleasant impression of a decidedly lengthy broth... And it's the only real flaw of this game, besides the fact that, unfortunately, it's all in English. The vertested version is 1.1.1 Price: 2.39 App Store links", "date": "2011-04-28", "grade": "7.5"}
