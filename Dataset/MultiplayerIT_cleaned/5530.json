{"name": "Turtle Defense", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167614-war-tortoise-turtle-defense.html", "text": "It is clear that tower defense is a real passion for the Foursaken Media team, which does not give up on exploring new genres (as in the case of the recent All is Lost) but which periodically returns to what can be defined as its native soil . A trend that is confirmed with the release of this War Tortoise, which takes the typical elements of the aforementioned category and applies them to a shooter matrix gameplay. Let's see if it's a successful mix or not... War Tortoise is a convincing marriage between a shooter and a tower defense style game The mice and the greens The war turtle that gives the game its name is the immobile and silent fulcrum on which the entire play structure of the latest addition to the Foursaken Media house rotates: protected by steel plates and reinforced by a scaffolding that envelops the carapace, the tortoise must be defended from enemy attacks (represented by frogs, cockroaches, lizards and other less illustrious members of the animal kingdom) using the weapons mounted on its back and controlled by soldier mice. Unlike the classic tower defense in which your units autonomously attack the closest opponents, here it is the player who actively takes control of the situation, moving the crosshairs and shooting at the chosen targets just like in a third-person shooter. The control system is simplified to the max, and it is only necessary to swipe with your finger to frame your intended victim and let the software fire until he succumbs. Put like this, War Tortoise could appear as an extremely banal and repetitive title, but fortunately there are several elements that contribute to enriching the offer, making the Foursaken Media product capable of going beyond its own limits, at least for a while. The progression is structured in levels divided into different waves of enemies, obviously with the aim of surviving as long as possible: by eliminating the opponents, credits are accumulated which can be spent at any time in the appropriate shop to improve the offensive and defensive characteristics of the turtle, buy new weapons or unlock support structures such as mortars or turrets. Sufficient content to keep the user's interest alive for more than a few hours, but which in any case does not prevent War Tortoise from proving to be a title that gives its best if played in bits and pieces rather than over long sessions: an aspect which the developers themselves are probably well aware of, given that the application rewards all those who return after a break with energy refills and extra credits. Taken in these terms, War Tortoise also entertains thanks to a simplified but strangely exciting shooter component: thanks also to a variety of enemies that constantly forces the player to evaluate which opponent to hit first, always keeping in mind the reload time of the weapons and other parameters that regulate combat. The solutions adopted when leveling up or being overwhelmed by opponents are also interesting: in the first case we see a change of setting and you can choose a new perk from those available, while in the second you can decide to pay a sum to continue to play or start over from the beginning, however, taking with you all the upgrades collected up to that moment. To complete the picture there are also clashes with bosses available for a limited time interval which in case of victory guarantee rich rewards. In short, it can be said that Foursaken Media has really got the most out of such an elementary basic structure as that of War Tortoise, managing to create a strategic shooter that does its duty flawlessly, also from the point of view purely technical. In fact, although the battlefield is not particularly extensive, the game is graphically very accurate, especially considering the quality of the textures, light effects and explosions. The work done on the interface is also excellent, clean and functional at the same time, while as per Foursaken Media tradition, there are in-app purchases and promotional messages but they are much less invasive than the vast majority of free to play games available on the market.", "date": "2016-05-04", "grade": "8.0"}
