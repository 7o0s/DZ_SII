{"name": "Super si nasce", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70566-champions-online-super-si-nasce-eroi-si-diventa.html", "text": "The successful MMORPG is a complex formula, dominated by two ingredients that are as easy to recognize (for us consumers!) as they are difficult to dose for those who have the burden of creating the game, as they are often antithetical: accessibility and depth. An online role-playing game, regardless of the business model, but even more so if it includes a classic monthly paid subscription as in our case, lives thanks to the long-lasting contribution of a large number of players. In short, it aims to attract a large user base (and therefore to be easy to take in hand as well as immediately capture the imagination) who go on playing for as long as possible (where longevity derives from depth - of gameplay, content and etc). ~Exaggerating~ on the one hand means creating a niche title: think of an Eve Online, infinite and eternal but with a harder learning curve than real life. On the other side of the spectrum we have the ~casual~ constellation of MMORPGs, perhaps free to play, more immediate than Tetris and equally full of surprises. There is no perfect balance other than that given by the expectations of each player, but what we can do is judge the effectiveness and consistency with which an MMORPG adheres to the formula - and therefore the audience - set. In short, if it hits the target, which Champions Online - and we finally get there - manages to do, even if a little limited and in a not exactly spectacular way. Edges to smooth Champions Online aims to be an immediate and accessible MMORPG and with good reason. Its predecessor City of Heroes already boasted an almost casual simplicity which was a real novelty compared to contemporary titles, full of statistics, skills, talents and so on. Interface and menu (obviously Warcraftian-style) are familiar, as are party and chat management, the elementary inventory and even the symbolism of exclamation marks and question marks suspended over NPCs: if it weren't for the time joyfully spent fantasizing about the character editor, you'd find yourself beating up your first aliens within seconds of installing it. However, it is a fact that a good part of so much commendable immediacy turns out to be little more than an illusion, right from the first steps in the tutorial location, where you find yourself in front of windows and windows of text to often read on almost insignificant details, while very few words are spent to introduce players to the fundamental mechanics of the game itself. Like the fact, for example, that there are no predefined classes: in the creation phase it is possible to choose a ~framework~ among the various available archetypes (powers based on fire, ice, magic, power armor, super strength...), but the thing is not in the least binding and indeed there is the possibility of exchanging the first two ~standard~ powers with any other of the same level. Even at the cost of giving rise to completely ineffective or meaningless combinations, which, given the practically total absence of indications for the neophyte, is the reason why it is advisable to adapt to the preset frameworks, at least during the creation phase. As we increase in level, the possibility of customizing our powers flourishes in a complete and uncontrolled way as much as the aesthetic one: it is a pity however that, unlike our costume, the effectiveness of ours depends on the goodness of our choices in terms of scores and skills. character and by extension our enjoyment or frustration. Champions definitely doesn't do a good job of explaining the rules underlay the often hermetic names of his various statistics. We challenge anyone to estimate the importance of ~Ego~ or ~Presence~ in the economy of the game, rather difficult to grasp, especially (but not only) for us Italians, never exposed to the historic but not very widespread original tabletop RPG. Of course, in case of errors it is possible to make corrections with a good reset or ~respec~ if you prefer (in deference to the culture of comics, it is called a ~retcon~, a nice touch of class), but in the apparent attempt to discourage a excessive use (which given the lack of classes and the total freedom of customization would result in the futility of creating further characters after the first one) Cryptic has imposed such a prohibitive price that you really have to wish to make as few mistakes as possible. Strange way of discouraging experimentation, so encouraged in every other aspect of the game. Even crafting, in itself elementary to the point of simplistic, manages to be a source of headaches, when the bonuses conferred by the objects created are not documented or are defined in a purely qualitative way. Elsewhere Champions returns to being user friendly in a brilliant way, as in the case of the sis~sideckicking~ theme, which allows you to gain experience with friends of a higher level than your own, playing the role of the classic ~sidekick~ of a more mature super hero (with an equal sharing of experience). And what about the fact that there are no monolithic, non-communicating game servers? Each main area is in all respects a huge instance, present in multiple copies and it is possible to jump from one to another and play with whoever we like best. A mechanism similar to the Guild Wars hubs, but on a larger scale and involving the entire world of Champions Online. Contents: few but good Regarding the world of Champions Online, a point that is not exciting is that relating to the contents, which are rather few and sometimes distributed in a discontinuous way. There are currently only 5 zones, and the fact that there are no exclusive starting areas for any classes or races means that each new character will find themselves fighting the same enemies and redoing the same quests. Once the tutorial instance is over, we are asked whether to go to Canada or New Mexico alternatively, but in fact you will explore both up to the last meter in search of quests to do. In fact, the missions are not sufficient in number to support continuous growth, except for the first levels, but once you reach the middle of the game (and the locations of Monster Island and the underwater kingdom of Lemiria) their number drops drastically, until to a real quest ~hole~ that will force you into the most tedious of grinds, grinding enemies around the map while watching the experience indicator slowly advance. Fortunately, the Lairs appear in the second half, instanced dungeons to be done in groups that are very well done and fun, but even in this case, the numbers are not ideal and do not imply choices or alternatives for the players: you have to do everything and often several times. Mind you that Champions Online is anything but a frustrating or boring MMORPG, but the fact remains that it has an objective ~rhythm~ problem and it's not just a matter of undersized and sometimes diluted content until it disappears. Meanwhile, the sense of reward that one gets from progressing through the levels is undermined by the fact of appearing from the first moment exactly as we would like to be: the additional aesthetic changes that can be earned are marginal and in fact a newly created character looks identical to one of the highest level. Time just a couple of hours and with the achievement of the fifth level you get probably the most important advance of the entire game, or the Travel Power: flight, teleportation, super speed and so on. An initially intoxicating conquest, which has the advantage of minimizing the empty periods between one fight and another, but which happens too soon as it makes each subsequent strenuous, almost insignificant conquest appear. Receiving a power every 3 levels means employing dozens of hours of play to accumulate just a handful of skills that add a minimum of variety to a fun combat system with a very ~action~ flavor (button to parry, powers that load in intensity holding down the button etc.) but invariably monotonous at first. Even the most original feature of Champions Online, the ability to design and release in the game our official Nemesis, the perfect super-villain NPC created to torment us, shows up too late, at the 25th level. When it would have been perfect to share the genesis of our character with that of our archenemy or at least start living a common story since the dawn of their respective careers. Luckily the world itself is vibrant and beautiful to look at and the new ~cartoony~ filters applied to the graphics are well done. The 4 locations mentioned above are quite conventional in look, but Millennium City - which is also the closest to the old City of Heroes - is beautiful and exciting to explore. One of the strengths of the game is that it appears more ~alive~ and vibrant than any other MMORPG we've tried, with enemies that don't just hang around on their own waiting for the pull, but always seem to be engaged in some evil intent that requires our intervention, be it robbing or threatening an NPC or discussing among themselves the best way to get the next lunch of human flesh. It's a pity that the graphics engine doesn't seem to be particularly efficient and as anticipated in the preview phase, and that the game turned out to be quite resource intensive for an MMORPG despite the graphics which, although original and with an interesting style, seem to be anything but revolutionary. The latency that afflicts particularly slow interfaces and menus does not contribute to improving a particularly rosy technical picture.", "date": "2009-09-18", "grade": "7.7"}
