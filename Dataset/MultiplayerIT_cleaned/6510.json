{"name": "Dante Reloaded", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146484-dmc-devil-may-cry-definitive-edition-dante-reloaded.html", "text": "While the practice of reboot has become commonplace in the current market, the restyling operation applied to characters that are part of the collective videogame imagination can be extremely risky. The management of video game icons is not dissimilar from the Hollywood star system and in particular with regard to cult video games, those that boast a particularly fierce and traditionalist base of enthusiasts, perhaps similar to the figure of the hardcore gamer, going to touch certain fixed points it can spark fierce opposition. Capcom, a historic publisher who in recent years has tried to keep up with the times by modifying and modernizing the material belonging to its vast catalog, is well aware of it, sometimes succeeding and other times failing in a rather evident way. DmC Devil May Cry is one of these experiments, however received with decidedly polarized judgments: if on the one hand the critics have promoted the courageous operation to relaunch the brand, on the other the audience of diehard Dante fans has not really managed to accept the restyling imposed by the publisher on their darling, entrusted to the care of the British Ninja Theory team and emerged as a bold young man with few elements in common with the original. Glacial fighter with long silver hair tempered by a thousand demonic battles in the first chapters, this new Dante is instead a rebellious boy, with short black hair, still inexperienced even if endowed with a great talent for combat. The deadpan, mature ~badass~ has become a decidedly foul-mouthed and disrespectful young hothead, hastily labeled ~emo~ in a ploy that longtime fans just couldn't swallow. It's a shame that much of the talk spent on DmC has ultimately focused on this pure matter of form, because underneath the haircut and the bad taste jokes there is actually a good game too. Let's see if it is possible to rediscover it on the occasion of this Definitive Edition. The stylish action Dante's epic in this new chapter takes a somewhat alternative turn compared to the original one: the metaphysical struggle of the nephilim (son of a demon and a female angel) is linked to a sort of critique of consumer society by associating Mundus, the demon supreme, to an industry and telecommunications magnate capable of pulling the strings of the whole world. The personal war of Dante and his brother Vergil in this particular vision therefore becomes a rebellion against the ~system~, here moved by truly diabolical powers, an elementary and somewhat coarse but nonetheless appreciable social critique, beyond the mere pretext it offers to the player to strike. In this context, an extremely fast and spectacular action game is inserted, which continues in the wake marked by Hideki Kamiya as regards the fundamentals of combat and the insistence on style, the search not only for combative effectiveness but also for spectacularity. In short, a ~stylish~ action like this not only requires the ability to land blows and avoid those of the opponents, but also requires doing it with a certain style. The alternation of fast, powerful blows, grabs and aerial projections determines devastating combos, which if carried out with the right timing are worth high-level assessments, multiplying the bonuses and damage inflicted based on the aesthetics of the combat, constantly evaluated with a particular scale of votes during each clash. The immediate alternation of weapons with different characteristics allows for different fighting styles and an approach that is both aesthetic and partially strategic, considering that some enemies require certain specific types. From a structural point of view, the Definitive Edition does not present any changes compared to the original edition, therefore we refer to the reviews of the old DmC Devil May Cry and the related DLC Vergil's Downfall, included in the package, for all the details regarding the functioning of the game. Dante is back: angrier, faster and more defined than ever in the Definitive Edition of DmC Back to the origins? In terms of structure and history, therefore, the Definitive Edition does not offer anything new compared to the original edition, with the variations that are to be found only in the technical and partially content fields. Let us therefore dedicate ourselves to the latter, which have been studied by Ninja Theory also taking into consideration the feedback of the players and clearly demonstrate a willingness to meet the tastes of the users, trying to mend the tear consumed with the hard core of fans of the series. Beyond the DLC included, frankly small, considerrando that it is only the only expansion released, or Vergil's Downfall, a new Bloody Palace dedicated to the character in question and some skins to change Dante's appearance, the major work carried out by the developers has concentrated on changes to the balance and added options. Everything is obviously studied in the name of the hardcore gamer, responding to the criticisms that saw DmC tending to excessively lower the level of difficulty compared to the original chapters. From this point of view, the addition of various modes is appreciated which allow the level of the challenge to be raised substantially, as well as guaranteeing a good replayability rate to try all the possible variations on the theme. Hardcore mode increases the resistance of enemies and the style evaluation system becomes more selective, requiring more skill and speed of execution to reach high levels, as well as a reworking of the Devil Trigger that complicates life for Dante even in his demonic form . The Must Style mode makes it necessary to reach the ~S~ level in the execution of the combos to inflict damage on enemies, who are otherwise invulnerable, while the Gods Must Die difficulty level represents probably the biggest challenge of the package, with the need to take down enemies with activated Devil Trigger and without using healing items. The feeling that this Definitive Edition returns is therefore that of a subtle but well-studied approach to the original features, perfecting the gameplay and making it closer to tradition. Dedicated to the fans The additions and changes applied to the Definitive Edition move mainly according to two main guidelines, namely a greater adherence to the tradition of the series, although Ninja Theory has however maintained its particular imprint on this chapter, and the inclusion of features desired and requested by more passionate users, selected on the basis of feedback and what emerged also from the community of the PC version, to which this latest edition certainly owes something in technical terms. The Turbo Mode is a welcome return to the game, an option that increases the speed of the clashes by 20%, making the action much more frenetic and spectacular, which combined with the greater fluidity increases the aesthetic enjoyment of the clashes. The possibility of manually targeting, thus choosing which enemy to focus the shots on, was probably one of the most frequent requests from players, given that the automatic targeting system tended to be very confusing, as we also noted in the review of the original, and it is clearly an addition that the developers have inserted to respond to the needs of the user. Other balancing interventions have affected the ranking system for fighting style evaluations and bosses, but also more subtle gameplay elements, such as a reduction of the advantage obtainable using the defensive maneuver Demon Evade and various other small but important adjustments to the mechanics of defensive and attacking moves. A reworking that closely resembles the operations always carried out by Capcom on the various versions of Street Fighter IV. The importance of the example given by the community is then evident in the possible activation of some mods that had been developed for the PC version, such as deactivating the timer inside the Bloody Palace or eliminating the need to use the angelic weapon or demonic against some enemies, who therefore become vulnerable to any type of attack. Xbox One goals This Definitive Edition also aligns with the standard of 50 unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points. Considering the presence of the Vergil DLC and the amount of modes introduced, the simple conclusion of the story does not lead to collecting a large amount of points, but it takes some dedication and exploration of all the various modes and difficulty levels to conquer the full loot. On the other hand that's what DmC fans want, right? 60 frames per second, 1080p The arrival at 60 frames per second is not exclusive to the Definitive Edition, given that this goal had already been reached by the excellent PC version of the original, but that is enough to make this new edition very interesting, given the importance that the fluency factor takes over in such a game. In a title that makes the speed of the action and the chain of moves its fundamental points, an increase in the frame rate also has beneficial effects on the gameplay, at least in perceptive terms. This is accompanied by the new 1080p resolution, riresult of a global remastering operation of the graphic layout and (at least partial) modification of the original assets to better appear in the new visual standard. To tell the truth, the results aren't exactly sensational when compared with the potential offered by PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The increased resolution improves the appearance of the game but it is evident that the graphic system fully belongs to the last generation and certainly does not represent a prominent element in the context of the new generation. The frame rate, as previously reported by Ninja Theory, is not locked at 60 frames per second, and although the fluidity always stands at excellent levels, some variations are perceptible in sporadic cases. A more frequent problem, at least in the tested Xbox One version, is instead that of tearing, which appears within some levels by rotating the camera with a certain insistence (an action that is often necessary to see the hidden collectibles), a sign of some difficulty encountered by the developers in adapting the graphics engine based on Unreal Engine 3 in the new hardware context, even if these are not major defects. For the rest, the judgment on the excellent work carried out by the artists of the British team in the construction of scenarios, characters and animations remains unchanged, as well as on the audio sector which uses the music of Noisia and Combichrist, as well as on the Italian dubbing.", "date": "2015-03-10", "grade": "8.0"}
