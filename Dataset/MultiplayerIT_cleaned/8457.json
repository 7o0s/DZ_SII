{"name": "The Amazing Spider-Man", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105552-the-amazing-spider-man-lo-stupefacente-emoragno.html", "text": "A trend in recent years has seen the various tie-ins be inspired by the plot of the related films only partially, bringing into play different situations and characters so as to somehow constitute a surprise even for those who had already gone to the cinema, and in the same way avoid spoiling the vision for those who have not yet gone there. In the case of The Amazing Spider-Man, however, the developers of Beenox have taken an alternative route, avoiding representing the events of the film directed by Marc Webb and instead working on a hypothetical sequel to them. We therefore find a Peter Parker already consolidated in his role as Spider-Man, a Gwen Stacy perfectly aware of her boyfriend's double identity and an Oscorp never so full of dangerous hybrids. When the two visit the laboratories to check that everything is in order, things fall apart and a contamination occurs involving not only some scientists but also Gwen. The only hope of finding an antidote lies in the hands of Dr. Curt Connors, otherwise known as the Lizard: Spider-Man finds himself forced to break him out of the special prison in which he is being held in order to get his help. These phases take place in the game as a sort of tutorial, during which our goal is to become familiar with a different control system compared to the other titles made by Beenox, which is clearly inspired by Batman: Arkham Asylum as far as it's about the fights. Our character very often faces small groups of opponents, but his ~spider sense~ warns him of every incoming attack, so that he can react instantly and implement a counter. The rendering of these dynamics is practically identical to that of the Rocksteady series, even if the blows of the Dark Knight make use of a substantially greater impact sensation, which gives more body and involvement to the exchanges. Power is nothing without control It is interesting to note how in the film, and therefore in the tie-in, we wanted to enhance the aforementioned ~spider sense~ to give the character an intuition that in reality, comics speaking, does not belong to him: Spider-Man who discovers the secret codes on a keyboard simply by looking at it, which sits on its web and follows its ~vibrations~ which indicate which path to follow, and so on. Beyond these moments, which constitute only a marginal part of the experience, this new Activision production bases a large part of its appeal on the so-called ~spider shot~, or a sort of instantaneous focus that Spider-Man can exploit to decide instantaneous movements towards an enemy or an area of the scenario. It's fun to use this power to silently knock out opponents, thinning out yet another group of Oscorp guards before they are completely annihilated, but it also comes in handy in various situations where you need to move very quickly from one part of the level to another , perhaps because there is a passage that closes after a few moments or the floor is dotted with traps and an alternative location must be reached quickly. The Amazing Spider-Man on Wii looks like a ~simplified~ version of what was seen on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, in the sense that all the sandbox part and free roaming have been cut in favor of a traditional approach, with missions individually accessible and really ugly menu graphics. Not that the in-game one is better, unfortunately: Spider-Man's polygonal model has a decent set of animations and a good level of detail, but everything else ranges from poor to insufficient, with enemies all the same, textures scarce or completely absent and a lot of problems with the view, which often gets stuck in absurd positions. In this regard, it must be said that the default control system, with the classic Wii-mote / Nunchuk combination, works very badly: shaking the controller to carry out a counterattack is a move that comes automatically, given that the device takes any vibration, but it is above all the management of the camera via the d-pad that arouses the greatest perplexity, because it is almost impossible to use it in a dignified way during the boss fights, or when the situation leads us to move continuously around the opponent. Luckily you can use the Classic Controller or, better still, the Classic Controller Pro - the latter is, in our opinion, the best way to play The Amazing Spider-Man, which ultimately doesn't really use the capabilities at all peculiar to the Nintendo console, indeed. Finally, a few words for the audio sector: the game is cofully dubbed in Italian and this is always appreciable, but the voices completely lack a professional direction and this is practically always evident, with the characters who say their lines calmly while all hell happens around the world.", "date": "2012-07-05", "grade": "8.0"}
