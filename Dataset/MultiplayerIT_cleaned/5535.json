Before starting to play, the hope was that of not finding oneself dealing with a vast structure full of repetitions again, but above all that this time the themes were a little less gloomy and linked to the death of any travel companions. Fortunately both of our requests were satisfied with a chapter which, while maintaining a bittersweet vein, especially linked to the impending old age of King Graham and the inevitable impossibility of throwing himself into new adventures, tells a story full of humor and with a level of difficulty well calibrated; but let's proceed in order. Here is the review of the third chapter of King's Quest: Once Upon a Climb! The king is looking for a wife Before we begin we are greeted by a simple but well thought out puzzle. To resume the discussion, the game shows us the protagonist who walks through three stages of his life: adolescent adventurer, newly crowned young king and adult. If you want, you can move through this timeline by changing some things so that they affect the next ones. For example, planting a seed in the first scenario will see it grow and ripen in the third. In this way we will have to save a little owl from its fate, so as to continue the episode. Once he has proven his worth, conquered the kingdom and overcome the pitfalls of the goblin caves, our dear king will be grappling with a decidedly pressing issue for any self-respecting crowned head: the search for a worthy life partner. After consulting the inevitable mirror, Graham decides to go to the classic high and lost tower in which the even more classic princess is imprisoned. But since things in the kingdom of King's Quest never go as they should, the princesses are two and imprisoned by a monstrous crone who has wrapped the tower in a magical barrier. Even Graham ends up imprisoned in the tower, which more than a building is a sort of magical living being with crow's feet: the only way to break the spell is to find true love. The two princesses couldn't be more different from each other: Vee is more intellectual, she loves puzzles, word games and intelligence that wins over strength, Neese has a more impetuous character, she loves music, adventure and throwing herself headlong into the challenges. It will be us with our gestures, dialogues and choices to decide which will be our favorite. In fact, the various stages of the game will require us to interact with the two girls in board games, puzzles, quick time events and musical puzzles, obviously trying to curry favor with the one we have chosen. In short, this third chapter looks like one of those reality shows in which the bachelor has to choose between two suitors. The story first One of the most important changes that the game has benefited from is making the chapter structure much more linear and less tied to backtracking in very large environments. Generally in Once upon a climb it doesn't happen that you have to explore more than a couple of screens at a time, moving on to the next ones once the current puzzle has been solved. Therefore, all those repetitions related to the first and above all to the second chapter have disappeared, which from time to time forced us to move in an always identical environment, trying to do new things. This approach, in some ways similar to the TellTale model, allows the game to never lose the thread of the conversation, while still proposing puzzles that are perfectly in the middle between simplicity and the need to look for a solution online. In particular, we were impressed by the variety of puzzles offered. In addition to the initial one, which we have already talked about, we were able to experiment with logical, memory, musical puzzles and even a sort of board game with which to discover the character of the two princesses. As for the general presentation, the game returns to the colorful tones of the first chapter, with a cel shading style that is always very pleasant to see. Even if the quality of textures and solids seemed slightly less high than in the past. The only annoying note are some points where, in the event of death, we will be forced to listen to some dialogues without any possibility of cutting short. In particular there is a puzzle, totally based on ~trial and error~, in which with every mistake we are forced to listen to one of the princesses say the same things. Since it may take a few tries to complete the sequence, after a while you'll be wishing the girl was a princess, Bella Ad style.sleeping and not the model with voice. For the rest we are perhaps faced with the sweetest, most sentimental and delicate chapter, given that in any case the topics touched concern love, growing old together and the passing of time, topics treated with irony and delicacy, not without decidedly touching moments , but maybe it's just the fact that we're getting old too. King's Quest: Once Upon a Climb sweeps away the shadows of the second chapter with a much more driven and less repetitive story, in which the puzzles are tantalizing and well distributed without ever representing an insurmountable challenge. As for the story, maybe it's shorter than the previous chapters, but it's also much more ~dense~ and there's no shortage of well-written moments and interesting plots that could transform the next chapters into small masterpieces, let's hope we won't be proven wrong!", "date": "2016-05-03", "grade": null}
