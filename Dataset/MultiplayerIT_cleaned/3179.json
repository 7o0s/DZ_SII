{"name": "Saints Row IV: Re-Elected", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saints-row-iv-re-elected-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "The Saints Row series is among the most divisive that the gaming world remembers. After a couple of episodes already over the top, the third iteration had reached levels of bad taste to be one of the most foul-mouthed and trivial video games on the scene. Adored by some, hated by others, rightly criticized by those in the middle due to a low ironic level, it still represented a watershed, especially for the future of a series that at the moment appears dead in any case. The unfortunate drift of the saga closely resembles that way of making American film parody that has given us some little jewels, but also some filth without rhyme or reason. On the other hand, the road traveled is difficult and requires living on the very blurred border between laughter and boredom, between genius and bad taste. After the not exactly splendid reception of the third episode, Volition has changed course, keeping the level of quotationism high, but reducing the useless vulgarity, resulting in a discreet fourth chapter, certainly more appreciated overall. The arrival on Nintendo Switch, and therefore the review of Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, also marks the conclusion of an adaptation process which, from now on, can only go on hoping for the resumption of a series that can still count several acolytes around the globe. The Saints at the White House The plot of this particular version of Saints Row IV spans two different time frames, one tied to the original 2013 release and the second included only in this Re-Elected version and known as Gat Out of Hell. The two stories have nothing to do with each other and both focus on the madness of the usual events of the most famous band on the planet. From street gangs they have now become big and appreciated, to the point of bringing our alter ego to be the president of the United States. When everything seems to be going well, an alien invasion affects the supremacy of the Saints, killing and kidnapping, transporting us in a virtual version of our world that winks at that of the Matrix series. Just as in the case of the film trilogy, having been deprived of our reality brings pros and cons, pushing the Saints Row series further than it ever had up to that point. In addition to the usual plethora of weapons and secondary missions, this fourth chapter also brings the possibility of unlocking superpowers, transforming the game into a strange hybrid between a normal free roaming caciarone and the never forgotten Prototype. Running at high speed, using telekinesis and boosting your jump are just some of the possibilities that you can activate during your game. Just as it is possible to enhance these skills, in the fourth chapter the modifications of the weapons have also appeared, dramatically expanding the customization of your arsenal. To add a pinch of quality compared to the past, there is a certainly better shooting system than the previous ones, which at least allows you to have the illusion of shooting in a specific direction. The certainly not exciting duration of the main campaign - we are talking about ten hours scarce - makes the couple with that of the Gat out of Hell expansion, even halved. In the latter case, however, the different setting and the totally crazy story make the package sufficiently large and fun. The Switch version On Nintendo Switch this Saints Row IV: Re-Elected looks exactly like its predecessor did last year. The element that convinced us the most was an undoubtedly improved frame rate, a sign that the experience of twelve months ago has benefited this second porting. For the rest we are faced with the same identical technical level ranging from mediocre to the lowest. On the other hand, Saints Row has never shone from this point of view and the fourth chapter already appeared extremely old to its original release now seven years ago. The small screen of Switch helps to avoid getting lost in the maze of a crazy aliasing and than a polygon count from two generations ago, placing Saints Row IV at the top of the scale of titles for ~enthusiasts only~. The series has enjoyed great success over time, just as it has been deeply hated by many others. It cannot be denied that it has been able to carve out a space for itself, but if what you are looking for is a technically successful open world on Nintendo Switch, this is undoubtedly the furthest port to dock.", "date": "2020-03-23", "grade": "7.0"}
