Usually, it is a question of defending a garrison against an impending threat through various means made available to the player, who must know how to dose resources and timing to manage the situation in a rather tight game dynamic. With a decidedly original idea, Gods vs Humans largely takes up the general superstructure of this genre but completely overturns its perspective, essentially placing the player in the shoes of the super-power and thus offering the opposite point of view compared to what we are used to . In the role of a divinity (several of them are interpreted passing through various civilizations of history such as Egyptians, Scandinavians, Japanese and others) we must in every way prevent humans from completing the construction of huge towers stretched to the sky with the intention of reaching the realm of the gods and force its portal. The attitude that the player has to keep during the game is rather atypical, since it is indeed necessary to use the various super-powers to be launched against the towers through the pointer in the most destructive way possible, but a certain foresight must also be used because humans continue to worship us as a good and mighty deity so as not to risk a potentially disastrous mutiny. The result is a continuous balancing of powers necessary to avoid precipitating the situation, which determines an additional level of strategic planning within a rather fast game mechanic. There is plenty of material to enjoy with about 60 levels and the particular premise adopted by Artefacts is convincing at first, but the inevitable monotony of the gameplay and the rather high price even by normal WiiWare standards, i.e. 1500 Wii Points, fail to place Gods vs Humans in the exclusive Olympus of the best titles on Wii digital delivery, despite the divine premise. Tower destruction game In fact, more than a tower defense, it is a ~tower destruction game~, if this particular release of Artefacts can be defined as such. If you have seen or played My Life as a Darklord by Square Enix you will have a rather vivid idea of what Gods vs Humans puts in front of the players' eyes, only the roles are practically reversed. We therefore find ourselves scrolling between one floor and another of the gigantic tower under construction, populated by humans of various types and appearances busy in the construction of their work. The relationship with these, as already mentioned, is twofold: if on the one hand the intentions of humans must be blocked, on the other hand one must not give in too much to the immoderate use of powers in order not to make the population of believers rise up. The interface is limited to the possibility of moving from one floor to another of the tower, with a particular wheel that can be called up at any time to select the powers that are progressively unlocked as you progress through the game and whose use consumes a ~respect~ bar which it is nourished by the prayers of the faithful. The powers can have destructive or defensive effects, substantially aiming at the direct erosion of the bearing structure of the tower or acting in a more subtle way (but less effective at the moment), for example by distracting humans from their work by slowing down the construction works or raising their moral. The effect of the powers (fireballs, tidal waves and so on) can be more or less powerful depending on the type and be characterized by a more or less wide range of effect, but what to keep in mind is the need not to repeatedly hitting humans directly, as this will anger the faithful and consequently make them work harder as well as charge the power bar more slowly. This feature would impose a continuous and accurate dosage of brute force as well as a particular attention in the placement of the pointer, but to tell the truth, the effects of repeatedly hitting humans are rather mild and only after several errors do you reach crisis situations due to anger growing number of faithful, therefore from this point of view the challenge, at least for most of the levels, does not prove to be suitably calibrated. Humans for their part are divided into several categories: builders, supervisors, transporters, blacksmiths, clerics and champions, each with its own specific characteristics, generally related to the role that each one assumes in the construction of the tower but each one also endowed with particular effects on the others, such as the supervisors who incite work or the clerics who, in their ~dark~ versions ~, they incite the builders to anger against the deities. It is a well-planned stratification but which often does not fully achieve the intent of creating a coherent and truly influential ecosystem on the dynamics of the game, still managing to vary the basic action somewhat. A strange world The particular cartoonish graphic characterization chosen by the developers manages to dilute the atmosphere by creating an ironic and playful game environment, populated by caricatured little men and twisted and very unrealistic architectural structures. Stylistically, the work carried out by Artefacts is impeccable, although a certain austerity in the polygonal modeling and in the quality of the textures is quite evident from the first minutes of the game. It is true that we are dealing with a product developed under a budget regime in terms of production, but it is also true that the quota of 1500 Wii Points definitely brings it closer to the retail price range, with consequent expectations from the presentation point of view. In any case, the bizarre shapes of the little creatures and the hilarious animations manage to build a rather convincing setting, despite the inexorable repetition of the same structural elements, always finding ourselves acting inside a tower anyway. Little to record in terms of audio, with somewhat anonymous music and sound effects that perform their duty without infamy or praise, even if they too fall into the particular humorous atmosphere that characterizes the whole game. In addition to the main mode, there is free play, which allows you to build your own scenarios in which to act, and multiplayer, which can only be used in presence and not online. In this case we find ourselves ~managing~ a tower parallel to another player, trying to outrun him in destroying the building or simply delaying the breakthrough of his own portal as much as possible, an event which determines the defeat and automatically the victory of the player. 'other. Furthermore, by advancing in the story mode, it is possible to unlock some additional ~challenges~ in which we are asked to achieve particular objectives, always within the same game context.", "date": "2010-10-20", "grade": "6.5"}
