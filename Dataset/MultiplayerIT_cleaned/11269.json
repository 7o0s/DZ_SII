{"name": "Soul Calibur IV - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-calibur-iv-recensione.html", "text": "Up and down the tower In addition to the classic arcade mode, useful for accumulating the money needed to unlock all the characters, the title is enhanced by three modes that accompany the player in going beyond simply defeating opponents in sequence. Story gives each fighter a minimal narrative part: it's quite short and intense, only 5 levels, even if made up of several fights each, interspersed with some nice cutscenes that underline the epic nature of the events. Torre delle Anime, on the other hand, is a decidedly more substantial and satisfying experience, divided into an ~uphill~ part and a ~downhill~ part. In the first, alone or in a tag team, the player must defeat a series of enemies, both part of the original roster and created ad hoc with the powerful editor. The latter, not only differently dressed copies of the original prototypes, but are an example of the variety that can be achieved by working carefully in the character creation mode. Everyone has weapons, armor and above all special skills. Knowing how to understand the characteristics of each of them is therefore necessary. Going up the floor, and winning according to the conditions that are listed from time to time, objects and equipment are unlocked, to be used to modify the character in use or to build one from scratch. The descent, on the other hand, not practicable immediately, as in a sort of survival mode, requires the chosen pair of fighters to overcome entire floors practically without stopping, and only when one of the two is ~put on the bench~ does he have the possibility of recovering the lost energy. Here too, you can unlock items and equipment. The real gem of Soul Calibur IV, however, is the powerful editor available to the player: it is possible to create your own fighter from scratch or modify all the characteristics of existing ones. the more you play with the same fighter, the sooner you unlock the accessory skills to shape your hero Up and down the tower We are not just talking about aesthetic embellishments, every single piece of armor, shoulder pad, helmet, mask or shoe, if you prefer, modifies, as if you were playing a (mild) role-playing game, the attack, defense and energy statistics of the fighter. In addition, you can also add special features that heavily modify the style of play. Those who particularly suffer from opponents who make use of catches and throws can activate a skill that blocks this type of attack, or those who prefer a decidedly offensive tactic can insert a skill in their stats that guarantees additional damage for missed blocked hits . The almost ~role-playing~ desire of the new Namco Bandai title is confirmed by the progression of the character statistics: the more you play with the same fighter, the sooner you unlock the accessory skills to shape your hero. Obviously any character modified or created from scratch can be used in all game modes, offline and online, single or versus. To top it all off, in addition to training and the museum, where you can buy and see movies, artworks, images and promotional material, we find competitive, local and online modes. Both offer the possibility of playing with the standard characters or with the modified ones, activating or deactivating the equipment and weapon powers. As per practice, then playing online we are asked whether to play ranked or non-ranked matches; the integrated friends list is also very welcome. Part manga, part science fiction After this substantial presentation of the game modes of Soul Calibur IV it is right to say a few words about how much new the title offers in terms of new characters and attacks. In addition to the 24 classic fighters, we find ~special guests~, new fighters and bonus characters. The first are Dart Vader, available on PlayStation 3, slow but endowed with interesting powers related to the Force, Yoda, playable only on Xbox 360, virtually free from projections and decidedly gymnastic and the Apprentice, protagonist of the Force Unleashed, very fast and capable to throw arrows. The Force, which could unbalance the fights between lightning strikes, force pushes, force pulls and various strangulations, cannot always be used ~lightly~: it consumes a special bar which, once depleted, will cause these special attacks to start directly absorb the character's life bar. The new arrivals are the splendid, not only from a technical point of view, Hilde, with parade armor, sword and spear and Algol, the final boss, a floating giant equipped with ranged attacks, spiked armor and teleportation. The more typical manga taste is catered for with bonus characters, iero five fighters graceful, cute and well-mannered, but at the same time devastating and lethal. For example, the most negatively characterized, i.e. the most stereotyped of the lot, is Angol Fear, a doe-eyed doll equipped with a stirrup with a huge electrified black ball at the end, while, half robot, half emo, Ashalotte hits her opponents with a kind of pointed halberd. The fighting styles used by the 5 heroines are not peculiar but refer to those of the classic characters: Shura with her two katanas fights like Cervantes, the almost elf Scheherazade instead uses foil in the same way as Amy. In terms of new moves and new gameplay implementations, Namco has introduced some interesting innovations that affect the style of play, ~punishing~ all those who prefer a wait-and-see and defensive tactic. In practice, each character is equipped with a 3-piece armor, head, torso and legs, which will break due to too many blows suffered, but above all blocked. The state of one's equipment, in addition to being visible on one's character, with body parts uncovered in the event of breakage and pieces remaining on the ground, is represented by a bar called Soul Gauge which, after being reset, can start a sort of of fatality by the opponent who instantly wins the round. For this reason Soul Calibur invites an offensive tactic, all devoted to attack, which leaves no room for fearful fighters who take refuge behind continuous parades and lightning counterattacks. The sword and honor The PlayStation version seems to be ready for a future inclusion of the trophies. In the same way as the achievements, by playing we will be informed that we have unlocked certain honors, linked, for example, to the achievement of particular objectives, such as finishing the arcade or story mode in the different difficulty levels, or linked to a certain number of attacks carried out. There are also honors obtained by collecting all the equipment and illustrations available. Do I study the opponent or push the keys at random? Precisely speaking of moves, special attacks and mileage combos, the only note (which many may not find in any case) that can be made to the title is that, as per tradition, and this new Soul Gauge only confirms it, for the player to win , especially in versus matches, the same technique present, just to mention a random title, in Virtua Fighter is not required. This does not mean that by pushing the keys at random victory is assured, but despite the myriads of shots to memorize and the tendency to specialize the chosen character, the game rewards the player right away, guaranteeing a learning curve and a use within everyone's reach. In short, more choreography than technique, more button mashing to put it like overseas colleagues, than an in-depth study of the opponents' weaknesses and tactics. All these additions, modes and new characters have obviously benefited from a graphic design of absolute excellence. The game does not skimp on special effects in profusion, with the rotation of weapons framed by lights, flashes and flashes as per tradition. Animations, polygonal modeling and applied textures continue to be the best a match fighting game can offer. All characters, without any distinction between created from scratch, modified, new and classic have benefited from the same graphic quality. In short, the editor allows you to create wrestlers technically at the same height as those created by the developers. This tool is so powerful and well done that there are already images of characters like Snake, Kratos, Raiden and Altair on the net, very similar to their prototypes. A nice way to make up for the (justified) absences of fighters who, given the presence of Jedi knights and Japanese dolls, certainly would not have disfigured. Even the backdrops, animated and destructible in some parts, are well made and varied, an extra touch of class in a high quality sector. For console war lovers the 360 and PlayStation 3 versions are virtually identical both from a technical point of view and from that of online play, with games that do not seem to suffer from lag problems. The only advantage of the Sony console is the ability to install the game, resulting in reduced loading times. Comment Soul Calibur IV is an intense, fast, frantic and fun gaming experience, capable of involving everyone, obviously starting from the historical lovers of the series up to those who face the saga of the two swords for the first time. The additional modes and the powerful and flexible editor at your disposal are well thought out implementations, which greatly extend the longevity of the title. Also, as usual, the cosmetics are always at the top. The only comment that can be made to such a title is the ease in performing the (many) special moves and attacks, which often manages to put ~geeks~ and expert and capable players on the same level. you know, it is part of the long tradition of the Namco title. Pros Excellent graphics Usable at all levels Great variety and completeness in the game modes Cons Not very technical", "date": "2008-08-04", "grade": null}
