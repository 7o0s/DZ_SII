{"name": "The Shadow of Zorro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-shadow-of-zorro.html", "text": "The game First I would like to underline a couple of points that will keep you glued to the monitor for a couple of hours. The graphical aspect of the game is overall good. As you should see from the screenshots you can see how Zorro's model is really well done, while those of the few secondary characters are decidedly less cared for (too bad). The animations are well done and during the duels the camera moves suggesting cinematic cuts that are very reminiscent of those we had already seen in the cinema or on television. But what is the game all about? As Zorro you will have to go around and carry out your mission (which changes from time to time, as the story progresses) and deal with enemies in different ways. You will be able to face the missions in stealth mode (the thief to be clear) or fight with the sword (which will be necessary very often throughout the game). The player's skill during duels will consist only in repeating the pressure of certain keys, following the instantaneous instructions provided on the screen. Fun at the beginning, more and more difficult as the levels progress, but honestly the freedom left to the player during these duels is almost nothing. Duels are decided by your reflexes in pressing the right combination of keys. When the fun ends and boredom sets in This will be fun for a couple of hours, but after that you will start to get tired of endlessly repeating the same duels, characterized by the same animations and sounds. If we then add the fact that all the enemies, after being defeated in a duel, do not die, but are only stunned, and then return to their feet after about twenty seconds, it will be possible to understand how ~Zorro~ can quickly become a boring game . A real shame, thinking that if the duels had been implemented in a more fun way, the game would have really gained a lot. Another weak point is the management of the camera: I've never been a great lover of third person games (style ~lara croft~ to be clear). In Zorro the camera stays over your character's shoulders, spinning a bit haphazardly and moving to pre-set positions in particular situations. The camera can be turned with the mouse, but the result is inaccurate and most of the time better to leave the mouse alone. The result of all this is that you will move with a little effort and it will not be immediate to understand the structure of the place where you are. Taking into account that during the game you will have to recover numerous objects, the unsatisfactory management of the camera could hide useful objects from you, and therefore you could get stuck without knowing what you are missing and above all where it is. Sin. However, the game cannot be said to be a failure; the plot is very intriguing, the characterization of Zorro is successful and for a couple of hours you will have fun dueling and trying to overcome the missions. After the first few hours you could scancarvi or you could continue to play with the same initial enthusiasm (I'm bored). Greater care in the making of the game and a richer game concept would certainly have helped. Sin. I remind you that there is a playable demo of about sixty megs, by playing which you can get an even more precise idea of what kind of game Zorro is. Zorro, who is this? I've never been a big fan of the saga of this masked hero, but I can't hide the curiosity I had in trying this game, even for the simple fact that it's the first time that Zorro has appeared on our monitors (or at least on mine). Not everyone knows that the creator of the original novel, entitled The Curse of Capistrano, is Johnsyon McCulley who presented it to the general public in 1919 in All Story magazine. The story is set around 1820 and tells the adventures of some young rebels who terrorize the rulers of the old California, at the time still a border colony of Spain. In 1920, almost a century later, Douglas Fairbanks was fascinated by the story and, buying the film rights, made the film The Mark of Zorro, critical acclaim and achieved great success. Year after year films, television series are produced, up to the last cinematic chapter with Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins.And here we are, evolution has run its course and Zorro has also managed to land in the gaming world.", "date": "2002-02-02", "grade": null}
