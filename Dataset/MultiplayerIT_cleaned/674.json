{"name": "Bubble Bobble Revolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bubble-bobble-revolution.html", "text": "That's the way I like it As previously mentioned, bubble bobble is a puzzle game that has a structure that is both simple and intriguing, the absolute protagonists of the series are the two little dragons, green and blue, who, armed only with bubbles, will have to emerge unscathed from the hundred levels (the generation from from which it comes is felt in the dosage of difficulty: the higher the level, the greater the difficulty, the complexity of the schemes and the AI of the enemies) of the game to arrive at the fateful final battle and be able to watch the triumphant end credits with ill-concealed satisfaction. The aim of the game therefore remains to make all the on-screen enemies disappear in the shortest possible time to move on to the next level; in case of excessive slowness on the part of the player, it will be possible to witness a progressive wickedness of the enemies, made faster and more lethal by the rapid pace of time. Each bottled and killed enemy will reveal a bonus item useful for replenishing the coffers of your score; in particular cases, in addition to the common bonuses, a series of letters will appear on the screen which, if taken in the right sequence, can form useful words to earn more money, or simply an extra life. New worlds Going specifically, in this chapter for Ds, you will have the opportunity to try your hand at two different modes: the first, called ~classic~ immediately gives a fairly clear idea of the contents and will allow the player to play the very first chapter of the saga, the game on which half the gaming world has lost hours, sweat and money in order to succeed in the attempt to come out better than friends; the second mode, ~New Age~, presents bubble bobble in a more modern guise (unfortunately compared only to that of 1986) and starting from the foundations of the progenitor it widens the gameplay in various directions. In this mode the bubbles present will be of different types, depending on the color they will have different resistance and effects, it will be possible to use super bubbles (which you can load by continuously pressing B) and remain trapped in them if you shoot directly against a wall to create a confusing tool of destruction, some bubbles will also have a meteorological element that will slightly modify the approach to the level, finally the ghost bubbles will be useful for reaching inaccessible points (perhaps because they are closed on all four sides) using a sort of teleportation. Trying to expand the basic concept of Bubble bobble with this series of tricks and additions, what emerges is a rather confusing game, not fixed on pre-established mechanics and which leaves the player too much freedom as regards strategic choices. The game therefore ends up stagnating in a limbo of boredom and monotony with levels that follow one another in rapid succession leaving nothing in terms of gaming experience. One of the problems that afflicts the game is the absence of a tutorial in the New Age mode: often new game mechanics are inserted without being explained in the slightest, everything boils down to a rambling search for the still unused button to find a way to get out of trouble; the only real way to learn how to play the new mode is to read the instruction booklet and it is a pity to think of how little it would have taken to insert a brief introduction to the new features. The strengths of the ds are not touched in the slightest: the double screen serves just to expand the playing area and to have the possibility of following the action in a slightly larger format, the stylus has the only function of selecting the modalities and the number of missions to face. Another not very usable aspect of the game is represented by the multiplayer (both of the classic and new age versions) which requires the player to find another person with the game in order to play a doubles match, the choice not to insert any download mode leaves a little perplexed also because the multiplayer could have partially revived the fate of the game. New worlds Sound and graphics do not live on better praise than the game itself and there is little left to say: the first is reduced to a simple reproposition and remix of the themes of the series (reproposition in the classic version, remix of the main theme in the new age version) and graphically , deliberately and rightly ignoring the first chapter, in some places the final result disfigures even compared to the bitmaps used as background in the first puzzle bubble on snes. In conclusion, en passant, a thought to the art direction of the European packaging: in cases like this, perhaps it is better to remain faithful to the artwork of the original series, because if the result of innovation is what we now find ourselves forr hands then let's hope that being retrograde will come back into fashion. A bitter disappointment, this remains after playing Bubble Revolution: uninspired, innovated in the wrong direction and distorted even in the few fixed points of the series. If we add to this a bad graphic design and a non-existent sound sector, the result is a product that owes a large part of its vote to the presence of that small masterpiece Taito dated '86; too little for a game that appears alongside the words ~Bubble Bobble~ and ~Revolution~. Unfortunately, it gives little hope that the upcoming ~Revolution~ chapters (for Nintendo DS, of course) of Rainbow Island and New Zealand Story, two cornerstones of the videogame industry, will be heralded to the rooftops in the booklet. We just have to wait and hope, wait and hope. Pros: you can play the first Bubble Bobble Cons: the new age mode complicates a game that used to be nice because simple multiplayer prohibitive DS features completely unused Art direction unwatchable In 1986 was born from the brilliant mind of Fukio Mitsuji, an employee of Taito, a strange puzzle game starring the two dragons Bub and Bob. The name of the game comes from the combination of the names of the two characters with the word 'bubble' which in English means bubble and refers directly to the main (and only) weapon that the two protagonists had at their disposal: the infinite production of bubbles from mouth, useful for trapping enemies and getting the better of them. Since that time, now almost twenty years away, Bubble Bobble, while not changing the basic stylistic features of the series, has been repeatedly re-proposed both in remixed and original versions on the many consoles that have followed since then and since the era of super nintendo in parallel, it also carries on the ~spin-off~ series puzzle bubble, a puzzle winner of successes especially in the female world. As punctual as the bills, for a new console that comes out, the ~new~ bubble bobble knocks on the door of the market, all that remains is to look at what dress it will be wearing on the Nintendo DS.", "date": "2005-12-23", "grade": null}
