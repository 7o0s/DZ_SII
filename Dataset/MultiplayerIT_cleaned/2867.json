Not only that: it can have it with Super Mario as the protagonist. And finally, come on: you don't even need to invent a completely new game from scratch, but simply take that Super Mario Bros. out of the hat for the umpteenth time, which at the time, first among the first, marked the history of the genre. But does this Battle Royale really work with 35 Super Marios on screen at the same time? And for how many hours is it able to entertain before getting bored? Let's try to analyze the situation well, since we spent several hours in the company of Koopas, ringing coins and damn stubborn opponents. How to play: Super Mario is a Battle Royale! How to play Super Mario Bros. 35? This is the first question the player asks himself (we also asked ourselves it in the preview), because actually Nintendo users are not used to similar experiences (not on Nintendo Switch and not for those who have always played Super Mario) and the first screens, as effective as they are sparse, arouse surprise. There are just two items highlighted, above, that welcome the newcomers: Challenge to 35 and Special challenge. 35-In-Trial is actually the main mode, and in most cases it will also be the only one you'll play. The aim is soon said, and sums up the entire production: thirty-five players, at the same time, face the same game of Super Mario Bros. They are gradually eliminated, and in the end only one remains standing, who is proclaimed the winner ; finally a ranking is drawn up with all the placements. A real Battle Royale experience therefore, pure and simple. Proceeding within the level, the player faces what, however, is only apparently the classic Super Mario Bros. He soon realizes that some enemies are gray and shouldn't normally be part of his path, or of that particular world. Why am I there then? Because some other participant in the Battle Royale challenge sent them to him. In fact, the eliminated enemies end up in the levels of the others present, and serve to hinder them or, better still, to eliminate them permanently from the game. Time and Coins At any time the Super Mario Bros. 35 player can see the levels of all the other participants on the screen, greatly reduced: in this way he knows who is ahead, who is about to be eliminated, or simply in which world a given opponent. It is really impossible, in truth, to keep everything in mind, absolutely everything, at the same time: in most cases this results in a chaotic experience or in sources of distraction, therefore it is advisable to focus on your game and that's it. In addition to the enemies to be eliminated, which are thus sent to the opponents, the two fundamental game elements of Super Mario Bros. 35 are Time and Coins. The first is obviously the timer at the top right of the screen: if it drops to zero it's game over, just like falling off a cliff or being hit by a Goomba. It is therefore not possible to resort to the trick that you may have already thought of: ~ah, I will stay still, so everyone will be eliminated and I will be the only one left standing~. To win in Super Mario Bros. 35 you have to be fast, precise, eliminating all enemies and collecting as many coins as possible. Coins, in fact: why should you collect as many as possible? Simply said: during the game, in exchange for twenty coins you can request a random power up. Considering that the speed of the whole experience is remarkable, a boost at the right time can save just an instant before elimination: for example a flower of fire, truly essential to immediately kill enemies. But even the star obviously saves a lot of time, and to get rid of anything that stands in our way. The coins can also be used to buy a very specific power up (therefore not random, this time) before entering the game. It is not mandatory, but it certainly allows you to start playing with an advantage. Special challenge and training The Special Challenge is the second main offer of Super Mario Bros. 35: while in Challenge 35 the player can vote for their favorite level and choose power-ups at the start of the game, in Special Challenge, random levels are proposed, which change continuously. Furthermore, each match provides participants with 100 coins to spend: it will be up to you to choose whether to exploit them all immediately or to keep them for the first useful opportunity. Finally, the presence of the Training mode is more than appreciatedSkilled: Here you can replay Super Mario Bros. levels that have already been unlocked up to that point. In fact, therefore, Super Mario Bros. 35 also includes a free copy of the latter, although not immediately accessible in all its possibilities. Progression and some doubts The progression of Super Mario Bros. 35 consists of the Grade system, but there aren't actually many stimuli that lead to maintaining interest for more than a handful of hours. That's unless the game immediately draws you in like a magnet, despite content that ultimately remains unchanged for long periods of time; the Battle Royale, moreover, have shown that they can work for very long periods even with little material (quantitatively speaking) available. But if you need stimuli and objects to unlock, here, Super Mario Bros. 35 does not have too many. In fact, it just doesn't have any. By playing and replaying you will unlock new levels, and by accumulating coins you will rise in rank. The Ranks are mainly used to be shown online to opponents, but sometimes they allow you to unlock icons with which to customize your profile. And given that icons must also be shown online, if you think about it, it's a bit the same thing after all. You cannot invite friends to your online game and there is no local multiplayer: these are fairly serious shortcomings for a title of this type.", "date": "2020-10-03", "grade": "7.5"}
