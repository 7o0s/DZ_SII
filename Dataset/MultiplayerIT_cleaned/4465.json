Noire, one of the few titles made by Rockstar but not developed internally by the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption software house. A video game with enormous ambitions, on which the fortunes and problems of an entire development studio were based: Team Bondi. Unfortunately, the outcome was not the best and the long construction times, combined with the enormous production costs linked to the motion capture technologies developed and put in place for the occasion, condemned the company to bankruptcy despite the game having sold a good amount of copies, easily exceeding six million units according to numerous reports: too few by Rockstar standards. Several years after that release and with another generation of consoles on the market, the Houser brothers' company has however chosen to try again by bringing both a remastered and a special version optimized specifically for virtual reality to the market. We will talk about the latter in the review you are reading which, obviously, will focus on the characteristic elements of the gameplay in VR, assuming that you know what L.A. is. Noire or referring you < ahref=~https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/191339-la-noire-prova-schiacciante-la-recensione-di-la-noire.html~>to the recent review of the remastered of the original game. It starts from the bottom... Let's start immediately by saying that L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files is not an unpublished stand-alone adventure but is a sort of conversion of a part of the original game. To be exact, seven cases of the twenty-one included in the title created by Team Bondi, plus a tutorial created ad hoc to help the player become familiar with the new commands and original interactions connected to virtual reality. Once the latter and the first mission have been completed, all the others will be immediately unlocked and can be tackled in the order we prefer, for a total of about 6 hours of gameplay. In concrete terms there is nothing really new compared to what we have already experienced at the time, but on a structural level the gameplay has been completely redesigned to meet your favorite helmet and dedicated controllers. In the role of Cole Phelps, the policeman protagonist of the game, as well as our avatar, we will therefore find ourselves investigating the underworld of Los Angeles in the 40s by facing up to four different contexts for each of the cases to be solved. THERE. Noire offers a very large part of the Californian metropolis reconstructed for the occasion with historical accuracy and entirely navigable in free roaming using police vehicles. In fact, it is possible to get on board a car at any time and wander around the city streets interacting not only with the steering wheel and with the accelerator and brakes, cunningly controlled through the triggers of the VIVE 3D controllers, but also with a large part of the dashboard and of the elements that characterize the passenger compartment, simply by waving your hands and simulating the closure of your fingers. In fact, the controls provide for the simultaneous use of the triggers and the side buttons of the pads to independently open and tighten the thumb and forefinger or the remaining three fingers of each hand so as to be able to carry out different grips or close it into a fist. All interactions are physical and therefore, for example, it will be enough to ~beat~ the horn with the palm of the hand to sound it, or move the handbrake lever or even open and close windows and doors, all in a very believable and realistic way. It is therefore a pity that, concretely, there is no real utility in going around Los Angeles except to reach the locations of the missions, an action that can also be accelerated through a convenient ~Warp~ button present near the mirror rearview. The city is in fact devoid of points of interest with which to interact and driving remains an essential activity to the mere movement between waypoints. The other possibility of interaction is given by the shootings that are activated in specific phases of the game. It is not possible, so to speak, to take out the weapon of order when you want, but it is necessary to wait for dedicated moments justified by the narrative evolution of the case that is being followed. As has already happened with many other virtual reality titles, the shooting phase is the one that seems to work best. In L.A. Noire you will be able to manage the covers through a semi-automatic system that will allow us to look at the point where to position Phelps and push the d-pad to get him to his destination without any risk of being hit. Once in place we will have to physically lean and crouch to get out at the right time and shoot, avoiding pecking at someone.he bullet. The weapons available are very few and depend on the mission but their management is very realistic with the shotgun, for example, which must be manually loaded after firing each shot and also requires the insertion of individual cartridges once the ammunition has run out present in the barrel. We feel like doing a similar discourse for punch fights: they require a little physical effort but are very satisfying in their dodging and blow dynamics to be landed by exploiting the openings in the opponent's guard. ...and you get to the top quickly Usually after the driving phase and a possible shooting, we will have to analyze the scenario in search of useful clues for the interrogation. In this ~adventure~ phase we will have to move Phelps around the environment, collect objects and rotate them to observe them in every detail. Also in this case we note the exceptional physical management of the virtual hands that move in space hitting furnishings and furnishings and also allow for advanced interactions such as opening a letter or undressing a corpse. Where instead L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files struggles to be playable in a natural way it is in the management of movements, also these cross and delight of every virtual reality video game. On the one hand, we must appreciate Rockstar's effort in offering three different movement possibilities, all of which can be used simultaneously, without having to go through an options screen to change them. We can move by observing a point of interest highlighted in yellow (most of the scenarios have been redesigned to implement these interactive elements) and pressing the d-pad, or we can press the touch surface of the 3D Controllers twice to bring up a small crosshair in overlay manageable with the look to decide the destination of Phelps via a further press of the d-pad. Finally we can use a sort of simulated movement, holding down the usual touch surface, bringing both arms along the body and waving them back and forth exactly like when walking or running. The latter possibility is, although the most realistic, also the most tiring and the one most capable of arousing motion sickness and, for this reason, as beautiful to try as it is very quick to abandon. And finally we come to the interrogations, a key element of Rockstar production. Compared to the base game, they have been significantly simplified in the management of dialogues since now, in response to the statements of the suspect, we can only have a good or bad cop attitude or proceed with the accusation to be connected to one of the clues collected at the crime scene . Basically, however, the exact same procedure remains that made L.A. well known. Noire at the time of its release: our goal will be to ask all possible questions to the questioned person, using the notes collected in our notebook, also completely recreated in 3D and even ~scribbleable~ with the pencil held in Phelps' hand. By doing so we will be able to study the facial expressions and the emotions of the suspect so as to be able to distinguish lies and truth and arrive at determining the real culprit of the case under investigation. And here lurks the main criticism that we feel like making to this VR edition of the original Team Bondi title: the lack of the entire narrative structure of the game forces us to follow cases that all seem unrelated to each other and in which there is often very difficult to create empathy with the characters present making it really difficult to correctly analyze the situation. We will therefore find ourselves catapulted around Los Angeles, sometimes without perceiving the logical connections, to follow self-conclusive cases where the very evolution of Cole Phelps' career and personality will be completely independent of our work. Still up to date From a technical point of view L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files is still in excellent shape and justifies the high system requirements inherent in all the VR experiences that we recently happened to play on PC. The indoor environments are excellently detailed and contrast properly with the very low polygonal mass of the outdoor scenarios which show all their approximation especially during car chases. On the other hand, the management of anti-aliasing is excellent also thanks to the numerous graphic options present in this sense: we have rarely seen other productions for virtual reality so clean in the open field. Equally exceptional are the models of all the characters who maintain the quality of the facial motion capture unchanged even if the point dThe close view sometimes makes the key frames of passage from one expression to the next more evident with a strange morphing effect. The game offers a pleasant soundtrack in theme with the historical setting while the voice acting, available exclusively in English, continues to be exceptional like all Rockstar productions. It is important to point out at this juncture that the game offers subtitles in our language but their positioning in a virtual environment makes them in some situations, especially when superimposed on the characters or some elements of the scenario, really very difficult to read because they are almost impossible to focus. Finally, keep in mind that the title cannot be played in small rooms since it requires a space of at least two meters by two meters to be used with HTC Vive, in a whole room configuration.", "date": "2018-01-03", "grade": "8.0"}
