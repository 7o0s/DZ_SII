Because that's what point-and-click adventures do: they tell stories. And this time they do it on the double screen of the DS, bringing the genre to a portable console for the first time, if we want to exclude the titles  la Hotel Dusk or Another Code. For the first time, we said, the classic adventures arrive on DS, those which until now have been the prerogative, if not exclusively, of PCs. In reality it is, this time, a story that wants to be told again. We are in fact talking about the conversion of the game that we have already seen on PC: Secret Files Tunguska, naturally revised in the technical sector to adapt to the dual screen of the Nintendo portable console and somewhat simplified in its contents. With a result that somehow displaces, because it presents us with a product that, while not enjoying particular innovations or captivating storytelling systems to gain our interest, manages instead to tickle the strings of nostalgia for those who still regret the Lucas Arts home adventures. Comment Secret Files Tunguska brings European-style point-and-click adventure titles to the DS for the first time. An excellent reason to be grateful to him, considering that the result seems really good to us, especially for those nostalgic for the old PC adventures, whose style is traced in this conversion precisely from the home platform par excellence. The DS naturally accommodates the genre, the use of the stylus on the touch screen is more than ever adequate for the development of the game, its puzzles, the combinations of objects present in the menu and collected in the various settings proposed. Despite an appreciable graphic sector and a generally very successful technical realization, Secret Files Tunguska sins, in an incisive way, precisely in the narrative sector, unfortunately not an indifferent defect for a title of the genre to which it belongs. Pros Good technical realization Excellent management of objects and puzzles Nostalgic and well-crafted graphic section Cons Fragmented and incoherent narration Lack of involvement in the story Dust and artifacts The game presents us with slightly retro graphics, with the first settings that can be visited which could not help but make us think of museums with atmospheres dear to a more famous Doctor Jones and his adventures. The nib beautifully serves a very natural ~point and click~ function, giving a new meaning to the genre and making us think that we are probably facing the ideal console for this narrative genre. Sacrificing a little graphics, of course, which must necessarily give up the settings and the detail achieved on PC. The graphics are not everything, some would say, especially if they still manage to be pleasant and studied in such a way as to be of excellent service for the purpose of the game itself, allowing sufficient visual involvement and maintaining a good balance, on the two screens of the portable, among various game elements. The spaces dedicated to menus, objects and all the possible interactions foreseen by the game are designed in such a way as to leave enough breathing space without however giving in to menu and sub-menu systems in favor of greater visibility on the screen. The result is that we have everything there, at hand and pen, without having any feeling of confusion or overabundance of details. The collection, exploration and interaction is so easy and immediate and it is practically impossible to find ourselves repeating actions already carried out only due to the loss of logical thread between the various actions. Is it the story or the one who tells it? The biggest problem the game suffers from, unfortunately, is the plot. The narrative is in fact fragmentary and almost gives the idea that pieces of dialogue have been cut to streamline the game, leaving us wondering what happened, what brought us to the point where we are. The result is far from pleasant, as you can imagine, leaving us with the feeling that the story, rather than being the protagonist, is actually almost a completely incidental justification that allows the player to extricate himself between exploration, collection, puzzles and puzzles. Well done, technically very usable, but certainly not the fulcrum of an adventure that should make the narrative its central pillar. The identification, the involvement in the game is thus lacking, not being supported by a graphic and sound sector capable of making up for this lack, leading us to move forward in an almost mechanical way. A missed opportunity, which has the advantage of having shown us how the genre fits well on the Nintendo portable platform and that, if it had been taken care of in its pnarrative art in a better way, would certainly have had a much greater value than what we are able to attribute to it here. We hope that his legacy will be collected and that this is just the beginning of establishing a genre on a platform that has shown that it knows how to welcome it in an excellent way. Ka-Boom Secret Files: Tunguska, in this DS version, leads us to experience, with different tools, the same story as the ~mother~ version for PC. Nina, the young protagonist of the game, will have to reconstruct step by step the events that led to her father's disappearance from his office in the museum where he works. Alternating with a younger colleague of the deceased scientist, Nina will follow in his footsteps on a long journey that will virtually touch different corners of our planet, while slowly the pieces of a mysterious and devastating explosion in the Siberian Tunguska steppes, of at least 10 or 15 megatons, i.e. incredibly more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb which has now set a measurement standard, are reconstructed. Explosion dating back to the beginning of the last century, the causes of which are part of the Tunguska mystery.", "date": "2008-04-24", "grade": null}
