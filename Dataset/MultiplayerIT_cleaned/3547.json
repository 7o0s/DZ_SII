{"name": "RAD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rad-roguelike-recensione.html", "text": "Not all Double Fine titles end up in the spotlight, and it's a shame because Tim Schafer's software house (the genius to whom we owe a thousand Lucas masterpieces, for the few who don't know it) has been able to explore completely different genres, such as the platform Psychonauts (of which an imminent sequel is expected), the action Brutal Legend, the tower defense Iron Brigade and the turn-based strategy Massive Chalice, always bringing out products of high caliber. With RAD, the Yankee developer decides to take the ~roguelike~ route. These are the kind of games characterized, fundamentally, by the permanent death of the protagonist and by randomly generated maps. The definition would also include the presence of shifts, but in our case the action takes place in real time, being a fast-paced isometric hack & slash. There are two game modes: the ~competitive~ one, in which the score is published in an online ranking, and the traditional one. There are ten selectable characters (although some initially locked) who differ only in aesthetics, as they all share a single starting weapon: it is an ~overclocked~ baseball bat that returns to base camp after each death of the protagonist, so that it can be challenged by the new candidates to save the world. Here is the plot (do you really want to know it?) in two lines: at a certain point in the eighties there was a nuclear holocaust and the survivors managed to organize themselves by adopting purifiers; after centuries something went wrong again and the planet is back RAdioactive. It's up to a teenager to restart the machinery that allows mankind to survive by eliminating the evil creatures that guard it. Monsters may be defeated, but not radiation: prolonged contact with toxic substances modifies the protagonist, adding appendages that make him stronger, more agile or more resistant. The sharp humor, trademark of Double Fine, is also very present in this production and is not limited to the pleasant expressions of the NPCs, but is infused into the very essence of RAD, so much so that one of the moments that one most eagerly awaits is the one, conceptually dramatic, in which the boy becomes a man/monster. What am I turning into today? The base camp, from which you start every time, is a hub where you can return to deposit the collected loot (in the form of cassette tapes and 5'25 floppy disks) with which to buy upgrades for one-off use. These are the only elements that can be recovered from a previous game, while everything else, once dead, resets. The typical structure of the map involves the activation of two or three light towers that open a central bunker inside which there is a boss to be killed. Often and willingly there will be a need to descend into some dungeon to reach otherwise inaccessible points; inside the labyrinth, however, there is not only the ~right~ path, but also a series of other rooms with mini-bosses that are practically essential for grinding. The character, initially equipped only with a baseball bat, gains experience by eliminating monsters; each level increase corresponds to a genetic mutation that provides different abilities from time to time. It can therefore happen to develop a super-brain and to be able to ~spit~ energy globes, or to transform the trunk of the body with poisonous spines, or even to find ~bouncing~ shoes or companions that provide a hand with the enemies. There is no pre-established scheme and with each new game different attacks are discovered which consequently also involve different fighting techniques. In addition to experience, the arsenal can be improved by visiting temples, or by purchasing items from bizarre merchants placed in strategic points. However, thinking of getting right to fighting is not the right approach to enjoy the title of Double Fine. Each level is full of objects to be destroyed inside which very useful power-ups or coins can be hidden, so it deserves to be analyzed with attention that at first would not seem necessary. Empty supermarkets RAD is a difficult game, often hovering between challenge and frustration. Exploration (the use of a joypad is strongly recommended) hides, of its own, pitfalls at every corner. Do you put your feet in a radioactive puddle? Pete of life. An enemy, dying, explodes and sets you on fire? You lose life. Do you miss a jump and end up down a ravine? You lose a lot of life. Not to mention the danger of monsters, especially the final bosses, faster and faster and with a shield bar that stretchesmap by map. Of course, health can be restored with drinks and steaks, a pity that the loot is rather stingy, with the result that even the most trivial duel can turn, from a perspective, into a death sentence. The fact that there is no possibility to customize the difficulty does not help. The combat system is frenetic and immediate, but with that pinch of tactics that makes it, as overseas colleagues would say, addictive. In addition to the primary attack (with the mace), there are two secondary ones determined by genetic mutations, as well as a series of passive bonuses. The parry is missing, the absence of which is compensated for by the evasive somersault and jumps. Above all, there is the need to constantly adapt the style according to the upgrades unlocked since, as previously pointed out, they are absolutely random. The best years The style of RAD is a cross between Bastion, Day Of The Tentacle and Far Cry: Blood Dragon. Double Fine winks at the eighties, but seems to do it more with the design of the menus and characters than with the characterization of the maps, whose settings reminded us of those of Borderlands. The variety is good even with the limits that the procedural structure carries with it, which ends up making the morphology of the levels conceptually standardized. We found the cel shading and the cartoonish style of the characters very spot on, whose cast seems to have been taken from that of the Goonies. There is no shortage of other homages to the paninari period: we will thus find cabin cruisers, CRT televisions, Walkmans and all the technological paraphernalia capable of snatching the tear of nostalgia from those sailing around forty. The isometric view is probably the most suitable for this type of game, even if in some shots you run the risk of losing your bearings. The arcade soundtrack is the classic icing on the cake of a title that was made by those who really know about video games. Too bad, however, that there is no multiplayer mode which, given the nature of RAD, would be a perfect fit. Among the technical flaws we point out the slow uploads complained of by some console users, while our reference PC had no problems at a 2K resolution.", "date": "2019-08-17", "grade": "7.2"}
