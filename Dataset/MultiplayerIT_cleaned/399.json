{"name": "Dragon Ball Shin Budokai", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-shin-budokai.html", "text": "Mythology The game is aimed primarily at Dragonball fans, presenting characters and events related to the infamous ~Z~ series, or that particular period of time which -in history- runs from the birth of Son Goku's son, Gohan, to the conclusion of the Dragonball saga. Majin Buu. Knowledge of a minimum of plot is useful to make the most of the game and to get caught up in the stories of the characters. The game offers several modes that can keep even the most tenacious gamer busy for a long time: the main mode of the entire game is the one called ~dragon path~ where, ideally running on the infamous dragon path (which connects King Kaioh's house to 'hell) unfolds a series of crossroads missions based on a common story. The second game option present is the one represented by the classic Arcade, which puts the player in front of a series of fights having the sole purpose of recovering the dragon balls; depending on the character selected, it will be possible to witness particular exchanges with the opponent on duty (for example Goku against Vegeta, or Krillin against Cyborg 18), which will recall events that occurred during the comic. In training mode you can keep track of your every move, evaluating thanks to a series of statistics how the character's performance changes (both in attack and defense) by performing some particular moves; the training section will also be useful for learning how to execute the basic combinations of each character in order to be prepared in any situation. The ~Z Trials~ conclude the count of the single player modes, formed by the most classic of survival, where the only thing that will count is to continue to beat your opponents, and by the time trial which will be articulated along a series of thematic routes (in which thematic does not mean the setting, but the category of opponents such as ~goku's great enemies~ and so on ..). In addition to the single player, it will be possible to play multiplayer wirelessly via an ad hoc connection, i.e. with another opponent equipped with a PSP and a copy of the game. Fight Club The cast of characters that can be used during the game has about twenty fighters in total, taken not only from the Z series of the comics, but also from the OAVs (animes) linked to this saga such as for example the legendary Saiyan Broly and the evil Janemba. The choice of usable characters was made with intelligence, inserting only those with a certain power in the cast (forget Mr. Satan and secondary characters who try to defeat enemies infinitely more powerful than them, upsetting all the balances of the comic) . The real battles are a simplified (and certainly more functional) version of the Budokai versions already tested on Ps2, within three-dimensional arenas (unfortunately few) that retrace known places of Dragon Ball two characters collide capable of both fighting land and in flight. For hand-to-hand combat, the square and triangle buttons have been dedicated, which work in combination with the analog pad to create different moves. Melee attacks sometimes suffer from a bit of confusion due to the continuous materializations and dematerializations of the characters (which most of the time are entrusted to chance) and due to the presence of particular blows capable of momentarily stunning the opponent, often condemning him to an early end. In addition to physical attacks, it will be possible to carry out a whole series of special moves based on the character's psychic strength: to load one's Ki bar, it will be necessary to hold down the backbone L and to release it, it will be necessary to press the circle key (also in combination with a direction) by creating special attacks specific to each character and well known to those familiar with the Dragon Ball universe. In addition to the lack of settings (only five), it should also be noted the absolute lack of details which, while following a trend also used by Toryama himself, are actually made with four cross polygons that want to recall particular Dragon Ball settings such as home of the red ribbon or hell. The battles, to meet the portability of the console, are quite fast and make it difficult to get bored in the middle of the game. At the end of each meeting you will be classified according to three parameters concerning time, technique and remaining life, and depending on the degree obtained you will get a certain number of zenie, the currency necessary to purchase a series of objects from the shop present in the game options. The purchased items will not directly affect the game, but will only be used to create your own splayer card to share in multiplayer matches. Fight Club Unfortunately, a bad realization of the story overlaps the good structure of the game, with holes in the script, dialogues bordering on the impossible and jokes worthy of the worst B-movie; if Shin budokai had even one tenth of the history of dragon ball, it could definitely turn out to be one of the best Goku&co based games ever. The graphic sector works excellently, presenting a whole series of light effects at the time of special moves and collisions at the time of impact with both physical and psychic blows (a gem is the movement that gives the classic ~slap~ to the energy sphere , to then allow the player to score on his opponent). The cell defends itself well and proves once again to be the best way to represent a comic in a video game. Unfortunately nothing to report for the sound, Shin Budokai is far from the glories of 16 and 32bit, his pseudo-techno tunes get lost in the pathos of the battle; the theme used for the presentation was excellent, a pity that the soundtrack of the game did not conform to that. Shin Budokai is an excellent debut for PSP, it is certainly one of the best games based on the world of Dragon Ball but spoiled by some macroscopic defects that weigh on the evaluation of the game. Fans will definitely like it a lot, to everyone else it may seem like a strange fighting game with a bizarre story. Pros: Fun and never boring fights. Long lived. Cons: Bad story. Music and settings don't keep up with the rest. One of the fortunes of being a successful manga (or anime), is undoubtedly that of enjoying a number of videogame re-propositions in such a number as to make even the video games that boast the most sequels pale. One of these multiple champions of attendance is certainly the DragonBall saga, which was born from the pencil (and head) of Akira Toryama, has been seen passing through the hands of video game enthusiasts since the days of the super nintendo and megadrive. Since that time things have changed a lot, the video game concept for DragonBall has evolved to develop what is probably one of the most suitable styles, mixing 3D settings and cell characters. And for a new console coming out, the PSP, here's the dragonball game dedicated to it, so it's time to go back to fighting with Goku and friends in the endless quest for the dragon balls.", "date": "2006-07-26", "grade": null}
