{"name": "Fuga infinita", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167966-joan-mad-run-fuga-infinita.html", "text": "Someone may judge it excessively monotonous and commercial, but we must give the endless runner genre the merit of being extremely permeable to influences from other videogame categories. In fact, over the years we have seen platformers, racing games, action games and other types still declined according to the dictates of what has become one of the strongest currents ever in the mobile sector. Happymagenta now takes care of swelling the ranks of this group of hybrids with the present here Joan Mad Run, a product that adds a marked shooter component to the equation. Joan Mad Run is fun and well done, but with a few tweaks it would have been a great title Shoot him again, Joan In Joan Mad Run, the user is called upon to take on the role of the combative girl who gives the game its name, trying to take her as far as possible in her attempt to escape from the cell in which she is locked up. The whole is developed on a two-dimensional plane divided into three horizontal lanes that can be crossed at will by the protagonist. Following the manual of the perfect endless runner, the control system is simple, intuitive and entirely based on swipes and touches: by acting on the left side of the screen, Joan can be moved from one lane to another and change the weapon supplied, while a tap and swipe in the opposite half allow you to fire and use the melee tool respectively. As mentioned at the beginning, in fact, Joan Mad Run combines a marked shooter component with the casual mechanics that we all know by heart by now: therefore, along the way the user must not only be careful to dodge obstacles and various dangers, but he is also called to neutralize the enemies it finds in its path, with each kill guaranteeing extra points that can also be multiplied during combos. Everything works very well thanks also to Happymagenta's shrewd design choices: to begin with, the arsenal at Joan's disposal is very well stocked, and includes pistols, rifles, machine guns up to exotic weapons, to say the least, with all tools that have their own precise behavior on the battlefield. The guns also represent the main purpose of spending the coins that can be collected during the escape, indispensable both for buying new models and for unlocking upgrades for those already in your possession. Another arrow in Joan Mad Run's bow is the handful of types of opponents that appear before us, distinguished by different attack patterns that must be identified in a fraction of a second to be able to counter them effectively: an aspect that gives the title that pinch of strategy that never hurts. With an atypical choice for an endless runner, then, in the Happymagenta product the game over does not arrive immediately, but instead there is a real health indicator (which even winks at the very old Wolfenstein 3D, with the face of the protagonist who becomes increasingly bloody as she suffers damage) which can also be filled by collecting the hearts that occasionally peep out on the screen. Also noteworthy is the random appearance of power-ups that allow you to enjoy various bonuses for a few seconds such as super speed, invulnerability or infinite ammunition and which work in a very similar way to what was made famous by the illustrious Jetpack Joyride. So far we have listed all the reasons that would seem to paint Joan Mad Run as a successful mix of genres, unfortunately, however, the developers have fallen into a fairly obvious misstep that prevents the title from reaching a higher rating. The problem lies precisely in having adopted an action game-style progression model while maintaining the restart mechanics typical of endless runners: in essence, the game has well-defined scenarios even interspersed with end-of-level bosses, but if you die you have to start over from the beginning. Giving the player the opportunity to restart from a checkpoint would certainly have helped a title which, as it stands, risks getting bored a little too soon.", "date": "2016-05-11", "grade": "7.7"}
