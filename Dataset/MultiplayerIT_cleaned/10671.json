The special ~Walk with me~ activity meter, with a simple and essential style, literally follows the player step by step, silently recording his activity: every single step is signaled by a small flashing red LED, which will turn green when the goal is reached. objective proposed by the game (objectives are gradually more ~bold~ depending on the progress made). In this way, even the laziest will be awakened from their torpor and will find the inspiration to get back on track, to find out a few more details about their own pace or even just out of pure curiosity! ...no one is excluded from the burden of the walk, not even your four-legged friend (it is in fact possible to associate a pedometer to your dog and record its vital rhythm). Statistics After an intense day spent together with the activity meter, all that remains is to download the data collected on your Nintendo DS (thanks to an infrared system, the procedure is easy and immediate). The information recorded throughout the day will thus be analyzed and organized into various graphs: the ~rhythm under the microscope~ graph will thus be proposed, which will show the number of steps taken and their distribution throughout the day. Your vital rhythm will then be associated with the animal that best represents its characteristics. But it doesn't end there! In fact, with the ~Calendar~ tool it is possible to view previously obtained results, while the ~Rhythm Graphs~ will be able to provide an overview of one's vital rhythm. Personalize yourself In order to be able to identify yourself, ~Walk with me!~ proposes the creation of detailed profiles, with the use of a personal ~Mii~ (which can also be imported from any Wii console). Each character must be characterized not only by gender and age, but above all by specific physical characteristics: the face of your Mii can be personalized to the point of making it look more like yourself. Finally, to complete the creation of your alter-ego, you will need to enter your personal data, but not before choosing the right dress! Obviously, it is also possible to create a sort of Mii for your own dog, complete with size and breed! Not just graphs Although much of the game is devoted to stats about your vital rhythm, there is also a small section devoted to mini-games based on your step count. In reality, the individual mini-games are nothing more than alternative methods to charts to visualize one's vital rhythm. Thanks to the number of steps taken, it will thus be possible to illuminate a house (different light intensities for different vital rhythms) or complete a world map with different elements (different images for different number of steps). This section is very interesting if several players are registered in the game, so that heterogeneous lifestyles can be compared. Using the Wi-Fi Connection it is then possible to enter a real world ranking or, adding up all the steps, take a virtual walk in the Solar System! Rhythm issue The activity meter, while being very accurate, fails to accurately detect the number of steps in some conditions or with different trends. The big flaw of the game is that the pedometer does not carry out an exact count in all the movements extraneous to regular walking, therefore including those carried out during sporting activity: if, for example, the player passes a day of absolute tranquility, but then finds the time for a run in the fresh air, for ~Walk with me!~ it will always be ~a koala who spends his life in a tree~!!! Sporting activity isn't the only thing that doesn't reconcile perfectly with the game: even walking barefoot or in sandals could invalidate the step count, as well as placing the meter in a horizontal position.
