{"name": "L'accademia del pallone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ea-sports-football-academy-recensione.html", "text": "Very strange must have been that day in the Canadian office of EA, the one well-known for the annual iterations of FIFA, when, looking for a valid answer to the success of Brain Training and company, someone came up with the idea of making a something similar, but on the subject of football! Have you ever thought that you can also have a football IQ along with the normal one that measures gray matter? Get over it, because Football Academy will reveal yours, and will also be very strict... At school with pupils As soon as you enter the Academy, the main game mode, there will be none other than Luiz Felipe Scolari (or rather a static and digitized version of him not even very well...) to welcome you and explain the game concepts. And he will have a lot to do, because at first you won't understand anything: in an attempt to put together something much more substantial than a classic collection of minigames with a final result, the FA designers have come up with a somewhat abstruse and convoluted, but which, as we will see in a bit, ultimately works. Follow us because the thing is complicated: therefore, games with 11 cards each of which represents a player, real thanks to the FIFPro license, taken from the five championships present (Italian, English, French, Spanish and German), each with its beautiful classic characteristics (Speed, Dribbling, Shooting... the usual things in short), his role and his beautiful digitized face. The first thing to do is the IQ Test, which makes you face three of the 14 mini-games each time. These are clearly dedicated to true football fans as in addition to testing reflexes and skills, most of the time they test your knowledge of football: for example, you will have to rearrange the formation of a team, associate players with nationalities, jerseys to the championships, even proving to know the final standings of the Bundesliga 2001 edition... Even those who don't exactly live on football alone, however, after an initial period of frustration, will begin to take measurements and memorize the salient data a little better, continually reproposed throughout the game, helped by the fact that the various mini-games are still fun and well done. At the end of the test, the football IQ is calculated, which then affects the harmony of your team, and you are given a pack of six cards, with which to reinforce it. At the beginning you can only have ~Bronze~ type cards, to unlock more valuable players you have to earn a certain number of points by defeating, with your team, the teams of the top leagues of the countries mentioned above. So it's time to take the field... The ball match The actual match itself is even more strange and unusual, but endowed with a charm of its own: the match goes on beautifully for its own business (you only know where the ball is at a given moment in the playing field) until there is an action in which you intervene. But intervene in full card game style, comparing the characteristics of the players involved and making different rolls of the dice! It will be easier with an example: suppose your midfielder is in front of an opposing defender, and wants to pass him (the game decides how) with a dribble, then the ~Dribbling~ quality of your player and the ~Defense~ quality are considered of the opponent. An initial amount is then added or subtracted from these numbers which depends on the mentality that you will have given to the team during the game: in an attacking action, for example, an offensive mentality will more easily bring an advantage, but, being this a die roll, it could also hurt you. Then we consider the harmony of the teams, the fatigue reached that point of the match and finally there is the choice of the action between two possible ones, one easy and one difficult. In the case of dribbling, you can choose whether to carry out a normal one in space or try to skip the man: the difference is that, in the dice roll, the first action has a maximum value of +10 and a minimum of -5, thus representing the almost certainty of making a good play, advisable when we are already ahead of the opponent, while the second goes from +25 to -25, to be risked only in the case of a strong disadvantage in the previous calculations. Even the opponent can do the same, and in the case of a risky but successful defensive action, he will start off beautifully on the counterattack: if, on the other hand, he blocks you normally, the action ends and the game restarts as before. Finally, in case of success, the action continues for several steps until the final conclusion, where the ~Shot~ characteristics of the attacker and the ~Grip~ of the goalkeeper are confronted. TOInitially, only one team is available to face in each league, the weakest ones: the following ones are unlocked by accumulating, after the IQ tests, a certain number of player-cards for a specific team and obviously a match won against Inter or the Juve gives you more points than one against Chievo or Bologna (no offense, they decided it in EA). And the circle, in a twisted and tiring way, closes. With an appendix to ~exchange stickers~ between different players, unfortunately not usable via the Internet: multiplayer is limited to this. Return round Confused? It's normal. Over time the mechanics are understood and become clear, and the limits also emerge which, paradoxically, are precisely an extreme linearity and repetitiveness. We know that at first glance it may seem incredible, the formula manages to excite especially those who already love football, who will see with satisfaction his team improve from test to test with the acquisition of more and more champions and gradually become able to face more and more titled teams. The conduct of the match can also be exciting, with realistic results precisely because they are based on the characteristics, which we wouldn't swear but seem to be taken verbatim from FIFA, real players, and the mini-games, as already noted, are fun and well done. Yet you soon get tired of always doing the same things, always having to deal with the same elements in the mini-games and with the same actions in the matches, all without a precise goal other than to beat all the teams present and collect all the cards, like a Panini album. In all this, a technical realization does not help at all that defining ~poor~ would be an insult to all games with actually poor technical realization, which is very strange for an EA Sports game: the only moving elements are in the minigames, the rest is made up of a few dozen (in all!) of static screens that recall the old 16-color DOS games that are continually reproposed, and of faces and shirts that are real but digitized so as to make recognition difficult. And the sound? Only one music for each phase of the game, ugly and insignificant, very few effects including that of the audience, which you will always have in your ears, by far the worst. In short, a very special title, very interesting especially for a certain audience but heavily limited by major flaws. It's time for the final result...", "date": "2009-03-19", "grade": "6.6"}
