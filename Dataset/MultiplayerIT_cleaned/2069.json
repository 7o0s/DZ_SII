Tourism, under a video of the game that we had posted on social media, a person asked: ~but by any chance is it one of those mobile games in which you click to get passengers off and on?~. And we, before answering, laughed, laughed a lot. Not to make fun of the curious user, never mind, we're not the type, but because A-Train is a completely different beast. Complex and colorful The Artdink game, a Japanese software house, has existed as a series since 1985; in the West, its most dignified attempt dates back to the early 90s on PC. Its most characterizing aspect is precisely its difficulty, so nothing further from those passive games where you just need to shake your fingertips every minute to get the better of it. Here you have to learn, try, reflect, act, modify, count, while our business based on mass public transport, of which the game puts us in control, responds accordingly. In A-Train All Aboard! Tourism isn't enough to pull down a via ferrata, put the little train on it and watch it go while it chugs. Oh my God, it could be done, but it wouldn't make sense and could knock out your opponent. finances very soon. Instead, we need to work on the details, which are many, from the simplest to the most abstruse, to grab dividends that allow us to reinvest, and to allow the map to evolve dynamically based on our best choices. For a large part of its long career, A-Train presented itself to the public as a rather cold game: full of listings, numbers, aseptic but fascinating isometric graphics, soft colors. From a certain moment on, the developers understood that perhaps it was the case to reach out to the public with a slightly more friendly approach, A-Train thus enters a new cycle where the same diabolical game mechanics are merged with a softer graphic design, but without losing the peculiar style, and anime-style characters that introduce the gameplay with greater empathy. The funny thing is that often, in the two very long introductory levels, they too admit that they don't understand anything, and this helps a lot to not make us feel alone. Everyone on board! The first difficulty that emerges, as it also happens in other management software and similar builders with great emphasis on the railways, is understanding how to design them in a logical, functional way. With roads everything is simpler, but with railways it takes much more effort, especially when the lines multiply and we will have to work, for example, with several trains on the same routes, trying not to have them overlap. Slowly, along the two tutorials, A-Train All Aboard! Tourism introduces more and more aspects, some to keep an eye on, the price of land and their sale, others optional, such as the possibility of investing in other fields, then trying to manipulate the market with our transport company and its secondary effects . As in our own, because European, Transport Fever, even in A-Train roads and cities are not built directly, but these evolve dynamically based on how the player expands his business. A city not connected by means of mass transport will remain stagnant, while an ever better connected one, both with civil transport and goods, will progressively tend to grow larger, even showing off monumental buildings that will characterize its appearance and show its wealth. In contrast to Transport Fever, which was mainly open ended and with procedural maps, A-Train All Aboard! Tourism unfolds through different scenarios, each with its own peculiarities. In this Switch version there are a total of eight, but the first two have a more guided progression, and are identified as tutorials. But don't think they're a walk in the park, as you can verify for yourself through the demo on the Switch store, the first and easiest tutorial can take up to ten hours. Eight scenarios correspond to about 60/100 hours of play, depending on the level of difficulty, the skill of those in control and the very possible failures. In addition, it is possible to create new ones and exchange them online with other users, and given how much the series is loved in Japan, and how popular the Switch is, hundreds of additional very high quality scenarios could soon appear, as well as any official expansions. Portable trains Switch gets along well, at least initially, but you know how it goes with these games: as you work on a scenario, and passengers and buildings increase, performance decreases as well. Aware of this, in Artdink they have included the possibility of lowering some graphic effects or eliminating them completely, such as the depth of field, in order to scale the graphics in step with the nour matches. In our test, however, things always went quite well, and the drops did not affect the gameplay, only lengthened the pauses by activating the various functions present. Where better could have been done is in the joypad controls: playing on the TV is of course possible but it will take some time to get used to certain steps. On the other hand, the portable mode is totally different which, by allowing you to mix the classic commands with the touch screen ones, also makes it much simpler and more intuitive to interact with the simulation. It's not an easy game but the two very long tutorials do their job very well, and if doubts remain, they can always be tackled again with pleasure. The graphics are simple but damned if it's effective: style is everything and that of A-Train All Aboard! Tourism is pleasantly enveloping, warm like some old 16-bit games. The soundtrack is of excellent quality, with many different songs covering at least six genres, but you can still do without the sound, replacing it with podcasts and personal playlists shot from other devices, and that's what we often did. More generally, this latest A-Train is certainly the best ever seen in a portable context, and one of the best in the series. Having it in your pocket is for lovers of the genre a pleasure that is appreciated more and more, day after day. A game like this is then perfectly suited to semi-passive use, with the Switch placed to one side while the trains come and go, and when you have time you go back to tweaking and refining everything. Relaxing but challenging, an oxymoron that these management software have been able to transform into a splendid reality.", "date": "2021-03-18", "grade": "8.0"}
