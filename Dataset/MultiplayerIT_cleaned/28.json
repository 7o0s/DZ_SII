{"name": "Blast Factor - Recensione PlayStation Network", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blast-factor-recensione-playstation-network.html", "text": "The game mechanics are quite simple and take up, with the necessary modifications, those of other past and recent titles, including that Geometry Wars that drove Xbox 360 users crazy. The aim is to command a sort of ship, literally trapped in some biological cells infested with viruses of different species, which will have to be eliminated to avoid large-scale contamination. Controlling the vehicle is quite simple: the left analog is used for movement, the right for shooting. If necessary, using the circle button, it is possible to release a shock wave in all directions, very useful in the event that the spacecraft is surrounded by the viruses themselves. Obviously it will not all be so simple and, as the levels go by, increasingly diversified and powerful viruses will intervene, which perhaps will react differently to the shock wave or which will require more hits to be killed. As if that weren't enough, some of them will be equipped with a sort of protective shell and in this case it will be necessary to use the movement sensor of the sixaxis pad to cause a lateral wave that will move or make the opponents roll over, making them discover their weaknesses. Each level is made up of several cells, a bonus section and the inevitable boss, truly the same in every iteration. Based on the time taken for each cell, the next hard, intermediate or easy version can be unlocked, which will also affect the number of points earned in continuing. In fact, one of the first ideas to replay the title several times lies in the possibility of saving one's records in an online ranking that includes all the players who own the game, which can also be compared only with the users on their friends list. A second incentive is instead represented by the part dedicated to multiplayer, in which it is possible to face each level together with another player, unfortunately only on the same console and not online. Finally, a further incentive devoted to replayability resides in the accelerated mode, which presents the same patterns but at a much higher speed, which makes the action even more frenetic. Graphically, the title supports all HD resolutions, up to the phantom 1080p. The foundations for a game that lets itself be watched are all there, with a fluidity always anchored on 60 frames per second and appreciable graphic effects packaged in a good stylistic realization. Obviously, since it is a type of product with a relatively low budget, it does not offer graphics comparable to the titles present, for example, on blu-ray discs, not to mention the sound aspect, which reaches the minimum wage. Comment Blast Factor is a game that relies entirely on its simplicity, immediacy and the possibility of comparing one's records with those of other users, together with the challenge derived from having to complete the game in the various modes or together with another person. Unfortunately, simplicity also represents the title's major flaw, which entertains and involves in the short term, but which cannot last very long due to its limited nature and longevity. However, with a price that should be around 9 euros, Blast Factor could be seriously considered for purchase. Pros: Immediate and fun Fluid and stylish Cons: Doesn't shine for originality Not long-lived Blast Factor is part of the ranks of the first titles that appeared on PlayStation Store, Sony's online platform that can be reached directly from the console through which it is possible to download movies, demos and buy games, in a very similar way, for example, to Xbox Live Arcade. The title that will be released at the European launch of PS3 will also include the multiplayer pack released in recent weeks and it is this complete version that is the subject of our review.", "date": "2007-03-16", "grade": null}
