Quarrel is a perfect opportunity as masterfully exploited by the Scottish Denki. This software house is now specialized in very particular productions, in this case puzzle games and, considering that the founders are former employees of the legendary DMA Design, there are enough reasons to discover their latest effort. Stay with us to know everything! Sharp pens Quarrel is now an old acquaintance on iOS platforms, a decidedly successful hybrid between a turn-based strategy and an anagram simulator, along the lines of board games such as Lyricist or Scrabble. This Xbox 360 edition adds support for avatars, but above all it implements multiplayer, a great absence from the Apple versions. The aim of the game is to conquer all the sectors of a map, displayed through a grid divided into sectors (there are several variants available), with your own army, represented by a color that not only identifies us, but which characterizes the conquered areas. Since unfortunately we are not the only ones to claim the territory, the only way is to wage bloody battles with opponents to win the conquest of the area. This is exactly where the beauty comes, since the outcome of the battle is decided by the anagram that manages to receive the best score, obtained from a series of letters randomly decided by the CPU. Each letter has a precise numerical value, which the player must take into particular account when choosing the word. However, the real tip of the balance is the number of soldiers engaged in the battle, which represents the maximum number of letters that we can use to compose the word. This is an important but not peremptory detail, as the computer rewards the original words and the use of high-value letters, which means that the longest does not guarantee mathematical winnings. Another not negligible detail is the time taken to answer, since, in the event of a tie, the answer given more quickly is facilitated. This is actually a rather annoying discriminator in games against the computer, with incredible speed and a breathtaking dictionary. Scripta manent On the other hand, whoever manages to get the upper hand in a situation of obvious disparity is rewarded with the possibility of capturing soldiers from the opposing faction, to be used obviously in their own ranks. And that, as you may have guessed, in the world of Quarrel means even better words! There are also other systems to increase the units of your army, such as a special circular bar which, once filled, allows you to call for reinforcements with the x key. Consider it as a sort of smart bomb, very useful for defending minute units on the fly. This bar can be filled by finding words during the clashes that do not concern us directly (you play up to a maximum of four), a really spot-on detail, which not only wards off boredom, but forces players never to relax too much. However, the best way to avoid ambushes and bloodbaths is to use your turn wisely, distributing the units equally in the territories, an operation to favor the attack on certain occasions. The single player mode allows you to train with an exhaustive tutorial, simulate matches with virtual players or face challenges of increasing difficulty, which require the achievement of specific objectives. Despite the average duration of each game, which is quite long, and the skill - indeed even excessive - of the computer, Quarrel's main dish can only be appreciated in multiplayer games, as already mentioned, the flagship of this edition. Even more interesting from this point of view is the support for Xbox Live, which translates, subject to the availability of players, into a potentially infinite longevity. Xbox 360 goals Quarrel features the classic 200 player points, spread across twelve objectives. Most are obviously linked to anagrams, especially the ability to build 7-letter words, but more than fifty points can be won by beating single player modes, including special challenges. Good luck! Show must go on This unfortunately leads to Quarrel's most relevant problem, namely the massive use of the English language, the understanding of which is practically essential to have any chance of winning. Let's talk about a problem and not a defect, sinceit was not really possible to act differently from the point of view of the online mode. Less forgivable is the absence of Italian even in the menus and the rich tutorial, a detail that inexorably precludes this game from a considerable portion of users. To be picky, the game dictionary and the evaluation criteria do not always prove to be optimal, if the abolition of profanity is understandable, it is decidedly less that of terms now consolidated in common language. For the rest there is very little to criticize about Denki's production, characterized by an extremely pleasant graphic design, where little or nothing is left to chance. The clashes are always enriched by hilarious animations, comic sound effects and captions relevant to the situations, if not full of great irony. All this, to give an idea, is reminiscent of a television show where the avatars observe the action from the four corners of the screen, just like virtual competitors. It goes without saying that it is an ideal pastime in company, offered at a truly unexpected price, only 400 MP, the equivalent of about 5 Euros. Quarrel is available for purchase on Live Marketplace for 400 Microsoft Points. Purchase links", "date": "2012-01-31", "grade": "8.0"}
