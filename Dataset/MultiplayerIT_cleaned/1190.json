For each ''Myst-ero'' its Revelation... Furthermore, the appropriate exploitation of the 2 capacious DVDs in which the game is distributed, has allowed the inclusion of an incredible amount of spoken audio, as well as of course superfine quality movies and the beautiful soundtracks of Peter Gabriel and Jack Wall. Mind you though that Myst IV's innovations aren't reduced to a handful of new puzzles and a revamped technical department. Think of the novelty of the camera, widely ~advertised~ in the first phase of the game, which allows you to save snapshots of the game taken when it suits you best in a special virtual album. For each ''Myst-ero'' its Revelation... The implications in terms of gameplay are obvious: not only can we draw up a real photographic account of our ordeal between the Ages of Myst, but it is possible to keep tangible traces of the thousand clues, images, obscure documents and drawings that make up the puzzle of information which allows you to solve puzzles. Conversely, the previous chapters of Myst forced the player to prodigious mnemonic exercises or also to fill sheets and sheets of notes in order not to get lost among a thousand details and cryptic references. Another noteworthy detail are the interactive 3D elements that can be found almost everywhere and which we mentioned in the previous preview: there are objects of all sorts, from tills to counters, from drawers to levers, on which we can intervene not only by clicking above, but literally ~grabbing~ them with our little hand and moving them along numerous degrees of freedom (limited to their function, a drawer or a wardrobe door will always move in the same way). Another original novelty, but of a more accessory nature, is the possibility, by clicking at will on the screen, to ~test~ the consistency of the objects present there: each time our hand will tap the element in question, producing a different noise depending on depending on the compound material, as well as a peculiar reaction where possible (as in the case of water). The level of interactivity remains deeply limited because it is anchored to the intrinsic characteristics of the game, but the introduction of new facets of the same gameplay is not only commendable but perfectly justified and I would add successful. [C] What a beautiful view we have here... You definitely need a photo! [/C] Sirrus and Achenar still them The intricate story of Myst deserves some information at least on the contents of the last scion of the saga present here. Without fear of ruining the surprise, we can anticipate that the story is set 10 years after Exile, therefore 20 from the end of the first episode, of which, however, it represents the closest thing to a real direct sequel. Once again we will be grappling with the Ages of Myst, dream worlds created by the power of the ancient D'ni race, capable of creating alternative dimensions simply by describing them in particular books. Our friend Atrus, one of the last descendants of this dynasty, after having successfully imprisoned Achenar and Sirrus in two Prison Ages (which veteran players will not struggle to remember) requests our help to find out if his two malevolent sons have now repent of their actions and deserve the return of their freedom. It goes without saying that great Revelations await us (the capital letter in this case is a must) about the past and the destiny of this family... Sirrus and Achenar still them Comment Myst 4 certainly does not fall into the most popular and attractive video game categories for the new generations of gamers. On the contrary, it is aimed at a very specific - but not limited - slice of the public of uncompromising adventure lovers who will not be disappointed by this new chapter, as it keeps its identity intact while renewing itself significantly. A worthy sequel to one of the most venerable gaming sagas that made the history of the PC and beyond. Pros: Original and not overly complex puzzles Technically impeccable Oscar-winning music Finally on DVD! Cons: You have to be cut, it's not a game for everyone For each ''Myst-ero'' its Revelation... What is the best-selling PC game of all time? Easy, The Sims. But perhaps not everyone knows that before Will Wright's masterpiece, the original, first, Myst has long been at the top of the charts with its 19 million copies sold. Not bad for a 1993 point and click adventure, universally recognized as one of the most dif gamesdifficult and abstruse that the human mind has had the audacity to conceive. It was no coincidence that he was the progenitor of a new genre that reinterpreted the classic graphic adventure in a key strongly oriented towards puzzles and exploration. This hellish machine deals with the very first puzzle of the game. Myst 4: Revelations does not interrupt the tradition and we can admit without fear of contradiction that the 3 long years of development have yielded (as well as a state-of-the-art technical sector) the best panplia of brainy puzzles desired by fans of the saga (whose masochistic component, and here I am also included, it is never to be underestimated). Nothing that a seasoned adventurer of the Ages cannot overcome with a little ingenuity and application, but for newcomers a hint system has been included which, depending on the level of help requested (from sibylline hints to the actual solution for failed) will allow you to finish the game without necessarily having to browse through the beautiful Trick section of Multiplayer.it. Luckily to avoid abuse by more impatient users, tips and solutions have been buried under layers and layers of sub-menus that you will have to go through all over again. After all, the Cheats section wasn't so bad. Myst 4, however, is not reduced to a mere mental exercise along a path of puzzles placed before us in plain sight. What the heck, you will also have to find the puzzles, indeed we could say that finding the puzzles is in itself one of the most successful puzzles in the game! After all, the second characteristic feature of Myst is precisely the beauty and majesty of the settings and how the exploratory component is designed to make us enjoy the inspired vision of the authors as much as possible. Drawers. A sea of drawers with things inside. A sea of things, all to look at. In this sense, the exceptional technical quality achieved in the fourth chapter has the opportunity to make abundant display of itself. The excellent level of definition and the almost perfect integration of the movies of the characters with the backgrounds definitely does justice to the goodness of their interpretation. Furthermore, the world of Myst has never been so ~alive~, and despite its intrinsic and immovable static nature, it is no longer just a series of beautiful ~pictures~ linked together by transitions in FMV. Every overview before our eyes presents some elements constantly in movement, from the small colored insects fluttering to the placid flow of water to many other details such as the leaves blowing in the wind or the characters and animals which, when we reappear, act according to an animation loop random departure.", "date": "2004-10-12", "grade": null}
