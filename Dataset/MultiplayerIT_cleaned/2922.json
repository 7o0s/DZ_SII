It is in fact the first time ever that the Clancyverse is brought together in the context of a crossover involving numerous franchises: from Rainbow Six to Splinter Cell, from Ghost Recon to The Division, from EndWar to H.A.W.X., almost eighty characters including heroes and villains find themselves fighting on the same team, determined to stop a threat that could change the world forever. The fact that an event of this magnitude takes place in the mobile arena, with freemium production for iOS and Android devices, should have warned us faced with the risk of flattening the mechanics in favor of the most unscrupulous immediacy, but we trusted Ubisoft's judgment: would the French house really bring together its best characters for a simple gacha? Gameplay The answer to this last question, unfortunately, is yes: right from the start we realize that the gameplay of Tom Clancy's Elite Squad is entrusted almost completely to the automatisms of the units arranged on the battlefield, which attack enemies without being no intervention on our part is necessary. The interaction is therefore limited to the strategic composition of the team, given that each character belongs to a specific class and has peculiar skills, and to the execution of two special maneuvers that can actually make the difference as far as concerns the outcome of the mission, but they represent too narrow and inconsistent an opportunity to increase involvement. The sensational mistake that the game commits is to focus almost exclusively on progression, with the unlocking of new heroes and villains to possibly be included in the five slots available for the team, the completion of achievements to obtain rewards and access to events and outline modes which, however, do not provide more variety than the basic formula. Opting for a traditional turn-based strategic system would have given the experience a certain thickness, even allowing it to stand out in that specific vein due to the extraordinary starpower used by Ubisoft for the occasion, rather than flattening it in such a sad way. What a pity! Structure In the end everything boils down to the contents and the structure, but at least on those there is little to complain about: Tom Clancy's Elite Squad can count on different game modes and on a roster made up of almost eighty characters, who, as mentioned, come from all franchises of the Tom Clancy line and include both heroes and villains. In the first few hours we unlocked for example Cole Walker from Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Megan Collins and Ryan Chang from The Division, Gilles ~Montagne~ Tour from Rainbow Six: Siege, Nidia Flores from Ghost Recon Wildlands and others: there is no doubt that this display of names has a certain charm among the many fans of the brands owned by Ubisoft. The developers have done a good job of emphasizing the capabilities of each individual fighter, and it is interesting that certain events should be addressed only with specific categories of units, perhaps dividing them into ~good~ and ~bad~ or based on role. The options available in addition to the full-bodied campaign, however, do not provide particular novelties apart from requiring a different currency than the traditional action energy that is needed for regular games. The latter is provided in great abundance in the early hours, giving the feeling of a very elastic freemium approach. Clearly, however, at some point hitting paywalls becomes inevitable. Technical realization An irreproachable technical realization is expected from a production like Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, but from this point of view the developers have only half achieved the goal. In fact, if the cartoonish style used for the characters appears pleasant and is supported by a good set of animations, the same cannot be said of the scenarios. In particular, the introductory sequences that illustrate the arrival of our team within the various locations they suffer from some frankly embarrassing aspects, so much so that they seem like a work in progress, see for example the representation of water. Other elements work but highlight mediocre solutions, perhaps with low resolution reflections, all with a view to a variety of scenarios that are anything but extraordinary.", "date": "2020-09-03", "grade": "6.5"}
