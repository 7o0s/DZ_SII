On the other hand, the focus of the series has changed over the years, moving away from the collection element and abandoning the staid progression of the first chapters to focus on combat: a more than sensible choice by Capcom to speed up and make the experience more fun , but not fully appreciated by that part of the community that was fond of the slow preparation necessary before each hunt. Whatever your opinion about it, the choice made has proved successful from a commercial point of view and has given life to some of the brand's most adrenaline-filled and played chapters. With Monster Hunter Rise, then, the step was such as to transform the experience, due to a revolutionized movement system and an impressive general speed. Here, however, another problem immediately took over: the veteran part of the community, used to dealing with games where the accurate positioning and study of the monsters were fundamental, found themselves with an incredibly more flexible system which caused a general lowering of the level of challenge. While gaining further complexity, therefore, the series has lost part of that nastiness that led multiplayer to be almost essential for many to advance, and there were not a few players eager to see significant interventions in this field. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak arrives therefore in a cardinal moment for the series: it is the expansion G (the old way to define what in Italian we call Grado Maestro) of what is probably the funniest and most valid basic chapter of the saga, and at the same time the one on which the critical eye of the historical fanbase is more fixed. Has he managed to become the perfect Monster Hunter that everyone wanted, or are some classic features now lost forever? We have played it for dozens and dozens of hours, and today we are ready to reveal it to you in our review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. Journey to the West Monster Hunter Sunbreak: ready to hunt? You really have plenty of new tricks As expected, the narrative of Sunbreak directly follows what happened in Rise, and takes the player to the outpost of Elgado, which we had already heard about from the ~merchant~ called Swallow. Structurally there are no major differences compared to other similar expansions: to start the adventure it is necessary to complete the Basic Hunting Mission 7: Goddess of Thunder, after which it becomes possible to unlock the new story. For the record, we remind you that this is still a Monster Hunter, so it is not the case to expect who knows what extraordinary plot behind the events. We are practically faced with the usual story built around a mysterious hidden threat and, in this specific case, the movements of a fearsome elderly dragon named Malzeno. That said, we believe that the complaints related to the lack of general attention to this aspect seen in Rise have been partly heard by the developers, because Sunbreak seemed to us not only richer in cutscenes, but also full of dialogues, as well as embellished sensitively by the presence of a large cast of characters. For its part, the new outpost of Elgado is nothing more than a more ~concentrated~ additional hub with a medieval look. It is a pleasant new entry, but its presence does not completely replace Kamura, since during the adventure you will be prompted to return to your home village for various reasons. However, its existence entails something much requested by those who played the first title: the disappearance of the Fury missions. In fact, this peculiar variant of the hunt was not liked by a large portion of the community, therefore - considering that its existence depends directly on Kamura - Capcom took advantage of the new location to completely delete it from the campaign. However, the absence of hordes of monsters to eliminate does not mean that there are no particular alternatives to common fights of increasing difficulty. In fact, Sunbreak introduces Collaboration Missions with followers: group expeditions where your companions are NPCs guided by artificial intelligence. And unlike the Furies here we have no doubts ... it is a very welcome addition and much more refined than we expected. Monster Hunter Sunbreak: Say hello to Malzeno, an elder dragon with a passion for vampiric cosplay Your comrades guThe data from artificial intelligence are not in fact cold automatons, but boast specific behavioral routines. Some heal often, others focus only on damage, still others grant the player bonuses during the action; everyone exchanges some specific jokes with each other or with the protagonist during the hunt and it is not even necessary to worry about their deaths, given that in case they are knocked out they can be treated immediately on the spot. Their presence is not calculated only as a pleasant substitute for the classic multiplayer for those few players who hate online: the collaboration missions are divided between a series of primary missions and free hunts with a partner of your choice (provided having unlocked them), with the former not only facilitating the recovery of materials, but also offering rewards of various kinds (mainly weapon or armor blueprints for the blacksmith). If we also consider the fact that these missions finally make sense of the many commonly useless NPCs in previous Monster Hunters - where the fact of belonging to a large regiment of hunters and almost always being the only one active was actually a bit alienating - you can clearly see how everything fits perfectly into the formula. The return of the G rank Monster Hunter Sunbreak: When the Lunagaron rises, there's no need to get distracted As fun as the missions with companions are, the fulcrum of the game is always and only one, that Master Degree which re-proposes the monsters of the basic campaign at a higher difficulty, inserts some very dangerous new entries and updates all the available equipment. As mentioned at the beginning, in the old Monster Hunters this mode was not calibrated on the single player and this made the completion of certain missions something for the chosen few; in the recent past of the series, however, Capcom has chosen to scale everything up making it more manageable for a single player, and this has caused some protests on the occasion of Iceborne, perceived by many as too accessible (at least until funny guys like the 'Alatreon and the Fatalis close the pack). Well, you'll be pleased to know that despite Rise's advanced movement mechanics and the often impressive power of available weapons, we found Sunbreak's Master Rank markedly more challenging than Iceborne's when faced alone, due to a progression of monsters handled much more carefully. Here, in fact, the best weapons and armor provide limited protection, and unless you immediately aim for a very defensive specialization, practically every monster is able to knock you out with two, maximum three attacks. Well-experienced players will therefore find themselves on the return-to-base cart much more frequently than usual and, unless we are dealing with super champions already extraordinarily trained with the so-called ~Apex monsters~ seen in Rise, we believe that the Sunbreak campaign will also be able to give to a longtime user a bit of a healthy challenge. For heaven's sake, if you advance again mainly accompanied by friends things become much more accessible, but it is still a testament to the fact that Capcom has listened to the feedback of fans who in this campaign we are ~papered~ (the jargon that hunters use to indicate when one is knocked down in Monster Hunter) an unspeakable number of times compared to the base Rise, or even the combination of World and Iceborne. To illustrate, the number of hunts we've completely failed this time out far exceeds the single KO's we've had in all of Rise, including bonus content. The way in which the difficulty has been adjusted is even more applause if we consider that Capcom did not go lightly even with the novelties in the gameplay, even making available to the players the possibility to choose between two configurations of skills during the action with a simple key combination. Monster Hunter Sunbreak: Blue Scroll or Orange Scroll. It's up to you to choose the abilities of each weapon Rise was already rich in skills and the options for customizing your style in battle were not lacking. However, Sunbreak chooses to make a surge in this sense, allowing you to select Exchange Abilities from opposite functionalities, using them according to the needs or synergies of the moment. A very simple idea on paper, from which we assure you, however, it will be almost impossible to go back once you get used to the exchange skill inversion. Too bad for only one thing: perhaps always to better adjust the progression of the difficulty and limit the initial options, during the campaign you start with a handful of minor extra skills, which greatly limits the use of the new systemwith certain weapons. Therefore, while some tools, such as the Charged Blade (which can immediately switch from countermoves with Wire Insects to a devastating aerial blow), are immediately revolutionized by the novelty, others such as Sword and Shield or the Greatsword will remain practically unchanged in their exploitation for over 15 hours of play (or more, considering that we progressed in the campaign very quickly). Even the talismans, the cross of almost all Rise players, do not undergo practical changes until the final phase of the initial campaign, and these limitations in the development of the player's skills they become ignorable almost exclusively for one reason: a great cadenced selection of monsters. The work done on each individual hunt is in fact respectable: each monster has additional attack patterns, fewer windows of vulnerability, and greater aggressiveness that prevent you from approaching battles superficially until better equipment is available. The monsters already seen, therefore, acquire a completely different flavor, and the experience is further perfected by a really valid mix of variants and newcomers. Count Dragula has arrived Monster Hunter Sunbreak: there are many fantastic monsters, but the aesthetics of Gore Magala surpass it in a few Rise's beasts already boasted a certain personality and we undoubtedly appreciated their new typologies (even if the absence of an alternative Goss Harag saddens us a bit); the real stars of the expansion, however, are the so-called ~three lords~ originating in Elgado: the Garangolm, the Lunagaron and the Malzeno, beasts inspired by the monsters of western folklore - respectively Frankenstein's monster, the werewolf and Dracula - so well characterized to be a perfect break from known fights. It has to be said, the full roster of beasts in Sunbreak isn't gigantic (although it's comparable to Iceborne at launch, falling just short of that set's monster count after updates), but we think the selection is truly among the best in the game. series, with illustrious returns such as Astalos or Gore Magala that have been loudly requested by the community for years, and even one hosted by Monster Hunter Frontier in the form of Espinas. Remaining in the field of novelties, both Felyne and Canyne have met to a general overhaul, with a handful of new abilities and upgrades for each, including cool ~secret moves~ for cats that further increase their usefulness. We're of the opinion that the gap between cats and dogs is still quite high even after the changes, yet it's nice to see concrete improvements even in their use. Monster Hunter Sunbreak: Many weapons have been balanced, the Hammer Courage charge for example is much more efficient Lovers of speedruns and lovers of some individual weapons will instead be happy to know that Capcom has also moved in balancing, going to regulate many aspects that had created imbalances in the fanbase. We didn't have the material time (and the necessary experience) to test each of them in detail, but we still tried to analyze all the new skills and focused on seven weapons in particular, finding sensible tweaks and filings everywhere. To give a concrete example: the loaded Blade, criticized in Rise for the radius of its explosions, now boasts a longer permanence of the vials on the ground once discharged and an improved vertical radius which makes its use more natural for old players data, and as mentioned it is certainly not alone. Even going into the details of the new skills, we believe there is little to complain about: true, some weapons have won the lottery of spectacularity compared to others and have completely different approaches available, but the developers seem to have included the new skills with the intent to perfect the less used styles in Rise or cover up their shortcomings, and it's a choice we can only support considering that end time leads to a general approach that closely resembles the variety of options of Monster Hunter Generations (but with much more customization and flexibility). Oh, and there's also a bevy of new jewel and armor-related abilities designed to actively enhance specific playstyles, further demonstrating a willingness to vastly open up the choices available to players. The end is just the beginning Monster Hunter Sunbreak: hunting with best wiveryan waifus is priceless The above should already represent a more than complete package, able to guarantee Sunbreak the status of ~excellent expansion~. Nonetheless, Sunbreak has at least one more trick up its sleeve: an endgame impression", "date": "2022-06-29", "grade": "9.2"}
