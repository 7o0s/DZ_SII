A ritual that Need For Speed: Most Wanted has chosen not to renounce, the second test of Criterion with the historic EA course franchise. Unlike other cases in which the work was entrusted to external teams, the developer himself wanted to take care of the porting process, trying to make this version actually the best available on the market. Let's see how it went. Wiiulently mine As with the vast majority of times a video game has been ported to Wii U a few months after its original release, the two golden rules apply to Need for Speed: Most Wanted U as well: to begin with, the game is essentially the same as regards the play structure and content, and therefore we refer you to the links of our review, video review and superdirect for all the relevant information. Secondly, precisely because of the substantial uniformity of values put in place between this and the previous versions, it is difficult for those who have already played the Criterion racing game to find ideas here that justify the purchase of a second copy. Just to make no mistake, however, Need for Speed: Most Wanted U starts by including the Ultimate Speed Pack DLC, which adds five new cars as well as a handful of events and achievements. As is normal, however, the GamePad is the main recipient of the innovations brought by the developers to this port. It begins with the possibility given to the user to view the game directly on the controller screen by simply pressing a button: in this capacity, the already excellent graphics of the title significantly benefit from the passage on the touchscreen, revealing a real show for the eyes. However, although it is a feature that certainly comes in handy when the TV is not available, it inevitably ends up being a second choice, given that the small size of the display makes driving at the spasmodic speeds typical of the title objectively more difficult . Moving on to something else, to meet the needs of the largest possible number of users, Criterion has well thought of supporting practically every existing control system for the Nintendo console. Using the GamePad, the steering can be managed by acting on the left analog stick or by exploiting the integrated gyroscope, the latter solution as picturesque as it is fundamentally too inaccurate to be seriously considered. The best results in terms of comfort are obtained with a Pro Controller, but there is also room for the Classic Controller and the ~old~ Remote, which can be used alone or in combination with the Nunchuk. All options that come in handy when related to another Need for Speed: Most Wanted U exclusive, or the so-called Co-pilot mode: while a user plays using an alternative controller, a second person can use the GamePad to provide some little help in real time by acting on the simple menus that appear on the touchscreen. With single taps it is therefore possible to activate or deactivate the traffic, switch from day to night, change the car and body color, view the map and even distract the policemen during a chase. It is unlikely that a seasoned gamer could go crazy with fun using this option, but at the same time it is something that fits perfectly into the social play philosophy of Wii U, therefore useful for providing mild entertainment even to those who are not personally involved in the guide. By personally overseeing the conversion process, Criterion was also able to work on some small details, such as the standard turbo in the cars that you find driving around Fairhaven: in the original versions of the game you had to win a race to unlock it, while here each vehicle already starts with nitro supplied, albeit weakened compared to the standard one. Good news also on the graphic front, an aspect in which the transpositions for Wii U have not always shone for quality: Need for Speed: Most Wanted U in fact enjoys the same texture assets as its PC counterpart, obtaining the result of a better definition of the image without affecting the frame rate, which remains stable except for some slight and sporadic slowdown. Almost in a sort of compensation, however, the developers have granted an upgrade to the visual rendering but have also made a slight restriction on thethe online multiplayer component, yes present in its entirety with a lot of support for voice chat, but limited to six players per game against the eight of the other versions. Finally, the uncertainty regarding the availability of future DLCs on Wii U, linked to the actual sales success of this version, should be taken into account.", "date": "2013-03-25", "grade": "8.0"}
