{"name": "The Roots: Gates of Chaos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-roots-gates-of-chaos.html", "text": "Bitter roots The Roots: Gates of Chaos begins its action-rpg task by making the user choose his own digital alter ego among the five available protagonists: we therefore find the balanced Paladin, the aggressive Warrior, the fast Thief and two types of magicians , the Sorcerer and the Sorceress. The classes mentioned are certainly not the maximum of originality, as well as the character design, among the most anonymous and stereotyped that history remembers: but being The Roots: GoC a clearly classic title, all in all these are problems of little account. The same cannot be said of the differentiation in terms of gameplay of the various characters, which highlight too marked similarities in terms of characteristics and behavior in battle. But let's go in order. The adventure that will lead our heroes to confront the evil henchmen of the Lord of Demons (long live creativity) begins in a small village inhabited by a handful of characters who have the task of providing various services to the player: it is therefore possible to control the status of your quests, purchase items and equipment, move from one area to another and more. Although a decent tutorial manages to show the user the control system and the various aspects of the gameplay in a satisfactory way, The Roots: GoC suffers from a general lack of underlying clarity. The menus relating to the aforementioned functions certainly do not shine for ease of use, as do the HUD and the status and inventory screen of your character: even, it is difficult to understand which objects can be equipped or not, thanks to the use of a really questionable icon system. The same goes for the sections relating to skills and abilities, where everything is reduced to images or names that very little can explain the real effects of the selected powers. A stew of frogs Closing more than a few eyes here and there, The Roots: GoC still begins to show its actual game action, but even here things don't go exactly right. The Tannhauser Gate title immediately manifests evident gaps at a technical and structural level, primarily with regard to the fight with enemies, with hits that hit the mark in an apparently completely random way. Also to be rejected is the balancing of the game scenarios (there are totally deserted areas and others filled to capacity with monsters) and the completely messed up calibration of the level of difficulty (it is not explained in particular why the developers have not pardoned the player of the classic progressive restoration of the energy present in every self-respecting action-rpg). Not to mention that there is no screen that takes into account the quests in progress and that often the mission objectives are absolutely nebulous. In short, The Roots: GoC is a decidedly incomplete title, even guilty of a game rhythm bordering on soporific. Not even the technical realization comes to the aid of the Cenega product: flying over a sound sector to the maximum of anonymity, The Roots: GoC presents a rough and washed out 3D graphics, framed by a bird's eye view which also highlights a whole frame rate It's anything but fluid and a rather primitive and jerky set of animations. Also forget the four-player multiplayer mode via Bluetooth (available in cooperative and competitive options), good on paper but which turns out to be unsatisfactory on balance both for its own demerits and for the poor foundations on which it is forced to rely. Comment The Roots: Gates of Chaos is an absolutely mediocre action-rpg, which rather clearly highlights the inexperience of its development team. Although created on a decidedly conventional basis, in fact, the Tannhauser Gate title fails to offer a satisfactory gaming experience, thanks to various technical and structural gaps. Confusing due to the lack of clarity of the menus and on-screen icons and for a rough and ~mixed~ cosmetics, The Roots also fails in terms of strict gameplay, putting on the plate a cumbersome and very unexciting game action. The fallacious implementation of the multiplayer mode brings down the curtain on a very unsuccessful title. Pros: Good variety of enemies and environments Potentially long-lived Cons: Stale and incomplete gameplay Confusing graphics and menus Trivial design, storyline and environments Developed by the little-known Tannhauser Gate team, The Roots: Gates of Chaos looks like a classic action-rpg in the truest sense of the word: fantasy setting, monsters of all kinds, heroic warriors and large quantities of gold coins and items to collect along the path. But how thickor it happens, not always following a successful trend leads to satisfactory results...", "date": "2005-05-05", "grade": null}
