It did so by showing off a respectable line-up for PlayStation VR on the occasion of the various sector fairs and it did it even more recently through a press event entirely dedicated to video games that can be played with a helmet compatible with its flagship console. Although conflicting information has not been lacking on various occasions and, honestly, looking to the future it is a bit difficult to understand how we will be able to use the peripheral continuously throughout 2017, there is no doubt that this year has started off great. On the one hand there was Resident Evil VII, probably the first massive triple A production made with an eye towards PSVR, on the other there were the sales figures which confirmed how the device has probably already broken through even the million milestone. In defiance of HTC VIVE and Oculus Rift which, together, do not even reach two thirds of these numbers. It must have been thanks to the selling price, or the diffusion of the console, or maybe just the marketing, we don't know but in the meantime the positive push doesn't seem to stop and the new fruit of Sony's publishing is now on the market . We are talking about Farpoint, a first-person shooter created by the young and perhaps a little inexperienced boys of Impulse Gear. An exclusive video game for PlayStation VR that is also sold bundled with a dedicated controller, the Aim Controller. It is a sort of stylized rifle with soft and neutral, almost aseptic lines, created with the precise aim of making the operation of holding a rifle while using a virtual reality helmet more credible and ~physical~ PlayStation Move Sharp Shooter go hide in a corner now!). The most interesting element of the peripheral is its theoretical compatibility with any other product on the market, VR or not, given that it houses the entire push button panel of a DualShock while the luminous sphere identical to the one on the Move makes it immediately identifiable from the PlayStation Camera. As far as the Aim Controller is concerned, in addition to referring you to our in-depth unboxing, we can only spend good words given its build quality and the excellent response of the buttons and vibration which compensate for a perhaps excessively anonymous design, but before proceeding with the judgment on the game it is essential to underline that Farpoint can also be played with a normal DualShock even if, in doing so, you will miss most of its (few) positive elements. Farpoint is a basic, linear shooter with little longevity but VR saves it from the abyss It's like throwing a salami down a corridor Farpoint is a first-person shooter with a sci-fi setting that makes simplicity its strength or, depending on your point of view, its weakness. The narrative incipit is quite trivial: we are near an orbiting space station in our solar system, not far from an unknown electromagnetic phenomenon which, if studied and exploited properly, could guarantee infinite energy for humanity. Our avatar is the pilot of a space shuttle and during the first few minutes of a long introductory sequence, pushing hard on the ~wow!~ of virtual reality, everything will fall into an unstoppable catastrophe and we will find ourselves catapulted on an alien planet in who knows what remote corner of the galaxy. Together with us, two other scientists have been thrown into the unknown and our initial goal will be to follow the steps of this couple of astrophysicists in an attempt to understand what happened to them. The story is told both through brief interactions with the holograms of the scientists left in key points of the scenario, and with long cutscenes where we will find ourselves witnessing scenes of daily life inside a small makeshift camp where sometimes we will be able to observe the situation from the eyes of scientists and on other occasions ours will be an external point of view. Although the plot is quite obvious and the setting of the narrative is truly classic - gameplay, cutscene, gameplay, cutscene... - we must admit that the story still entertained us thanks to its feeling at The Martian, the film with Matt Damon and, on more than one occasion she has managed to convey the feeling and emotions experienced by those who really find themselves in total solitude in a hostile environment with no longer any possibility of returning home. Too bad only for the epilogue, whicharrives after about five hours of play, and which practically leaves most of the questions hanging in a mixture of cliffhanger and trivial superficiality, where it is not clear whether the developer wanted to leave the door open in view of a hypothetical sequel. However, it is with regard to the gameplay that we feel we have to make the greatest complaints. Farpoint is in fact a single, linear, simple corridor. To the point of making even those who have always fiercely criticized the chapters of Call of Duty pale in this respect. There are no crossroads or alternative roads that can in any way stimulate the exploration of the scenario, any element of interaction with the environment is missing, with the exception of the holograms mentioned above which start practically automatically and are almost all mandatory for the continuation of the 'action. The game develops almost as if it were on a track, practically in a straight line, from level to level and from cutscene to cutscene. With the only exception obviously represented by the very frequent shootings. But even in this case, not everything goes well: the weapons are few, just five, even if almost all of them have some sort of alternative fire mode, and the enemies lack variety. Initially we will have to deal with the local fauna represented by jumping spiders that are so reminiscent of Half-Life's headcrabs, by arachnids capable of throwing poison balls, by other spiders capable of digging through the subsoil and, guess what, by a giant spider that serves as a mid-game boss. Subsequently, mechanical enemies take over to vary everything a bit and when a real alien threat finally makes its appearance, the title is practically at its epilogue. Even the artificial intelligence follows the same descending curve since most of the enemies tend to charge with their heads down or to remain almost motionless over the distance to target us with their shots from a distance. Let it be clear that this does not mean that Farpoint is an easy title: although it does not present any level of difficulty, it often manages to offer a good rate of challenge, especially when the scenario is filled with many different enemies forcing the player to alternate between the various weapons and constantly run behind cover to avoid being slaughtered by enemy shots. A little too often, however, it will be enough to find a good observation point and limit oneself to coming out to shoot at regular intervals without experiencing the risk that some opponent will come and flush us out. Playstation 4 trophies Farpoint offers 47 trophies, including the platinum one. The gold three are achieved by completing the game and obtaining good results in the cooperatives, while almost all the silver ones, nine in total, are related to the challenges. The bronze trophies, on the other hand, are largely linked to the methods of killing enemies and the weapons used to commit the extermination. It will tend to be quite simple to platinum the title. It's like being inside The great linearity of the title, forcing the player to go practically always straight and the numerous simplifications of the gameplay just described, however, seem to be justified and intimately linked to the fact that Farpoint is above all a game for virtual reality. In fact, we want to emphasize here that, although as a traditional shooter, the title would not have had any chance of surviving our criticism and that of the public, it is its value as a game that can be faced exclusively with PlayStation VR that gives it an edge and, probably, to forcing the developer to seek a series of compromises. First of all we must highlight how the first hours of the game, thanks to the combination of a plastic helmet and rifle, really give back an excellent sense of immersion and, in the end, they are fun precisely because they are immediate and direct. Almost genuine. At the same time it is understood in an instant that always having to proceed in a straight line is an essential design compromise to make the game within everyone's reach. In fact, by default Farpoint does not even allow the player to turn the body of his avatar: the second analog is inert and we will have to physically turn our head to be able to walk sideways; a ploy that also greatly reduces the motion sickness inherent in this kind of experience. At the level of options, however, it remains possible to configure the second lever in the way you prefer: from rotation via teleportation to progressive rotation. In fact, however, there is never a real need to retrace your steps and even to look back: it will never happen that an enemy can appear from behind you and there are very rare cases in which an opponent will shoot you from the sides. We even get to the paradox of the salt spidersaforementioned erini who, once dodged during their jump, rather than attempting to hit you from behind, will walk diligently towards you, to overtake you and get back comfortably in front ready to jump back into your face. The result is decidedly alienating and unfortunately it is well representative of the compromises that Impulse Gear had to seek to make Farpoint an experience that is not too hardcore like some of those seen on VIVE and Rift (Arizona Sunshine and Onward above all). It is not even possible to jump or duck, there are no ammunition so as to avoid collection actions and, unfortunately, it is not even possible to look out from a cover since the positional detection is limited only to the movement of the head and to a minimum of spatial positioning. But be careful because this does not mean that Farpoint is a trivial game because the use of the Aim Controller brings to the fore a really successful element of the game: aim management. In fact, the title does not allow you to shoot ~blindly~ but rather requires the player to make an effort to look into the optics of the weapons in his arms in a mix of reality and fiction that works really well. Physically holding the plastic rifle in your hand, to bring it close to your eyes so you can hit an enemy from a distance or to be able to intercept one in flight is really very satisfying. It's like a beauty in the distance Technically Farpoint does not seem to have enjoyed those investments typical of triple A productions of which it should be part. The textures are quite simple, the scenarios are frighteningly static and devoid of any interaction, the animations and the polygon count of the opponents are basic. At the same time, however, the title is very clean and fluid and in at least a couple of situations, thanks to the involvement guaranteed by PlayStation VR, it manages to offer truly engaging and airy glimpses. Farpoint is then entirely translated and dubbed into Italian with an acting that is pleasant enough for the two scientists, and perhaps too caricatured for our protagonist. In addition to the single player campaign, it also offers a cooperative mode that can be tackled in four arenas in the company of a friend with a style reminiscent of the classic horde, plus a challenge mode that allows you to go back to some levels already covered in the campaign to try to complete them in one sort of timed mode where it becomes essential to reach the checkpoints as if it were a racing game. It is clear that these are alternative possibilities to spend a few more hours on Farpoint but their attractiveness diminishes very quickly.", "date": "2017-05-18", "grade": "7.0"}
