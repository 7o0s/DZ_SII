{"name": "Marvel's Midnight Suns", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvels-midnight-suns-recensione.html", "text": "Marvel's Midnight Suns is a surprising product, especially if you are approaching it as a fan of XCOM or Firaxis Games games in general. The latest work by the good Jacob Solomon, in fact, shares many elements with the previous works of the Baltimore studio, but it is also profoundly original from many points of view. For example, it's the first licensed game, but above all it's the first time that the gameplay doesn't seem like the heart of the experience, but the glue between one piece of history and the next. In the Marvel's Midnight Suns review, in fact, we will see that this title is more than a turn-based strategy, a genre that Firaxis has contributed to creating and evolving, it is a role-playing game with strategic elements. One thing that brings him closer to being more of a Fire Emblem than an XCOM. History The all-powerful Lilith, the main antagonist of Marvel's Midnight Suns The story of Marvel's Midnight Suns is loosely inspired by The Rise of The Midnight Sons, an interesting cross-over saga born in 1992 which saw several minor superheroes such as Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, Blade and Morbius traveling around the United States to try to stop Lilith, the all-powerful mother of demons, from recruiting an army of minions to bring destruction to Earth. Some of these elements, such as the antagonist, the fact that several different superheroes are forced to collaborate, and the mystical atmosphere, rather far from the techno/superheroic one of the recent films (with the exception of the latest Doctor Strange) , remained, while others were overthrown by Solomon and his. By the way, did you read the interview we did with Solomon and DeAngelis? Partly to make the plot more modern, partly to be able to include a more charismatic cast, which includes personalities of the caliber of Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Strange, Wolverine, Spider-Man and many others, which will be available at launch or that will be added through DLC. Instead of a road trip with the Spirits of Vengeance, Marvel's Midnight Suns focuses on the Abbey, the secret base where the Keeper is assembling an army of superheroes to face Lilith and her henchmen. Already after a few hours within its walls you will find not only the Suns, but also the Avengers, evicted from their respective mansions and forced to transfer laboratories, gyms and various operational centers here. The Abbey is also important because Lilith lived here, but above all rest you, Hunter, her progeny. With this narrative device Firaxis has managed to unite heroes from different eras, cities and groups, but above all to justify the presence of a completely new hero that the player can shape in his image and likeness. Not only choosing Hunter's gender and physical characteristics with a handy editor, but also his fighting style through moral choices and building his deck. The Abbey The Abbey is the center of operations for all of Marvel's Midnight Suns All those who have played and loved XCOM will find in the Abbey more or less all the functionality that could be found within the foundations of previous Firaxis games. The former church, in fact, is the hub within which to manage one's operations, as well as organize and strengthen the team. At the Keeper's post, the Mirror, it will be possible to select which mission to face, only one per day to choose between optional and those that progress the story, Captain Marvel manages heroic missions, particular tasks that engage only one hero at a time useful for obtaining new upgrades. At Agatha's library it is possible to create potions and items to use on missions. Stephen Strange and Tony Stark are responsible, respectively, for magical research and that technology, while Blade manages the gym, or the place to improve the attack cards by merging them together, adding a random modifier to them. Once a day it will also be possible to have Hunter train with one of the other heroes, in order to improve their bond, as well as obtain additional bonuses with which to start the fight. With some improvements, the possibility of healing wounded warriors will be unlocked, or to make them fight in order to make them recover the experience levels that divide them from Hunter. Blade is the one who runs the abbey gym in Marvel's Midnight Suns However, unlike XCOM, all of this is handled ~in real time~ and not through a schematic structure. Hunter will be able to move freely around the Abbey, chat with its inhabitants and interact with them in many different ways. Sometimes superheroes will have doubts, othersSometimes you can invite them to see a movie or go for a walk, and sometimes you can participate in one of the side activities, such as the book club or the Ghost Rider and Spider-Man workshop. As always, the different activities will be linked to each other and will often consume certain resources to be recovered in battle or in the gardens of the Abbey. This creates a system that forces you to manage resources well in order to make them grow harmoniously, so as not to be faced with a dead end that will force you to wait until you can build a fundamental object to continue with the story or make the ability to which you will really need. Thanks to these activities, designed to unlock upgrades and costumes for the various superheroes, Firaxis has indulged in outlining a heterogeneous and varied cast of superheroes. Despite being the same characters appreciated in the films, the icons of Marvel's Midnight Suns behave in a rather different way than one might expect. Strange is a chatterbox who feels competition with Stark, while the billionaire genius is decidedly more edgy, arrogant and edgy than the character played by Robert Downey Jr. Peter Parker has more in common with the Midnight Suns than with the Avengers and Captain America is like a gigantic rock, i.e. solid and rather dull. In other words you will have to deal with familiar characters, but in some ways new, more human, that you will learn to discover and appreciate. The motley cast of Marvel's Midnight Suns Along the time that will pass before reaching the end credits, which will vary according to many different factors (difficulty level, secondary activities, etc...), but which will abundantly exceed the total 60 hours, the screenwriters build an atmosphere as a fraternity, with different groups forming, they clash, but eventually unite under the leadership of Hunter to face a common threat. The Suns are the reckless youngsters, a little loser, a little jealous of their often secondary role in the whole story. The Avengers are the football team, the rich, famous and powerful ones, but perhaps also the ones less emotionally involved in the whole initiative. Between head shots, from one side to the other, some reversal of the scene and many, many lines of dialogue, Firaxis gave each of them at least one moment of glory and justified his presence within the supergroup. It will be within the walls of the Abbey, but above all in its possessions, that the role-playing part of Marvel's Midnight Suns will take place. Firaxis, in fact, has decided to enrich the experience with a whole part of exploring the surroundings of the base. Among the meanders of the garden you will find treasures, environmental puzzles, but also collectibles thanks to which you can delve into the history of the game, find out who the Keeper, Agatha and Lilith are, what relationship they have with Hunter and what Scarlet Witch was doing with each other. These sections of exploration, with no enemies and no platform stages to jump into and test your reflexes and skill, are interesting when there is some puzzle to unlock, but rather empty in all other situations, such as the gathering ingredients or searching for clues. Marvel's Midnight Suns Abbey Gardens are full of charm, but rather empty This structure slightly dilutes the time between one mission and the next, adding ~story~ and exploring a territory never approached by Firaxis, but perhaps it makes the whole experience lose some substance. The sense of urgency of XCOM 2, with the passing of the days that inexorably approached the end, is felt much less here, and the days, especially after 40-50 hours of play, risk becoming a simple routine. The suspension of disbelief, not visible in the War of the Chosen 2D base screen, is palpable here, with increasingly dramatic events endangering the world and people bickering over which group is better other, have a drink at the bar, read books or sunbathe by the pool. It is true that the quality of the experience is not affected much (the atmosphere is that of the 90s comics, more than the dramas of recent years), but an extra effort to minimize this disconnect, not only through a few phrases repeated by other heroes, it could have been done. The impression is that by completely changing genre and focus, from gameplay to story, Firaxis has lost some of that compactness and cleanliness of the experience that made XCOM 2, especially with its expansion, one of the most beautiful and engaging strategists of recent years. I'll make you the deck! A Marvel's Midnight Suns fight handled through cards If apparently Marvel's Midnight Sunsand XCOM could be enclosed within the same genre, or those of turn-based strategy, in reality the two experiences are profoundly different. The main factors that shuffle the cards are certainly the disappearance of the grid, a key ingredient of almost all Firaxis games, and the introduction of a card-based system, which takes the place of the classic one which involves a movement and a action for each unit in the field. These elements, combined with a simplified level design, which eliminates verticality and standardizes the size of the maps, make each fight a sort of chess game, in which the player not only has to choose the right move, but also has to look for the correct order. in which to perform these moves, so as to try to secure further strategic options. In theory, in fact, during each round it is possible to play only three cards, make a single movement or draw two cards. In practice, some particular cards and abilities of the heroes and the use of the elements of the scenario or of the objects, allow you to perform many more moves than those foreseen. Let's take an example: some cards have the ~Speed~ characteristic: this means that if they are used to kill at least one opponent, the move will be refunded. Other cards, on the other hand, increase courage, a resource necessary to use the most powerful Heroic abilities, but also to exploit some elements of the scenario. Having a lot of Courage, therefore, allows you to blow up bins or throw light poles at the enemies' heads, thus thinning their ranks. All ~additional moves~ compared to those budgeted, which allow you to add layers of strategy to a system that is only apparently simple. Magik portals will be very useful for controlling the battlefield of Marvel's Midnight Suns If initially the gameplay of Marvel's Midnight Suns might seem much more limited than that of XCOM, in fact, over time you will understand that the team has changed the focus of the game, from managing a coordinated attack of a mini army to a sort of chess in which instead of pawns you have superheroes capable of doing practically everything. Getting to know your characters, making their synergies count, but above all understanding how to make the most of the battlefield will be essential to win and not be overwhelmed. The enemies are divided into minions, elites and bosses and understand what is the best sequence of moves to play to maximize damage and avoid KOs. in the defense turn it makes the clashes intense and spectacular, despite their potentially limited duration. Dealing with Marvel characters on the one hand allowed the developers to use some of the most recognizable names and faces in entertainment, on the other it forced the team to rethink its game, especially the defensive phase. Captain America, Iron Man and co, in fact, don't hide behind a low wall, but fire missiles, parry attacks and advance head-on without ever missing a beat, sweeping away every obstacle. The mechanics of error rate and covers, the cornerstones of XCOM, were therefore not usable in Marvel's Midnight Suns. This forced the designers of Firaxis to unbalance the gameplay a lot on the offensive phase, with the defensive one based on blocks, provocations and the possibility of recovering lost energy and not on a real strategy made of positioning on the battlefield or line management. Some enemies in Marvel's Midnight Suns will summon allies and risk overwhelming you In fact, it doesn't matter where on the map you are, even the enemies will always be able to reach the targeted hero and hit him. One thing that makes the control of the mass of enemies an element to always take into consideration and which, on the other hand, dampens the tension a bit during the boss fights. It is the many blows suffered that will knock out a hero: hardly a single enemy, without his henchmen, will be able to worry you. The boss fights are therefore an anti-cathartic element: what should be the moments of maximum tension, in reality, are the simplest ones to manage, as well as the most predictable ones, given that the phases and moves performed by that single enemy they will be more or less always the same and therefore easily manageable. Unlike a horde of opponents that can attack en masse and focus on a single target. Raising the difficulty level will only make the enemies tougher and more violent, without distorting the strategy to be used on the field. So it could happen that you are unable to pass a mission more for having the wrong trio to send on the field than for errors of", "date": "2022-11-30", "grade": "8.5"}
