A certainly not indifferent period of time, which did not bode well for a possible sequel. We were wrong, the motto of ~better late than never~ comes the DX version which demonstrates how Namco has even managed to outdo itself. But let's proceed step by step. This edition is not to be considered as a true sequel, but rather an enhanced revision of the CE, with decidedly interesting additions capable of reshuffling the cards of the original formula. We are still faced with a labyrinth full of dots just waiting to be devoured, of course, the difference lies in Pac's new skills in getting rid of the hateful ghosts. This time our hungry hero can count on a limited number of bombs that he can use to send the hostile creatures back to the central box, in addition to this there is a slow motion effect (unlimited and automatic) in dangerous situations that has little to envy at the bullet time of the Matrix. As well as a new Neo, our nice spheroidal friend will be able to easily escape from his pursuers. Wake up! Another substantial difference is represented by new ghosts positioned in the labyrinth, initially asleep and harmless, but as Pac passes by, they wake up and begin the frantic chase. By learning the conformations of the various labyrinths, it is possible to drag an endless row of enemies along with you, in order to obtain substantial combos once you have conquered the super pill to eat them. In fact, this new episode revolves around this formula, so much so as to distort the historical mechanics of the original, in an extremely positive sense. In keeping with the trends of many Live Arcade titles (such as Geometry Wars), the focus is entirely on scoring and leaderboards. In the case of Pac Man C.E. DX, everything is still subject to time, 5 or 10 minutes depending on the chosen mode, after which the game ends. It is no exaggeration to compare this incarnation to a hyperbolic racing game, where the main objective is the learning of ideal trajectories capable of reconciling the collection of dots and the dragging of the ghosts. Extremely galvanizing situations are soon reached, given that some super pills are guarded by external ghosts, so it is not possible to recover them without first having turned them into blue, but once done we will be able to ring almost infinite chains, with dozens and dozens of tormented pursuers . Xbox 360 goals There are the canonical 200 points of Live Arcade titles, divided into a handful of objectives that are not too complicated to achieve once you have mastered the game. They range from the conclusion of a mode without the use of bombs, to the achievement of certain scores or the number of ghosts engulfed. Hi score galore! This particular setting involves not a little substantial changes, almost desecrating to the saga. Losing a life becomes a rather remote eventuality, thanks to the many bombs bestowed by the game, the slow motion, the excessive speed and the tendency of the enemies to no longer take individualistic initiatives. Even the importance of the maze itself is somewhat diminished, but everything works incredibly well, demonstrating Namco's great level design expertise. In fact, using bombs, or even worse, losing a life, the speed is decreased and consequently the multiplier. To obtain prestigious records it is therefore necessary to minimize the new resources shown off by the pill-eating yellow. A commendable balance capable of generating a playability of immediate grip and great fun. Various modes are made available, which can be progressively unlocked together with a large set of labyrinths, even if the conformation of the same remains always changeable, after having eaten the special bonus fruits. There is something to indulge yourself, from various timed modes, levels in the dark where only the area crossed by Pac is highlighted, others where it will be necessary to eat as many ghosts as possible, and so on. Even the same map of the CE is made available, which we can relive with the new mechanics. Therefore, there is certainly no lack of variety, as well as the large player ranking, relating to each mode, which proves to be completely rich and satisfying. Not satisfied with the result obtained, Namco has also included various graphical interfaces, ranging from the minimal psychedelic bitmap of the CE, to the three-dimensional aesthetics already seen in the historic Pac Mania (the settingand in any case it always remains 2d). It goes without saying that all of them are beautifully made and full of style, also thanks to an audio accompaniment that expertly mixes dance sounds with the historical jingles of the saga. A feast for the eyes without a doubt, fully optimized for 16:9 displays. Everything perfect then? Not really, as we already pointed out in the CE edition, we would have liked some structure with progressive levels, or an infinite mode, i.e. without time, to have an even greater longevity. Unfortunately, however, even the DX remains totally subordinate to the clock, even more than before, as the new mechanical details do not lend themselves to games based on resistance. The reverse of the medal is that this leads to an extremely frenetic and extraordinarily concise product, but lacking in length, despite the many methods proposed. Even the absence of any multiplayer mode makes the games a pleasant pastime aimed at the best score, to show off even for cheerful evenings with friends.", "date": "2010-11-25", "grade": "9.5"}
