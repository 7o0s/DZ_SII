{"name": "S.C.A.R. - Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scar-squadra-corse-alfa-romeo.html", "text": "Psychology applied to racing The excellent animated introduction fades into the game modes offered by SCAR. It is possible to face short races and timed challenges, perhaps to familiarize yourself with the control system and with the physical management of the vehicles, but the fulcrum of this product is obviously represented by the Dynasty mode: a story mode in which we will have to face races and tournaments from the bottom, acquire a certain reputation and become undisputed champions. More than referring solely to results on the track, this mode has a certain depth and takes into account various course elements: intimidating opponents and overtaking them, time spent in the lead, the ability to make clean laps , any track records and, finally, the position obtained when crossing the finish line. Managing all of this leads to earning points at the end of the race, points that can be spent to increase the rider's physical abilities and/or to purchase equipment. The latter does not have a purely aesthetic value, in the case of SCAR, but rather helps to make our alter ego more self-confident and aware of his own abilities. You might be wondering why we've been talking about the psychological aspect of racing for so long... Well, in the game all this matters a lot in the overall picture: getting into an opponent's slipstream and keeping up with him will decrease his energy bar ~emotional,~ let's call it that, and it will mislead him. In extreme cases, when this bar runs out, physical phenomena such as blurring of vision, slowing of reflexes and an exponential increase in heart rate occur. This, possibly, is reflected in the ~physical~ energy bar, i.e. the condition of the car: crashing into other cars or into a wall will soon lead us to retire. Of course, all of this also applies to our driver: having someone breathing down our necks before tackling a demanding bend won't do us any good, and we'll have to try to avoid such situations in order not to find ourselves in the unpleasant situation described above. Physics and aesthetics ~Power is nothing without control~. This slogan echoes in the mind when you try your hand at SCAR for the first time, which offers a detailed but rather severe driving system. It is possible to activate or deactivate the various ABS, traction control and so on to significantly change the feeling with the car, but in general, driving on the track is never a walk in the park and a lightness is enough to ruin an otherwise perfect session. The sensitivity of the left analog stick is not a problem, as you quickly get used to it, but the analog capabilities of the Dual Shock 2 keys still prove to be ~cumbersome~ in use, especially when it comes to dosing the acceleration. In this sense, the Xbox and GameCube controllers remain superior. If we combine everything with the low sensitivity of the back buttons when changing gear, apparently a characteristic of SCAR, we will notice an evident contradiction: you have to be progressive and delicate with the analog stick to set the trajectories at best, but then to change you they literally hit the back of the keys with a hammer... These are problems that can be overcome with a little practice, but combined with the behavior of the car when cornering (mercilessly: you almost have to stop to steer, unlike Gran Turismo...) they outline a rather difficult picture for those approaching the game for the first time. It is perhaps for this reason that the developers have seen fit to include a sort of ~smart bomb~ to help players after a mistake: the so-called ~Tiger Effect~. By pressing the Triangle key, in fact, we will see time flow in reverse for a few seconds, possibly restoring a situation prior to the impact against a wall or against an opponent. This power-up is only available once per run, but by scoring a certain number of points it can also be used again. Slipping into an opponent's slipstream and keeping close to him will decrease his 'emotional' energy bar, let's call it that, and lead him into error. The technical aspect Milestone is used to not disappointing its fans, also and above all as regards the technical realization of the games. SCAR is no exception, so much so that it doesn't seem like a multiplatform title (the PS2 and PC versions come out practically at the same time, while the Xbox version is on the way). The engine that moves the many polygons on the screen, in fact, suffers very rarely and generally performs well, managing both the cars and the magnificent landscapes in a convincing way. If for the cars it has already been said thatthey are well made and very faithful to their real counterparts, the tracks deserve a separate discussion: halfway between reality and fantasy, in their urban incarnations they offer an exceptional show for the eyes, reproducing famous and rather familiar scenarios. The lighting effects are also excellent, which give realism to the backgrounds. The game offers numerous views: the classic one from behind the car, the first-person view (with or without a view of the bonnet) and an interesting variant from above, which is very convenient for evaluating distances well. It is also possible to check the position of the opponents, either by looking in the mirror or from the side. The sound sector consists of a series of well-made effects and, as anticipated, of the remixes of Morricone's music. It is a musical score of excellent workmanship, able to further underline the ~Italian style~ that permeates the game. And it could not be otherwise Comment SCAR addresses the ~Gran Turismo 4~ issue in the most logical way, that is, without acting as the real antagonist of the Polyphony title. In fact, the new Milestone-branded product represents something new, at least in part, for the world of racing games: the RPG elements were not put there by chance, and make the races something different from the usual, an experience in in which strategy and precision are rediscovered instead of the ease typical of arcade racers. Extremely long-lived, visually exceptional, enhanced by a signed soundtrack, Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo is a title that should be seriously considered by all fans of racing games, especially by those looking for something different from the usual. Pros: Exceptional scenarios for workmanship and detail Innovative and satisfying hybrid structure Cons: Merciless in controlling the car Sensitivity of the alternate controls Car and engine enthusiasts in general regard the Alfa Romeo brand with respect, and not by chance: it is a historic car manufacturer, one of the most prestigious, which has given and continues to give a lot to the racing world as well. The new Milestone title looks a lot like a tribute, in this sense, given that it will allow you to compete only on board Alfa Romeo cars, old and new, all characterized by the same charm. The Italian talent is not only represented on the screen by polygonal models that faithfully reproduce the entire range of the car manufacturer in great detail, including custom-built ones, but it is also revealed in the soundtrack, composed of music by Ennio Morricone, duly remixed for the 'occasion. Well, as an incipit, you couldn't ask for more...", "date": "2005-06-09", "grade": null}
