{"name": "La recensione di Rust", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/194937-rust-la-recensione-di-rust.html", "text": "Rust is a brutal game, a digital hell populated by beings who revel in barbarism. It all starts with a stone, a large stone that becomes an extension of the body, a Kubrickian symbol of evolution, a tool for eating, building, growing and stealing. Stealing everything possible from the dead and their homes, starting out as simple huts that often turn into labyrinths designed to discourage looters. Inside there are objects and materials accumulated with hard work, the backbone of every survivalist, often mixed with what is collected from aerial supplies, occasional murders and organized expeditions that can guarantee immediate resources, weapons and access to very useful projects. And to get them it's well worth killing someone, even if in Rust you often kill regardless. You kill to mark your territory, to deter future threats and even to tease reactions, in search of adrenaline shots that make sense of the time between one wipe and another. Death in Rust is a faithful companion and it is also in a group although the worst torture is for those who try the path of solitary play and risk an ordeal from post-traumatic shock unless they play on a deserted server. A five year road In the merry island of Rust even the chickens start a fight and it is common to see armed human beings chasing merry nudists destined to end up on their backs a few moments after their coming into the world. Some more powerful groups even enjoy blocking the buildings of others, while others engage in the systematic destruction of their neighbors and have no qualms about waiting for the arch-enemies of the moment to all be asleep. On the other hand, structures are vulnerable, disconnection does not secure our possessions and not even automatic defenses can do much in the face of the constant commitment of those who live to impose themselves on others. And if in the best case the players who are not part of our group represent an interesting challenge, in the worst they are entities that aim to arouse anger by not giving a damn about creating an atmosphere that today we would define as toxic, forcing us to have to carefully choose the server in which play. But even in the best of situations imaginable, it's still good to always be ready to get your claws out. In Rust every meeting can quickly turn into a massacre and even if someone extends a hand in pity for our poverty, turning your back on them is never a good idea. It's not because Rust's most terrifying weapon isn't the AK 47 or even that stone from which everything is born. Rust's most fearsome weapon is deception and the only tool to fight it is a fast, close-knit and decisive team. And that's what Rust players like, a title whose alpha has been going on for five years and which hasn't encountered any revolutionary changes since leaving the Early Access dimension. In addition to the price, which has almost doubled, what changes are the graphic rendering, once again clearly improved, and the pace of the updates that will be released on a monthly basis in the standard version and on a daily basis in the one, now stand alone, called staging. And it is in this that vehicles, structural improvements and promised evolutions for the future of Rust will probably appear first by a team that remains entirely at work on a project that, despite the exit from Early Access, is still on the high seas. But that doesn't mean he hasn't come a long way in the past five years. A five-year period that has brought us a completely new client, official servers for 400 players, a real fauna, tons of objects to build, new interactions, new parameters, anti-cheat systems and a myriad of fixes, sound effects and other tweaks. Once the flying doors and other more or less sensational bugs were resolved, we really saw everything, including the addition of assorted eyebrows and nudity that take a back seat to the evolution of artificial life, but they are still pieces of a title that has constantly enriched with interactions, materials, projects and sound effects, even allowing us to hide part of our belongings underground. And to all this the latest patch, the one we could define as a launch, adds new tooltips, gherkins with the risk of botulism, better lighting, the terrifying Frog Boots, new effects, improvements to vegetation, animals now linked to their respective climatic zones and countless fixes and balances ranging from the immediate availability of the double metal door to the recoil of the AK47. They are not radical changes, even if it is a decidedly rich patch, but as we have already said, the umpteenth update of a title still in development and whichit will soon welcome more substantial news, which will add to a long work that has taken us far from the first and ramshackle Rust. Groundhog day The work carried out in these five years has also had a drastic impact from a technical point of view, putting us in front of credible mountains, realistic water, real-time reflections and depth of field. All seasoned with a substantial improvement in the animations, although that of the jump is still horrible, and by an intense atmosphere supported by the traces in perfect post-apocalyptic style, by the torches that can be glimpsed at a huge distance in the dark night, with increasingly lively and with increasingly evolved effects. And with this latest patch the result, although overall lower than the most recent survivals, is really valuable. The improvement to the vegetation, which ranges from the yield of the foliage to the introduction of new tree variants, is undoubtedly the most visible, but the technical evolution embraces every aspect starting from the water courses to get to the icebergs. Thanks to all this, the new version of Rust has managed to shake off the patina of an eternal independent title and although the result does not reach the peaks reached by other younger survival games, it gives us valuable glimpses, while weighing on the performance of a title that at the base still remains modest. What hasn't changed is the substance we had to deal with as soon as we set foot in a populous Italian server. The first human we met after the servers restarted gave us a pair of pants to cover our shame. The second greeted us and then treacherously killed us. The third chased us away shouting abuse and convinced us to take shelter in a less busy area. The same area chosen by a ravenous bear that sent us sprawling in an instant. Rather annoyed, we came back to life, we made another gallop running away from anything that moved and we finally managed to build something, fishing with both hands in the large number of immediately available projects whose increase has increased, month month after month, the survival chances of newbies, casual players, and players overwhelmed by stronger groups. Possibilities that also include peaceful interactions, as in the case of automatic vendors, in a landscape that embraces senseless violence but surprises us with some pleasant variations on the theme. In fact, there are servers based exclusively on sandbox and construction, there is a battle royale variant that combines the mechanics of the game with quick games and there is no shortage of modifications of all kinds, including one that allows you to create and manage a clan. The horizon is wide and the population large enough for us to try every variation. With the arrival of the latest update there are about 30,000 players active at the same time, not counting the thousands queued on the official servers, 20,000 of which are scattered between the Community and Modded servers. Many flocked to admire the new graphic layout, but it is still clear that Rust is a living reality, although it still has to deal with forced wipes or wipes made necessary by technical issues, resets that are antithetical to the goal of creating those persistent worlds that we imagined five years ago. Such an approach, among other things devoid of any system to manage crime and the economy, forces players to start from scratch on time and makes it difficult to create those complex communities that we imagined five years ago. But a large part of the interest of active Rust players revolves around the instability of worlds that are promptly reset, upsetting the balances that have previously been created and renewing the fierce race for the survival of the fittest.", "date": "2018-02-11", "grade": "8.5"}
