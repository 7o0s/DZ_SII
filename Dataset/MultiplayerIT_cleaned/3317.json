{"name": "Hearthstone: La Discesa dei Draghi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hearthstone-la-discesa-dei-draghi-recensione.html", "text": "Hearthstone 2019 closes with the review of The Descent of the Dragons, an expansion published by Blizzard a few days ago, just in time for us to slap a few slaps in the tavern ahead of Christmas. However, the year of the card game linked to the world of Warcraft also closes with the awareness of having done better than the previous one, thus managing to regain control of a situation that in 2018 had appeared quite worrying. With The Ascent of Shadows and Saviors of Uldum, the so-called Team 5 has in fact taken over the fate of Hearthstone, providing a pair of expansions that have given new life to the game on the occasion of the Year of the Dragon. There was therefore a lot of curiosity around The Descent of the Dragons on the part of fans, above all to understand if Blizzard had been able to close in a positive way while waiting for the next rotation to arrive in April. We have therefore spent these last few days in the company of Galakrond and his henchmen, to try to understand their possible impact on Hearthstone. 140 new cards: Galakrond and his brood Descent of Dragons connects its narrative cue to what is told through the previous expansions, thus completing the plan of Rafaam and his Legion of M.A.L.E. to awaken the proto-dragon Galakrond, progenitor of all dragonkind. The Warrior, Thief, Priest, Shaman and Sorcerer classes can thus count on the Hero card of the powerful creature, which, like all the others of its type, replaces our character once played. Its peculiarity lies in having a battle cry that can be upgraded through the use of the new Invocation keyword, linked to some of the new cards in the set. By playing a card with Invocation, you get an immediate effect that depends on the class of the deck, allowing Galakrond to increase its power at the same time. The experience we've had these days with Descent of Dragons allows us to say that the most powerful dynamics related to Galakrond belong to the Shaman, and in fact Blizzard has announced in record time some nerfs arriving this week to fix the shot. In fact, with each Invocation a 2/1 elemental with Assault is summoned, thus allowing together with the use of the Lackeys to take control of the game in a relatively simple way. It must be said that even in the face of such a massive use of the archetype and of some cards like the one we are witnessing, such a sudden nerf still sounds strange. In fact, it has already happened in the past that apparently unbeatable archetypes found countermeasures within a few weeks, the time necessary for those who build decks to become fully aware of all the new cards. It is probable that Blizzard has decided to move taking into consideration the situation of the Shaman prior to Descent of Dragons, already strong enough, to try to smooth out the discontent expressed by the players already previously. In any case, Galakrond's dynamics appear quite also strong for other classes related to the proto-drake. In particular, in our opinion, the Warrior has excellent potential, thanks to the possibility of obtaining three attack points for each Invocation. Considering that his Galakrond summons random demons and is therefore the only one without immediate effects on the game, the only one that seems a little further behind is the Sorcerer. But obviously never say never: we wouldn't be surprised to see a new handlock variant (from this point of view the possibility of keeping twelve cards in your hand thanks to Valdris helps) enter the meta by force. The side missions Not having a Galakrond to count on for Hunter, Druid, Mage and Paladin, Blizzard had to study some alternative dynamics to try to make even the classes that do not belong to the Legion of M.A.L.E. The idea that jumped into the minds of Team 5 was to create a series of secondary missions, which can be combined with the main ones in a similar way to what happens in some classes for secrets. Compared to the primary quests, the secondary ones are not guaranteed in the opening hand and are obviously weaker. At the same time, however, they require less effort to complete and can thus be completed in a matter of a few turns, or even in some cases in a single turn. Even if the usual speech of an immature meta that will undoubtedly evolve in the next few days is always valid, at the moment the secondary missions did not seem particularly capable of redefining the game dynamics, except perhaps for a Face Hunter who uses of the Toxic Reinforcements sidequest to bring three Tainted Gnomes onto the field.Even without making use of the secondary missions, the classes that do not have Galakrond among their ranks can still try to have their say: the most striking example is that of the Druid, who is still played quite a lot in this phase even if the cards of the new missions have not found particular uses in the construction of decks. In fact, we must not forget that together with Galakrond many other dragons have arrived to populate the Hearthstone meta, and it is in fact the Dragon Druid that has spread in these early hours. Cards like Enlargement (+2/+2 to all minions in the deck for a +1 mana cost) and Breath of Dreams (draw a card and get a mana crystal with a dragon in hand) immediately showed up as attractive for those who love the ability of this class to bring large creatures into play, together with Ysera the Unstoppable who, with her seven portals in the deck, allows (with the right interactions) to summon random dragons. Even the Magician can say that he has received a good treatment, thanks to the introduction of Malygos, Aspect Magic and the new Giant of Mana: also in this case, however, it is precisely the side missions that convince us less. Among the classes mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph, it is therefore that of the Paladin that appears further behind than the others. At the moment, Uther's class looks like a work in progress, which will probably be completed during the next expansions. The presence of in the list of cards of the Lightforged Zealot makes Purity Paladin a fairly concrete possibility for the future, but which at present, however, does not have enough coverage to become competitive on a par with other decks present in the meta. Before concluding, a last note regarding the creation of the cards present in The Descent of the Dragons. The designs created for the new expansion seemed to us more beautiful than those of the last published sets of cards, which in turn were made in an excellent way as per Blizzard tradition. Our passion for these creatures perhaps makes our judgment a little biased, but some cards (especially in their golden version!) deserve to be in decks just for their beauty.", "date": "2019-12-16", "grade": "7.8"}
