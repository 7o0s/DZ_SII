Cuckoo! Arabian slug... This time... It's war! Although the fifth chapter is already circulating in the room, Metal Slug 3 remains one of the best, the perfect epicenter of the philosophy of this saga. Comic book style, unbridled irony and lots of blazing action. Like the previous episodes, the game presents a war setting clearly inspired by the Second World War, in which the shabby heroes of the moment give them thrashing to heavily armed Nazi troops, but with strong sci-fi digressions that include aliens, Mayan divinities and all that a sick mind can give birth to. For beginners, it is a purely horizontal scrolling 2D shoot em up (although there are variations and crossroads in the paths), in which two players can participate in a cooperative. Four characters to choose from, all guerrillas with a widely insane characterization, engaged in furious battles culminating in the canonical final megaboss. The power ups on duty are inevitable, represented by prisoners to be freed, who will reward the noble gesture with devastating weapons. These include everything: from machine guns worthy of a Comanche helicopter, missile launchers and laser beams (!), the minimum wage to keep up with the war apotheosis that is unleashed on the screen. Metal Slug 3 is a difficult title, which forces the gamer to considerable virtuosity, not always sufficient to manage the enormous digital chaos unleashed by the programmers. The game overs are therefore inevitable and copious, considering that a well-aimed blow is enough to bring down the protagonists. In the hardest parts various heavy vehicles that can be controlled by the player come to the aid, in this case an energy bar is made available which indicates the health of the supports, particularly important in the last, endless level. The last, epic level Okay, panic Insert coins As previously mentioned, the demented madness of the authors seems to have no limits, and in the 5 levels the impossible can really happen. Just to give an example, in the second one you will have to cross a field infested with ravenous zombies, with the risk of being infected by their vomit, and walk around in search of the antidote. Later we will even find ourselves in an Egyptian tomb, perhaps in the guise of a mummy who uses his explosive head to defeat enemies! In short, the game features humorous gimmicks that elicit more than a smile, and the last level is almost a tribute to vertically scrolling shoot em ups, with sessions that even refer to the legendary Galaga. The Xbox conversion is predictably flawless, and fixes the arcade hitches, making it even better. The quality of the sprites, palettes and animations is beyond the levels of excellence, with an artistic quality that is difficult to find in similar products, equal only to Capcom's 2d. The Xbox conversion is predictably perfect, and fixes the slowdowns of the arcade, thus resulting even superior Insert coins The audio is adequately noisy and pleasant, with alienating music and a plethora of screams that accompany the cheerful massacre. The difficulty of the game is high, which betrays the typical coin-eating nature of the arcade, but the presence of 9 credits for the continue and the possibility of choosing the starting level once completed, make it easy to finish. There are some bonus modes that can be unlocked after finishing the main one (a task that is certainly not impossible, given the conditions). It really does happen... Pest control Metal Slug 3 is a perfect (but belated) conversion of the arcade original, with marginal additions that relatively lengthen a certainly not exemplary longevity. A hilarious and graphically phenomenal title, but which compared to today's panorama, demonstrates the full weight of the four years that have passed since its release. The two-dimensional setting and the archaic gameplay (basically it's about shooting and avoiding shots) give a retrogaming flavor that will fascinate only the old fans. More could and should have been done on the side of additional modes, especially as regards the exploitation of the Live service, here limited to online scores. Certainly a purchase to be weighed carefully, considering that the market offers products of much greater depth. Pros: Perfect conversion. Excellent2d graphics Very funny Cons: Certainly not long-lived Shows the weight of the years Live limited to the scores Arcade perfect. It has always been every gamer's dream to enjoy a perfect replica of the arcade original in the comfort of their own home. Yet in the past there were wealthy users who experienced these emotions, leaving all console and personal users at a loss in terms of technical performance and arcade feeling. We're talking about that technical marvel called Neo Geo, the high-performance SNK console that eliminated any technological gap between the cabinet and the living room, and the reason was simple: it was the same machine. Nowadays this situation represents the custom, just look at the cabinet versions of Xbox and Gamecube, but at the time it was no small achievement.", "date": "2005-01-13", "grade": null}
