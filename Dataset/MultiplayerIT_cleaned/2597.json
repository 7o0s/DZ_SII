{"name": "Dark Reign 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-reign-2.html", "text": "Not to lose your compass.. The visual is naturally configurable at will but don't think that there is necessarily a correspondence with the sad combination of ~free but dispersive~, a rather unpleasant characteristic of some titles of this genre. Several standard views have been set that can be selected with a few keys that cover all the useful angles from the classic bird's eye view with which your crew will look like a mass of worker ants to the super-close one, so super that you can see the pimples of the young girls infantry recruits... Joking aside, it's nice to have set visuals that act as a reference point in order to avoid losing control of the situation, leaving the spectacular nature of some shots unchanged. If we then add that four keys immediately turn on the cardinal points and that whoever owns the infamous mouse wheel can get up and down from the ground as he pleases, I'd say we're here. Some may argue that it is not easy to get familiar with the commands, at least initially and in fact I have never claimed the opposite. On the other hand, I don't seem to remember a 3D RTS title that can boast the award ~even a baby can maneuver me immediately and perfectly~, right? So don't worry if initially you spend a few bad minutes listening to the death rattles of your fellow soldiers while you busily frame them (it would take the legendary Funari: - Give me 1, give me 2 -) with the right camera... consistency sooner or later pays off! A heavy legacy Dark Reign 2 doesn't pretend to be a game-changing title and it does well, for two reasons: 1) It couldn't. Although tested, the game scheme represents the classic collect-build-go and destroy rigmarole, at least as a basic concept; 2) Much better to focus on the strengths of the game, as it was done, carefully developing and enhancing them down to the smallest detail. Want some examples? Well, then ... the objectives change dynamically during the game, which is interspersed with animated cutscenes made with the same graphics engine of the game, the climatic conditions change including the alternation between night and day (and the different rendering on the field of some units compared to others), a ton of strategic situations and features such as camouflage, traps (as many as 4 different types), fire on trees, rocks or other structures to block passages, teleports from one corner of the map to another and then a whole series of power-ups that influence the behavior of the teams, etc. It's really a long list, but I'll stop here... I'm not telling you the rest to make your mouth water (I'm bastard inside) but they are things that are always actively reflected in your games, not choreographic trappings and that's it. The multiple dark realm Let's talk a little about multiplay now, and I announce that it looks good: whoever ~hosts~ a game (whether on the web or on a LAN) has the keys to change all the settings, among which I point out the handicap for players, the alteration of the general AI of the game and even the maximum amount of buildable units in the game, which can go up to 1000. Logically, with such a high number, I think the performance drops even on powerful PCs, but it's nice to know that you can go so high! Those who do not have an installed map can download it before playing and as a thank you can then enjoy distributing resources and troops to allies in absolute freedom in the game. And the modalities? Soon said ... King of the hill, Control Freak and Assault; ie, respectively, occupy the central hill of the map with a building for more than 5 minutes, gain control of 5 strategic locations in the map and finally carry out an assault on a fortification to gain possession of a portal, with 60 minutes of time to do it. In addition, there are different victory conditions, which alternate with the classic ~destroy all enemy units~ such as the Blood Bath (kill 50 enemy units first) or maps in which force fields prevent the contending from colliding, except then open at regular intervals. Summing up It's difficult to judge a game which, from what I've read on the internet, according to many people should have satisfied fans of the first title but above all brought new life and change to the genre and it seems it didn't. From my point of view I can say that it is now inevitable that aficionados of this genre feel a sense of deja-vu in front of DR2. But if for some it's just heated soup know this: I was a partial detractor of the 3D RTS precisely because I trudged to the good isometric 2D and a little hesitant in the face of the latest ~beautiful but chaotic~ trend. DR2 changed my mind because it has a balanced learning curve and I never felt at the mercy of events, unlike other games of its peers. My advice is therefore to try it absolutely and by virtue of all the details seen before and the enormous expandability and support that it will bring with it, to learn to love it... Mmmh... Here you can breathe fresh air! Tell the truth: how would you feel if after years of hard conquest you had earned the privilege of living in the best part of the earth, namely underground? Or again, how would you feel in the shoes of someone who has to live in daily contact with the radioactive atmosphere of a planet now sterile and left to itself? It matters little at this point, because whether you choose the JDA busy defending its organization or the Sprawlers intent on reclaiming better living conditions you will have to go to war. No political or diplomatic intermediation. Just the facts. This Dark Reign 2 is the direct successor of the first Dark Reign, at the time the creator of a mini-revolution in the real-time strategy field. In fact, it could boast of some goodies that for the time were a real amusement; the roughness and the conformation of the territory gave the opportunity to always resort to new tactics, since they really influenced the behavior of your units. Units which in turn were numerous and extremely expandable thanks to the periodic releases on the web of new freely downloadable buildings and troops. In these respects DR2 does not disappoint at all, indeed it enhances everything even more. Having abandoned the ancient (at least by today's standards) 2D, we are now faced with pure 3D, created thanks to a flexible engine that gives us noteworthy graphics and with minimal expenditure of system resources. In fact, the game uses a scalable polygon technology that makes everything enjoyable even on not overly powerful PCs and automatically adapts to your configuration, in order to always obtain the best aesthetic-fluidity ratio.", "date": "2001-04-26", "grade": null}
