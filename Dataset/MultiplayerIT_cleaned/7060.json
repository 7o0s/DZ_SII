Now that the game is finally available on the App Store, it's time to evaluate if Godfire is also beautiful to play as well as to see... Fire kill with me Vivid Games' ambition to offer the mobile public an experience comparable to that for home consoles is evident from the outset, starting from a scenario that without too many hesitations goes fishing in the context of Greek mythology, just like God of War: this time the protagonist is not a Spartan warrior, but the rebel Prometheus, who has always been the protagonist of stories that see him as opposed to the gods. Here the music does not change, even if it must be said that the plot is dismissed in a rather hasty and botched manner, moreover heavily penalizing all those who are not familiar with English, given that the developers seem to have forgotten to add subtitles to strictly dialogues not localized in Italian. Nothing too serious for an action game that certainly doesn't focus on the plot of the storyline, but it is still the first in a long series of naiveties that inevitably end up affecting the overall quality of Godfire. In terms of gameplay, the game is basically divided into two distinct phases, one reserved for exploration and the other for combat. In the first, Prometheus is controlled by moving him using a virtual analog stick, with the sole purpose of continuing in the level, solving some puzzles and opening the chests along the way; in the second, the screen is occupied exclusively by keys relating to the fight in progress (light and heavy blow, parries and dodging), freeing the user from the obligation to move the protagonist during the battle. A solution which, if on the one hand simplifies things as much as possible by making Godfire usable best on a touch screen, on the other hand inevitably makes it very limited. Exploration therefore soon becomes a boring filler between the various fights, which instead suffer from serious problems related precisely to the impossibility of moving at will: you cannot decide which side to dodge, nor which attack to parry, much less which enemy to face, all aspects that become particularly annoying when you find yourself surrounded by multiple opponents, or in the vast majority of occasions. Godfire is yet another testimony that beautiful graphics are not enough to make a great title Beautiful soulless In addition to all this, the Vivid Games product suffers from a strong repetitiveness that manifests itself from the first levels of the game, underlined by a stage design that does not really do its best to stem the problem. There are few combos to carry out and the enemies are always the same, unable however to constitute a real challenge (at least at the normal level of difficulty), even when it comes to the bosses: these all resort to a primitive pattern of behavior, with the user who has to do nothing but dodge their attacks and then sink when they are momentarily stunned. In fact, Godfire keeps its promises almost exclusively from an aesthetic point of view, showcasing a truly impressive cosmetic for mobile standards: the settings alternate particularly successful moments with others that are a little less inspired, while the polygonal models of the characters amaze for their solidity , level of detail and quality of the animations, including the bosses that often reach very large dimensions. The artistic direction of the title is also convincing, with a ~fusion~ interpretation of Greek mythology that brings together classic elements with technological influences, see for example the chariot of Elio which is depicted here as a sort of spaceship. It's really a pity that everything else boils down to an action game that is really too naive to leave a mark: negative aspects should be read in this sense such as excessive inertia of the protagonist's movements, which prevents you from performing an action before it is completely complete the animation related to the previous one (with immediately understandable effects when you want to try to block an opponent's attack from behind us while we are hitting the one in front), or againa really superficial management of the puzzles - so simple as to seem almost an insult to the intelligence of the users - and of the inevitable quick time events, with a single virtual button that always appears in the same position, nullifying the call to reflexes that should be the real purpose of this gaming tool.", "date": "2014-06-20", "grade": "6.5"}
