If Maelstrom's problems were only the movies, we'd quietly turn a blind eye. Too bad there are far more serious issues to deal with. The gameplay is the classic one: once you have accumulated a certain number of resources and built some buildings, you can produce quite powerful troops which, amassed in good numbers, allow you to set off to conquer the map. Except for some exploratory missions, in which you are equipped with a predefined number of vehicles, the scheme is valid for all campaigns. Apart from the questionable nature of the choice to rely on dated gameplay, the profound slowness of the various operations should also be noted, mainly due to the scarcity of one of the resources (water). On some maps, you spend an hour just setting up production. Repeat the operation for ~n~ times in which the only variable is the aggressiveness of the enemy, and you will have the idea of the repetitiveness of everything. There are actually some differences from the competition. it is precisely the terraforming that is crushed by the weight of all the other defects, remaining something interesting in itself Have we met before? For example, it is possible to directly command the individual units using a third-person view behind them. It's a pity that these moments are done so badly as to make them counterproductive: the controls are few and not very precise, the movements are slow and lack fluidity and, last but not least, with such a close-up view you can better observe the bad animations of the units, especially the human ones, which defining woody is paying him a compliment. These are boring phases that are skipped without too many regrets, where it is possible to do so. Another novelty is terraforming. The graphic aspect was sacrificed to it, impoverished precisely to allow the creation of a completely modifiable world. Nothing comparable to Company of Heroes, then, but large, low-detailed, and fully transformable maps. In fact, putting up natural fortifications or lowering the ground in order to build a building is quite fun at least at the beginning. It soon becomes clear that everything else has been sacrificed precisely in the name of this characteristic, which is the one most heralded in the press releases. I hope it gets recycled for some other game, because here it's really wasted and it's not enough by itself to raise the general level. Moreover, such a radical implementation creates major fluidity problems: cases of framerate collapse will not be rare, especially when a large number of troops are coupled with particularly complex terrain. Fortunately, the graphics engine is scalable and allows you to massively lower the level of detail, making the game usable even on not exactly pumped configurations. Unfortunately, however, there is another problem derived from this heaviness: the pharaonic loading and saving times. There is talk of 30 seconds / 1 minute for loading / saving, at least on medium configurations. In some particularly difficult moments, you spend more time looking at the loading screen than playing the game. The breakdown Despite the above, we haven't talked about Maelstrom's biggest flaw yet. After all, what has been described could correspond to a classic RTS, a bit slow, with a poorly developed new feature (direct control of the units) and another well done (terraforming). Too bad that the artificial intelligence of the troops takes care of definitively collapsing this production. It is something that has not been seen for some time and of which only the worst exponents of the genre can boast. The troops behave in a way that to call an idiot is to pay them a compliment. For example, set up a gathering point for building production near (not in) a body of water; you will see your soldiers go for a bath and thus lose some of their life points. What prevented him from staying on dry land? Moreover, always observing the accumulation of troops in any gathering point, it can be seen how they never find peace and continue to go around in circles to go and position themselves who knows where. All right, the troops aren't very disciplined and maybe feel bad standing still in muster points. Let's move them and attack an enemy. Let's select them, form a single group and click on an area close to the target  but where do they go? Why are they trying to pass there? Why don't they maintain a shred of training? Repeat this scene as many times as you have to attack some enemy in force, and you will have a clear picture of the situation: the individual members of our army, when they find a path occupied by another troop, look for alternative routes, whichit translates into traffic jams worthy of the Grande Raccordo Anulare and in the creation of long messy lines that head towards the goal in different ways and at different times. This creates the following cases: a few troops arrive at the target at a time, which allows the enemy to have fun massacring them by exploiting an involuntary funnel effect; the troops, looking for an alternative route, isolate themselves and end up against hidden enemies being massacred; the troops, always looking for an alternative route, end up in areas that damage them (they don't care at all, unfortunately) and arrive at their destination drained of energy... if they arrive. Obviously, in these conditions, talking about formations and attack strategies becomes utopian. Very often it is reduced to having the troops make short journeys to try to coordinate the movements in the best possible way, which results in great waste of time and in absurd situations that frustrate the fun. Sometimes we were forced to move individual troops by hand since they didn't want to know anything about standing still. if Maelstrom were a concert we would say that it is played by a bad orchestra, whose fortunes are not improved by even an excellent violinist Hands in the water Obviously from all these problems others arise which form a chain that leads straight to the sting. For example the first missions are really boring. And we are not talking about one or two missions but about the entire first campaign. Their problem is that they are slow, cumbersome and poorly managed. But it doesn't end there. Mixing the filmed sequences with the third person view, we found ourselves in cases where the enemies could massacre our troops because  we had positioned them in safe areas, but after a film we found them elsewhere. This is especially true for heroes, which we haven't talked about but about which there isn't much to say: these are special troops that can level up and enjoy superior powers compared to other troops. For example they can become invisible and they can heal. Too bad that a quest system has not been thought of in order to make them a little more active and less anonymous in the midst of battles between dozens of other troops. What remains is terraforming which unfortunately, due to what has been said, ends up being crushed by the weight of all the other defects, remaining something interesting in itself, but certainly not able to improve the fortunes of this game. If Maelstrom were a concert we would say that it is played by a bad orchestra, whose fortunes are not improved by even an excellent violinist.

We just can't recommend Maelstrom even if you've been drooling for months for all the press releases made around terraforming, the feature much heralded by the gameplay of this strategy. There is little to save and that little is crushed by everything else. Maybe next time it would be better to focus on the game as a whole, rather than a single feature. Pros The terraforming is well done The graphic engine is very scalable The title music is beautiful Cons AI to forget Slow as a snail Very long loading and saving times On the surface We would have liked to speak well of Maelstrom, a post-apocalyptic RTS that we have followed with some interest since the first announcements (it is not for nothing that Multiplayer.it has dedicated a good number of articles to it). The idea of terraforming applied to gameplay intrigued us. The preview versions, while presenting all the defects found in the final version, had given us hope in solving the problems before being released on the market. It wasn't like that. Sin. The story is classic: a destroyed world, the resistance against the invaders formed by the survivors, strange alien beings that seem to have sprung up out of a science fiction writer's worst nightmares ... all this translates into some campaigns with missions to face in linear sequence. Each of these is made up of missions linked together by a kind of storyline. And here the problems immediately begin. If you decide to tell a story within a video game you must necessarily study a way to do it in order to make it an active element in the gameplay or, at least, in order to make it work as gluebetween the various levels. Now, if you choose to take advantage of the more classic narrative tool after the written text, i.e. the filmed sequences, it would be appropriate to make them at least interesting. It had been years since we'd seen sequences as bad as Maelstrom's. The characters are disjointed and seem to be in constant convulsions, which lead them to gesticulate exaggeratedly and completely detached from what they are saying. The direction of these sequences is flat and lackluster. Wasn't it better to avoid them and have simple messages appear on the screen to explain the various objectives? Such bad sequences, instead of engaging, upset and make you laugh... a decidedly counterproductive effect for a scenario that, instead, claims to be serious and dramatic. And fortunately the Italian dubbers are better than those of the English version; but we are still on the surface. The real flaws of the game are to come.", "date": "2007-03-21", "grade": null}
