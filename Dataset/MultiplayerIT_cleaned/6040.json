It would be unfair to trace it back only to the release date of the first episode, 1990, because in fact we are talking about a noble daughter of the videogame culture of the early days of the medium, who has looked for a way to rejuvenate some tried and tested formulas, while remaining well established in more traditional grooves, in years in which the classic shooters, or shoot'em ups, still had their market, especially in Japan. Raiden, then developed by Seibu Kaihatsu and now in the hands of Moss, was the son of Space Invaders, of Galaga, of Xevious, of 1942, of Vulgus, to name some of his famous ancestor, but also of R-Type and Gradius and all those titles that had helped to evolve the genre in the eighties. It all ended when shooters were no longer the point of reference for action, replaced by the more technologically exhibitionistic ego shooters, or first person shooters. In a few years, only a few series of shumps have survived the commercial decline, among these precisely that Raiden which has managed to be enriched with new chapters, a parallel series and a spin-off. Of course, this is not a particularly prolific cash cow, given that the fourth chapter was released in 2007 and the fifth should be released in 2015, but between ups and downs it still managed not to disappear, coming back to the surface with various re-editions on PC and consoles. Raiden IV: Overkill will make many understand the true meaning of a hardcore video game Earth attack Having to describe the basic features of Raiden IV: Overkill we would define it as a 2.5D vertical scrolling shooter belonging to the bullet hell family, i.e. those games in which the enemies shoot a huge amount of bullets which in the advanced levels end up filling the full screen. Like all Raidens, the fourth chapter also offers the possibility of playing alone, but driving two spaceships. It is one of the hallmarks of the series, present since the first episode. Obviously you can also play with a single ship or with two ships led by different players. There are so many options and you have to indulge yourself in trying them all. The number of levels varies depending on the mode selected, but don't expect too long matches, because bullet hells are famous for the challenge they offer, certainly not for the length of the stages. Normally they are titles designed to be finished with a single session (when you get used to it, i.e. after spending a lot of money), because you certainly couldn't insert save systems in arcades. The video game is set on Earth, with a trip to space in the later levels. We spare you the details of the plot, only telling you that it is the classic canvas made up of aliens, in this case the Cranassians, eager to transform terrestrials into cans of tuna, and of very secret projects implemented by us sentient bipeds to stop them. The scenarios are created with great care, despite the fact that they scroll quickly under the eyes of the player who has little time to admire them. Even the design of the enemies is really excellent and the various alien ships still look good today, despite being reinterpretations of what was seen in the previous chapters. Of course, don't expect visual wonders, but what is there is really well done and is at the top of the genre. The whole series and where to buy it Main series Raiden (1990) Raiden II (1993) Raiden DX (1994) Raiden III (2005) Raiden IV (2007) Raiden V (planned for 2015) The Raiden Fighters Raiden Fighters (1996) Raiden Fighters 2 (1997) Raiden Fighters Jet (1998) The spin-off Viper Phase 1 (1995) Currently it is possible to play the Raiden series in its entirety on PC, not even spending too much. The first chapter and the three Fighters are included in the Raiden Legacy collection, while the third chapter can be purchased separately, in a not exactly flawless edition. The second episode, although it exists for PC, is currently unavailable in stores, both physical and digital and you have to turn to the second-hand market to hope for a copy. Raiden DX is unsalvageable and currently the only way to play it is by emulation. The same goes for the spin-off Viper Phase 1. The fifth chapter however, has been announced for Xbox One and should be released within the year. Overkill mode The fulcrum of this re-edition is the Overkill mode, the real novelty compared to the Xbox 360 version, dating back to 2008/2009, but already seen in the PlayStation 3 version, which dates back to 2014. It is essentially a new scoring system, designed to the race for records, which profoundly alters the dynamics of the game. Apparently based onThe collection of gems that have fallen from the carcasses of enemies is best expressed when it requires you to rage on the wreckage of the largest spaceships to raise the Overkill level and obtain fabulous bonuses that increase the score exponentially. This is no small addition, because it completely changes the gameplay and requires a different type of game management strategy, whose main objective, once you have seen the ending at least once, inevitably becomes the race for the highest score. high. Unfortunately for modern gamers Raiden IV offers no shortcuts in any mode you play it, be it Arcade, Overkill or any of the special ones. Bullets come from all directions, forming deadly choreographies that transform the screen into a labyrinth full of dead ends. Taking one means losing a life. The only way to make it win is to devote yourself to learning the aliens' schemes and understand how to make the most of the weapons, between main and secondary, without forgetting to always keep a finger pointed on the bomb button, the only ones that can save us when the situation is desperate. Among other innovations introduced in the PC version, the Additional mode, a variant of the Arcade mode with two new levels, the Score Attack mode, which allows you to compete for whoever gets the highest score in all the other modes, the online leaderboards, the replays, spaceships of different shapes and even extras out of the game like the official soundtrack (in digital format) and a PDF artbook full of sketches and illustrations.", "date": "2015-09-15", "grade": "9.0"}
