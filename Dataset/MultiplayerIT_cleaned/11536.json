{"name": "Medieval: Total War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medieval-total-war_a.html", "text": "Obviously, Medieval: Total War Mobile has absolutely no pretensions of recreating the typical gameplay of the original for PC on mobile, a product so complex and full of information and statistics as to put even the most savvy players in difficulty. The mobile version was therefore necessarily stripped of many elements, leaving the combat sections standing and some drafts of management practices, a section that was however decidedly placed in the background. It all begins with the choice of the nation to command (France, the Vatican State, England, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and the Ottoman Empire), each with precise pros and cons in terms of battle skills (you go from troop specialization up to the mechanical means available). From here we move on to the map of central-western Europe, where you can decide, through a few simple options, what kind of relationship to establish with your ~neighbors~. Obviously, you will inevitably end up declaring war on someone (fortunately you are only allowed to face one kingdom at a time), and this is where Medieval takes off, or rather should take off. In fact, the combat sections by no means represent the best exploit of the genre on mobile phones, proving to be very slow and orphaned of a particular thickness. The only discriminating factors in play are the various types of units and the status effects that some parts of the scenario can inflict on them. For the rest, Medieval is also a rather trivial strategic game, in which one wearily limits oneself to moving one's troops and passing the turn to an enemy AI that is anything but brilliant. It goes without saying that with these assumptions the actual duration of the game has a very relative importance: Medieval: Total War on paper is a fairly long title (a good 40 battles to face), but if most of the time spent with it is made of cumbersome navigation between the menus and waiting between one move and another, it is evident that we are not really talking about a quality. However, a pass-the-handset multiplayer mode intervenes to save the situation, which compensates for many of the shortcomings of the single-player campaign. The rundown is closed by a mediocre technical realization, at times even below the -already rather low- standards of the genre, both in terms of graphics (really bland) and in terms of sound, practically non-existent.
