Obviously, when you find yourself handling a similar subject, the first question you need to ask yourself is how to make a videogame translation that satisfies veteran players of the original and newbies who may be intrigued by the theme and style of play, but don't want to go crazy with numbers and tables. Cyanide Studio has chosen the arduous path of reinterpreting a classic gameplay, but making it more challenging than the average. So we can select and move the heroes with the mouse, activate special abilities always with the mouse or with keyboard shortcuts and so on. From this point of view there is really nothing that can put an expert user in difficulty. If you want, there is no key that highlights interactable objects, such as levers or chests, but you quickly get used to it. But we will talk about this aspect later because the interactions deserve further study. The most accurate part, and also the one that gives the clashes great depth, is the management of the characters. Each hero's file is divided into different sectors: characteristics, skills, armour, primary weapon and, if necessary, secondary. If the first entry is self-evident and the second clarifies that everyone has six unlockable and upgradeable skills by spending the points accumulated by leveling up, the others don't require an explanation. Weapons and armor are not upgraded by leveling up or finding better pieces, but by collecting points from racks and then distributing them on equipment-related upgrades. Each point awarded yields one boost and excludes another. Starting from a certain point in the game, then, around you can collect glyphs of different colors that yield other powers. Fight to win! The fights work very similar to what we saw in Baldur's Gate or in Dragon Age: Origins: you explore the scenarios in real time and, when you see enemies or are spotted, you can choose how to attack by pausing and selecting actions to be performed by each character (it is also possible to create sequences of actions). There are also small variations, with stealthy characters who can carry out lethal surprise attacks or can sneak past enemies to try and attack them at the right moment. Skills are different for each hero, and learning how to use them is vital to winning. Starting the charge without studying an attack strategy is often equivalent to dying. Speaking of death, when the characters go down they don't die immediately, but they have a period of unconsciousness before expiring. When they are knocked down, any conscious companion can step in to heal them, both in combat and afterward. In the first case, the healer is completely exposed to enemy attacks, so you have to be careful. So far the description is that of a good game with certainly interesting features. Unfortunately there are several downsides to consider. The first is the texture. Confrontation tells of a war that has lasted many years and a group of heroes sent behind enemy lines to infiltrate the laboratories of the Scorpion race to figure out what they are up to. Hence a rather obvious story that we will not detail so as not to upset your digestion. Everything is told by writings and filmed sequences made with the game engine which are certainly not exceptional. Obviously this is a problem that could easily be overlooked, were it not that High vacuum At first it's hard to understand why the characters in Confrontation don't have an inventory. They have weapons, sure, and some of them have two equipment configurations, both of which can be upgraded in the way explained above. It's only after exploring a couple of maps that you understand everything: around the levels you can't find anything to take. Enemies leave no loot, and in the sparse chests you cross there are only bandages that are used to heal the deepest wounds (someone needs to explain why scorpions waste time putting bandages inside chests and why they waste troops defending them) . Among the other interactable objects there are only levers and various machines, which then all have the same function: to open doors and passages. In some cases there are small puzzles to solve, but that's really all. This chronic lack of interactions makes some rather soporific passages, especially the first levels which, however, should be the most engaging.Later things improve, also because the fights become more challenging and exciting, but before reaching the best stages you have to accept to duel even with tedium. We therefore find ourselves wandering around large empty maps, often with recycled graphic elements, in search of the next enemy to take down or some lever to pull. Another major defect of Confrontation is linked to wandering, namely the path finding which is bad and full of problems. How else to describe characters who end up stranded on their own, or others who get stuck trying to reach their intended enemy? Multiplayer and graphics In short, there are few things to do and there are more than a few bugs, but how is the multiplayer? It's honestly not easy to say. We tried to play, but the lag often hurt the games irreparably. Perhaps the problem is that we faced distant opponents (we play one-on-one and there are very few Italians), but it wasn't easy to finish a match in a decent way. What we can say is that the gaming options are few and that elsewhere we have seen much better in every sector. Technically, Confrontation isn't great either. We have already mentioned the recycling of graphic objects, but it is all the production that is on a very medium level of detail. From this point of view, the biggest flaw, made worse by being a transposition of a wargame with really well done miniatures and artwork, is the ugliness of some three-dimensional models.", "date": "2012-04-10", "grade": "6.5"}
