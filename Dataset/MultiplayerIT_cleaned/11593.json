{"name": "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-budokai-tenkaichi-3.html", "text": "Budokai you're okay In the preview phase, Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 had captured everyone's attention due to the curiosity aroused by how the peculiar control system of the Nintendo console would be exploited: fans fantasized about the idea of being able to perform the moves of their favorites simply mimicking its movements via motion sensor, a hope that to be honest has translated into a less exciting but still noteworthy reality. But let's go in order: apart from the aspect just mentioned, little or nothing changes here on Wii compared to the PS2 version, starting with the numerous modes available. We therefore have the Story of the Dragon, or an episodic story mode in which the most important events of the manga are transformed into fights complete with dialogues and cutscenes in the middle; the second section is instead called Supreme Battle, and is made up of four distinct modes: Dragon Sim (in which you have to train your character, send him in search of objects and finally make him fight to bring him to a higher level), Mission 100 (comparable to classic Scenario Mode), Disc Fusion (which allows you to insert the discs of the two prequels to unlock secret battles) and a hidden mode that resolves into a simple Survival. Dragon World Tour then gives you the opportunity to try your hand at the classic Tenkaichi Tournament and its five variants; the full-bodied package is finally completed by the Duel modes, Z Evolution (to buy items and create customized warriors), Supreme training, Data Center (where you can enter a password to recover a character created from scratch, check those already saved and watch replays archived) and Character Reference, a comprehensive encyclopedia on all the characters that appear in the game. The multiplayer mode deserves a different discussion, here in the double role of split screen and online: unfortunately, in both cases, Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 does not fully convince, on the one hand due to the reduced view and on the other due to some frequent lag. However, it is a venal sin after all for a title that offers such a quantity of elements: in addition to the overwhelming wealth of modalities, in fact, the frightening carnet of available wrestlers should also be considered, including as many as 150 characters taken from the comic (including some nice guest stars such as Arale, the protagonist of another famous work by Toriyama). Of course, it must also be said that the differences between the various fighters are little more than aesthetic, seen and considered how moves and skills remain substantially the same, but the impact is still truly remarkable. With only the laying on of hands As reiterated several times in the review of the PS2 version, in terms of gameplay Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 presents significant improvements compared to the previous ones, offering a combat system that is decidedly not very technical and deep but still agile and fun: throwing an opponent to dozens of meters away at the push of a button won't be the pinnacle of ~gaming professionalism,~ but it's unquestionably exhilarating. The control system via Remote and Nunchuck certainly contributes to this sensation -albeit minimally-, not as revolutionary as perhaps some expected but still capable of doing its job well. The basic functions are assigned to the four main keys, while the movement of the two controllers is requested for moves such as sprints or the execution of special shots: in this case, the user must mimic the movements described by an icon on the screen , for example by bringing the hands back and pushing them forward immediately after to launch the well-known energy wave. Everything works very well and is also quite satisfying, but for all those who do not like to put on a show or make too much effort, it is still possible to use a Classic Controller or even the old Gamecube pad. Despite a rather subtle combat system, Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 manages to avoid repetitiveness thanks to some clever tricks: in addition to the aforementioned amount of modes and characters, help is also provided by a level of difficulty that is always calibrated to the right point , gradual enough and that never makes life too easy for the player. Between one thing and another, Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 also finds time to be appreciated for its graphics, the quality of which stands out above all in the polygonal models of the various characters, extremely faithful to Toriyama's designs and embellished by a skilful use of cel shading. The settings, on the other hand, are extensive, even if rather bare, while the frame rate and special effectsstand on standards that are absolutely up to the situation. Some less praise instead for the sound, composed of trash-rock music of dubious taste and an excessively over-the-top English dubbing (even if it is possible, and advisable, to switch to the Japanese version). Comment Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is a beat'em up that certainly won't go down in history for the depth of its playful structure, but which is certainly appreciated for some features of undoubted importance: quantity of modes and characters, spectacularity and accessibility of the game action and a good technical capacity that never hurts. Also strong in a non-revolutionary but still interesting control system, Dragonball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is undoubtedly one of the best video game transpositions of the Toriyama saga.
