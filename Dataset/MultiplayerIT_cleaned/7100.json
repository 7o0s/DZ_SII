The most obvious change, as we already said in the preview, concerns the graphics while the gameplay remains linked to the advancement of cover in search of crucial positions to conquer and points to obtain. The points obtained can then be spent on additional units such as heavy tanks that can allow us to penetrate enemy lines more quickly and are the key to getting by in both single player and multiplayer modes. In all of this, micromanagement plays a fundamental role which includes the use of means such as infantry cover, the positioning of the units with the relative guard direction, the management of the ammunition and good timing in relation to the almost never frenetic dynamics of a title that prefers tactics to the stopwatch. The formula, in essence, is the classic one of Men of War and in this Assault Squad 2 there is the possibility, characteristic of the series, of directly controlling one of our soldiers. It is an interesting mode that determines the loss of part of the overview, which is problematic in multiplayer, but which allows you to maximize the use of heavy units and allows you to directly hit snipers and other particularly threatening enemy units. The campaign offers many of these situations and is quite rich in peculiar events even if many of the 40 missions are played in re-editions of maps already seen in the series. In all of this we must then take into account that the multiplayer is resolved almost exclusively around a single mechanic, given that the main methods are focused on the conquest of the aforementioned nodes through which the resources necessary to strengthen one's army are obtained. But we must still testify that the formula works well in combination with the complex game of covers and that is enough to give the title the specificity necessary to stand out in the large panorama of real-time strategy. Even in sixteen-player multiplayer games, set in new specially created maps, it is not difficult to see more or less sustained stalemates over time and the Battlefront mode further enhances this peculiarity of Men of War by giving us intense, long and full of opportunities to fight be worth. If the opponent knows what he is doing and has correctly positioned the troops, it is almost impossible to launch rash rushes and this factor is important to leave the players the space necessary to pay attention to the micro-management dimension of the title. Are the novelties of Men of War: Assault Squad 2 enough to justify the purchase? Looking for novelty With over two hundred units, forty missions and several multiplayer scenarios, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is more than satisfactory from a quantitative point of view. Most of the uncertainties related to the early access version have disappeared and between reflections, textures, increased destructibility and density of detail, the graphics have improved not in a revolutionary way but clearly. The most advanced lighting gives a completely different meaning to the dark at night and the evident improvements relating to vehicle damage add realism to the clashes that include the vehicles. We're not talking about a technological marvel and the models of the soldiers still leave something to be desired but the step forward is clearly visible and there are elements of absolute value as in the case of the bodies of water. Too bad that, although Assault Squad 2 is extremely rich in content and quite pleasant to look at, the recycled material represents a good portion of the offer and the lack of important news is felt. A small evolution relating to multiplayer is not enough and the technical improvements are valid but certainly cannot appease the growing desire for a real sequel. In all of this we must also highlight that the direct control method is still incomplete and full of rough edges. The bad handling of the camera and the woody and imprecise movement are clear signs of how the game engine is designed for anything but and needs a small revolution to finally be able to support what could be a considerable strength. In addition, stealth missions that enhance direct control have decreased, allowing you to explore the map with greater circumspection, without highlighting the problems of a useful but still crude option. The improvements are instead marked if we take into consideration the usability factor. The title enjoys full Steam support and this facilitates, thanks to Steamworks, the condiview of the contents created or modified with the more than valid and rather intuitive editor. Furthermore, the Valve infrastructure greatly facilitates the search for multiplayer games and, as icing on the cake, we find a significantly improved interface. The HUD is in fact more intuitive and includes more precise indicators to identify our teams as well as also offering us a command, quite useful in the most agitated clashes, to highlight which faction the fallen are. To all this we must then add full support for multi-core CPUs and the non-essential but welcome addition of camouflage skins that make the units more consistent with the geographical and seasonal context of the maps.", "date": "2014-05-26", "grade": "7.0"}
