{"name": "Dungeons & Dragons Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dungeons-dragons-heroes_a.html", "text": "Shadows and dust The beginning of the game is certainly one of the most promising: an epic FMV introduces the player to the not too articulated plot of D&D Heroes. The prelude shows the final battle, which took place 150 years before the events that will be faced, between four indomitable heroes and a very powerful wizard named Kaedin, guilty of having brought death and destruction in order to satisfy his thirst for power. Exhausted and practically on their knees, the four champions of justice manage to defeat the tyrant who, despite the advanced agony, unleashes a last devastating spell, resulting in the death of all the combatants. After 150 years, and therefore arrived in the era in which the narrative plot of the game will develop, the world is once again threatened by Kaedin, exhumed by a group of unconscious clerics, clueless to the point of believing they can govern such a power . The counter-move of the ~good~ ones focuses in one direction: to resurrect those who had the courage and ability to defeat the powerful wizard in the past. Four executioners, four heroes. At this point the ball passes to the player, who will have to opt for one of the classes available in the game. Race classes, class races Human-Warrior A first-rate fighter, capable with sword skill alone to destroy hordes of monsters. Over the course of the game, he will be able to refine his techniques with moves of both high power and enormous strategic power. Magician-Elf In this class lies mystical strength, which will compensate for the poor aptitude for physical combat with powerful elemental spells of all invoices. Thief-Elf Shrewd, diminutive, and cunning. Three adjectives to describe the most particular class of the entire game. Skilled with daggers and a bow, the thief will also have the ability to break into the locks of the chests as well as the possibility of having discounts on the purchase of goods. Cleric-Dwarf His is a predominant role in the game, although his features are not exactly encouraging. In fact, combat and healing skills reside at the same time in the dwarf. At my signal, unleash hell The wait for this Atari-branded title was justifiably high for two factors: the great interest that lies behind everything related to Dungeons & Dragons and the possibility of playing simultaneously with three friends without the aid of the split screen. In fact, the most attentive will remember the biggest flaw that afflicted Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, or a multiplayer mode that allowed only two players to cooperate within the adventure. This is why Atari has done its utmost to give its creation all the variations of the case. The game is a western-style action-RPG heavily devoted to hack & slash, which will feature large hordes of enemies taken directly from the sets of the original game. It begins with the usual selection of one's alter ego among four characters of class, race and very specific attributes: a human warrior, a dwarf cleric, a thief and a wizard belonging to the race of elves. Creating a balanced character will be a meticulous work, in which it will be necessary to take into account many details: the equipment and its weight; offensive, defensive and evasion skills; as well as all the parameters of the characteristics, which will evolve at the discretion of the player. Once you have selected the hero that best suits your needs, we start with a tutorial, just to get used to the intuitive control system. In this sense, Atari has really worked well, providing its action-RPG with an easy-to-use control interface, despite the large number of possibilities offered to the player. Basically, the historic software house has done nothing but allocate some keys of the Xbox pad to very specific actions, leaving three of the four fronts free to be configured in-game; moreover, in order not to make the maneuver too chaotic, he has implemented a sort of slowdown of the action. The result is excellent, as well as the varied battalion of enemies: Hobgoblin, Draw, Golem and Mind Flayer just to name a few; all with their own unique stats, abilities, and attack patterns. Facing a Hobgoblin who prefers a head-on collision will not lead the player to have the same approach as fighting a Mind Flayer, a sorcerer with devastating telekinetic powers. The shadow line To invalidate a gameplay so far full of ideas is precisely the shadow of the past, in other words Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, the maximum exponent of the genre on consoles. From the first steps taken in the game you will have the clear and clear sensation of deja vu. It all leads back to the Snowblind Studios title: from game menus to character creation, from settings to skills. There will even be an identical boss located roughly at the same point in the evolution of the story of BGDA, or in the middle of the game. Sure, both titles make use of the same set of board game rules, but Atari hasn't done much to remove that already seen halo from its product. It almost seems that he has drawn liberally from a successful product to be on the safe side, obtaining, however, the opposite effect to the intended one. Polygonal alchemy In other words: from stars to rags. We started with great pomp, and then diminished slightly, up to the technical realization, the real weak point of the Atari title. Graphically Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes gets along without infamy and without praise, presenting poorly defined polygonal models and with animations that are not always up to par. All in all, the settings don't look bad, even if much more can be expected from hardware like the Xbox one. The same goes for the effects which, except for the spot-on motion blur present on all heat sources, are practically reduced to the bone. The most painful note concerns the frame rate, made insecure by a polygonal engine often in trouble, even if partially justified by the large number of enemies constantly present on the screen. The camera, for its part, gets along really well, offering the player all the necessary dynamism and framing freedom. The sound sector is rather anonymous, which if on the one hand presents good and precise effects, on the other it disfigures for background reasons that are anything but inspired. Comment Dungeons & Dragons Heroes is an enjoyable title, which rises to power when played in company. The good ideas proposed by Atari lose part of their value when compared with a technical realization that is anything but commendable, as well as with the excessive similarity to Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance. Ultimately, the title in question is aimed above all at fans of the genre and at those who are constantly looking for a good adventure to face shoulder to shoulder with friends. But be careful of the above: those who have had to deal with the Snowblind Studios game, and have not been fascinated by it, could prematurely lay down weapons and pads. Pros: Intuitive controls system. Fun in multiplayer. Good verity of enemies. Subtitles in Italian. Cons: Dubbing unfortunately not. Deja vu. Subdued technical realization. We have always interpreted Dungeons & Dragons as a tabletop role-playing game that requires paper, pencil, dice of all trigonometric shapes and a group of irreducible friends devoted to the fantasy world proposed by the various game sets. Anyone who has ever had the good fortune to run into an evening set in the realms of D&D knows how much the master has a predominant role in game development. In short, the master is the one who invents the scenarios, populates the dungeons with enemies of all kinds and proposes himself as the absolute judge of the vicissitudes that the remaining players will go through. Atari, attracted by the fairy world of this majestic work of fantasy and fun, has decided to take the field proposing itself to western players as master of this new videogame incarnation of Dungeons & Dragons, for the occasion equipped with the suffix Heroes to frame its essence. The title was born with cross-platform purposes, but Microsoft, also fascinated by the project, did not hesitate to acquire the rights.", "date": "2003-10-30", "grade": null}
