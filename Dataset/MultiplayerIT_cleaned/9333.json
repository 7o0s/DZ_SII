This name is certainly not unknown to fans of the genre, we are in fact talking about the team responsible for Dofus, a popular MMORPG which, not surprisingly, has several points in common with the title we are going to review. From the isometric view, to the comic style clearly inspired by anime, Islands of WAKFU also shares the same universe as Dofus, only set many years earlier. The protagonists are two decidedly different characters, both in terms of race and ability. Nora is a pretty Elatrop who, however, is not subtle at all, being an expert in Wakfung, the ~dimensional~ combat art that we will explain later, while Efrim is a water dragon capable of flying and firing devastating shots from a distance . The tranquility of their world, and above all of the energy that animates everything (the Wakfu in fact), is threatened by a parasitic danger, and it is precisely here that the adventure of our heroes begins. Islands of WAKFU is a different product than Dofus in any way. Given the specific parameters imposed by Live Arcades, the developers have opted for a curious hybrid between a fighting game, a shooter and an adventure. A decidedly intriguing idea on paper, but one that hasn't managed to shake off several imperfections in the finished product. As soon as the game has started, we are asked which mode to play in, Initiate or Goddess, while the first represents the normal difficulty (so to speak), in the second it is not expected to die and is designed exclusively to enjoy the story. A bizarre option that hasn't spared us some trepidation, totally purging the challenge from such a game sounds like a race for cover rather than a sought-after choice. In fact, Islands of WAKFU does not have a transcendental story to tell us, nor particularly elaborate adventurous sections, but it is full of frenzied action bordering on chaotic, in short, a formula that makes the possibility of being faced in the condition of immortals truly absurd. Four-dimensional barrels The isometric setting recalls great classics of the past and suggests an old school gameplay, but in reality Islands of WAKFU is not greedy for original ideas. As already mentioned, the protagonist is a true melee expert, in addition to the ability to deliver the classic punches, kicks and deadly combos, it is the ability to teleport at will to refresh the formula. The dragon for its part is able to strike from a distance and reach areas of the map that are closed to Nora, the goal is therefore to make the most of the abilities of the two protagonists in relation to the obstacles imposed by the levels. Unfortunately, everything collides with a general heaviness in clear contrast to the assumptions, and a deficit balancing of the difficulty. The tutorial is really too long and boring, often leaving the player with no clues on where to go and what to do, rather than delving into the combat system, which is the real core of the game and must be understood quickly. The screen soon fills with bullets, explosions, and enemies that require the ability to strike via teleportation. The previously mentioned dimensional combat, essentially a variation of the art of evasion already seen in other fighting games, which imposes a coordination of keys, triggers and analog sticks worthy of a seasoned drummer, however, lacks the slenderness necessary to manage such a rhythm frantic. As if that weren't enough, the game further pushes the accelerator through various quick time events where reading from the keys to press is tiring and poorly implemented. Bosses are generally challenging, with worrisome spikes. Defeating them means learning the attack patterns to perfection, and this leads to long and exhausting fights, where the defeat forces you to repeat everything from scratch. In the light (or shadow) of all this, the perplexities for that notorious initial choice take the form of a bitter certainty. Xbox 360 goals 300 points along 12 objectives await all Islands of WAKFU players. Since this is a single player adventure, it is assumed that most of them will be achieved by finishing the main story. But the game will also reward those who try their hand at the company alongside a friend. Remember that if you play in Goddess mode you will be completely denied the Champion achievement, for 40 precious player points. To you the choice... Understand you can not What leaves you astounded about Islands of WAKFU is its luxuriant technical realization, splendid bitmap characters are represented with aImpressive graphic cleaning. There is no trace of polygons, everything is hand-drawn and expertly animated, just like a cartoon, and despite the small size of the characters it is possible to capture their expressions, as well as a stylistic delicacy that really touches the heart (phenomenal in especially Ephrim). Despite the oriental inspiration for the characterizations, it must be admitted that Ankama has a style of its own which also embraces the most recent western animation productions. There is no shortage of delusional nuances, such as a certain ~meta-reference~ that would make Hideo Kojima smile, and many pearls that we invite you to discover for yourself. Seeing such a sparkling visual jewel on your television is an experience that we cannot effectively describe with words, without excluding the exceptional sound accompaniment, capable of entering into perfect harmony with the images. Last but not least, the idea of making all the characters speak backwards, with an even more alienating effect! It is therefore a pity that this title is much more beautiful to look at than to play, and that Ankama has not managed to convert its commendable stylistic cleanliness into playful language. Supported the coop for two players, and the online rankings for the score of the levels, even if they will be completely closed to those who play in Goddess mode.", "date": "2011-04-21", "grade": "6.8"}
