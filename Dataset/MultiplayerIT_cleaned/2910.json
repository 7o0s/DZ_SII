{"name": "WRC 9", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc-9-recensione.html", "text": "New year, updated version: the review of WRC 9 tells of the fifth evolution of the official game of the World Rally Championship curated by Kylotonn, the French software house also responsible for TT Isle Of Man. In this review we will analyze the news of the exclusive of Epic Game Store (the versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are obviously also available, while Switch and the new generation of consoles will have to wait a few more months): simple update or new revolution? Single player There's no time for preambles: as soon as you start the game you start immediately with a special stage to test your skills and allow the PC to calibrate the level of difficulty. The modalities are the same as those that dirt-track enthusiasts had already come to know in recent years: first of all there is the classic world championship, updated to what should have been the current season and therefore including three new nations, namely Kenya, Japan and New Zealand; each rally consists of eight stages, and they join the other ten already present in the past. The categories are, of course, the official ones and range from the premier class (in which, we recall, only three manufacturers participate, i.e. Ford with Fiesta, Hyundai with i20 and Toyota with Yaris), WRC 2 and 3 (reduced by one hundred horsepower compared to first; Volkswagen, Skoda and Citroen are added to the list) and WRC Junior, a championship in which only the front-wheel drive Fiestas produced by Ford take part. For those who have stopped at the time of Miki Biasion there are the legends, in which the invincible Lancias (Fulvia, Stratos, Delta) appear, together with other champions of past years. Remaining in the single player mode we find the Challenges, trials that you need to finish within a certain time to get points with which to unlock the next ones; the Training mode which serves to perfect the driving style and the Test Area where you can practice without limitations. We have deliberately kept the main dish of the house for last, that is the Career mode already introduced in WRC 8 which presents itself without sensational news. In practice it is a question of starting from the lowest class (Junior) to get to pilot one of the WRC racing cars while managing the team at the same time. Conceptually similar to F1 2020 My Team, although less detailed, the management part is not limited to repairing the damage between one race and another, but requires planning the calendar, choosing which events to take part in and when to reserve days of rest to allow the mechanics to recover their strength, as well as spending the accumulated experience points to make each of the four areas of research and development more effective. Multiplayer Now essential in this genre of games (and not only), the online experience is integrated through a series of daily and weekly events with which to try your hand at obtaining the best placement in the global ranking. The multiplayer allows eight players to challenge each other in a single test or in a series of rallies created ad hoc. In this case the real-time position of the opponents is visible through their ghost cars; then there is also a welcome split-screen mode and later the possibility of sitting on the right seat, in the role of navigator, will be added. The e-sports world championship will begin on January 21st, divided into ten rounds, with the final stage scheduled for July 19th. The regulation provides that each player has five chances to get the best time in each race; at the end the first eight classified will be invited, in a location still to be defined, to grab the title of virtual world champion. At the wheel Although they were already present in the previous WRC 8, the variable weather conditions and vehicle wear and tear have been further addressed in this sequel. One of the best ways to test the changes is through special events to complete under the flood or with the car in pieces. The wear of the tires is also appreciable, the degradation of which affects grip when cornering and requires greater attention during the journey. The driving model is even more sensitive than that of past years, and it will take quite a while to master it with the joypad. Unlike, to give a recent example, Project CARS 3 (which deals with other types of situations anyway), in WRC 9 it is absolutely necessary to choke on the gas and move the analog sticks with almost surgical precision, given that it takes nothing to lose the control of the car (even those with four-wheel drive), so much so that in order to have a fully immersive experience it is necessary to rely on the steering wheel and pedals. Going into detail, it seemed to usthat the pendulum effect is too strong and that its effects last for too many meters, regardless of the roughness of the asphalt and the speed. There are also some quirks of the physics engine, which in some cases projects the car into the air after apparently innocent contacts; moreover, numerous invisible walls return an artificial effect to a title which instead, as mentioned, winks at simulation enthusiasts. Graphics From a graphic point of view, there are only small adjustments, so much so that the comparison with the 2019 version presents imperceptible differences as regards the layouts, which therefore remain well made but still not very ~alive~ and a little sparse in details, such as the audience made up of static figurines or plants that bend unnaturally as the wheels pass. The most noticeable work has been done on the camera behind the car, which now follows the car much more smoothly. The models of the various Ford, Hyundai and Toyota, updated to the 2020 liveries, are cared for even if they are not very susceptible to bumps and dirt. On the other hand, lighting and texture quality are slightly lower than Codemasters' rival DiRT Rally 2.0, which will take over from Kylotonn in 2023. The PC version, tested here, does not suffer from the frame rate limitations that characterize the console versions, stopped at 30 fps (but the developers have promised double the value at 4K for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X), but still has some annoying drops due to loading portions of the maps (this obviously happens in longer stages), completely unacceptable on a system equipped with one of the fastest SSDs on the market and 32 GB of RAM. The sampling of the engines is valid (but also in this case we have heard better); the co-pilot seemed slightly uncoordinated at times.", "date": "2020-09-08", "grade": "7.5"}
