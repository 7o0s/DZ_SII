{"name": "Windjammers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/188264-windjammers-il-ritorno-di-un-classico.html", "text": "In our area, the era of arcades has long since ended, yet those who were able to take their first steps in the world of video games between the 80s and early 90s still remember with great pleasure - and with an ill-concealed sense of nostalgia - the endless afternoons spent with friends in front of the cruisers that have entered the history of this sector. There are many names that resurface from memories, someone has aged well and someone else a little less, but if we had to choose a title that is still able to entertain in a genuine and unpretentious way, Windjammers would certainly be one of the most plausible answers. The game developed by Data East was released in an arcade version in February 1994, and then landed in the following months also on two highly selected home platforms such as Neo-Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD. Now, more than 23 years after its first appearance, this classic from the past has been revived on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in an almost identical guise to the original. Are you ready to pick up the frisbee again? The frisbee is your best friend Windjammers is based on a fictional sport inspired by part tennis and part air hockey. Inside arenas with a view from above, two opponents must frantically throw a Frisbee with the aim of sending it into the opponent's goal. To have the upper hand, it is essential to release each shot with good timing and to modify one's trajectories as much as possible, using banks, parabolas and lobs. A single frame can be won by reaching the minimum threshold of 12 points, or by finishing the time available to you with at least one point more than your opponent. The score of each play varies according to the area of the goal where you can send the puck, while dropping the Frisbee to the ground gives your opponent two points. As can be easily guessed, to be able to impose yourself you need quick reflexes but also a good dose of strategy: you need to know how to maintain an effective position on the pitch as much as possible and dose the slides correctly to recover at the last moment even those shots that otherwise would not be in in any way reachable. At the same time, it's important to optimize both the speed and direction of your attacks. The result is a frenetic and fun experience, which among other things puts a strain on the reflexes in the event that you decide to select the highest difficulty level. Overall, Windjammers is identical to its original version, both in mechanics and in the amount of selectable characters. The six athletes present have variable characteristics, favoring to varying degrees the power of the blows or the speed of movement within the arena. By opting for the Teutonic Klaus Wessel, everything will be focused on power at the expense of speed, conversely by falling back on Hiromi Mita, promptness in recoveries will prove to be significantly more effective at the expense of the violence of the Frisbee release. The other athletes are somewhere between these two extremes, while each of them enjoys a personalized powerful attack that can activate with the right timing in certain game situations. During offline sessions it is possible to lean towards the arcade mode, where it is possible to challenge all the other athletes controlled by artificial intelligence consecutively. Alternatively, by opting for the Versus mode, you can embark on fierce local challenges alongside a friend. Playstation 4 trophies The Windjammers Trophies are 29 overall and include platinum. Some involve completing the arcade mode, others involve performing specific actions a certain number of times. Online goals include winning 1, 50, and 100 ranked matches, as well as winning 5 ranked matches in a row. Welcome to 1994 or almost From a graphic point of view, the only differences from the original counterpart concern the appearance of the menus and the options that can be activated in the settings. The default view provides that the game is enjoyed in the classic 4:3 mode of old CRT televisions, but if necessary it is still possible to opt for the 16:9 shot. In our opinion, playing with the original settings remains the best choice, also because it is possible to decide to adjust the side bands to your liking with colored images in addition to the classic black background. Beyond these details, the real novelty of the versions for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita is linked to the presence of an online multiplayer mode complete with a leaderboard. Through the appropriate menu you can enter a quick gamethat does not require the assignment of a score or prefer the ranked challenges. However, if necessary, it is also possible to open a private lobby to invite players from your contact list. During the online sessions the matches flow smoothly and without a hitch, although in some cases a little patience is required before being associated with some opponents. Unfortunately it is not possible to set the search criteria, so it is very likely that you will find users with very high scores already during the first games. The ranking system provides for the assignment of a bonus in case of victory and a small penalty after each defeat. Curiously, if you suffer two defeats by the same player, it will not be possible to continue further and you will necessarily have to look for another challenger.", "date": "2017-09-08", "grade": "7.0"}
