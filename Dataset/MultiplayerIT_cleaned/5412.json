All ideas, even the wonderful ones, need care in the very delicate process that will allow them to land in the real world: otherwise you risk disaster, an object that does not correspond at all to that initial beauty. You may have already figured out where we are going with this. The history of video games, in fact, is dotted with episodes of this type: products that wanted to be a certain thing, but instead nothing; who had promised certain experiences, to the practical test then revealed, well... disappointing. Dragon Ball: The Breakers unfortunately fits into this reasoning, as a good example. Because what annoys, above all other aspects, is its possessing enormous potential: we are still convinced of it today, nor do we despair about its possibility of recovering along the way. An asymmetric, fully online action game based on the experience of Dead By Daylight can work, it has all the credentials to do so. Yet, something went wrong in the title made by Dimps and published by Bandai Namco last week on all major consoles and on PC. Below you will find our review of Dragon Ball: The Breakers: we have tried it for a long time, oscillating between exaltation (for some mechanics) and frustration (for everything else), on PlayStation 5. The apparent (but largely absent) plot This is the super time machine from Dragon Ball: The Breakers: the survivors must reactivate it as soon as possible Dragon Ball: The Breakers has a story and at the same time it doesn't. In the initial moments it seems that a great adventure is about to begin: so much so that Bandai Namco presents us in all respects with a Prologue - and a prologue, as we know, also etymologically is something that precedes another speech, therefore something else should arrive later . Thus, our protagonist - made through a more than sufficient, but not brilliant editor - wakes up in a hostile territory, hunted by a known enemy, but which should no longer exist, which shouldn't be there at that moment: Cell. Then comes the Trunks of the future (the one from Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, the time patroller) and explains to us what is happening. Something in space-time no longer works as it should. Time Rifts are appearing everywhere, very serious alterations in the continuum of reality: due to these changes, some historical enemies who in the past threatened the Earth and space, specifically Freeza, Cell and Majin Buu, are back in action, with serious danger to the population. The brave protagonist will have to put everything back in place, thus giving a hand to Trunks who, obviously, cannot be at the same time in every place that needs his presence. The Prologue allows you to familiarize yourself with the game mechanics of Dragon Ball: The Breakers: it works well, it's engaging, even fun; secondary characters are known who will then return to the main hub; finally, it is understood that this product is a separate episode of the Xenoverse saga, with a whole series of references. Alright then. The problem is that the plot ends here: it is possible to replay these first fifteen minutes so engaging, but nothing else. Thus, a story mode is the first major missed opportunity of Dragon Ball: The Breakers. Not bad, you say, after all, everything is proposed as an online video game. ~And yet~, we can't help but think, ~and yet so little would have been enough...~ A thought that comes up again, again and again, in every other aspect of the production. Let's proceed. Gameplay: survivors and raiders In Dragon Ball: The Breakers the ~intermediate~ versions of the historical enemies return to dominate (and thank goodness) The basic gameplay of Dragon Ball: The Breakers is very simple to illustrate: each game hosts eight players at the same time, seven of whom play the role of survivors, the last that of the raider. The latter is one of the historical enemies of Dragon Ball Z, to be chosen between Freeza, Cell and Majin Buu (others should arrive later); it appears in the game in its basic form, and then by performing certain actions it can transform itself up to the ~perfect form~, becoming stronger and stronger. The raider's goal, of course, is to annihilate every other human player; the survivors, on the other hand, must... survive. The team of seven poor civilians trapped in the time fault must be careful, at all times, both to avoid the enemy and to carry out all the necessary actions to win the game, before time runs out ( why yes, to complicate everything there is also a fairly rigid time limit). To win, the survivors need to find a key to power in each area of the mapof game; keys that must then be activated in a specific position, to bring the Super Time Machine back into operation. It is clear that they will have a whole series of more or less useful tools, gadgets and objects on their side, from the Dragon Radar to find spheres and civilians to save to sentu beans and vials to regain strength, also passing through Vegeta's gloves (they release one of the character's iconic ki-based attacks) and energy cubes. Running away is definitely a key aspect of Dragon Ball: The Breakers Now, it is said that civilians are not always and only helpless players against the current enemy. In fact, by collecting enough energy cubes, it is possible to ~transform~, evoking at your side the spirit of a legendary warrior of the Dragon Ball universe (Piccolo, Gohan, Goku, Vegeta, and all the best known): for a very few seconds, the the survivor will then become a full-fledged Z Warrior, who could even KO the raider, ending the game; this in theory, in practice it has never happened in our sessions. There's even an entire gacha mechanic within the main hub, to help draw new support warriors to use. It should also be mentioned that the raider is always, consistently ahead. Not only because his playing class was designed like this, but precisely because of an evident imbalance in his favor: if a raider knows how to play and how to act, it is really difficult for the survivors to win. Also because the latter do not have any chat or system to coordinate: most of the time they simply proceed at random, in a confusing way, hoping that everyone is doing something useful for the general goal. Great potential, but too many limits The energy grappling hook is one of many unlikely gadgets in Dragon Ball: The Breakers We have already had to talk about the great potential of Dragon Ball: The Breakers. Not only is the basic idea excellent, but the gameplay itself also proves to be immediate and fun from the very first games, since each survivor has a certain number of skills to survive, can choose to play in the open or completely in stealth, team play or abandon others present, and so on. The same progression, which provides for a separate level increase for survivors and for raider, encourages the use of both classes, and in the long run it also benefits the overall longevity. But too many limits combine to make Dragon Ball: The Breakers a disappointing experience. Let's overlook the completely forgettable technical sector, not at all in step with the times: it is the artistic direction, the charm of the ~world of Dragon Ball~ that visually saves the production, certainly not the rest; let's also overlook the obvious advantage of the raider over all the others present, because it is clear that Freeza, Cell and Majin Buu will soon be weakened on a general level. But the environments are very few, really a handful, and almost completely empty: so what's the point of being able to climb them, or having a small Capsule Corp. moped to move from one place to another? What's the point of inserting two highly respected characters like Bulma and Olong from the very first series, even with specific skills, if all the others are missing? How can reasoned teamwork be encouraged, if then those present run all over the place without being able to really coordinate, moreover with a whole series of conditions for victory that are much more complicated than in the tutorial? The Saiyan ship allows you to move from one area to another in Dragon Ball: The Breakers Confusion reigns supreme in Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and that's undoubtedly a problem; problem that adds to the very limited variety of places and situations, not to mention that there is only one game mode - just one, and that's it - repeated to the end. And even if we wanted to turn a blind eye to all this, the matchmaking situation has worsened compared to the early days: now on consoles it is not only difficult to find a game (let alone if you choose to play as the raider), but also to start it, since system errors are always around the corner. The only positive side of the whole experience seems to us to be the price, just 20 euros for the digital version. But if the situation stays that way for long, the public may not be willing to spend even that.", "date": "2022-10-19", "grade": "6.0"}
