However, in Kirby and the Hero's Cloth, the obese protagonist has found a further way to stand out from the crowd; experience a new adventure in a colorful world made entirely of fabric, threads and pieces. A fairy tale, complete with an external narrator, which speaks of the very bad wizard Malandrana with his magical white sock (!??) and of the friendship between Kirby and Prince Batuffolo, lost in front of his kingdom of Toppalandia unstitched and reduced to pieces . If reading these premises has brought a sincere smile to your lips, you are already well on your way to being able to appreciate this splendid Nintendo production. Point and cross In the series of events that introduce the story, even the ruddy Kirby is thus transformed into a mass of threads; a factor that out of the blue prevents him from using his suction ability simply because, devoid of the original consistency, the air passes through it making everything useless. Fortunately, a problem always has a solution, and therefore eliminating enemies in the world of Toppalandia can be done simply by pulling the threads that make them up, like unraveling a skein or reducing a knitted composition to its original shape. A small surprise which is however only the tip of the iceberg of creativity that the Japanese designers have been able to unleash in the game; instead of being just an aesthetic solution for its own sake, that of the world of fabric becomes a source of possibilities, of opportunities that find extraordinary and incredible stylistic coherence. There are really a lot of examples: pulling threads to bring the fabric backdrop closer and consequently the platforms, or opening new areas hidden behind a zip, or caskets hidden behind a patch, and more areas to reach by passing under the backdrop such as if you were under a blanket. Not to mention the various worlds, with always different and recognizable ~wallpapers~. From this point of view Kirby and the Hero's Cloth is therefore absolutely exceptional, since it manages to guarantee a cohesion between the graphic and the playful element that transmits freshness and originality even to an incredibly conventional game formula. Because the latest adventure of the pink hero is in fact nothing different than what one would expect, that is a two-dimensional platform calibrated on a particularly low and accessible level of difficulty, to the point that it is impossible to die. The only real element of challenge lies in the medal obtained based on your performance, and the three treasures hidden in each level. There are therefore platforms, objects and beads to collect, enemies to eliminate and roughly all the standard sampling of the typical Nintendo product of this genre. The control system is based only on the Wiimote held horizontally, and thus only keys 1 (attack) and 2 (jump) are used. A double press in one direction instead transforms Kirby into a car, so as to gain some speed and possibly make larger leaps. Removed from context, with a particularly cynical eye, the gameplay could even be defined as basic and devoid of bite. In reality it would be a big mistake, because Kirby and the Hero's Cloth is not a title to be surgically dissected and examined piece by piece; on the contrary, it should be appreciated as a whole, in its excellent coherence and in the marvelous variety of situations offered to the player. Put a patch on it In any case, Kirby and the Hero's Cloth still tries to put something new and quite original even in a familiar and recognizable environment such as the classic 2D platform that forms its foundations, and this happens through the tide of transformations that the fat pink can exploit throughout the levels. In certain points of the stages indicated by the Metavortex, in fact, Kirby will be automatically transformed into some type of creature or means of transport, thus gaining unique and peculiar abilities to face more or less short sections different in terms of mechanics compared to the rest. And so, for example, transforming into a Dune Buggy will lead you to take part in a dynamic and frenetic race, while becoming a fire engine will allow you to extinguish columns of fire with the jet of water, or becoming a big robot complete with a rocket punch will allow to eliminate waves of boring enemies. While perhaps not always very successful, these sections prove to be essential for donatinga greater dynamism to the gameplay of the game, and at the same time to ensure a wider scope to the otherwise repetitive pace of progression. Testing the facts, however, it is clear that Kirby and the Hero's Cloth is a game created to be enjoyed alone, but absolutely perfect and preferable if played in company. In this case the second player controls the Prince Fluffy, who possesses identical skills and abilities compared to the protagonist; greater diversification in this respect is perhaps the only note that can be moved to an otherwise perfect multiplayer to the extent that it allows expert players to accompany others who are less skilled. Girlfriends, children or parents come to mind, and more generally anyone, attracted by a similar type of experience, maybe feeling inadequate. In this sense, frankly, we do not find at all that the characteristic framed by many as the greatest defect of Nintendo production, or the very limited challenge offered, represents a real point against. On the contrary, it is a precise choice that outlines a product that, in fact, did not yet exist on Wii: a ~walking~ platformer of the great N, which can be shared with someone without fear of frustration or inferiority complex. Those looking for something more challenging are spoiled for choice between the excellent New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Donkey Kong Country Returns, just to name a couple of examples. For all the others however, here is finally an alternative that qualitatively has nothing to envy.", "date": "2011-03-02", "grade": "9.0"}
