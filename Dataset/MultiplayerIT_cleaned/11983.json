{"name": "Heavenly Sword - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heavenly-sword-recensione.html", "text": "The Sword of Nariko The incredibly cinematic cut that the Ninja Theory wanted to give to their creation is immediately noticeable, thanks also to a plot that is not limited to acting as a simple pretext to swing left and right. The plot of Heavenly Sword is about revenge, honor and pride, like so many adventures before, but it is so well narrated and developed that it is difficult to believe that this is not a first-rate Hollywood production. Nariko wields a sacred sword revered by her clan, the Heavenly Sword, and challenges the prejudice of her people, who associate the woman with a terrible curse, to counter the armies of the evil and mad king Bohan. Flanked by the inseparable and a little crazy Kai, a girl with infallible aim, Nariko will face Bohan and his troops to save her clan and defend the sword itself, but soon she will have to deal with her own weapon, which in addition to depriving her of her vital forces, seems to slowly build up in her a rage and a desire for war that was unknown to her. The plot develops through a full-bodied series of non-interactive sequences created with the game engine and on these occasions embellished with graphic tricks that make them practically indistinguishable from real CG movies: the artistic direction deserves loud praise for the care taken to each narrative element, so much so that Bohan's lieutenants, despite the little space reserved for them on the screen, through a few shrewd sentences manage to make themselves known and hated just enough to satisfy Nariko's thirst for revenge and, in parallel, the our. The redhead protagonist of Heavenly Sword is light years ahead of the videogame feminism icon Lara Croft, and Ninja Theory succeeds in the difficult goal of proposing a new heroine without falling into the usual clichs: Nariko is sweet and maternal but strong and decisive, very sensual and enchanting , definitely beyond the ~sex bomb~ that is often proposed in action-games. Bohan, on the other hand, can be counted among the best villains of all time, and the care taken in the realization of this despotic psychopath was such as to even call into question Andy Serkis, the actor who lent his body to the artists of WETA Works for the making of Gollum in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. For the realization of these cinematic sequences in Heavenly Sword, Ninja Theory made use of the collaboration of WETA Studios and of the most sophisticated motion-capture systems: the result is a truly astonishing naturalness and realism in the animations of the various characters, and above all in the facial mimicry, almost indistinguishable from that of a common - and real - human being. At the same time, dubbing in our local language counts some of the most important names in the sector, such as Chiara Colizzi and Ennio Coltorti (respectively, to give a couple of examples, the Bride in Kill Bill and Agent Smith in The Matrix trilogy), saving us the flat and listless acting to which localized games have accustomed us in most cases: in Heavenly Sword the work is done with extreme passion, and each sequence, interactive or not, is decidedly enjoyable and compelling, thanks also to a splendid column sound that from the very first bars offers engaging tracks capable of making the most epic moments of the adventure simply sensational. The plot of Heavenly Sword is so well narrated and developed that it is difficult to believe that we are not faced with a first-rate Hollywood production. The Sword of Nariko But what is the game like when it doesn't mimic an action movie and the player is called upon to lead Nariko or Kai to safety? If the recently proposed demos and videos had already given hope for the visual rendering of Heavenly Sword, rest your heart because, indeed, Nariko is the standard-bearer of the next-gen, despite the defects that afflict the final version of the Ninja game theory. First of all, the polygonal modeling is surprising, extraordinary especially in the case of the protagonists of the adventure (Nariko and Kai, but also their father Shen and their nemeses Squamata, Volpe, Grugno and of course Bohan) and decidedly excellent as regards the enemies that they will oppose the bloody march of the red sword-bearer: the variety of the latter, however, is not particularly convincing, as the game offers only about five or six types of opponents. However, the polygonal mass moved on the screen is astonishing, when our heroine will be attacked by dozens of enemies at the same time, reaching the peak of a hundred in the spectacular final stages; the impressive show visive is however undermined by periodic, however short, drops in the frame-rate, which can sometimes be annoying, especially and naturally in the most agitated moments, when the timing and speed of the action become fundamental. Among other things, Nariko's battles are embellished with a myriad of particle and luminous effects that make them spectacular but not excessively gaudy, maintaining a sober and effective visual style: to compensate for the spectacularity of each screen are in fact the locations, decidedly among the most beautiful ever made for a video game. Reaching Bohan Castle, surrounded by huge waterfalls as the sun creates mesmerizing reflections by piercing the streams of water, or crossing stone avenues in gardens where flower petals and leaves float gently in mid-air are just a few examples of the style and the painstaking care placed in the creations of the various locations, which in the exteriors show an exceptional depth of the field of vision, while in the interiors an almost maniacal attention to detail is denoted. The dynamic shadows, the practically total absence of aliasing and the excellent and abundant use of HDR complete a more than satisfactory artistic picture, despite the already mentioned frame-rate drops, in fact, and the absence of V-Sync, unfortunately not seldom perceptible. Nariko's War The main concern of anyone waiting for Heavenly Sword was especially the quality of the gameplay: it is now difficult to propose original mechanics without overdoing it or, even worse, falling back into the traps of those games equipped with very advanced and complex combat systems but, often, all nothing but fun. Ninja Theory from this point of view has done an excellent job, and Heavenly Sword is played like a pleasure, despite some flaws which, in the final analysis, prove to be remarkable as collateral. Of course, Nariko's main weapon will be the Heavenly Sword, a supernatural sword capable of taking on three combat positions: simply pressing the attack keys allows Nariko to strike in a fast position, by holding down the L1 key the blows will be launched at a greater distance and, keeping R1 pressed instead, Nariko will hold the Sword with two hands while maintaining a powerful attitude. Obviously, a conspicuous series of increasingly spectacular combos is available for each configuration, but the most interesting thing is the possibility of switching from one setup to another at any time and during any combo: in addition to increasing the spectacularity and frenzy of the fights, this what is extremely important for defensive purposes. In fact, the various enemies use different structures to attack, distinguishable by the peculiar color that accompanies the animation: to parry the various blows, Nariko will have to remain still in the corresponding configuration, and at that point by pressing another key it will be possible to launch deadly counterattacks. To make the exchange system more complex there is also the fact that some enemies are able to launch attacks that cannot be parried, and at that moment dodging comes into play, accessible via the movement of the right analog stick : if the first fights are so extremely flat and simple, the difficulty increases significantly during the adventure leading us to face battles in which it is practically impossible to stand still without extricating ourselves from continuous changes of attitude, dodges and counterattacks. Not to mention, then, the special techniques that can be used when a special indicator allows it, extremely harmful and spectacular. Furthermore, Nariko can grab practically anything on the ground, from weapons to the corpses of enemies, and throw it at opponents, thus using the environment and objects to her advantage. Nariko's War On the other hand, Kai's approach to the battles in which she will be involved in the first person is decidedly different, which make extensive use of the Sixaxis: the small and bizarre sniper in fact finds herself escaping enemies and then targeting them from afar, sometimes even in time in which it will be necessary to aim with extreme precision at our targets. It is precisely here that the PlayStation 3 controller takes over, that is when we hold down the button to shoot: the view will switch to the first person, as if the camera were ideally placed in our bullet, and by moving the joypad we will be able to influence it the movement. The control system via Sixaxis is also indispensable in other moments of the game, in some puzzles that Nariko will have to solve to proceed, for example, or in the spectacular sequences in which we will use a cannon to repel the enemy army. These internships will initially prove to be quite difficult, but once pbecome familiar with the Sixaxis will become much more engaging, despite the sometimes excessive duration. Heavenly Sword is therefore proposed as a decidedly linear action-game, in which the predominant activity is the indiscriminate killing of enemy after enemy, while you go through each location in Nariko's shoes, sometimes solving simple puzzles. In some moments of the adventure you put yourself in Kai's shoes to punch holes in some enemies from afar, while some stages are entirely dedicated to the clash with the ~bosses~ on duty, generally Bohan's lieutenants, which often end with spectacular sequences in which we will be called to press the right key at the right time as in one of the many Quick Time Events that characterized games like Shen Mue or Resident Evil 4. The problem with Heavenly Sword, at this point, is certainly not the variety, which lacking for a game of this kind, but the ease with which it is possible to complete an already very short adventure in itself in a short time: in fact, the linearity of the various stages is combined with an artificial intelligence that is not exactly satisfactory, which often leads the enemies to two or three attack Nariko when ten surround her. Even the fights with the bosses, however spectacular, do not reveal particularly varied and difficult behaviors, thus turning into long exchanges of blows in which the player's resistance and the thrifty and possible use of the energy refills present in the vicinity count. And it's a pity, because Heavenly Sword is one of those rare games which, thanks to the excellent plot and the extraordinary technical sector, at the end of the adventure really leave us wanting to keep playing, really reminding us that sometimes a game has to hold more expectations than it should have, and in these cases then you really need to do it for a long time. Playing Heavenly Sword, especially towards the end, one realizes that, clearly, Nariko's adventure should have offered something more: whether it was the tight deadlines imposed by the manufacturer to speed up the release of the game, or whether it was it was Ninja Theory that placed so much emphasis on the cosmetic aspect that they forgot that the space was not enough even for the game, no one can say. Certainly, Heavenly Sword is a very linear action-game (and it is not necessarily a defect) that a practical player of the genre can complete in 5 hours or so, very little for a product sold at full price. The feeling of haste in closing the project is also felt in the lack of content that encourages replaying the adventure: the various extras that can be unlocked from the first games have already been accessible on the Internet and PSN for some time, and completing the game only unlocks one level of higher difficulty which, to tell the truth, is not as infernal as it would imply. Heavenly Sword is therefore a decidedly splendid product to look at and play, but which, due to some technical and playful problems that haste certainly did not correct, shows itself more as the masterpiece that it should have been but is not. We are sure, however, that the series has a brighter future than ever. Pros: Technically stunning, artistically flawless Deep and fun combat system Good variety of stages and situations Cons: Extremely short and simple Extras practically absent Some sporadic graphic glitches Heavenly Sword is available for PlayStation 3. Heavenly Sword is one of those games which, poor things, when they arrive on the shelves are already loaded with responsibilities: not only do they have to sell for the software house that developed them, but maybe they are also assigned some mystical and fundamental task such as, for example, sell the very console on which they should run. In practice, some games are born to be killer applications, and not all of them succeed. Heavenly Sword, for example, misses by a breath. But let's go in order. Developed by Ninja Theory, the title immediately made itself known in the world of video games thanks to the curves of its protagonist, the beautiful Nariko, committed to wielding a sword with supernatural powers and slicing enemy after enemy with it. In reality, since the very first videos released and the gradually more substantial demos, the Ninja Theory game has been able to show at least a glimpse of what the PlayStation 3 will be able to offer us in terms of next-gen. Behind the disc which contains the precious vital code of the game, there is a phenomenal work of stylistic research and programming, which has managed to give us, now that we have been able to try its definitive incarnation, one of the most suggestive videogame experiences that can be remembered .
