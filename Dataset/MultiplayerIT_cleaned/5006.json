After a long stay of about two years in Early Access, LEGO Worlds has arrived on PC, Xbox ONE and PlayStation 4 and a version is also planned for the newborn Nintendo Switch, later in 2017. We gave you a taste of the possibilities of this title in our tried some time ago, but with the final version the development team has completely revolutionized a game that seemed aimed exclusively at the creation with LEGO bricks and the exploration of immense maps generated randomly, transforming it into a very more similar to classic Lego games with a story mode and, unfortunately, completely removing (or, at least, not making it immediately available) the creative mode that had a positive impact. This change came with the release of version 1.0 and caused quite a bit of anger especially in many of those who had already purchased LEGO Worlds in Early Access and who were used to entering the game and building everything right away. Attention, this is not a change that worsens the game, it simply makes it very different from the previous version: let's explain the nature of this upheaval better and in order. It all begins with a presentation in pure ~LEGO game~ style that was previously absent and in which the spaceship that accompanies the player throughout the game is introduced. We immediately notice that the very few initial options have been replaced by a much more substantial series of menus in which we can adjust practically everything, from the video resolution to the graphic details and from the volume of music and effects to the selection of the language (to underline the beautiful dubbing in Italian by Claudio Moneta). The first real novelty is the creation of the character with your astronaut counterpart (the LEGO man) exploring in deep space, with the spaceship seen in the presentation suffering an accident causing you to fall towards a small LEGO world and, during the fall, you can already choose some basic character customizations. In this first world, a real tutorial made up of mini-quests begins which, in addition to making you take the various game tools, reward you with golden bricks. These bricks have the task of marking progression within LEGO Worlds and allow you to access ever larger worlds, moreover, they raise your builder level. Let's try to understand together if this revolution turns out to be successful. With LEGO Worlds you will give free rein to all your creativity with the most famous bricks in the world Volcanoes, forests, deserts: let's explore the landscape After having collected the first 10 golden bricks, we are free to take our spaceship to freely visit other worlds but only the randomly generated small ones and this selection, from here on out, gives us the possibility to choose and visit one of the many biomes present; as the adventure progresses, and therefore as the gold bricks increase, you will have access to ever larger maps. There are 26 biomes, each with unique terrain, buildings, characters, vehicles and animals (some have elements in common); to give a few examples, in the desert of the dunes it is possible to find pyramids, paleontologists, camels with relative Bedouins on their backs and the inevitable mummies! Similarly, in the rainforest you will find towering trees, gorillas, monkeys, cavemen and elephants or, if you are looking for something colder, you can happen to arrive in the frozen tundra full of igloos, researchers, polar bears, huskies and even yetis. There are also scary settings such as the forest haunted by vampires and werewolves and those pertinent to the fantasy world such as the volcanic wasteland with fire-breathing dragons and powerful sorcerers. Ultimately, each biome is literally invaded by objects, natural elements, rideable animals (all except the very small ones) and non-player characters (obviously all strictly LEGO) who react differently to your presence: some will simply ask you for objects to bring them to reward you with another object, while others will give you more complex quests, for example to help them build the house, paint it a different color or free another blocked character from the surrounding environment. The reward for these little missions can often be a gold brick. It will also happen that animals or non-player characters will turn out to be hostile and will try to kill you, or rather, to disassemble you: don't worry, dying in LEGO Worlds only has a scenic effect and your puppet counterpart will reappear underito, ready to use. A little above we mentioned the vehicles, in fact, each of these settings allows you to find means of transport more or less relevant to the place where they are found therefore, for example, in the swamp you can find a hovercraft, in the ocean various types of boats but don't be surprised if you find a bicycle in the haunted forest or a motorcycle up in a tree: this is LEGO Worlds too. To add natural elements to your collection, such as flowers, burning trees, decorations or vehicles, it is usually sufficient to use the discovery tool while almost all rideable animals require a specific item. It is not enough to add them to the collection to have them immediately, unlocking them permanently requires the payment of a price in ~studs~ (round plates) which represent the game's currency. But how to get them together? In the classic way well known in every game in the LEGO world, or by destroying everything around you, or by completing some quests and discovering the many chests located throughout the map and inside which the rarest elements are hidden (which will often serve as bargaining chip with the various characters). All the collected elements can be recalled through the game interface and, in a very intuitive way, you can immediately know how many studs you need to unlock a certain element. The weapons of ultimate creation With version 1.0 of LEGO Worlds a radical change has also been implemented to the game interface and, while previously only one tool was used with different functions selectable from a single panel, now there are many more ~weapons/tools~ selectable from a quick radial menu that pops up around you. Each of these tools is graphically different and with a specific function: there is the one for adding and placing objects, the one for building bricks, the one for painting, the one for modeling the landscape and the one for copying/pasting entire parts of the terrain and and buildings. Even this choice was not welcomed by old users who saw a perhaps simpler system get complicated, however, this solution is certainly intuitive for new players. We said that you appropriate these tools during the tutorial of the very first missions, going to use them one by one with small specially created quests. The first tool accessed, that of discovery, is used to collect, add or remove an element; its use is immediate and, while holding it, a ray of light that starts from it will help you aim and ~shoot~ on an object that you are going to add (if possible) to the collection, moreover, to understand if it is freely catchable you can observe its outline after pointing with the tool, if it is green it can be added and, to simplify everything even more, in each new environment the objects that you do not have yet in the collection will flash. When you add a character, animal or vehicle, LEGO Worlds also tells you which LEGO set it comes from among the really existing ones (LEGO Technics, LEGO City, etc.), while some were created specifically for the game. The construction tool allows you to choose the bricks one by one by selecting them from the existing ones, from the classic 2x4 up to much more complex pieces (all the pieces are easily identifiable both visually and with the relative descriptive label), even if not all immediately available and to get them there are several ways of which, the most common, is through chasing an annoying green character who appears near you and then runs away with a piece in hand: these chases make it extremely slow to get all the game pieces and frankly, it's also a bit boring. The paint tool literally allows you to shoot a color, chosen from a rich palette of tones, on the pieces that make up the landscape or on your creations, it is also possible to vary the consistency of the brush in order to obtain more or less nuanced tints. With the landscape tool, you can raise, level, smooth or excavate entire parts of the land, existing or built by you, through the use of different geometric shapes such as pyramids, cones, spheres, cubes, plateaus, etc. of different sizes and depths: only your imagination is the limit. The last of the tools, the copy tool, is used to take entire portions of land or even individual bricks and copy, duplicate or delete them very quickly and easily, you can also save them for later use on other planets/maps. To model the landscape, not only tools are used, given chand even with vehicles it is possible to modify the terrain, for example by using a special drill vehicle or a work vehicle to build roads. It's not over, in addition to the possibility of building virtually anything you want, you have available finished buildings, such as castles, ready to be placed but the projects are all unlocked through the mini-quests or found in the chests. To better understand where you can find the chests or where to start a quest for a golden brick, you can both consult the mini-map and follow a system of signal rays of different colors present in each world. Create whatever you want alone or in company Graphically, LEGO Worlds does not differ much from the style of the various LEGO games to which we are accustomed even if the attention to detail of each single brick is truly maniacal and it will seem to have the real pieces in your hands: the various biomes are very colorful and well made while the vehicles and characters, all belonging as mentioned to real sets on sale in the past or still in production, are animated in a very realistic and fun way. The music department has been completely overhauled with the 1.0 update and there are now many more tracks that are well suited to the type of biome the action is taking place in, ranging from more epic themes to really hilarious tunes. The game engine, criticized in the past for being excessively heavy which compromised its functionality on older machines, has benefited from a fair streamlining with the various patches of recent months and with the latest update, however, we must say that it is still quite heavy and that there are some graphical glitches or camera handling issues indoors that cause some confusion; moreover, we have experienced sudden resolution changes after using the Alt+TAB key combination without having the possibility to return to the starting resolution with the only solution being to restart the game. Finally, we've read about some players having their game crash suddenly and for no apparent explanation. We tested it on a high-end PC and it didn't have any glitches other than the aforementioned minor issues with the camera. The multiplayer could not be missing, and had already arrived a year after entering Early Access: this mode is available both online by invitation with a code to be entered, and offline in screen sharing with the second player who can join the game in any time. The characters can be controlled both with the combination of mouse and keyboard and through the use of any joypad and, although both work well, we feel we lean towards the latter. Ultimately, we are faced with a good title which, however, will perhaps be appreciated more by those who had not already tried it in Early Access given the elimination of the creative mode. Indeed, this new system of progression through small missions aimed at obtaining gold bricks would have been perfect in support of the creative mode but having only this as a way to access larger maps, various objects and the very numerous bricks, makes everything much slower and lowers, in our opinion, the final evaluation. The development team is constantly working to improve the game and we are willing to bet that the creative mode will be made available, in light of the numerous protests. Finally, we must positively underline the openness of LEGO Worlds to the use of mods (even if not yet available) specially developed by players that will make this title even more varied, just as has been the case for Minecraft for years.", "date": "2017-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
