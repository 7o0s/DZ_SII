It is imperative to start this review by talking about the work done by the developers with regard to the technical sector, because Dead or Alive 5 Plus, it is true, renounces some effects and perhaps uses a less sophisticated antialiasing than what was seen on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3; but, at the same time, it appears on the Sony handheld with a very stable frame rate of sixty frames per second, which therefore in no way demeans the fighting experience or the elements related to timing in terms of combos and countermoves. Therefore, one of the most serious shortcomings of the aforementioned two episodes of Ninja Gaiden is remedied, also aiming to enrich the offer by inserting extra modes such as that of ~touch fight~. In practice, it is possible to try your hand at a match using a first-person view, holding the PSVita horizontally or vertically, and using the touch screen to tap and gesture to hit your opponent, grab him and make parries and dodges. We can say it immediately and without hesitation: beyond the innovative presentation, it is a nice but useless feature, which we found cumbersome and inconsistent in its mechanics. An offer you can't refuse The single player campaign of Dead or Alive 5 Plus, decidedly long and robust, allows us to observe the ~plot~ of the game from the point of view of various characters, up to the climax of the story. Team Ninja proves in this case that they don't have excellent storytelling skills, but fans of the series probably don't care. What matters rather, are the many cutscenes that enrich the modality, which make a fine show of excellent polygonal models even if they often get lost in the details of the scenario, which sometimes seem to belong to productions of the Dreamcast era (see the cars, the road ...). Clearly the campaign does not represent the ideal place to ~specialize~ in the use of a particular fighter, but there are also quite advanced tutorials (Training Plus) and more compact modes suitable for the purpose, such as Versus, Arcade mode, Challenge to Time and Survival. The Arcade mode, in particular, offers eight possible levels of difficulty and allows us to face a series of opponents as usual, but unfortunately without a final sequence to reward our efforts. There is also a valid multiplayer sector, with quick or ranked matches, invitational matches and so on. Only problem: it was really hard to try it, because at the moment there seem to be very few online players. As always happens, the quality of the games depends on the connection of the two connected users, ergo you could enjoy a perfect responsiveness or run into delays due to excessive latency. PSVita trophies There are forty-six Trophies contained in Dead or Alive 5 Plus and most of them can be obtained over the ~long distance~, specifically by playing a certain number of online or Versus matches, completing the various Arcade Mode paths and so on. I'm a fighter Compared to the previous episodes of the series, Dead or Alive 5 Plus focuses heavily on the incidence of the scenarios with respect to the outcome of the fight, therefore it is possible to interact more frequently with the stage, hit the enemy until he breaks through a wall and ends it in another area of the location, or come to terms with an unstable terrain, in constant change. The layout of the controls on PlayStation Vita sees by default the ~slow~ strokes assigned to the two back buttons and the ~fast~ ones to the Triangle and Circle buttons, while X can be used to execute a grab and the Square activates the parry (which, however, is he also gets in the classic way, i.e. ~pulling back~ from the opponent). The d-pad soon proves to be the only viable solution to move the character, but there's nothing to worry about given the quality of the directional pad mounted on the Sony console. The feeling of the fights is excellent, thanks to the fluidity of the graphics and the various fighting styles substantially differentiate the wrestlers: it is really difficult to find two ~equal~ ones, and this undoubtedly represents a great advantage. The presence of some characters taken from Virtua Fighter, to be unlocked by defeating them during the story mode, also adds a further layer to the pleasant ~fan service~ that the Tecmo Koei franchise does not get buti miss.", "date": "2013-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
