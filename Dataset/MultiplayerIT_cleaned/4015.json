{"name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-recensione.html", "text": "This year it is particularly difficult to write the review of Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4. With the previous chapters, the slavish repetition of the contents had in fact made writing an article almost mechanical: we started from the campaign, listed the various technical elements that composed and differentiated it from the multiplayer, the direction, the acting, the choice of the protagonists and the pace of the game were observed and judged, and then moved on to the multiplayer with its novelties and to the zombie campaign to close the circle. These three elements could be appreciated or not, high quality or made in a problematic way as it was with Call of Duty: Ghosts, but the pillars of the Activision brand have always been there to give the certainty of hundreds of hours of gameplay to an audience of fans grown dramatically over the years, to such an extent as to ensure the series a success that could regardless of the sum of its components. Obviously, this does not mean that all the brand's games had the same quality, on the contrary, but at least the public already knew what to find as soon as they bought the game and then started it on console or PC. This year, as we said, things change, given that the new Call of Duty completely abandons the single-player campaign to follow a market that now makes esports and spectacularity the ram's heads to break through between communities and influencers. Just look at Twitch in recent years to understand how the advertising push of the campaign had lost all strength, leaving only the competitive modes and zombie maps to carry on the popularity of the title in the months following its launch. Activision with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 makes a particular move and, instead of trying to trace a successful path that can be imitated by other shooters, subverts the rules by bending to the market, inserting the much-discussed Battle Royale mode within the production. This year we therefore find ourselves with the need to evaluate a product that loses an important piece of its essence, gaining others, for a final package that today more than ever will be difficult to digest by the public but which can easily be understood, justified and accepted willingly by those who approach the game without prejudice. The campaign disappears, the multiplayer remains No more single-player campaign therefore: Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, with a clean slate abandons all the protagonists of recent years. No Alex Mason, no Captain Price, no Frank Woods and not even any bad guy to stimulate that patriotic spirit that has always traced a deep groove across the entire narrative line of CoD. And all this happens just when the development is in the hands of Treyarch, who with the last three episodes has been able to demonstrate that the single-player campaigns could still have an extraordinary value, so much so that they can offer breathtaking moments, epic scenes and surprising new ideas, such as crossroads missions of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 just to give an example. Yet all these fanfares Call of Duty players have almost never heard, because the statistics of appreciation and especially those of completion say that the CoD series campaign has always been marginal for buyers. With a clear mind and with choices to make on the plate, then, it's right to cut it, right to push on the contents that are more popular at the moment, right to insert Black Out and leverage on Battle Royale and even more right to experiment with new mechanics in multiplayer which, in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, not only is it fun and successful but it will also excite those who watch and play Call of Duty dozens of hours a day. Treyarch has therefore abandoned double jumps, jetpacks and everything that dramatically exaggerated the engagement strategies, to find a perfect blend between the famous ~feet on the ground~ seen in Call of Duty: WWII and Black's time to kill Oops III. If you have tried the Call of Duty Black Ops 4 beta, you will discover on your skin that in the final version of the game you die a little faster, leaving the habits unchanged for those who arrive directly from the old chapters. Certainly in this way the cures, which are now no longer automatic but must be activated through a special skill, are no longer so easy to use and almost always require you to stay out of combat for a few moments in order to benefit from them. The change to the game system is still successful, it puts more things to think about and new strategies to implement in order to grind kill after kill. Kills that serve and are indispensable to recall the new Score Streaks, which refer to the canons of the series. Reconnaissance UAVs and supply crates are the favorites simple to obtain, up to being able to make use of swarms of drones, helicopter gunships or automated bombers, nothing really new under the sun. Remaining in line with the past chapters, the pick ten also remains unchanged, i.e. the possibility of choosing ten between perks and attachments in order to create one's favorite class, a solution that is always promoted and decidedly valid both for variety and for the flexibility offered to players . Adding to all this then comes the role of specialists, nothing more than a new way to equip fighters with a devastating special move on cooldown. Ten characters and as many skills, more or less useful depending on the game mode, with, in addition, a second supplementary skill to be used with accelerated frequency. The aforementioned skills are nothing overwhelming or particularly original and are inspired by other shooters on the market, such as Destiny 2 or Overwatch, just to stay at Activision. It is an effective solution to bring freshness and align with other successful titles without excessive risk. In short, many elements for a gameplay of Call of Duty Black Ops 4 which above all entertains, is spectacular and seems not to get bored, with lots of specialists to use as specific counters and in team strategies, useful in this fourth chapter as never before . The fog of war closes the circle of the big news on the gameplay, an element that is structured around the mini-map, showing on the radar the enemies within our field of action and vision and that of our teammates, placing communication and collaboration on new levels. Maps: since the dawn of time the heart has not changed The whole play system holds up over the years and still works sublimely especially thanks to the new additions, but Treyarch has not limited itself to renewing the gameplay mechanics. The Call of Duty Black Ops 4 maps are more extensive and offer a variety never seen before: with the arrival of the specialists, in fact, it was necessary to give each area of the game different solutions for accessing and hiding, so as to favor a large number of strategies. We can then rely on thermal sights and keep the long corridors under fire or choose assault rifles for hand-to-hand combat, remaining aware that with such a wide range of solutions we will need our companions to back us up to get the better of it. Don't get us wrong, Call of Duty: Black ops 4 hasn't become a team game  la Rainbow Six: Siege and it doesn't even want to be, but it is clear that in competitive competition they will look for effective and complementary compositions much more than in the past of classes and specialists. And then there are new game modes to flesh out the offer such as Heist where, with an eye to Counterstrike, we will have to steal a bag of money and gradually buy more and more performing equipment; Control who will ask instead to conquer two goals before time runs out; the great classics like Team Deathmatch, Killing Confirmed and Hardpoint are also back. You could then try to invent something strange like the old Uplink or Gungame, even if these marginal variants will probably be added at a later time. Finally, for singleplayer lovers, know that you can play a whole series of challenges for the specialists who will then unlock the related skins on Black Out, short tutorials to get a general and complete picture of the skills available and useful for giving a background to each character present , with always very violent scenes and the typical Black Ops action, obviously based on multiplayer maps and modes. The biggest zombie pack ever And here we are delving into the Call of Duty Black Ops 4 zombie mode, a mode that has not only stood out over the years for being the real engine of Call of Duty downloadable content, but has always shown that it has a huge slice of fans ready to squeeze every square inch of the maps to understand all their secrets. Black Ops 4 then, to make up for the lack of the canonical singleplayer, throws three brand new campaigns into the cauldron, each with unique mechanics and settings. This year zombies made a lot of talk about themselves, if only because the setting shown during the Los Angeles reveal showed clashes in ancient Rome based on axes and flails, letting the imagination roam free towards a new system of hand-to-hand combat or other such peculiarities. Let's say that reality is slightly distant and if it is true that there are some very powerful specific weapons for close combat,the underlying mechanics will be the same for all three campaigns, with the need to kill zombies, discover the secrets and survive the waves so as to arm yourself to perfection and complete the tumultuous path. It's nice to discover while playing that the maps present all have particularly different level designs: IX is circular and makes little use of verticality, putting explosive tigers and gigantic gladiators against you; Voyage of Despair, set on the Titanic, will have you racing back and forth from stem to stern between demonic portals and Oscar-less DiCaprios hungry only for your brains while Blood of the Dead, inspired by the Mob of the Dead map from Black Ops 2 will throw you within the walls of Alcatraz with well-known characters and hellhounds to feed. Very varied settings therefore, united by an extremely in-depth character growth system. In fact, more than the mechanics of the individual maps, which we will explore in depth in a series of subsequent specials, we would like to point out that in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Zombie hides a completely new system of Perks. In fact, it will be possible to choose four elixirs to bring into battle, permanent cooldown power-ups to be activated in the most favorable moments. Recovery times are usually short and allow you to implement interesting strategies and facilitate the game on more complex difficulties: you can unlock them through ampoules to mix, receiving the ingredients at the end of each match, or buying them through the shop, with the most rare offered in the form of consumables. Then there are consumable talismans able to give you a buff for the whole game, perks to select for passive bonuses to damage or statistics and even special weapons: ultras to be used at the most propitious moment to cause great damage and get out of the most difficult situations. complicated. In short, as for the multi, everything seems to have been made more modern, without ever distorting the game and always giving players a lot of customization possibilities, elements that are apparently essential for this latest Call of Duty. It is completed by the special Rush mode, a sort of score mode, where you can kill zombies in series in the aforementioned maps as quickly as possible, for the sole purpose of setting new records and climbing the world rankings. Blackout Mode: Hunt for 60 FPS against 100 other players The market has moved in a very clear direction over the last couple of years, fully promoting Battle Royale as a new flagship entertainment genre. Whether it's a trend or something more, this is not the right place to sanction it, but what interests us is that Treyarch has not been able to resist the charm of these mega battles for a hundred players, so much so that he also wants to offer them in their new title. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 therefore welcomes the Blackout mode and does it in the most classic way possible: one hundred challengers will be thrown on an island and will have to do everything to survive while a deadly zone tightens around them. The game mechanics are by no means innovative, if we exclude the presence of zombies in some specific areas, but the effort made by Treyarch to adapt gunplay to a game system that is completely different from multiplayer games and which, in fact, is to be appreciated lives in a completely autonomous system. Although Blackout still doesn't drive us crazy, the developers must be recognized for their commitment to completely rewriting a physics system for bullets, which is no small factor if we think of the good number of weapons involved. Yes, because Blackout takes its cue more from Playerunknown's Battlegrounds than from Fortnite, allowing the player to mount attachments of various kinds on their favorite guns, including optics with differentiated zoom, silencers, increased magazines and so on. Blackout is a huge playground for fans, but technically it has to make some compromises to remain fluid and playable. Not all textures are of high quality, a necessary choice in order not to make the game map excessively heavy, which is really huge, functional and full of differentiated biomes, but above all to be able to keep the 60 FPS fluid that distinguish the whole package. As soon as you touch the ground, you immediately understand how the pace of the game is completely different than usual, without the map brightly lit by tracers and explosions. Blackout, in its current form, leaves you time to think, to stock up on medkits and armor but also gives you the feeling of being in a constant and pressing conflict, with shots whistling in the distance and a considerable viewing distance from which to see the enemies. There is also no shortage of vehicles and aircraft, from", "date": "2018-10-12", "grade": "8.5"}
