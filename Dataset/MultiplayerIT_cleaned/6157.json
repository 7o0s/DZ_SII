The tinyBuildGames title can in fact date its origin to 2011, the year in which the team formed by Tom Brien and Alex Nichiporchik published it for the first time in Flash format on the Newsgrounds website. Given the success, two years later No Time to Explain replied on Steam, on which it arrived after a successful campaign on Kickstarter: although the backers had guaranteed about 19,000 dollars more than the 7,000 requested, the final version for PC was haunted by bugs that heavily undermined its playability. Given the failure of the first attempt, the two boys did not give up, and decided to set up a Remastered version that arrived a few days ago on PC and Xbox One. 2011, 2013 and 2015: for No Time to Explain, all good things come in threes, thanks to the Remastered version! I'm you from the future Living up to its name, No Time to Explain throws the player right into the middle of the action, sketching the plot with a very small introduction in which the protagonist is surprised at his home by a mysterious character, who claims to be himself from the future . Not even the time to finish the sentence ~I am you from the future~ (a catchphrase during the adventure), that the future-I is carried away by a giant crab, dropping a laser beam that will become the endowment main character of the I-of-the-present launched in search of the other character. Contrary to what one might think, the beam is not a real weapon, given that for most of the time it is used as a jetpack, exploiting its thrust towards the opposite direction with respect to which it is pointed to make jumps and reach platforms around the level that are otherwise inaccessible. Unlike the game seen in 2013, the experience offered by this Remastered version undoubtedly manages to reach sufficiency, but unfortunately it is not free from some problems that end up annoying the player. In particular, the main accused is the laser: during the adventure its power seems to change without an apparent explanation, thus causing an unpleasant swing in the precision of the jumps that one expects to make. In the worst cases, you end up trying your luck trying again until fate decides to push us past the tipping point. It is no coincidence that No Time to Explain paradoxically gives its best in the phases in which the main weapon is set aside, such as for example when you have to resort to a rifle to similarly exploit its recoil to make jumps , but much more precisely than with a laser. The level in which the game genre completely changes is also quite successful, entering a horizontal scrolling shooter where the laser is used as a real weapon to shoot down enemies. The other occasions where this happens are represented by the bosses, apparently difficult in some cases, but all quite simple to deal with once their dynamics have been studied properly. During the normal levels the lives available to the player are infinite with the presence of checkpoints from which to resume in case of death, but during the final battles you have three lives available before the fight against the boss of the moment restarts from the beginning , erasing the progress. Simple and straightforward Compared to the 2013 version, from a technical point of view No Time to Explain Remastered presents itself in a completely different way: the developers have in fact completely cleaned up the graphics sector, eliminating the annoying frame rate losses that had sent the players into a rage. In analyzing the detail of No Time to Explain we must not forget that it is a title created to appear in Flash format on Newsgrounds: the style is therefore minimal, with details reduced to the bone and animations almost absent. The levels reflect with their variegated colors the madness that pervades the entire adventure, spent chasing the character from the future between jokes and screams that offer moments of humor that are quite pleasant, even if not always at the same level. The Remastered edition also brings with it a multiplayer mode, which allows you to play locally up to a maximum of 4 players also thanks to the addition of controller support, both on PC and on Xbox One: at full ranks, further chaos is added to the dynamics of the game, thus obtaining a good way to spend an evening. The soundtrack is very satisfying, which accompanies us with an adequate rhythm as we jump around the various levels, in which sometimes the good effects and the speech are lost perhaps a little too much in the cogeneral infusion of the screams launched by the protagonist, both in present and future versions. The price of 14.99 euros is perhaps a little exaggerated, considering that we are talking about a title that can be completed in about three hours and replayable only to collect some alternative hats, or try out the levels created by other users thanks to the internal editor.", "date": "2015-07-28", "grade": "6.2"}
