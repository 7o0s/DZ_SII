Before taking this step, however, dear John wanted to vent his undeniable talent for shooting in a video game, the Stranglehold one released in 2007 and capable of enjoying some success. Seven years later and making a somersault from home consoles to iOS devices, John Woo now tries again with this Bloodstroke, but the results are definitely not up to the fame of the Asian director... Nothing under the dress Bloodstroke shoots its best cartridges (it is appropriate to say it) in the presentation, actually of great impact: the user plays the role of a beautiful and lethal bodyguard nicknamed Lotus, who must escort a scientist through the dangerous streets of Hong Kong making havoc of all the bad thugs that appear in front of it. Framed from a bird's eye view, the game showcases a very refined cosmetic that makes it look like a painting colored only with watercolors in shades of gray: the only concessions to liveliness are represented by the red color that defines the Lotus dress and the blood spatter of downed enemies. The problem is that visual elegance is the only real strength of Bloodstroke, a title that in a short time demonstrates how little stuff it is made of. The gameplay is very simple, as the mobile costume requires: using a virtual stick and a few keys on the screen, the user must move the protagonist along the scenarios to eliminate the opponents before they can threaten the health of the scientist, represented by a special indicator. The story mode is made up of a good number of levels (all of rather short duration), at the end of which you get an evaluation based on your score and earn money that you can spend in the appropriate shop to upgrade Lotus' weapons, buy new ones and even to improve the scientist's stamina. There is no shortage of in-app purchases, represented by packages of virtual dollars which, however, are not advertised obsessively and which, moreover, are hardly needed, since it is possible to try your hand at special arenas to scrape together some extra comfort. Bloodstroke may boast a beautiful style, but the substance that puts on the plate is very little However, a few games are enough to understand that Bloodstroke has such serious deficiencies in terms of balancing that the entire play system collapses. To begin with, Lotus is completely invincible, an element that dramatically reduces the level of challenge of the game and that leads the experience on the tracks of an absolute monotony if combined with the other critical aspect that we are now going to illustrate: while being able to count on two distinct offensive tools such as firearms and melee blades, the playful economy relies excessively on the latter, given that each kill accumulated with this method guarantees triple the points. It is therefore in the user's interest to favor this action, which ends up reducing the gameplay of Bloodstroke to the simple act of running back and forth across the scenario approaching enemies to kill them with the edge of the sword, with the aforementioned invulnerability of the protagonist which eliminates any possible hint of contentment. The game, then, really seems to do its best to bask in this aura of absolute monotony: the graphics - however pleasant - always end up offering the usual glimpses and an almost non-existent variety of enemies, and even the music and sound effects (with an honorable mention for the annoying gunshots) seem to have been artfully created to accompany the action as repetitively as possible.", "date": "2014-02-07", "grade": "5.0"}
