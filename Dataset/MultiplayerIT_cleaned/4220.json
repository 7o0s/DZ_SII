His first gesture from Ekon is unfortunately tragic: blinded by bloodlust, he bites the first person that comes within range ... and unfortunately it's his sister Mary. Shocked by what happened, desperate for answers, Reid discovers he can use his new senses to perceive blood, whether it's the one circulating in the veins of people still alive or the one scattered on the ground or on the walls, a sign evident of a crime. The tracks lead him to interrogate some inhabitants in the port area, becoming familiar with the traditional system of dialogues with wheel options, and then to his first fight against a Skal, an aberrant progeny of vampires, intent on taking the life of a man of faith, manager of a shelter for the desperate. Jonathan manages to save the intended victim and meets two key characters for his new life: the beautiful Elizabeth Ashbury, also a vampire, and Dr. Edgar Swansea. The latter offers him a collaboration to shed light on the epidemic that torments London and which seems to have to do with the hordes of Skal who increasingly roam the streets of the city: Reid will be able to work at Pembroke Hospital, using the own knowledge of a hematologist to study the disease and identify its origin. Of course, working the night shift. Nocturnal animals Archived the first stages of the game, which serve to introduce us to the basic mechanisms of the gameplay, the Vampyr experience reveals its cards in the form of a freely explorable sandbox structure (net of some loading necessary to access certain buildings), which allows you to visit four different areas of London: the port, the aforementioned Pembroke Hospital, Whitechapel and, in the second part of the campaign, the West End. Each of these districts boasts a different ~state of health~ which depends on how the its inhabitants, from the possible elimination of key figures and from how the protagonist intervenes in this regard, offering medicines to those in need to improve the general condition of the neighborhood. The worsening of the state of a specific area multiplies the presence of enemies, whether they are Skal, Ekon or vampire hunters, the latter divided into various categories: there are soldiers armed with torches or pistols, those who shoot darts on fire, the armored troops armed with shotguns or poisonous gas, or even the ~preachers~ with their imposing size, the crucifix and holy water. Then there are the bosses, who give life to exhausting and well-crafted duels. A respectable variety, with opponents who level up depending on the district in which they are located and who will give us a hard time from the beginning to the end of the adventure, revealing an approach to fighting that in some cases is terribly close to ruthlessness of soulslike: the damage inflicted even by the most common enemies is huge, the game overs are wasted and the only difference compared to more hardcore productions is that once we return to life we will not lose the experience points collected up to that moment. Young vampires grow up Around the dark, eerie and gloomy night London of Vampyr it is possible to find several shelters for Dr. Reid, places in which to examine substances collected around, create serums and drugs, as well as use the rich and varied loot (obtainable both by sifting through bins, furniture and objects, both by collecting what is left by slain enemies) to improve the weapons that make up the equipment. There are obviously different types: scythes and maces, slow but powerful, occupy both available slots but allow you to parry the blows of your opponents to open a gap in their defense and allow us to bite them, thus increasing the bar of the protagonist's blood, necessary for the execution of all the special moves; swords and daggers, fast but capable of inflicting minor damage, allow you to keep a large part of the stamina and use it for quick dodges, the maneuver that transforms the protagonist into a cloud of smoke; and finally all the secondary tools, whether they are guns (not particularly effective but iable to stun the enemy) or special knives, which collect a little blood with each blow. Each setup substantially changes the approach to fighting, and it is possible to memorize two configurations to be recalled instantly, by pressing the d-pad, so as to better prepare to face specific opponents. Inside the shelters it is also possible to lie down for daytime rest, spending the experience points collected in this juncture in order to improve the character's abilities (health, stamina, blood bar) and unlock the many special moves available, which allow recharge the energy using one's own flesh (autophagy), emit plasma projectiles, create temporary barriers, make rapid leaps forward to take the enemy by surprise, block him for a few moments, but also resort to the most hidden abilities of the Ekons to unleash the fury of multiple attacks, shadow blades and blood explosions. Depending on the effectiveness of the maneuver, the reload time increases: a factor to be taken into account when going around the city, although the special sight of the vampires (activated by pressing the left stick on its axis) allows you to see in advance the presence of any threats and decide what to do. A wolf among the sheep The growth of Jonathan Reid during the Vampyr campaign is a fundamental factor in order to be able to face the last stages of the story in a relatively easy way, although as mentioned the degree of challenge remains high in all cases and often leads to retrying bosses several times fight but also fights against standard enemies, perhaps present in large numbers within a place that we have the task of exploring. Pursuing the enhancement of the character is not simple and costs sacrifices, in the literal sense of the term: where the level of fascination allows it (it must be higher than that of the potential victim), we will be able to choose to bite one of the sixty-four NPCs divided among the four districts of the map and thus earning a large amount of experience points, much more than by successfully facing some duels or completing side quests. The temptation to indulge in the bloodlust of the Ekon therefore increases hand in hand with the increase in the challenge, and at this juncture the title of Dontnod Entertainment gives us the reins of the situation, leaving us the decision of who to kill and why, based on each character's background; or to resist the urge and not eliminate anyone, so as to get the best possible conclusion in the end. In this sense, the limits are few, and it is even possible to ~embrace~ even the figures responsible for the trade, those from whom we will be able to buy components and ingredients useful for creating drugs, serums and upgrades for weapons. Doing so will obviously imply a change in the economy of the area, but in fact trade does not represent a fundamental part of the experience and you will therefore find yourself snubbing it without too many compliments: it is one of the aspects that the French team has not been able to exploit properly . Interview with the vampire There is no doubt that the narrative sector is one of the fundamental elements of Vampyr, and from this point of view, in our opinion, an excellent job has been done, perhaps net of some shortcomings. Doctor Reid's story is told in a convincing way, with the right timing, and although the final part of the adventure avoids delving into certain relationships, getting lost a bit in the rush to conclude, there is no doubt that the ~lore~ created by Dontnod Entertainment is particularly full of ideas. The use of a proven system such as the dialogue wheel allows, by making the right choices, to discover new possible clues about certain NPCs, opening up to side quests and situations in which killing someone could even be sensible for the purposes of a certain ethical consistency. In fact, the most trivial questions are opposed by central questions, indicated with a text of a different color, as well as the choices that will then influence the progress of the story. Similarly, the scenario is littered with letters, diaries and testimonies that allow you to further deepen your knowledge of London that is the backdrop to the adventure, the sometimes complex plots that led to the spread of the mysterious epidemic that keeps the city in check and the sometimes surprising relationship that binds some citizens. To accompany this system in the best way there are excellent dialogues in English (subtitled in Italian), well recited and a very successful audio design, which effectively communicates the atmosphere of the game and underlines certain sequences.ze with a successful mix of strings, but also with disturbing motifs when Jonathan decides to ~embrace~ someone, hypnotizing him and then leading him to an isolated place where he can give vent to his thirst. Some moments reminded us of the television series ~Penny Dreadful~, and we don't consider it a defect at all, on the contrary. Budget question Vampyr does an excellent job on the narrative front, boasts an absolutely non-trivial, challenging and diversified combat system, as well as a fairly large map, freely explorable but without the possibility of moving quickly to places already visited. A design choice that goes hand in hand with the intention of putting the player in front of the difficulty of moving in increasingly problematic environments, with enemies around every corner making it difficult to reach the areas indicated for completing the current mission; also deriving from the connotation of a less extensive scenario than one would usually expect from a high-budget production, which however the title of Dontnod is not. During our experience we have often wondered if the availability of more resources, those that we generally attribute to triple A games, would have allowed the French team to fully express the potential of a project that undoubtedly stands out for its quality, atmosphere and solidity of ideas brought into play, even if not exactly original; but which at the same time is ~held back~ in terms of size, unable to make the most of certain aspects and, above all, characterized by graphics that too often reveal an ~old gen~ nature. Here the question gets thorny and we hope to be able to clarify it, because there is really nothing ~ugly~ in the visual sector of Vampyr, which, moreover, on the test configuration holds the sixty frames per second at 1440p and with all the settings at most, asking instead to limit the frequency to thirty frames if you want to go up to 2160p (needless to say that we preferred the first option). There are simply aspects that would have required greater attention: above all the animations of the protagonist, particularly ~old~ during the race, but also and above all the definition of the textures, which did not seem up to Ultra HD resolutions and which often show their side to vague and pixelated textures. The effects in general are instead excellent, thanks to the need to show a London exclusively at night, wet and foggy, with puddles and sidewalks that effectively refract the lights. The desertification of the neighborhoods, with the exception of the non-player characters to interact with, is clearly the result of the difficult situation in which the City finds itself and of the times in which the adventure takes place, therefore it should not be seen as a technical lack and falls within the category of expedients which, if used in an even more careful way, could have avoided certain blunders.", "date": "2018-06-05", "grade": "8.0"}
