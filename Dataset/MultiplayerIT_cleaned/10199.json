Anyone with a good memory (and obviously those who bought it) will certainly remember it, since it was a title which, while not proposing a new concept (Arika was also the author of Everblue on PS2), was proposed to the public as a examples of the new philosophy of the Kyoto house focused more on casual games than on traditional games. The result was certainly a well-made product, with a large exploratory component, rich in information on marine fauna and also technically good, but which made many turn up their noses due to the lack of a real objective. And what better method than a sequel to fill the gaps of the original? Here, good, nobody. Atlantis? Surely the protagonist of the game, of which we can define a few, simple parameters, did not imagine, while studying and practicing to get the diving license, that once he found a job he would be involved in an adventure like the one that he will be called to live a once the console is turned on... The fact is that ours (or ours) comes into contact with Jean-Eric Rouvier and his granddaughter Oceane, head and member of the R&R, a team of divers who takes care, in a small Republic in the Pacific of the South, of the most varied tasks that divers can take care of. But the story of the fifteen-year-old prodigy Oceane and her ex-diver grandfather, who can no longer dive, soon reveals itself to be much more mysterious and complicated than it first appeared: in particular a strange pendant that Oceane got from her father who died years ago, will kick off a whole series of research and explorations that revolve around the legend of the ~Song of Dragons~. The team will thus find themselves looking for ancient finds and real submerged buildings, in a story that will also be very engaging for those who are passionate about Atlantis and its surroundings, and which is, despite its not excessive originality, certainly well told. The main novelty compared to the prequel is therefore the presence of a plot and an ~end~, with various missions that will mark the game time. But limiting yourself to carrying out the main quest would mean missing out on a good 60% of the adventure, which re-proposes all the elements of the predecessor with various implementations and improvements. The fundamental components remain the exploration and cataloging of the various life forms, aquatic and otherwise, which will be encountered in diving, gradually filling all the entries of the encyclopedia present in the game with the main characteristics of fish, mammals and quant 'other and, for some species, with nice curiosities to be unlocked by carrying out certain actions. But that's not all: you can also recover finds to evaluate and sell (with the money earned you can buy new equipment), carry out various sub-missions always useful for earning some cash, devote yourself to photography and interact with dolphins and birds, real and own ~pets~ to train in the most varied stunts. Among the most important innovations, then, the introduction of an unrealistic pulsar gun with which to heal wounded creatures and/or calm the most dangerous ones (yes, some nasty sharks this time can be encountered from time to time a lot), and the possibility of appearing on the surface to closely study terrestrial life forms, such as polar bears in the Arctic scenario. In short, an extremely varied game, in which the main activities remain, all in all, the relaxing ones of the first chapter; but this time, for those who got bored with Endless Ocean, the programmers have also provided some, very welcome, action. The Age of Aquarius Among the things that have not changed there is also, and fortunately, the control system, very immediate and intuitive thanks to the simple use of the remote control alone, but once again subject to small pointer sensitivity problems and similar details. The longevity of the title, which stands at seven to eight hours as regards the main story, increases dramatically for anyone who wants to experience the game in the relaxed and calm way typical of the first episode, not to mention the return of diving with a buddy in multiplayer via the Internet, this time also graced by voice chat for Wii Speak owners. For all those who, on the other hand, were disappointed by the previous title precisely because of the actual lack of action, it suffices to know that in any case we still have to deal with a slower pace than most ~modern~ games, and this above all because of the extension of the scenarios that requires a little patience to locate the objective of a given mission: this side of the game can cause frustration to those simply looking for an Action from the original setting. However, the latter is rendered splendidly, considering the capabilities of the Wii, by the suitably improved engine of the first episode: the underwater scenarios are, taken as a whole, breathtaking, thanks to the extended horizon, the effects that recreate the environment and above all to the various animals present, which can even reach a large number at the same time, all rendered well and animated in a credible way, just as the behaviors of schools of fish and isolated creatures are probable. Of course, going into detail it turns out that the polygons of each element are not so many, that some textures are clearly ~thrown there~ just to give an idea, but the final effect, which is what counts, is also above the norm for a Wii title. Finally, the sound is slightly below the first chapter, especially for the choice to entrust the explorations to a fairly anonymous soundtrack and not to give the player the possibility, as in the previous episode, to create his own lineup via SD Card: however, there are some very very beautiful licensed pieces, and the various sound effects manage to capture the evocative atmosphere in a substantially worthy way.", "date": "2010-02-12", "grade": "7.8"}
