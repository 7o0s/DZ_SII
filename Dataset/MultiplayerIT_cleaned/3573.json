{"name": "Pokmon Rumble Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-rumble-rush-la-recensione.html", "text": "Among all the spin-offs that The Pokmon Company has invented in the last twenty years, the Rumble derivative is probably the one that has stood out for its personality thanks to the angular stylization of the little monsters, represented in the form of toys (and in fact sold as such for a short time, before the toys-to-life market crashed). Pokmon Rumble Rush is the mobile evolution of a series that began its run on Wii in 2009 and then moved to Wii U and Nintendo 3DS before landing on the iOS and Android platforms. As it has evolved especially in the most recent title, Pokmon Rumble World, the series could only be the ideal candidate for a mobile transposition: it is a simple, intuitive formula, which is aimed above all at the little ones and which adapts perfectly to a hit and run experience. What could go wrong? pokemon islands Pokmon Rumble Rush abandons any narrative claim to catapult the player into a boundless archipelago populated by all the pokmon we know, to which presumably those of Pokmon Sword and Shield will also be added in a few months. We are talking about more than eight hundred little monsters, although they are not all available from the start: the game, in fact, offers a different island every two weeks where there are about twenty monsters at a time. In this way the player is forced to launch the app periodically to catch new pokmon and in a sense has to start over every time, because it is not possible to use pokmon caught on a different island on a certain island. Pokmon Rumble Rush is therefore configured as a kind of game as service with a series of rotating events that can hold the players' interest. Interest which, however, runs out relatively quickly due to various problems. The most obvious of these problems undoubtedly concerns the simplicity of the gameplay which, practically automated, leaves little room for the player's skill. The latter could also take control of the selected pokmon, which alone moves towards the closest opponents to attack them, but is practically useless when fighting normal little monsters. At the end of each stage, however, a boss awaits us who requires a bit more attention and strategy: defeating him gives a certain satisfaction, also because in most cases you only succeed after choosing the right pokmon. The little monsters are not captured as in the normal titles of the series. Essentially they are found at random, vary in power based on the stars that distinguish them and have a completely random move that pushes the player to ~grind~ the stages to find the right combinations of pokmon and moves. And this is the second problem of Pokmon Rumble Rush. Beyond the completely random assignment of the moves which can be quite frustrating, the grinding does not only concern the little monsters but also two specific elements of the gameplay: feathers and minerals. The former serve to unlock new islands, marked by specific coordinates on the world map. The idea is ingenious, but the interface is awkward and imprecise and more than once you end up selecting the wrong stages, wasting the precious feathers in question. Fortunately this is the lesser of evils because you can save the most interesting stages so that you can repeat them as many times as you want: unlike many other mobile games, Pokmon Rumble Rush does not impose any limits in this sense. It does, however, with regard to the minerals that need to be refined in the workshop, a special menu which, moreover, is particularly prone to causing the app to crash. The minerals are transformed into gears that give pokmon special bonuses, including the ability to temporarily summon another little monster to inflict a particularly effective attack against the enemy in turn. If you want to defeat the toughest bosses and super bosses, you need to choose the right combination of pokmon, moves and gears like in a real RPG; the problem is that refining a mineral takes several hours and this is where the usual microtransactions come into play, designed precisely to reduce these waiting times. In reality they do not affect the game too limitingly, but without the right power-ups it becomes much more difficult, if not impossible, to face each content. If anything, it's the bugs and the optimization that really hinder the player: sudden crashes, some freezes and a code that consumes the battery too quickly, forcing the already approximate image quality to further decrease.", "date": "2019-07-30", "grade": "5.5"}
