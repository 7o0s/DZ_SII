{"name": "Street Riders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-riders.html", "text": "At the end of each mission, in fact, if you place in the first three positions you will receive a sort of prize and consequent compensation (gold, silver and bronze bullet), which usually consists of a series of Items useful for upgrading the car for the next race by equipping it for example with a higher amount of energy, or with a greater number of ammunition. Ammunition that will prove vital when, having collected one of the icons that will equip you with a random weapon among those available, they will allow Buck, your adventure companion, to lean out of the window and start shooting at enemies (by pressing the console's back buttons R and L  Ed -). Obviously, the car you choose for the race will also play a fundamental role: each of them is in fact characterized by personal ~skills~ that make them unique and which consist of speed or physical resistance of the different bodywork, etc. With 66 single-player missions and Wi-Fi local network co-op (one player drives, one shoots) as well as more traditional deathmatch options, longevity seems safe too. Visually Street Riders is very accurate and detailed. The engine is one of the best seen on PsP, and offers well-defined graphics, effectively allowing the game to maintain a certain general quality despite a constant frame-rate. All without particular flickering problems. Not even when many fast-moving objects appear on the screen or there are particular effects such as explosions or crazy car fragments that fall apart (shown in slow motion). It is interesting to note, with regard to this aspect, that the physics of the game are also absolutely valid, credible, especially in the impacts between the bodies of the cars (which are deformed) or of the bullets with them. The ambient sound effects are very good, starting with the shots to get to the sound of your engine and the soundtrack that will accompany your evolutions, with ~hard~ and pounding rhythms. Conclusions If you like arcade games where in addition to racing cars you have to kill your opponents and you loved titles like Burnout Legend or Pursuit Force, then Street Riders could be for you. Funny, the Ubisoft title, a real middle ground between the two aforementioned driving games, certainly represents a valid title for PsP in its genre. Pros: Very accurate graphics. Fun missions, especially in Multiplayer. Good variety of mediums. Cons: A little too difficult in some places. Short single player mode. After the modest success found on Ps2 and Xbox with 187 Ride or Die, Ubisoft could not fail to try to re-propose the fun concept behind this game also on the Sony portable console. Especially considering the positive sales data of another similar title already seen on PsP, Pursuit Force. Street Riders is in fact a driving and fighting game in which the player, aboard cars equipped with all sorts of war trinkets, must compete against other drivers fighting meter by meter until the finish line. While trying to survive and physically eliminate as many opponents as possible. The plot of Street Riders (yes, the game has a plot despite the genre) revolves around the figure of a young drifter, us, picked up from the street by a Los Angeles boss, a certain Dupree, who, threatened in his territory by a another bad guy of his kind, Cortez, instructs our friend to eliminate the rival's henchmen with any means at his disposal to restore dominance over the area. The Ubisoft title is essentially divided into three game modes: Story Mode, Quick Clash and Multiplayer. Among them, it is the one called History that proves to be the most intriguing. In fact, in this mode, the player will have to compete on various routes in real missions with different race objectives, following a narrative line, complete with interlude cut-scenes, which will lead him to a series of challenges of various kinds up to the final one. The challenges offered by the game are many and range from the canonical endurance race with cars driven by Cortez's men ready to throw you out or brighten up your ride with machine guns, to ~escape from the police~ on a highway, escaping them through the streets a chaotic city paying attention to the traffic, in both directions. Along the way you can use different weapons to take out your opponents: some are already equipped in the machine, others you can pick up along the way. Furthermore, by completing the Story Mode it will be possible to unlock a whole series of bonuses useful for increasing the longevity of the Ubisoft title, such as new challenges, characters and automezzi that can also be used in the other modalities.", "date": "2006-06-06", "grade": null}
