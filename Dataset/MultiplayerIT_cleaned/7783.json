The problem is that we see the undead as George Romero's first cinematic representations showed them to us - pathetic, slow-moving creatures that only become dangerous in packs. However, some films produced in recent years have launched a different image of zombies, able in this case to run fast and therefore constitute a lethal threat even if ~tasted in small doses~. With the film ~World War Z~ the question takes on even paradoxical connotations, with the undead who not only move fast but also form frightening crowds, trampling each other to overcome obstacles, like a devastating wave that sweeps everything away, moving apparently by a single will. The video game adaptation of the film starring Brad Pitt was entrusted to the talented developers of Phosphor Games, already authors of quality titles such as Dark Meadow and Horn. Therefore, after the failure of the Kickstarter campaign for Project Awakened, the Spanish team is confronted with a tie-in that mixes shooter sections, first-person combat and even adventure elements in three fascinating locations: Denver, Kyoto and Paris. The story is not the same as the film, but takes place parallel to it, with the protagonist who is in the middle of the zombie invasion and is determined to reach Kyoto, where his son is and where, apparently, the same disaster. Compartmentally sealed Each development team dealing with the peculiarities of mobile devices decides to address certain issues in its own way, and in the case of World War Z we have a touch control system that activates the movements of the character through simple touches, indicating on the screen the area towards which we want to move, while we can use the left thumb to act freely on the view. The game manages the various aspects of the gameplay in a distinct and separate way, a solution that can leave you perplexed at first but which soon proves to be functional to the action, providing the necessary space for each situation and avoiding annoying overlaps. And so if the exploration of the scenarios, one of the key elements of the experience, works as just described, when zombies appear on the scene, things change: if it is a herd, our alter ego pulls take out the firearm and start shooting as in a ~fixed~ FPS in which we can move the viewfinder and there is automatic fire (great intuition to make this practice agile on touch screens, too bad everyone doesn't get it), while if there is only one undead we can face him brandishing a makeshift weapon, initially a crowbar, trying to avoid his charges and hitting him as soon as he is within range. The close combats unfortunately represent the least successful part of this production, it is no coincidence that the updates released so far by Phosphor Games were aimed above all at polishing the edges. It's strange, given the excellent work done with both Dark Meadow and, above all, with Horn from this point of view. With the updates, the situation has improved significantly, given that at the beginning the game did not correctly detect our maneuvers, but a general enjoyment problem remains for these phases. On the other hand, the shooter sequences appear repetitive but effective, made more interesting by the possibility of buying new weapons or upgrading those in our possession by spending the experience points earned by finding objects and solving simple puzzles. The adventure aspects of the experience are basic, it mostly involves memorizing codes and entering them into the appropriate devices for opening doors, or connecting power wires, or even moving crates. No location map is provided, which is very old school and good, but the overall challenge rating remains fairly low throughout the game. Nothing to say, however, on the front of the technical sector: beyond an excellent sound, with well-acted English dialogues and sufficiently ~full-bodied~ sound effects, the graphics powered by the Unreal Engine are confirmed as rich in details, fluid and convincing, with some moments of great impact and only a few uncertainties. World War Z is a very interesting, full-bodied and engaging tie-in, but with some flaws.", "date": "2013-06-18", "grade": "7.7"}
