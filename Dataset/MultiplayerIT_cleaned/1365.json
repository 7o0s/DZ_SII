Being in contact with the miasma for a few seconds, in fact, people die. The various villages are kept alive thanks to the power of some magical crystals, which prevent the miasma from infecting small areas of land. However, these crystals only work through a substance called Myrrh, which, as you can imagine, is very rare and difficult to recover. In order not to give in to the advance of the miasma, the crystal must be recharged with myrrh every year, and this is why, every twelve months, the villages send the most promising youngsters and adventurers around the world in search of this precious substance veterans. These people, who are responsible for keeping the entire community alive, manage to avoid being infected by the miasma as they explore the world thanks to a miniature version of the crystal of their hometown. Obviously the area purified by the small crystal is rather limited, and you will only have to move within it. As you may have imagined, it will be up to you to impersonate one of the adventurers in search of myrrh. You can create your character by choosing from four different races, each with different characteristics from the other. For each race there are eight characters, four male and four female. The statistics of the characters compared to other games of this type are few, only four plus the ~memories~ figure, which indicates how long a particular adventurer has been wandering in search of myrrh. The further you progress in the game, the more powerful your virtual alter-ego will become. However, your characteristics will not increase by directly killing enemies, because there are no experience points; exploring the stages you will find objects called artifacts, and, once you have killed the boss who presides over the level, you can choose one to keep. There are many, some increase the attack, others the magical power, it will be up to you to decide which ones to keep based on how you want to orient your character. This fairly slow evolution of the fighter will allow you to easily insert new adventurers into your group (yes, there is a multiplayer mode). The gameplay Once you've created your character, given your city a name and chosen your parents' profession (a choice that will determine the type of items you'll receive at the end of the year), it's time to set off on an adventure. The world of FFCC is divided into five continents, for a total of about fifteen levels. Each stage features a good variety of enemies, only some of them are common to multiple settings. At the end of each level you will have to face a boss who, in most cases, will be quite easy to beat. Within the stages you will have, as in any self-respecting hack'n'slash, hit, hit and hit again. The puzzles are few and quite simple, although they almost never fall into banality. As it stands to reason, the combat system assumes a fundamental importance, and that of Final Fantasy behaves very well. Before analyzing it in detail, however, it is necessary to specify some important things regarding the gameplay: the single player game must be played with a classic GameCube controller, with the possibility of checking your statistics and the level map from the GBA screen ( plug into the second GC pad port). In multiplayer all  all  players must play with a GBA. For this reason, the control system has been simplified to the maximum: with the analog stick or the digital cross you move the character, with L and R you scroll through the various skills (attack, defense, objects, spells), with A you perform and with Start it pauses. In Single Player mode, with X you also access the menu, from which you can use the objects, equip the character's weapons, observe his statistics and check other details. You will be able to perform these actions in peace, as the game will pause giving you time to operate in peace. In multiplayer the situation is very different: to access the menu you will have to press the Select key on your GBA, and then control it from the screen of your laptop. The functioning of the menu is identical to that of the single player mode, however there is a substantial difference: in multiplayer the game will not stop, you will therefore be forced to make your choices in the shortest possible time, as you will be an easy target for the enemies while operating on vour screen. We said earlier that the action takes place within a zone, or rather a circle, within which the miasma has no effect. In single the crystal that generates this protection will be carried by an adorable moogle, a typical animal of the series, so you can move around the world at will. In multiplayer the moogle will not be there, and one of the players will have to carry the crystal. In addition to being much slower than the furry bird, the unfortunate character will not be able to perform any action while holding the crystal. At this point a problem arises: since while a player uses his menu from the gba the game doesn't stop, how does he keep his character inside the circle? Simple, the adventurer will be transported automatically from the edge of the protected area. The advantage deriving from the use of the GBA, therefore, is that of not having to interrupt the action every time you want to consult your menu. Surely this fact does not justify the purchase of four laptops to be able to play multiplayer, but if you have them available you will realize, especially if you have played other titles of this type, that playing without interrupting the action every ten seconds is very more comfortable. Another aspect not mentioned above is that, obviously, since all the characters have to be inside the restricted protected area, the screen in multiplayer is not divided into small parts as it was, for example, in Phantasy Star Online. Furthermore, each player will have a secret mission that will be communicated to him by the gba. The more he plays in compliance with this mission (for example, don't use super attacks, collect money, etc.) the more points he will get in the end. The player who has the most points at the end of the stage will be able to choose the artifact first. Obviously these missions aim to increase the challenge: if on the one hand you will earn more points by remaining faithful to your secret objective (the others will not be able to see it since you will have it on your personal screen), on the other you will damage the collaboration with the other adventurers. Let's go back to the combat system: the attack is similar to the one already seen in Phantasy Star Online. In addition to launching a single hit by pressing A once, you can perform a combo of three consecutive attacks by pressing it several times at the right time. By holding down A, however, you can perform a special attack. Within the levels you will also collect spheres that will allow you to perform magic, which to tell the truth there are not many. They are divided into healing and offensive, as usual. Strangely, the spells will not be your character, but you will have to collect the orbs that contain them every time you start a new level. Even more strangely once found they can be used indefinitely, since there are no limits to ability power in FFCC. The spheres, as well as the objects, can be found inside chests or dropped by defeated enemies. Objects are of different types. There are those to heal, which will temporarily increase your characteristics as well. Each character has his favorite foods: the more your ~object~ likes the character the more hearts (which indicate your energy) he will recharge. There are items to send to the family via mogu-posta, so that you will receive more gifts when you return to your hometown at the end of the year. Finally, there are the pieces of materials (iron, alloy, mithril and many others) and the plans for armor or weapons. When you enter the cities, which are few, one per continent, you can take your project and the materials to make it to the blacksmith who, by requesting a few gold coins, will make it for you. Objects and weapons are present in a fair amount, although the variety proposed for example by Phantasy Star Online is very far away. Towns in FFCC are nothing more than zones to sell/buy items, you won't be able to enter any houses. There is only one sub quest in the game, nice enough, but only one. The depth of the gameplay undergoes a surge by playing in multiplayer, given that you can perform attacks and combined spells. It might seem like a trivial thing, but we assure you that it is a very interesting and well-crafted feature. A great advantage of the game is that it offers very different levels, with many enemies and various settings. There are both outdoor and indoor internships, more or less complicated. Another positive note is that the stronger your character becomes the more powerful the enemies of all levels will be, so no massacres when it comes time to backtrack. The game essentially offers a long experience and high replayability, being valid both in single and inmultiplayer, while giving its best in the latter mode. Mind you, we are not talking about the fun generated by playing together, but about an objective increase in the quality of the gameplay. The contour Let's start with the story, which plays a marginal role. In addition to the vague main storyline related to the miasma, you will come across other adventurers along the way who will spice up your journey with their tales. Nothing important, however appreciable these scenes that dampen the warlike spirit of the game. Each event of this type will be noted by the character in a diary, together with notes on the stages explored. The graphics, as usual for Square, are wonderful. Nothing earth-shattering, but the style is adorable and the touches are plentiful. No exaggerations in the use of polygons, just a skilful modeling and an excellent use of texture. Four details that show how much Square cares about making the visual part of its work perfect: the water, which reflects everything (although it is not physically credible), the circle that delimits the protected area within which the players move, it adapts perfectly to the polygonal surfaces of the levels, the fur of the moogle, Rare-style fur-shading, the light effects of the areas called ~miasma streams~. Absent the usual FMV movies, replaced for the occasion by real-time skits. In conclusion, a jewel. The sound succeeds in the difficult task of living up to the graphics. Beautiful music will accompany your adventure, the Celtic-style one in the introduction is memorable. Excellent sound effects, treated in detail (such as the noise of the wheels of the caravan). Too bad you can't take advantage of Dolby Pro Logic II. To conclude, a praise to the Italian translation which, although it is quite ridiculous in some cases (the starry carrot will become a legend), overall it is certainly enjoyable and also far from the horrors seen in the past. Comment Final Fantasy Christal Chronicle is a good hack'n'slash, which ensures excellent longevity and great fun, thanks also to the multiplayer mode which enriches an already well-structured gameplay. The defects that can be attributed to it are a lack of depth, as it is more simplistic than other games of this type, and a not too much variety of weapons and objects. It is clear that not everyone can like it, hack'n'slash are particular games that may seem repetitive to many, and it will certainly not be FFCC that will make you change your opinion on this point. We recommend it to all lovers of the genre and to those who want a good cooperative game to play with friends, provided they have an adequate number of GBA, and respective connection cables, to play. Pros: Simple but effective game structure Good multiplayer mode Majestic graphics and sound Cons: Lack of depth The GBAs, fundamental in multi, could have been better exploited. The huge expense is not justified. Final Fantasy Christal Chronicles has been one of the most anticipated games for the GameCube since it was announced. All this hype on the one hand has generated excellent sales, which surely would not have been so voluminous if the game had not been called Final Fantasy, on the other hand it has fueled false hopes in the hearts of the players; it is true that the title in question bears the name of this famous saga, but it has very little to do with the other chapters of the series. Therefore, we warn you right now, if you intend to buy this game with the conviction of buying a classic Final Fantasy, therefore a j-rpg, stay away, as Christal Chronicle is totally different. The best way to enjoy this new and first game from the Game Designers Studio is to start it without any kind of prejudice, without the pretension of being in front of a masterpiece or any Final Fantasy in this way, rest assured, you won't you will be disappointed.", "date": "2004-03-19", "grade": null}
