In almost forty years of history, the colorful arcade puzzle born from the mind of Toru Iwatani has been reinterpreted dozens of times on the most diverse platforms, yesterday but also today. The Championship Edition boasts a fairly recent history, having been proposed for the first time by Namco in the Xbox 360 LIVE Arcade catalog just over ten years ago, and then also landed on other platforms, including mobile ones. Considering that the renewal operation was quite successful at the time, the Japanese publisher decided to return to the office with Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, essentially an edition on steroids that reiterated the already proven formula. Strengthened by an even more dynamic, immediate and challenging structure, the fun Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 landed on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One two years ago and with this last chapter we arrive at current events. The episode released in 2016 is in fact ready to return to the scene with a Plus version intended for the Nintendo Switch catalog; a choice that all in all is not surprising at all, especially if we consider the arcade caliber of the product in question and the opportunity to use it even when you are far from your living room. An endless race against time The distinctive feature of this version of Pac-Man is precisely linked to the high execution speed required to successfully complete every single section of the game. Unlike what happens in the historical version, where running into one of the Mephistopheles ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde immediately determined the loss of a life, in this case it is possible to take advantage of a sort of bonus linked to the execution speed: only by touching the trains formed by the spirits twice consecutively, the latter are transformed into furious entities to be avoided at all costs. So yes, in this case a simple and fleeting touch is enough to see the already small supply of extra lives at one's disposal reduced by one unit. By ingesting a sufficient number of Pac-Points at full speed, the appropriate bar located in the lower part of the screen is filled and access is gained to the Energy Balls, the key tool with which the roles on the field end up diametrically overturning. As if by magic, the ghosts that were chasing us up until a moment before turn into prey and start running away, moving wildly in any direction. At that point the only action necessary to avoid being overwhelmed by the timer is to identify the head of each group and to arrive from the opposite direction to mercilessly swallow the leaders of the merry crew and all the rest of the row that diligently follows close behind. Equally fundamental is the Saltabomba, a tool by which you can get out of the way whenever you are surrounded by ghosts or when you need to quickly reach the center of the map to forfeit the object that will allow you to continue in your desperate battle against time. The main section of the game faithfully reproduces the one already appreciated two years ago. By choosing Adventure you can try your hand at a series of areas of increasing difficulty, made up of ten levels each and a final boss that must be unlocked in order to access the following area. The approach is very simple: the higher the difficulty set for the resolution of the level, the higher the number of stars forfeited, up to a maximum of three at a time. Considering that already at the Normal level a good dose of speed and strategic evaluation is required to extricate oneself brilliantly in certain situations, it goes without saying that the degree of challenge of the game proves to be more than sufficient to stimulate even the most demanding and gifted users. superfine reflexes. Alternatively, you can opt for the Score Hunt mode, in which you have to do nothing but fight incessantly against time in an attempt to make the best possible score within as many as forty variable routes, many of which are to be unlocked by bringing successfully completed the first round. Frenzy and fun, now also in co-op The only novelty introduced in this version for Nintendo Switch provides a fun cooperative mode for two players to be enjoyed strictly locally with the help of the two Joy-Con controllers. The control system remains unchanged, but obviously you have to deal with the small size of the pad. In the most agitated and fast phases there are some too many headaches, but it isjust do a little 'practice to be able to extricate yourself even in these situations. In this case it is necessary to completely clean up the level and then make the two characters converge on the same position to take on the fruit that each of them is carrying in their mouths. When the turn of the Energy Balls arrives, you can start hunting ghosts, but with a slightly different dynamic than that provided in the single-player mode. In this case, in fact, it is necessary to coordinate properly with your ally in order to swallow each enemy by attacking it from both sides at the same time. There are only six selectable paths and, just as in the main mode, also in this case it is necessary to make good use of the time available to get to the end-of-level boss with a sufficient margin to finish the raid without worries. In Plus mode, these clashes also have some peculiarities. First of all, both players enter an arena with large spaces, where first you need to recover the few dozen Pac-Points located in the center of the arena and then collect the inevitable Energy Ball capable of making the enemy vulnerable. At that point, all you have to do is attack the victim at full speed through the jump command. For the sake of completeness it is worth emphasizing that the aforementioned levels can still be enjoyed alone while the second character will be controlled by the CPU. As we anticipated at the beginning, the best quality of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus on Switch is basically the use in portable mode. Depending on its intrinsic characteristics, the game adapts wonderfully to hit and run matches, but it can also be an excellent interval between one session and another of more demanding titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or one Xenoblade Chronicles 2.", "date": "2018-02-22", "grade": "8.5"}
