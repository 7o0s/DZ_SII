{"name": "Overpass", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overpass-recensione.html", "text": "Going fast is fun, in fact driving games almost always focus on this aspect. For some, however, it is much more interesting to go slowly, to replace speed with efficiency, cunning, the absolute dosage of brake and accelerator to tackle meters that seem like kilometres. And that's a bit like what happens in the thousand shades of off-road, a discipline chosen by the Swedish Zordix for this latest effort. If you want to find out how it went, you just have to read our Overpass review. Off-road racing As the old Motorstorms, the wise Mudrunners, that crazy Trials or the recent and more serious Dirt 2.0 taught us, driving away from the usual asphalt is fun, as well as requiring a completely different attitude behind the wheel from the usual racing games. Similarly to the other games, also in Overpass you sink into the mud, but the more compliant clay is only one of the countless challenges that a driver has to face in this game, and without a doubt the least insidious. The circuits are in fact littered with challenges such as extremely steep climbs, narrow rocky paths, tilting platforms, bumpy roads and so on, and knowing how to overcome them in the shortest possible time, but above all without tipping over, will be essential to snatch a good time and consequently a position satisfying. The races, aboard Quad or ATV, take place all alone and without the risk of colliding with the other riders, but they last several laps so each obstacle will have to be overcome several times; it is also possible to throw in the towel, circumnavigate a particularly difficult passage, but in doing so you will be penalized on the final time. In addition to the single races, Overpass offers a well-organized career mode, which requires you to spend the earnings on repairs and allows a little tuning of the vehicles in our garage, which never hurts. Technique and physics Everything would suggest a sufficiently interesting game, perhaps not rich in details and methods but still different from the usual, but Overpass also suffers from various technical problems that make it much less fun than it might seem at first glance. On PlayStation 4 Pro, where it was tested, the fluidity often affects the gameplay, the actual playability, and the poor response to the commands only makes it worse. In some situations, it can take two seconds for a vehicle to regain gas after a descent in reverse, and changing the different types of transmission as the game suggests does not improve things much. But Overpass is neither responsive nor accurate, and accuracy is everything in a game where even a small stone can knock you over. The physics on which it is built clearly has ambitions of realism, the way in which it is applied, however, leaves one doubtful and frustrated due to the many undeserved accidents, as well as the countless and inexplicable throwings of the pilot when driving a quad. Unlike ATVs, quads can help with weight shifting back and forth, but the grip of the wheels on surfaces doesn't always seem to behave the same way. With these problems, it becomes very difficult to have fun because you never really feel like you have full command of the controls, and when you make a mistake, you always do it with the doubt that it's not really all our fault. The biggest problem is when the opposite happens, that is when you overcome a difficult obstacle thanks to the inaccuracies of the game, and you are not even free to feel like an ace behind the wheel. Problems, problems Then there is a serious problem with the camera that has a disastrous effect on the quality of the experience: in Overpass it is often necessary to check where the wheels are resting, if only to understand how to continue on the course, if not to position yourself better in the riskiest passages . Except that it is not possible to look around without pressing the right analogue, a function that takes too long to activate and then deactivates itself almost instantly, returning to the classic position behind the pilot's shoulders. Thus, one is repeatedly forced to proceed blindly, in perfect antithesis with the spirit of the game, increasingly at the mercy of events. What's more, the glance isn't even bad: at first glance Overpass isn't bad to see, and even dwelling on the details, what is shown isn't unpleasant at all, just a little poor. The tracks offer more than forty variations on six different settings, it's true that there aren't a few, but they aren't dynamic either, they don't change as we pass and every rock will remain there lap after lap. There aren't many vehicles that you can get your hands on, but this is because the desire to rely on licensed vehicles (Yamaha, Suzuki, Arctic Cat, Polaris) realistically limits the variety.", "date": "2020-02-27", "grade": "4.5"}
