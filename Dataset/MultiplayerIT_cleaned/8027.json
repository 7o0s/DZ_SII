Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. We've talked many times about how difficult it is now to create something really fresh and original in the video game market, but also about how mobile platforms are an important resource for experimenting with new structures , new mechanics and, why not, new ways to monetize the experience. There are various ways to interpret these possibilities, and the French Playsoft team has seen fit to dedicate itself to the creation of a two-dimensional fighting game, albeit powered by the powerful Unreal Engine, by adopting the freemium model. What does this solution mean in the specific case of Blade Lords? The game has a roster made up of four characters, which in itself does not represent an extraordinary number these days, however those who want to try their hand at this beat'em-up without putting a hand in their wallet will basically have to settle for just the starting warrior, Sakuraba, a skilled swordsman who wields a long, sharp katana. The other three characters can be purchased in exchange for 250 gold coins, which is the ~real~ currency of the game, and scraping together this sum without making an in-app purchase, although possible on paper, takes quite a bit of time. Not bad, because the strengths of this title are others and take shape after a few games, when we have become familiar with the touch control system and won a few duels. We are noooo, we are noooo... Set in feudal Japan, Blade Lords puts us in the role of a warlord determined to thwart a threat that could destroy the world, and to do so, he embarks on a journey in which he will face various opponents to discover the truth about his true enemies. After a nice anime-style introduction and a fairly long loading (like most freemiums, Playsoft's product also checks for updates from time to time), the interface allows us to access four different options. The first screen is dedicated to unlocking characters, an operation we talked about a moment ago, while the second screen is related to the store, where we can spend bronze and gold coins (respectively the ~poor~ and ~rich~ currency ~) to purchase weapons, armor, and items that not only give the warrior substantially better abilities, but also affect his outward appearance. The swords each have a particular degree of sharpness, indicated in the upper part of the screen, which once it reaches zero requires a certain period of time (generally thirty minutes) to be restored, or the use of some gold coins to an instant fix. While the fourth screen, that of the online duel, is not currently available (it will be implemented shortly via an update), it is the third option that interests us the most, as it highlights the quests available on the map. We can select one of the missions and therefore try our hand at a fight to the best of three rounds, then move on to the next obviously expecting a higher degree of challenge but, at the same time, more generous rewards in case of success. The interesting thing is that the single player campaign does not take place entirely in this way, but there are many variations on the theme: the appearance of the ~Tower of Infinity~, which hides new threats to be faced on each floor, or the ~Portal of Chaos~, which is also a harbinger of demanding challenges. In short, the developers have found various ways to offer us the fights, to the benefit of long-term involvement. As regards the controls and the technical aspect, Blade Lords adopts a virtual d-pad that lends itself well to cardinal movements but certainly not to crescents, and in fact to perform the special moves you simply need to press the appropriate button in various ways, pointing in one direction rather than another to obtain different effects, and the same goes for combos. It is a pity that sometimes the inputs are not well received in the most excited moments, but in general the work done by Playsoft is noteworthy, with good polygonal models, decent animations and a pleasant musical accompaniment.", "date": "2013-02-02", "grade": "7.8"}
