{"name": "Curse of the Dead Gods", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/curse-of-the-dead-gods-recensione.html", "text": "Until a few years ago, roguelikes represented a fresh and original market niche, to the point of attracting millions of players and thus saturating the genre in a flash. For some time now, in fact, it is not uncommon to see more or less successful clones of the most important titles appear, with some sparks ready to refresh this type of product. Let's talk for example of the more recent Hades that we all praised just a few months ago, Monster Train, which in its DNA assimilated by Slay the Spire, blossomed with new ideas putting us on the side of the bad guys and the recent Dead Cells DLC, ready to elevate further Motion Twin's masterpiece. With so much variety, being able to create something truly original has become extremely difficult but Passtech Games did not want to give up, retouching the early access of Curse of the Dead Gods to offer today a title determined to have its say in this scope. In our previous test, the game had already demonstrated all its peculiarities, but we were waiting for the launch to be able to admire it in its due completeness. Today, after more than a year of Early Access we have finally reached the long-awaited final verdict in the Curse of the Dead Gods review! A dark adventure with fresh gameplay Curses will hit less careful players hard Playing as an unnamed explorer, a cursed Aztec temple will welcome us. The air you breathe is that of an Indiana Jones ready to deal with Darkest Dungeon and the atmosphere is imbued with that adventurous scent that can't help but kidnap the user. Curse of the Dead Gods is a title with gloomy tones, as if darkness were to accompany us at our every single step, determined to swallow us while deformed creatures await our misstep to attack us. A brutal beginning what awaits you, without too many preambles or explanations, a tough impact with a title determined to immediately make it clear how much walking in a temple erected to celebrate ancient gods will not be the carefree outing you imagined. The mechanics of lighting enter by force in this climate, which more than other games of this type plays an incredibly important role. In addition to guaranteeing you the possibility of seeing enemies well in advance and being able to illuminate otherwise deadly traps, fighting in the light brings considerable advantages and instead negates damage bonuses for your fearsome opponents. Before putting your hand to your weapons, therefore, you will have to observe carefully where you are, since drawing a sword means automatically putting away the torch, with a truly sublime see-saw play of light and shadow. A fast and intuitive combat system is what awaits you It is interesting to be able to set fire to the cobwebs on the floor, to light embers strategically placed inside the rooms but also the brilliant idea of being able to directly set fire to the enemies so that they are the source of illumination that you so desired. In short, there are several ways to interact with this mechanic, solutions that we have found fun and successful, albeit unfortunately with little impact in the long run. In fact, if it is true that this gimmick is well thought out and during your first steps you will always try to find a way to stay in the light, as the hours of play go by your experience will make up for the lack of visibility, as you will be able to dodge the incoming shots or to execute perfect parries. The combat system is immediate and appreciable and although the title tries to stand as a difficult game, you will find that the combat mechanics are much more forgiving than direct contenders, with very large and rolled parade windows that are easy to ring consecutively, even simplified compared to the Early Access period. Although not free, the ability to roll from side to side is limited by stamina points under your character, to be recharged over time or by performing perfect dodges, a simple exercise for those with suitable dexterity. A step of additional complexity is introduced in case you decide to use ranged weapons or heavy weapons, given their ability to interrupt enemy attacks, since they also use the same stamina bar, but nothing too complicated to handle for the veteran of the genre. Lots of weapons, few enemies to use them on Crossroads clearly inspired by Slay the Spire The selection of weapons is initially made at the entrance of each new dungeon and then, by deciding which path to follow in a branching scheme identical to that seen in Slay the Spyre, you will be able to come across new weaponsi, upgrades for them, relics or other treasures of value, so as to make you more lethal and maintain an adequate level of challenge. The variety of weapons is more than good and includes a broad spectrum of everything you'd expect from a fantasy title like this, starting from the most common swords and maces up to muskets, claws and spears that are extremely in line with the Aztec theme. If the weapons satisfy, the enemies on the other hand, both in terms of variety and design, leave something to be desired, disappointing our imagination and revealing touches of class only during boss fights. In this regard, it is fair to point out how the guardians of the various floors of the pyramid exploit repeated attack patterns, almost never changing pace or strategy and soon becoming easy to read and to break down. While the difficulty curve drops suddenly with the growth of the player's experience, the curse mechanic intervenes to keep the interest alive, this one really original and well thought out. Basically, each door you cross will increase a dedicated bar, the completion of which will correspond to a permanent curse for the whole run: get to get five curses in one go and your life will start to drop every second, requiring a truly superhuman effort to carry finish the adventure. Curse of the Dead Gods therefore contains a meta game, forcing the player to make wise choices at the altars of rewards so as not to accumulate excessive hexes, to sacrifice pieces of equipment to try to appease the wrath of the gods and also to be careful of some attacks that, instead of damaging your health, will clearly aim to accelerate the filling of this cursed stat. Within this ecosystem full of things to remember and decisions to make, the player always has the impression of being in control and every choice is made carefully outlining a clear strategy. A system that works extremely well and that leaves at each game over that insatiable desire to try another run and then another, until you get to defeat all 10 bosses of the pyramid, with sessions ranging from 15 to 50 minutes or more of play. In the progression, obviously, a pinch of repetitiveness will enter by force, inevitable for games of this genre, but perhaps a hair too marked this time, with a procedural construction of the levels not sufficiently varied to avoid unpleasant frequent dj-vu effects: the most the bulk of a production to be kept in close consideration anyway.", "date": "2021-02-23", "grade": "7.5"}
