{"name": "Gordian Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gordian-quest-recensione.html", "text": "After two years of development in the Early Access version, it's almost time to get your hands on the definitive version of Gordian Quest, the deckbuilding RPG with rogue-like elements from Mixed Realms and Swag Soft Holdings. The date to mark on the calendar is June 23, 2022 and will allow us to get our hands on a new hero, the fourth and final act of the main campaign and additional ways to continue the adventure. Before we get to all of this though, it's best to go back to the basics of the game and try to figure out exactly what we're talking about. So here is our review of Gordian Quest. D&D The protagonist heroes of Gordian Quest Gordian Quest offers various modes, but the main and most massive is the Campaign. Divided into four acts, for at least five hours each, the campaign mode puts us in the shoes of a group of heroes who have to face an invasion of the undead, clearly summoned by necromancers. Through a map of the game world, we will have to move from one point to another in the region, completing battles and narrative events with occasional D&D-style ~skill checks~, during which a roll of a dice will be required which will add up to the statistic of the moment. Don't expect D&D depth though as it all boils down to three stats related to hero archetypes (strength, dexterity, magic). Yes, you will be able to enhance each character in various ways, in any case, both by leveling up and through equipment. Then there is an extensive system of skill trees, which allow you to obtain new cards, enhance the ones we own and increase the character's attack and defense values. There are also various RPG elements within Gordian Quest, but on the lower difficulty levels not all of them are really important in order to continue successfully. Sword and magic Gordian Quest fights The heart of the game are the clashes, which are performed in turns with a deck of cards, which determine the abilities of each hero. The structure is classic and well known to fans of the deckbuilding genre: each deck includes attack, defense and other cards capable of applying boosts or weakening enemies. Each hero has a number of moves that can be performed each turn and, in addition to inflicting damage, must increase their armor to parry the blows of the opponents. It will not surprise anyone to know that the enemies signal the incoming attack, so as to allow us to organize ourselves. Unlike more straightforward games like Slay the Spire, battles take place in an arena divided into rows and columns: position and attack range are important and we'll often have to move our heroes to get the better of the monsters. Secondary statuses are also the masters, such as poison, weakening and various elemental effects: what matters is that fighting is always fun, thanks to the variables to pay attention to. The game mechanics are not too complex to understand and, above all, there are multiple levels of difficulty that allow you to aim for a relaxed game or a seriously challenging one depending on your taste. Roguelite or not Gordian Quest's skill system The personalization of the experience is also linked to the way we want to approach the game. The campaign can also be tackled in roguelike mode, in which death is final and defeated heroes cannot be resurrected. More importantly, though, is the additional Realm mode, which makes Gordian Quest a true roguelike. Instead of having a narrative campaign and a map to explore freely, the game takes up the structure of Slay the Spire and, having chosen three heroes, asks us to complete a series of challenges, with moving towards a boss at the end of the level, passing through battles, areas safe places to heal, merchants to buy items and so on. The hub of the first region of Gordian Quest It is an alternative way to play Gordian Quest, in case you are only interested in the heart of the gameplay and do not feel like (re)playing the narrative campaign. Also consider that every single hero has four different decks, which change his way of fighting: there is no shortage of content and you can go on for dozens of hours. Finally, a 1vs1 PvP mode is also available in which you can compose a deck for each hero and face other players online.", "date": "2022-06-17", "grade": "8.0"}
