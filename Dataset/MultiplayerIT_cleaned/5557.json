It is now useless to continue to dwell on the salty price of the package: we are interested in evaluating whether the 15 euros spent, or less if you have bought the Season Pass, correspond to quality content. The composition of the new Treyarch offer is the one we all know, four multiplayer maps and the new zombie setting with the unpronounceable name Zetsubou no Shima. Let's see everything in detail. Eclipse is a nice DLC pack for Black Ops III - here's our review Total remake Also in Eclipse is a remake map of one from the past. If Skyjacked of Awakening was the remake of the not too old Hijacked of Call of Duty: Black Ops II, with Verge we find ourselves retracing a classic like Banzai of Call of Duty: World at War, branded 2008. It therefore definitely makes more sense as a remake . Those who have a good memory of the old map will find themselves pleasantly surprised, given the numerous changes made, starting with a part where we can go underwater to move more calmly than in the open areas. It is undoubtedly one of the best maps in the package, especially from an artistic point of view, as it ~enacts~ the struggle of two tribes for survival. A post apocalyptic setting, very colorful and really successful. KnockOut, like Verge, is artistically of great value. Not great in terms of level design, but not trivial either, it all revolves around what looks like a Shaolin monastery nestled in cascades of cherry blossoms. A decidedly complex map, perfect for all types of game, thanks to a skilful alternation between narrow spaces, long lateral lines and ~small~ squares complete with a golden dragon, for appreciable shooting lines. There are many opportunities to put the movement system to the test, but be careful not to fall into the abyss. Technically speaking KnockOut is decidedly exuberant: very colorful and full of detail and with a couple of not bad easter eggs with a musical and martial theme. Rift, at first glance, might give the impression, even from a purely aesthetic point of view, of being the least impressive map in the package; instead, behind not exactly generous dimensions, and an all too symmetrical layout, a respectable battlefield is hidden. All the action takes place on the two side lanes and a small indoor part that connects them. There is no shortage of very long shooting lines, a couple of spots for wild ~camping~ and situations in which to put movement skills to the test. A really fun map, not very complex and not at all ~colorful~ and ~exuberant~ when compared to KnockOut and Splash from the previous DLC, but really fun to play. A chat with Jason Blundell We had the chance to interview Jason Blundell by phone, the man behind the Nightmare alternative campaign and the actual zombie maps. Jason was very happy with the good response Nightmare had had, an additional effort for the team that was able to benefit from the three-year development cycle of the series for the first time. He doesn't know if it could become a standard feature for the franchise; each team at work has its own needs and ideas in this regard. Speaking of the zombie maps, loved not only by fans of the game, Jason told us that Treyarch listens very carefully to community feedback, with staff dedicated to this to understand what goes and what doesn't go, to then make the necessary changes . We asked him if there is the possibility in the future to revisit iconic maps from the past, but given the narrative nature of the mode it is impossible. In fact, it wouldn't make sense. We also asked him if it was possible that they would be released with a single DLC - at the end of the Season Pass, of course - only the zombie maps. It's not their decision, he replied; their job is to always do the best with the game, devote themselves body and soul to development. Mouths closed even when we asked him for some anticipation on the new DLC: ~if I revealed something to you I would have to kill you~, he replied. The Island of the Famous Say Spire and think of Bespin's Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back. We are on board a sort of spaceport in suborbital flight, white dominates the articulated level design of this map, probably the best of this Eclipse: structured on several levels and full of surfaces on which to move and run, generous both in terms of open and airy spaces, as well as deadly bottlenecks and various roofs. A perfect battlefield for ad game modesgoal, which enhances the athletic side of the players, always on the move thanks to a truly classy layout, made especially to gratify the ~pros~ of Call of Duty: Black Ops III. And then there's Zetsubou no Shima. Our heroes Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, Takeo Masaki and Edward Richtofen survived the events of Der Eisendrache and now, after being shipwrecked in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, they find themselves lost on a real cursed island, home to a secret research laboratory of Element 115. Still WWII, no Nazis but bloody Japanese zombies. The map seems to have a slightly smaller size than the titanic Der Eisendrache, but it is equally fun and full of secrets and areas to explore inch by inch. There are not only ravenous undead, but also a whole series of new dangers, such as spiders, huge creatures with an easy bite and lots of vegetation ready to kill us in the most classic style of carnivorous exotic plants. A new episode ~only good~, we could say: you will replay it with great pleasure, of course, but it will hardly be among your favourites.", "date": "2016-04-22", "grade": null}
