{"name": "Skyforge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/156016-skyforge-un-dio-gracile.html", "text": "A few weeks ago we concluded our trial of Skyforge cautiously optimistic. The new massive multiplayer online game from the Allods Team, the same developer of the famous (and somewhat infamous) Allods Online, had turned out to be a decidedly curious product that tried to distance itself from the clichs of the genre to have its say in a landscape that becomes more barren every year. The combat system, spectacular and action oriented, had convinced us, and the freedom granted to the player in the construction of his ~immortal~ avatar had amazed us, even if we had only scratched the surface. At the time we hadn't tried PvP yet, nor unlocked the Order or reached the level of prestige necessary to tackle the endgame content... also because we had immediately crashed into a wall, the weekly limit that prevents players from accumulating the many currencies over a certain amount. Now that we've delved a little more into what Skyforge has to offer, we can form a slightly more concrete opinion. Let's be clear that this is an MMO, a game that can change overnight with a few updates, and that our assessment is based on the current state of the game. In short, changes are welcome. Skyforge could become more than just the bizarre hybrid we've played so far Order and chaos As we anticipated during the hands-on, the value called ~Prestige~ totally dominates the progress of Skyforge players, unlocking new features and activities as it increases. The algorithm that regulates it is unclear, but the individual progress concerning the equipment, the Ascension Atlas and the Order substantially influence it. The latter is unlocked soon enough, and represents the real ~cult~ formed around our avatar: we remind you, in fact, that in the Skyforge universe we are immortal demigods, and the very subtle plot of the game revolves all around our ascension and the ambitions of the other demigods. After playing the expansion of Final Fantasy XIV, or even the controversial alternative timeline of Warlords of Draenor, the story of Skyforge has left us rather indifferent, it must be admitted, but the basic idea is really interesting, as are its developments in terms of gameplay. The Order, moreover, is reminiscent of the garrison implemented by Blizzard in its latest World of Warcraft expansion, for better or for worse, and it is probably no coincidence: maximum yield, minimum expense, since both tend to soon become little more than a browser game in three dimensions. The Order allows us to recruit new adepts and followers who increase its power, and to establish temples and places of worship in various regions of the world: in reality, we will never physically see any of them, and their existence simply serves to to give bonuses, to collect new currencies and to increase our Prestige. At a certain point, the micromanagement of the Order becomes one of the most important moments every time we connect to the game servers: we have to decide which followers to send on a mission, which ones to upgrade, which ones to fire and which changes to make to the built structures. The problem is that, sooner or later, it also becomes one of the few reasons to connect daily, especially once the weekly limit of currencies has been reached. The border imposed by Allods Team has caused much discussion, but in some ways it is understandable: on paper, it serves to prevent players with more free time from progressing too much, creating a gap in terms of Prestige, economy and performance that is difficult to deal with . It's a limit that only half works, as it is reached quite easily, once you learn how to play, at which point you find yourself logging into Skyforge only to micromanage the Order or ~farm~ missions for the other necessary currencies, for example to upgrade weapons. In the long run, it is a situation that creates many imbalances. In the guilds, here called Pantheon, players tend to connect for a few hours after each weekly reset, and then disappear until the next: this creates a gap towards the game, and affects the performance of the Pantheon itself, given that many features of Skyforge , especially in the endgame, they rely on the community and risk not even being touched. In this sense, even the exorbitant number of currencies to be accumulated through the completion of missions or the internal economy does not help to keep the interest high: they are simply too many, they generate a lot of confusion especially to newbies and transform the experience into a repetitive and exasperated grind. Wandering the Atlas The important thing, however, is not comput the fallacy of considering Skyforge a traditional MMORPG along the lines of World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV or Star Wars: The Old Republic. In this sense, the Allods Team title looks more like a kind of Diablo III sui generis, in which missions and dungeons are repeated in search of some rare loot, in order to accumulate the currencies you need and, above all , the Sparks that are key to unlocking nodes in the Atlas. Also in this case, the first hours of the game can be disorienting: there is too much information displayed at the same time, there are numerous currencies to manage and the cumbersome and not very intuitive interface certainly does not help. Once you become familiar with the Atlas, however, everything becomes a little clearer and more natural. After all, this is the heart of the game: while in many MMORPGs you progress by finding new objects and leveling up, in Skyforge growth revolves around the Atlas and the discovery of its nodes. By spending the various categories of Spark, new bonuses and skills are acquired and paths are followed that can lead to the acquisition of new classes. In fact, the player initially can only choose between Cryomancer, Paladin and Lightbinder (assuming that he has not purchased the founder's pack with the additional ones) and can change it at any time, as long as he is not fighting: at which point he changes the equipped weapon and the skill loadup, but the character always remains the same, with all the passive bonuses already unlocked on the Atlas, including those in the field of other specializations. It's an interesting mechanic that recalls the Job System of Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, and therefore allows for enormous versatility on the battlefield, especially if you find yourself needing a support class instead of one focused purely on 'attack. The various classes differ significantly in terms of skills, spells, roles and fighting styles, but unlocking them all is a titanic undertaking which, both for the way the Atlas is structured and for the weekly limit of accumulated Sparks, will take months and months of time. That's why it's better to focus first on unlocking just one, the one that interests us more than the others, and that's why it's the game itself that offers a kind of tutorial that allows you to try them all in advance and even a simulator that allows you to track on the Atlas the shortest path to the class of our interest. Too bad, therefore, that in terms of PvP and balancing there is still a lot to do, especially if we consider the obvious advantage available to players willing to swipe their credit card to buy bonuses on the Allods Team store and increase their Prestige at a much faster rate than free to play players. In short, the ~pay to win~ drift makes itself felt quickly, and it is not surprising that there are various Prestige bands in which it is practically impossible to find other players for dungeons or group activities. Furthermore, the latter made us turn up our noses. Skyforge employs a role-playing trinity of its own, in which there are no real healers but support classes, and in which it is above all important to do damage in the shortest possible time: the enemies, especially the bosses, have an infinite number of life points and at a certain point becomes a race to kill them before they are killed. From a gameplay point of view, action fans will feel right at home: even normal enemies can be a big problem, and the bosses have peculiar mechanics that require you not only to move easily around the battlefield, but also to use the head. In short, as we said, Skyforge is not an MMORPG, but more of an MMO action RPG: a formula that, in our opinion, should be decidedly investigated.", "date": "2015-10-05", "grade": "6.8"}
