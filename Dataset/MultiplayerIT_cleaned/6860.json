On the one hand one of the best declinations of the cooperative concepts of Left 4 Dead starring a handful of robbery dogs, of those whose deeds we have seen celebrate (and condemn) in films such as Reservoir Dogs, Killing Zoe, Pointbreak, Heat - The Challenge or in the magnificent incipit of The Dark Knight. Films to which Overkill's multiplayer shooter openly refers, just as his love for cinema and television in general is open, if we consider the extensive use of live action films or the Web series signed by Demian Lichtenstein, which is currently working on a transposition of the game for the big screen, coming next year. On the other hand, the crazy splinter of Dennaton Games, an apparently awkward and simplistic indie that turned out to be an all-round masterpiece of style, playability and storytelling. A cynical, morbid and ultra-violent work, which with a handful of pixels taken from above knew how to slam face to face with the sordidest sordid thing of the criminal ecosystem and human nature, between a declaration of love for Miami Vice, a strong spiritual affinity with Drive by Refn and a tribute to OutRun, without missing even moments of great introspection. Two experiences with extremely different approaches and tones, very distant yet in a certain sense very close, united by something, deep down there, beyond the criminal topic. A bit like Freddy and Jason, Alien and Predator, Terminator and Robocop: emblematic figures who belong to very different worlds, sometimes with seemingly irreconcilable assumptions, but who give the impression of coexisting, somehow, in the same dimension. A crossover between PayDay and Hotline Miami therefore appeared to be desirable, natural, almost due, and with enormous starting potential. Now it's really happened. Let's see how it went... Reviewed the PayDay 2 DLC dedicated to Hotline Miami. Successful partnership? Those cursed 200 seconds... At the usual steep price established by Starbreeze for this type of content, Hotline Miami offers access on Crime.net to a new work of the same name. The client is the already well-known Dentist, a character introduced in the previous DLC, Big Bank Heist, played by that Giancarlo Esposito who in Breaking Bad had given the face to Gustavo Fring, one of the most charismatic villains in the history of TV, crowning another crossover, that between PayDay 2 and the AMC series, to which the game was already winking with some obvious ~culinary~ themed homages in a shot of the basic campaign (returning to it here too). The goal is to remove the Russian drug trafficker known as the Commissioner from circulation, following his tracks first in a motel, then in a dilapidated building in Washington. Unlike other assignments to which the stainless poker of anti-heroes formed by Wolf, Dallas, Hoxton and Chains is used to, the job immediately excludes the secluded approach, given that ours go into action already masked with the henchmen of the antagonist who await them with open arms and guns in hand. The cut of both scenarios is very adventurous and ~on your face~ but not monotonous, given that by pausing to explore and proving willing to take on some additional risk, it is possible to win some great extra loot, not to mention some easter eggs to which the achievements are linked, which require you to perform particular actions, sometimes wearing special equipment. Hotline Miami is certainly not among the most structured and imaginative missions of PayDay 2, but it is still intriguing, challenging and replayable to the point of not making you regret the money spent. A bitter taste remains in the mouth for the partially wasted opportunity: if exploited in a more bold and courageous way, the encounter between the two universes could lead to something truly memorable and instead we are content to remain within familiar territories after all . No stylistic changes, no scenographic exploits, no paw with a dreamlike or ~metareferential~ flavor, no real madness: Overkill has not seized the opportunity to draw from the partner's very rich visual and thematic cauldron, except with a soundtrack that represents a good bridge between the sonorities of Simon Viklund and the more jaunty and blatantly 80s drifts of the OST of Hotline Miami mainly bearing the signature of Jasper Byrne, Scattle and Perturbator. It recovers a little on the frontof weapons, with particular attention to melee ones, through which to cause real physical harm to a legion of Russians who grew up with Don Johnson's posters in their bedrooms, between cleaver blows, baseball bats, machetes and briefcases, exactly as was done in the Dennaton Games title, even if the blood here has less effect, although paradoxically it is more realistic. And then, clearly, a great point in common between the two intellectual properties such as the masks. Eight additional ones, inspired by the animal-characters whose identities and powers could be assumed in the most violent and disturbed Miami ever (Don Juan, Aubrey, Tony, Brandon Dennis, Graham, Rasmus and Richard). But be careful: half of them are only available if you already own Hotline Miami on Steam, in accordance with a type of cross-marketing operation that we have already seen on the Valve store in the past. After all, this is also a crossover.", "date": "2014-10-07", "grade": null}
