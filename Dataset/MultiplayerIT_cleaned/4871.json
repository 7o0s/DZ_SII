{"name": "Portal Knights", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183310-portal-knights-divertimento-al-cubo.html", "text": "Minecraft (also recently landed on Nintendo Switch), Dragon Quest Builders and Cube World, just to mention the latest exponents of the genre, are the simplest demonstration of how the inventiveness of the players is still a very effective tool. When the Mojang title was launched on the market, many said they were perplexed by the game's actual ability to entertain, sure that in a landscape like today's, where being accompanied step by step is now the routine, suddenly finding oneself at having entire worlds available to create anything could even be counterproductive. Instead, it was interesting to find out how from a niche product Minecraft then became a real cult phenomenon, leaving room for clones and titles with similar ideas. Portal Knights, published by 505 Games and developed by Keen Games is only the last of these but in its own way it tries to carve out its own personality, yes, taking advantage of the classic cubes to give life to a geometrically perfect world but also filling it with creatures with a design well-finished and stylistically more refined objects. In short, a product of the same genre but not a simple clone, ready to receive our final verdict after spending the last 12 months in the Early access phase on Steam. If you are a fan of the Portal Knights genre, it is a title that you should not miss given the price Cube after cube after cube Portal Knights is the perfect link between Minecraft and Dragon Quest Builders, trying to offer almost total freedom to the player but also channeling it through the classic styles of role-playing games. During the creation of your character, with a good amount of variables for the aesthetics, you can choose whether to make it a warrior, an archer or a wizard, laying the foundations for a one-way development. You will therefore have a very specific role in the universe of portals, you can be a tank or a damage dealer and when you meet other players in online games you will already know who you are next to simply by observing their equipment. It's a significant starting point, as we told you, but it's also the only real limitation with which you'll be tied down. From a title like Portal Knights, which presents a linear structure of growth and discovery, we would have expected a more important story while to lead the players through the available worlds there will be only a weak background narration, leaving precisely that they are the players themselves to create their own story. From this point of view, the evaluation for such a choice falls on mere personal taste: we would have preferred to be guided more by a narrative beyond Dragon Quest Builders, for example, rather than finding ourselves dealing with the simple, repetitive and obvious quests secondary that flesh out Portal Knights. They certainly lengthen the broth, but with the umpteenth request to find a particular object or kill a certain amount of monsters we began to ignore them beautifully, only to return to them later in order to obtain prizes and trophies for customizing the homes. The quests are also a good source of experience points, even if the only ~farm~ of enemies guarantees you a rapid growth of the character. As a good self-respecting role-playing game, Portal Knights offers you thirty levels of experience, passive talents for your hero and even stat points to position as you please. It's just a rough outline of a structure that could have done more in depth, but it still gets the job done, allowing you to even think about some particular builds for your class. Nothing overwhelming, mind you, but reason enough to want to reach the maximum level as soon as possible to unlock your potential. With the growth you will also get access to new sets of armor and equipment for a rather low difficulty curve and in any case malleable according to your needs. A simple game to face and never unnerving, thanks to a basic but effective combat based on attacks and dodges, perfect for the young audience to which the title is aimed. Open world, where are you? You will start your adventure on a small island but you will have the possibility later, by collecting crystals from enemies, to open connection portals, unlock new worlds and face some fearsome end-of-area bosses. All of this is obviously just the antechamber to give the player entire square kilometers of explorable areas, bricks to destroy and tools to unleash their imagination. As a good self-respecting sandbox, you can destroy every single cube on the map and then reposition it wherever you see fit to build it.ire buildings, fortifications, dungeons or flying fortresses: your imagination will be your only limit. The quantity of materials made available to you is more than satisfactory and to enrich the offer there are also prefabricated ornamental objects that further embellish the aesthetic aspect of the game. Statues and furniture are just the basics but there are also touches of class such as braziers and torches to place, which illuminate the dark of the night thanks to a particularly convincing dynamic lighting system. Portal Knights from a technical point of view is in fact a really nice product, extremely light and able to give a fascinating glance. On consoles we note some slight frame-rate drops and a pronounced blur on distant objects but nothing that could represent a real problem overall. The day and night cycle, with some enemies that appear only at dusk, and a particularly successful fluid dynamics are just other little gems that improve the overall experience, simple as we said but also quite satisfying. As far as longevity is concerned, however, the duration is very variable, based on what you want from the title. If your aim is to jump from one island to another as fast as possible by building the portals, in fifteen hours you may have already seen everything but in case you want to stop and create your own world, the hours to spend on it will automatically become infinite. You can then also invite three other friends to your island and four of you work on a common project or even go hunting for rare materials together, another note of merit for a production which, at a cost of 15 euros, offers a rather valid experience.", "date": "2017-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
