{"name": "Master of Magic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/master-of-magic-recensione.html", "text": "The first word that comes to mind when playing the Muha Games title is ~respectful~. After all, the small Polish team (made up of six people) had already shown that they loved the SimText classic with the two Theas, so it's easy to guess that when he found himself working on the original, he had few doubts about how to approach it, limiting himself to make some adjustments here and there and to review the interface and the technical part to adapt everything to the current times. The result is certainly successful, as we will see in the Master of Magic remake review, and will appeal to those who can't wait to play an updated version of one of the games that most of all contributed to determining the canons of 4X strategic games. Remake The fourteen wizards bring some variety to Master of Magic Master of Magic is a single player 4X strategy game with RPG elements, in which you have to try to become the most powerful wizard in the world. Let's clarify immediately that the remake is based on the original and not on the Caster of Magic mod, which over the years has carved out a privileged role among enthusiasts, for how it has evolved game systems by solving various problems (to get a complete picture of the history of Master of Magic and its various branches, we invite you to read our dedicated special). The idea followed by Muha Games is to start from the base by making adjustments and modifications where necessary. So we are faced with a rigorous remake, which attempts a complete restart of the franchise. Once the game is started, we are given the possibility of starting a new game or launching the editor to further customize the experience, managing the map and events. Having chosen the first option, the various parameters must be set. Then we have to decide the level of difficulty, the points that can be spent on the selected wizard, the starting gold, the ability of the artificial intelligence, the size of the game world and more. In general we can guarantee you that at the normal difficulty level, i.e. the medium one, Master of Magic is not exactly a walk in health. Indeed, it is really difficult. So for beginners it is better to start from the easiest level, also because the game mechanics are not very few and must be studied well if you want to get results. In any case, once the game has been set, all that remains is to select the wizard to use among the fourteen available, specialized in schools of magic, then one of the species to guide among the fourteen in total (nine for the outside world, Arcanian, and five for the underground one , Myrran). A world to discover Magic is key to winning in Master of Magic Those who have already played a 4X will immediately find themselves at home with Master of Magic, which is the remake of one of the founders of the genre. The start of the game is quite slow: you have only one city and you have very weak troops at your disposal, which are good for exploring, but certainly not for wild conquests. The map is divided into hex-shaped spaces, with cities occupying a fixed number of territories, each with its own values for food production and productivity. On some boxes there may also be special resources, such as minerals or particularly rich pastures, which give some bonuses. Unlike a Civilization or 4X based on historical progression, there is no need to work every square to specialize a city, but simply distribute the citizenship between agricultural production and workforce and that's it. The improvement of the various aspects of the local economy is entrusted to the construction of buildings, which can increase agricultural yield, or allow the construction of other buildings or units, or even make more money, to be spent on the growth of our magical empire. Cities occupy a certain number of tiles In addition to the occupied territories, cities change in appearance and production of buildings and units according to the species to which they belong. Let's say that each species has its own peculiarities, with strengths and weaknesses. At the beginning you are quite constrained, but from the middle game onwards it is not uncommon to have cities belonging to different species, therefore having a large number of units available with which to compose armies. The first rounds are however dedicated to the complete exploration of the map, with the discovery of points of interest, which can be exploited to obtain resources; of magic knots, which are used to increase the magic reserves of our alter ego; of territories favorable to colonization, useful for increasing the number of cities under our control and of portals, which are used to move between the two layers that make up the game worldor (the aforementioned Arcanian and Myrran). When you've settled down a bit, i.e. you've explored a good portion of the map, you've come into contact with the other wizards and you have a clear direction in which to expand, you can start to get serious. War of magic For fights, it's better to play them directly if you don't want to lose troops for no reason In principle, Master of Magic is focused on war, without the possibility of finding diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Let's say that you can maintain good relations with some of the other factions, at least until you find yourself held back in the expansion or until you cast the final spell, which automatically triggers a global war. That's how the original worked, too, so it won't be particularly new to veterans. The important thing is not to expect a Crusader Kings III or similar. His diplomatic side is bare-bones and only allows you to stipulate some agreements with the other magicians or to obtain a temporary peace, without however giving great options in terms of dialogue and bargaining between the parties. In short, expect gameplay focused on accumulating troops and mastering the combat and spell system to expand as much as possible. After all, the latter are the fulcrum of the game, with the need to search for ever more powerful ones and to accumulate mana to launch them. Knowing how to use magic is essential not only to win battles, but also to control the map, managing the movement of troops and heroes, with the possibility of giving cities tactical advantages and speeding up certain production or exploration processes. Points of interest are used to accumulate resources Let's say that with more than two hundred spells to learn there is a lot to study to have clear how to make the most of them and how to combine them without wasting them. Some are cast immediately, others take more turns (depending on the amount of mana available), but in general they quickly become essential in the game economy and, to be honest, they are also the element that gives the most variety to the whole. Fights start when two armies meet. They can be managed in two ways: indirectly, by letting the CPU do the work for us, or directly, by manually moving the units on the battlefield using a turn-based system. The second mode, even if more expensive in terms of time, is to be preferred to the first, because often the CPU does not prove to be very brilliant, especially when the forces in the field are equal. The result is that relying completely on the automatic system can result in the loss of more troops than necessary. Once you go into battle, the game system changes radically. Every single unit appears deployed on the map. If necessary, in Master of Magic it is possible to convert money into mana and vice versa Players move their troops in turn, trying to make the most of their characteristics. Each turn it is also possible to cast spells: one for the wizard and one for each hero deployed. Of course you have to take into account the availability of mana of each. Be that as it may, the latter are really central to victory or defeat. Just to give an example: a single troop with strong magical protection from arrows can rout several units of archers in defiance of their numerical superiority. Or having sacred magic can make it much less difficult to face an army of undead. The possibilities offered by the game system are really many in this sense and fortunately the artificial intelligence proves to be able enough to exploit the magical resources at its disposal in a more than decent way, so as to represent a good challenge, which does not allow you to rely on recurring patterns to win every fight. In truth, the CPU has also proved to be very capable in troop movement, in particular from the normal level onwards (at an easy level it tends to waste many turns on useless movements). It is certainly more advanced than that of the original Master of Magic and looks good even in the face of some of its more famous competitors. Graphics and interface In Master of Magic, you can lead fourteen species From the point of view of graphics, the remake of Master of Magic is quite fluctuating. The work done by MuHa appears in line with the standards of the genre as long as it remains static, but when the troops start moving they show quite poor animations. In particular, some feedback is not exactly exceptional. Nothing dramatic for a strategic, mind you, but sometimes one gets the impression that the things that happen on the screen slip away without any weight. In shorta, the essentials are there, but some more refined effects for the spells and some more animation during the fights would not have hurt. Its interface is of a modern type and is quite comfortable and intuitive, especially if you have played other 4X games, even if it lacks some small functions that we would not have minded, such as the ability to trace the roads to be built, instead of having engineers work one box at a time. In some cases it is not exactly beautiful to see, such as in the dialogues between the magicians, which appear a bit spartan. More clarity on keyboard shortcuts wouldn't have hurt either. They are trifles in hindsight, but the hope is that they will be resolved with some future update.", "date": "2022-12-12", "grade": "8.0"}
