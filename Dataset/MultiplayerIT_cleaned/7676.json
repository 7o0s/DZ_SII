{"name": "I Puffi 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121975-i-puffi-2-che-gioco-puffoso.html", "text": "Writing this review has been truly painful. The reasons are mainly two: first, there are the Smurfs. Now, don't get us wrong, we love the Smurfs. All children of all ages love the Smurfs. What's not to love about Peyo's Blue Creatures? How do you forget the little song of Cristina d'Avena? You can't, not even when you grow up and life puts the child in us in a cage: he's there, closed, but he keeps singing that the Smurfs are like this, they're all blue. But the Smurfs are also the umpteenth victim of a cinematic trend that for some years has enjoyed raping the heroes of our childhood, transforming them into horrendous CGI films. And in this game there are the Smurfs, but they are those of the terrible sequel to a film that was already mediocre in itself, despite the presence of Neil Patrick Harris (well, even Barney Stinson has its limits). And that is the first reason. The second reason is that The Smurfs 2 is just plain bad. So, just to be synthetic. Everyone is crazy about Smurfette The game loosely follows the story of the film of the same name, which sees the Smurfs grappling with a new crisis: Smurfette, convinced that no one in the village wants her anymore for some idiotic reason, runs away and ends up in a trap set by Gargamel. The old sorcerer played by poor Hank Azaria has created two grayish and ~bad~ Smurfs, the Naughties, and intends to discover the formula for the essence of Smurf to make his own personal reserve of magic. The real Smurfs, who were preparing a surprise birthday party for Smurfette, poor fools, are therefore forced to intervene to save her, facing a series of levels full of flora and fauna corrupted by Gargamel's powers. From the Forest to Paris, the game basically tells the story in a rather sketchy and confusing way, to the point that a child would have a hard time understanding what's going on without first seeing the film (or reading the plot on Wikipedia). The game, on the other hand, is so simple and linear that one wonders if the developers of WayForward Technologies have ever looked around lately: in a world where for their tenth birthday kids want the new iPhone or the latest iteration of Call of Duty, we doubt anyone would be interested in a platformer where you can complete levels simply by tilting the d-pad to the right. Of course, you can jump - after all, it's a platformer - but although it may seem counterintuitive, in some levels it's not even necessary. The few enemies that sometimes block our way can be defeated by jumping on their heads or even outflanked through the powers of the Smurfs that we will be able to control: Papa Smurf paralyzes the enemies, Clumsy hits them with a slide, Brave breaks the boulders and so on. Skills that may or may not be there, however, so limited is their importance; on the other hand, some secret bonuses are accessible only after completing the level or after defeating a boss and unlocking the Smurf he kept imprisoned and which will allow us to reach that specific secret. In fact, The Smurfs 2 forces the most fussy to replay each level several times, desperately trying to increase its laughable longevity in a somewhat sinister way. Playstation 3 trophies The Smurfs 2 is a real shower of Trophies, which will be unlocked by performing the simplest actions, which are using the Smurfs' abilities a certain number of times, collecting coins, defeating a boss without getting hit and so on. At the end you will get 10 Bronze Trophies, 19 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum, for a total of 33 Trophies. Children, not cretins! And then, in The Smurfs 2 you don't even die: try to imagine the trauma those poor children would have experienced if, after seeing a new episode of Dragon Ball on television, they had seen a little blue Smurf die, killed by a toad or a polar bear. The only challenge is the end-of-the-world bosses, which require a little more brain activity than usual since they have to be fought in a particular way. The idea that you get after a few minutes is that nothing you do in The Smurfs 2 really makes sense. What is the point of collecting the coins scattered throughout the levels? After defeating a certain number of enemies, the Blue Smurf power-up activates which doubles the number of coins collected but... for what purpose? Also because if an enemy hits us we lose them all, like in Sonic... And then, what's the point of repopulating the Smurfs' village and visiting it, if there's no way to interact with any inhabitant? Designed for a truly, but really young children's entertainment, The Smurfs 2 doesn't even have the decency to be aesthetically pleasing.And. The developer has opted for a questionable middle ground between prerendering and polygons, with far from exceptional results. The overall look is colorful and pleasant, until you move around and realize the small number of animations and how slow they are. There are no frame-rate dips... the whole game seems to be in slow motion. The backdrops, so little animated as to seem static, appear detached from the foreground where the action takes place, but the worst comes when you come across the bosses: monsters bigger than normal which, proportionally, seem to come out of a game of two generations ago, and they even allow themselves to burp. Birba, in particular, is embarrassing. Everything is framed by absolutely repetitive tunes, punctuated by a handful of phrases repeated continuously by the Smurf on duty with irritating frequency, to which the legendary Smurf song alternates for the entire duration of the Blue Smurf bonus, only after hearing it for the fourth or fifth time in five minutes you even feel a little like puffing your veins. The Smurfs 2 is a tie-in for kids, too bad they'll notice his problems too", "date": "2013-08-13", "grade": "3.0"}
