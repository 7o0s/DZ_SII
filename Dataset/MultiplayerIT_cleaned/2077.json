{"name": "James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/james-bond-007-agent-under-fire_a.html", "text": "High risk missions The game, as previously announced, unfolds through a long series of various and original missions that will be offered to you as you continue on your way; the missions in all are around a dozen, rightly distributed between shootings, chases and stealth phases, they will make you travel from one corner of the globe to another, offering you various and very well done designs from a graphic point of view with some really classy touches excellent, a real feast for the eyes; unfortunately the only note to move is the excessive linearity of the same, speaking of the levels of pure FPS, in fact the game practically takes you by the hand for an almost pre-established path from which it will be difficult to deviate, otherwise you will be verbally reprimanded by your trusted collaborators and redirected with some hints on the right path. Another matter for the so-called ~on-rail~ sessions in which your digital alter ego follows a predefined path (for example, as in the second mission, on a vehicle driven by an ally) and where you ~only~ have to worry about eliminating the enemies who by all means will try to hinder you in a quick succession of armed clashes, shooting down of helicopters and overcoming checkpoints. Last but certainly not for fun or overall enjoyment, are the racing and car chase missions, really excellent, thanks to the help of the collaboration of some programmers under the ~Need For Speed~ series, they practically offer you a city street chase in the style of ~Wreckless~ for Xbox. Q's armory, garage and laboratory Exactly the places where a secret agent must stock up on everything he needs to carry out high-risk missions and eliminate the criminals who will try to block his way; as all gamers like us know, a large part of the success of a first person shooter is also determined by the weapons that it allows us to use. So let's briefly review what will be offered to us for the three categories above (weapons, machines and gadgets): Weapons: Dart Gun Wolfram P2K Ingalls Type 20 KA 57 IAC Defender SWZ SSR 4000 Frinesi Special 12 Windsor Viper MRL 22 Meyer-Westlicher UGW Koffler & Stock KS7 Munitions Belgique PS100 Koffler & Stock D17 Calypso P750 Windsor FSU-4 Grenade Fists After this list anyone knows a minimum of weapons he will already be greedily rubbing his hands, the others less wise will surely be impressed by the quantity and variety; however, to get an interesting idea, even a visual one, of the paraphernalia at your disposal, you can go to this address. Vehicles: BMW 750THE BMW Z8 Aston Martin DB5 Tank of the Romanian Army Here too we range from the classic Aston Martin, to the most modern BMW up to getting on board an armored tank.Gadgets: Q Decriptor Q Laser Q Claw Q Remote Q Camera Q Jet Also this time the faithful Q has provided you with interesting and very useful gadgets, which obviously except the Jetpack and the digital camera are all contained in your mobile phone: from the decoder for electronic locks to the laser for the old padlocks up to the useful grappling hook to reach elevated positions. Friends and Enemies Even the enemies and part of your collaborators are completely new and original. In fact, apart from R and M of the agency, fantastic girls and fascinating women will line up at your side, such as Zoe Nightshade who you will already be called to save in the very first mission entrusted to you or Dr. Natalya Damescu, an expert in bio-engineering and essential contact for the continuation of your missions. On the villains front, however, they will line up against despicable and unscrupulous individuals like Super Thug, corrupt diplomats like Reginald Griffin or criminal masterminds like Nigel Bloch. There will certainly also be ineffable femme fatales sent against you by your enemies such as Carla the Jackal or the twins Babe and Bella, without forgetting Adrian Malprave, a woman at the head of a very suspicious multinational, Malprave Industries, with high-level connections in various sectors, from petroleum to bio-engineering. Multiplayer what a passion That's right, every James Bond game now has a single and immeasurable yardstick, the Multiplayer mode offered by the now passatello Goldeneye and possibly by its spiritual successor Perfect Dark for the now defunct N64. So can this title set new standards and obliterate the old N64 game? The answer is negative. Then it is a mediocre title and has a pegreat Multiplayer mode? The answer is again negative. In fact, the game itself is excellent and complete, with a varied, interesting and fun Multiplayer mode; obviously not without forgivable flaws. Summing up the multiplayer mode, we can express that despite the 12 specially designed arenas, the impressive number of weapons and paraphernalia that has been expanded precisely for this mode with mines, dispersion grenades and the experimental photonic weapon, we still cannot define it as a masterpiece. In fact, the multiplayer is afflicted first of all, like the whole game and as we will explain later, by one of the most difficult control systems I've ever encountered, flanked by the odious limitation of having a maximum of 4 players on the field at the same time, whether they are controlled by humans or bots; however, it cannot even be rejected since it is excellent for any challenge between friends and deep and long-lived also thanks to various modifiers to be applied to the challenges to make them more compelling. After all, a good mode but undermined by defects that deny it the definition of excellent and unsurpassed. CONCLUDING: We certainly have in our hands the best FPS title for GameCube (not only because it's the only one), with significant additions compared to the PS2 version, excellent and well-defined graphics, a good variety of settings and a respectable paraphernalia; unfortunately limited by a control system that is hard to learn and be able to make the most of and excessive linearity. Still a great game for all fans and beyond. Pros: Clean and well-crafted graphics Endless weapons and gadgets Fun multiplayer Cons: Bad and difficult to assimilate control system Excessive linearity imposed in the FPS sections Sometimes repetitive and monotonous music The world still needs a hero... And you as James Bond, or if you prefer secret agent 007, are the only ones able to complete the most dangerous and exciting missions that the agency will offer you, from rescuing girls inside enemy fortresses to escaping from helicopters and cars through the narrow alleys of Hong Kong to chases at 200 km/h in your flaming Aston Martin in the streets of the port... This game will offer you all of this in the first levels and then continue in a growing whirlwind of action and adrenaline. You will therefore find many references to the typical situations of 007 films but no precise reference as the game is based on a new and original story, which will make you go from frenetic shootings to stealth actions, all optimally interspersed with wonderful cinematic interludes. Obviously since Goldeneye was released several years ago, every self-respecting FPS, especially if related to 007, has to deal with the multiplayer mode and try to keep up with the masterpiece Rare for N64; EA has therefore focused a lot on this aspect as well, creating an excellent 4-player multiplayer mode (which we will however talk about later).", "date": "2002-06-25", "grade": null}
