{"name": "Wimbledon 2008", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wimbledon-2008.html", "text": "Although it is a sport that lends itself well to video game reproduction, tennis is unfortunately not among the most popular activities in the world of mobile video games. However, the French Gameloft will take care of quenching the fans' thirst for digital rackets and balls, creating a product entirely dedicated to one of the most famous and followed tournaments in the world, namely Wimbledon. Let's start immediately from the painful notes: that of the British location is in fact the only official license that softco wanted or was able to grab, and consequently all the tennis players present do not bear the real names of the champions, but simple distortions that remind them. A pity, but nothing that prevents you from enjoying the advantages of this 2008 Wimbledon that are not lacking; above all, the studied control system, which allows you to play by holding the phone with one hand and interacting only with your thumb. In practice, the numeric keys correspond both to the direction in which to move the character, and to that to be imparted to the ball. In fact, once the ideal position to hit it has been reached, the tennis player automatically blocks, thus passing control directly to the racket. After a little practice, it must be admitted that the solution studied by the designers works in a valuable way; some limitations and errors are in fact easily forgiven in the face of the great accessibility of the product, which does not, however, translate into a lack of depth. On the contrary, you always have a good variety of shots available, and the ability to actually load and direct them in 9 different segments of terrain allows you to create exciting and vibrant matches. The amount of modes available is also positive, which alongside the single game or the obvious Wimbledon tournament also allow you to start a career, creating your own player from scratch, making him grow in characteristics through specific training sessions, only to then climb the rankings through real official meetings. Faced with many successful aspects, however, there is a component of the Gameloft production that is not up to par and which indeed significantly compromises the final evaluation of the game; we are referring to the technical aspect, more precisely to the animations of the tennis players. Disconnected, woody but above all not very fluid and poorly cohesive with each other, in some cases to the point of affecting the enjoyment of the games. A pity, because from an artistic point of view Wimbledon 2008 is not bad at all, adopting a pleasant realistic style with a good amount of details and touches of class. Annoying instead the sound, soon destined to remain deactivated without the possibility of second thoughts. Finally, sorry to note again that, especially in this kind of sports games, there is no multiplayer mode, perhaps via bluetooth. The evolution of mobile games also passes through here, and it's about time that the production houses started to understand it. PRO Good control system Good game structure Fun AGAINST Not enough animations No license for tennis players Multiplayer still a mirage", "date": "2008-05-12", "grade": "S.V."}
