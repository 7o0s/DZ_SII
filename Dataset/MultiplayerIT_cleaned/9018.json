{"name": "We will We will Rock You!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94400-orcs-must-die-we-will-we-will-rock-you.html", "text": "Tested version: PC We have repeatedly underlined how one of the undisputed advantages of Steam - and of similar online stores - is the space it grants to developers and titles that otherwise, even for simple economic reasons, would never be able to see the light of day or a real distribution . These titles, often released at negligible prices and even more often of good if not excellent quality, represent, in some way, the real reason why many users maintain their loyalty to the Valve multimedia platform even in the purchase of more competitive titles and easy availability. Orcs Must Die! it is undoubtedly part of this prolific line of potentially excellent, low-priced titles and, in this case, with some important names among the developers, who also include members of the teams working on Age of Empires Online and Halo Wars in their curriculum. Orcs march on Helm's Deep In Orcs Must Die! the typical threat to the peaceful kingdom of men by a horde of wildlings and slobbering orcs is just the excuse to package a product like Tower Defense with some splashed action, a healthy dose of humor and an almost infinite amount of enemies to tear apart. All we are given to know about the game world is that there are ogres who threaten the good guys, that the good guys have erected a series of fortresses to defend their territories and that the bad guys attempt an assault against these fortresses every day. The player's only task, in the guise of a warrior mage guardian of the fortresses, is to make these attacks fail by transforming the corridors and halls of the castles into real slaughterhouses. In terms of gameplay we therefore have a series of maps delimited by a starting point - the breach - and an arrival point - the teleportation to the outside - divided by a space that can be more or less variously occupied by halls, corridors, large rooms , stairs, terraces and ditches. The player therefore has access to a initially small and then increasingly large number of traps, slowdown systems and even allies to be strategically positioned along the way to stop the growing waves of orcs until they stop arriving. The goal of the orcs will not be so much to eliminate the player or the defenders but rather to reach the teleporter: if an excessive number of enemies (generally twenty-five) were to cross it, the game over will start. Between the various waves - on average eight per level - about ten seconds pass during which the player will be able to spend the points earned by killing enemies to place new traps or add defenders and, between one level and another, resources will be obtained to use in upgrading the traps themselves, making them cost less, increasing their range or raising their damage. However, the presence of the player is not limited to just this: on the contrary, contrary to other similar games, you will have direct control of your alter ego during the attack phases and, by commanding its movements using the classic arrow keys, you will take an active part in the defense by shooting down enemies with crossbow or broadsword or with the use of spells such as fireballs or lightning. As for the enemies, there are many classes of orcs, from common warriors to crossbowmen, up to gnolls (characterized by the fact that instead of running to the portals they aim to kill the player), kobolds, vampire bats and gigantic ogres, each of which is characterized by abilities that make some traps ineffective against it. The very fast kobolds, for example, can pass over a trap before it is triggered, not only remaining immune to it, but also protecting the allies who follow them, who will be able to pass unscathed next to the trap already triggered unnecessarily. Vampire bats, on the other hand, are completely immune to ground traps, and powerful ogres can take massive amounts of damage before succumbing. The strategic part of the title therefore lies, needless to say, in carefully deciding which traps to place and where, in such a way as to be ready to stop anything that comes your way, without risking being overwhelmed by classes of opponents that you are not prepared to face. Unfortunately, in balancing these traps we have a first, perhaps the most marked, flaw in the gameplay: as varied as they are (about thirty, to say the least) it is easy to see that only some of them are really useful, while others, either due to the slowness of recharge or the cost, they turn out to be little more than amusing visual trappings which, due to the scarcity of resources (otherwise it would be too easy) it will be very difficult to find the space to halftere. METAL! LA-LA-LA-LA! The technical aspect of Orcs Must Die! it obviously takes up the irony at the basis of the idea: the environments and the models of the characters are deliberately caricatured, in a style that can be defined as a mix between that of World of Warcraft and that of Uderzo's drawings for the adventures of Asterix and Obelix . The protagonist in the first place is a cross between a wizard, a knight, Ken (not the warrior, Barbie's Ken), He-Man and a member of the Village People. The castles and environments overflow with grotesque and redundant details and the ogres are the typical pissed off, drooling green skins, armed with axes and covered in skin and various scrap metal. The effects of the traps - spikes appearing from the floor, darts and cleavers shooting from walls, ceilings collapsing, springs shooting from walls, ducts releasing air to blow people away, etc. - all have somewhat caricatured and exquisitely splatter effects. with limbs, limbs and heads flying about in a blaze of blood and glory. Nothing exceptional as regards the special effects of spells and explosions, pleasant and never heavy, able to make the game run without slowdowns on many configurations despite the large number of characters on the screen. The sound is mainly based on the clicks of the springs, the screams of the ogres, the little comments of the protagonist (actually few and obvious) and some amusing piece of music that is never too intrusive and always suitable for the situation. Longevity is quite high thanks to the online rankings and the numerous traps that invite you to try more methods to pass the various levels in order to score a greater number of points. As for the dreaded repetitiveness of the title, we must instead point out that it exists, and, after a few hours, it tends to appear. A good way to fight it is to take the title for what it is, thus granting it rather short sessions of a maximum of a couple of levels at a time, in order to dilute the repetitiveness in favor of safe fun.
