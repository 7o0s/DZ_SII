The absurd ability to generate hatred and desolation in the hearts of many fans, dedicated to judging it in some cases even before having put their hand to it, marries optimally with the post-apocalyptic universe that characterizes its narrative and setting. We are probably facing the most difficult of the reviews of the year, even more so than titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, precisely because of its ability to divide users and critics so strongly. Regardless of everything, we tried to do what many felt entitled to avoid, even though they wanted to give an objective opinion in their opinion: play the title thoroughly. Let's start the Fallout 76 review by writing that Bethesda's new game isn't a masterpiece, it's not the best Fallout ever and probably not even the most compelling survival game on the market. This does not mean that its potential in a future key opens up such an extensive series of level contents, alongside the myriad of those already present, which make it at least attractive for a good portion of players. I have become Death The title of the paragraph is a literal quote from the header of one of the missions of this Fallout 76. It is also the one that most of all puts the essence of the Bethesda game campaign on the plane. We have already spent many opinions on this aspect, what we would like to highlight is that Fallout 76 uses its ~massive~ online gaming infrastructure and puts it completely at the service of a story that few will follow, but which presents some ideas ( especially in the final phase) so interesting as to surpass that of the fourth chapter in a very few moments. We play one of the survivors of vault 76 who, twenty-five years after the nuclear holocaust, is called to go out to the surface to begin the reconquest of our planet and return, as much as possible, to the normality of our past. We are in all respects faced with a prequel of the Fallout universe: it is in fact a title set several dozen (in some cases hundreds) of years before the other episodes of the series. No Vault has yet been opened on American territory and thus we become, in a heartbeat, the pioneers of what we like to call the new-new world. After a rather sketchy editor, and a walk around the almost completely deserted vault, what welcomes us on the outside is a devastated world, far from the beauty we remembered and inhabited by infected, irradiated and deeply hostile creatures. Our task is to follow the traces of the overseer and his journey throughout the territory of Appalachia, in search of the truth about what exterminated what was left of human life on the surface. The Fallout 76 campaign therefore unfolds through a series of main missions which are in turn divided into many sub-quests, each of which will require you to perform a specific action requested by the superintendent or by one of the robots and terminals that can be encountered on the own path. The lack of human NPCs with which to interact and start real discussions through multiple choices is a detail that has generated discontent and perplexity in fans of the series and role-playing games in general since the announcement of Fallout 76. Although this element may somehow prove to be particularly unsuitable for the genre, it is certainly justified by a historical moment that excludes any possibility of human life on earth. For this reason and for the quality of the characterization of the robots, which over time have made up for the lack of the dominant species by replicating their behaviors and consciences, the continuation of the campaign does not hide a rather interesting narrative subtext, leading to the rediscovery of that atomic technology which it was precisely the cause of our (almost) extinction. We cannot hide a certain level of repetitiveness of the management of objectives, written in such a way as to allow us to visit a good part of the map of Appalachia, huge and characterized so well that it can be considered the best of those produced since the series was in hand in Bethesda. Searching for the truth behind the birth of the so-called Fiery Beasts, a threat born precisely following the ~Great War~ and transformed into the worst of our nightmares, turns into an interesting journey, both alone and in groups, however showing the side to inherent problems both in one mode and in the other. If it is true that Fallout 76 offers joy and fun in company, and this still remains undeniable today, it is equally true that the infinite amount of holotapes to listen to and documents to read makes it diffIt is illicit to manage communication with your group, often leading you to isolate yourself in order to listen or read. From this point of view, Bethesda has not managed to find a compromise such as to make the experience sufficiently usable in every respect, with the consequence that, probably, you will perceive a certain tiredness in solo continuation, and equally a lack of deepening of the universe when you are in a group. This does not exclude, for the record, that the plot of Fallout 76 is absolutely well written and a step forward compared to the little bite of that of the fourth chapter, giving a certain amount of thrills and surprises as the hours go by and throughout the last stage. If you decide to delve into the game world, its premises and what it will bring over time to the Fallout universe that we all know, you will be able to surprise and excite yourself until you feel, as mentioned at the beginning, something very close to Death itself. Even the secondary quests, divided between simple tasks of little importance and real digressions and insights into the world around you, hide many moments capable of making you reflect and deepen all those elements that prompted man to fight against himself , until its self-elimination. Fallout 76, precisely because of its prequel nature, magically manages to give voice to all that desire to know the background of a universe that is still little explored, putting us in the shoes of those individuals who will become the progenitors of the personalities we will meet (or rather that we have encountered) in previous titles in the series. Therefore, net of a problem inherent in the game structure, the campaign and the narrative of Fallout 76 certainly represent the most successful and most satisfying element of a game that we would never have expected so profound from the point of view of history. The gameplay, the dirty one Closed the parenthesis on what concerns the campaign and the narrative sphere, the time has come to dwell on the gameplay of Fallout 76: it is here that the cards are played, literally given the management of the growth of one's alter ego, and it is here that the first great pains of Bethesda's last effort are born. Without necessarily having to point out what we all already know, the post-apocalyptic title par excellence puts us in the shoes of a survivor, who has returned to the surface after twenty-five years of imprisonment in an underground paradise in which life, with all the limitations of the case, flowed easily and without too many obstacles. The real world, on the other hand, is ugly, dirty, mean and far from friendly. Slaying mutant beasts, ghouls, radioactive animals, and all sorts of monstrosities that arose as a result of the nuclear holocaust, lays down as the basis of your survival. To do so, you'll have a virtually infinite arsenal of weapons at your disposal, ranging from handguns built from scrap materials to shotguns, assault rifles, blunt weapons, automatic firearms, explosives, grenades and mines, and even weaponry based on use of lasers, gamma rays and strange alien amenities. There is something for all tastes and no one will be able to argue with the variety of their arsenal. The story is different as regards the feeling that these weapons give. The shooting system of Fallout 76, it is useless to get around it, is the direct descendant of a Bethesda legacy which is now showing the side of time and would require a strong revision to be able to find a quality and playability suitable for 2018. The aim makes the whims, the slowness of movement does not help and the almost total uselessness of the famous SPAV system. (actually an obligatory choice given its totally online nature), outline a shooter sector that is not even remotely able to deliver a fluid and fun response to the commands in the hands of the player. As if that weren't enough, the wear and tear of weapons, sometimes exaggeratedly rapid, causes a certain sense of boredom in all those players who have no intention of dramatically increasing a single specification just to see their transportable weight become playfully bearable. As for the armor, in Fallout 76 the management is generally similar, with a myriad of possibilities and variations, also helped by the unique pieces that bring specific perks as a dowry, but which always suffer from sometimes frustrating wear. This aspect would be easy to overcome, thanks to the possibility of using workbenches and your own camp to work on modifications and repairs, if it weren't for the fact that, going forward and unlocking valuable pieces, the materials to spend to fix these pieces become so rare that often push you to equip less performing parts, rather than foundYou may have to wander around for tens of minutes looking for that adhesive tape that hides like a mouse would in your house. Precisely the crafting, cross and delight of Fallout, enormously amplified with the release of the fourth chapter and similarly re-proposed in this 76, represents one of the emblematic aspects of the current situation of Bethesda. From a team with enormous potential and almost infinite resources, it is at least anachronistic to find such an outdated and uncongenial system. Even the construction management, also taken up entirely by Fallout 4, is not fully convincing, hardly pushing the construction of one's own base, leading many players to place those few elements useful for managing their inventory and leaving the rest to rot. at least for a large period of time. Alongside these rather classic details, the growth of one's character is positioned. The evolution system in Fallout 76 has a dual nature, just like almost every aspect of the game. If it is true that the level increase generates the classic skill points to be spent on one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. it is with the cards, real active perks and steps, that one's build is matured. As you level up (not always but at specific intervals) the game will give you the chance to open a pack of four cards. Inside you will be able to find skills of all kinds, each linked to a specific characteristic. Each card has its own cost based on its level (and therefore its usefulness) which affects the points spent with progress. This means that if we have increased our ~strength~ characteristic to level 5, we will have five points to spend on cards in that specific category. It is also possible to merge duplicate cards so as to level them up, but consequently increasing their deployment cost. This whole system works quite well, there are an infinite number of cards and their interchangeability allows you to create builds in seconds. But what we cannot digest is the total lack of possibility to redistribute one's spent characteristic points. Mechanics present in the previous Fallouts, is completely disappearing in this new iteration, limiting your possibilities of ~changing your mind~, a fundamental element in a title that focuses on the multiplayer experience. Once you reach level 50 you will continue to increase your rank and take cards, but lose the possibility of further increasing one of your stats. Even today we are unable to give a practical sense to this choice, even more so since it is a title that will necessarily have to live on the contents published post-launch. Even the survival aspect of Fallout 76, limited to the need to drink or eat, does not change the essence of a genre study that is too superfluous to be acceptable, but which on the contrary risks turning into a simple tax to be paid every few minutes of game, otherwise you will lose energy and be unable to run. The aspect on which we would like to focus is that all the elements listed above, with the necessary small management differences, present themselves as key aspects of a way of making games that is inherent in Bethesda. The superficiality in the gameplay, all in the service of an excellent atmosphere and campaign, cannot be separated from the awareness and intellectual honesty of admitting that it is certainly not the fault of Fallout's online drift if the game has taken this direction. For this and for many other reasons, it will be up to you to decide if you are still ready to immerse yourself in an experience that is not very user friendly like this, or if instead the total lack of refinement in the mechanics has completely bored you. The activities Let's get to the point, to conclude what the Fallout 76 gameplay offers and before moving on to the sore point of the technical aspect. Activities are not a problem for the title, in terms of quantity. The main campaign settles down to about thirty hours of gameplay, and there are so many secondary activities that completing them all will be quite prohibitive. These are divided into specific tasks, sub-quests, various missions and events (including daily ones, with a specific increased reward). Completing tasks will grant you a good number of experience points and caps, as well as a number of unique items. Movement on the map is rapid, once a certain area has been discovered, upon payment in caps. However, what denotes the team's lack of experience in such a game is the impossibility of sharing quests. This aspect, even after almost ten days, is the least understandable element of Bethesda's design, forcing", "date": "2018-11-23", "grade": "7.0"}
