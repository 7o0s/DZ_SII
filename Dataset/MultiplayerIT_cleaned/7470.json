Because at the last E3 in Los Angeles, when Super Mario 3D World was presented for the first time, we certainly didn't describe the new adventure of the most famous Italian plumber in the world with particular enthusiasm. Neither the announcement during the Nintendo Direct nor the subsequent test on the show floor impressed us, on the contrary leaving us with the feeling of a ~minor~ episode, devoted more to the three-dimensional declination of the multiplayer formula of New Super Mario Bros. than to the fulfillment of the desire for ~Galaxy-style~ single player that many fans were trying. However, it must be said, as a partial excuse, that the Kyoto house did its part: first the choice to abandon the ~party~ of the classic Los Angeles conference in favor of a more synthetic and sober Direct, then the installation of demos not in able to give the perspective of the real value of Super Mario 3D World. But, looking at the glass half full, it is also true that in this way we really enjoyed the pleasure of discovery, the enthusiasm in the face of the total reversal of the beliefs with which we challenged the GamePad for the first time, facing level 1- 1, without imagining that this would be the beginning of an extraordinary and hilarious journey... Super Mario 3D World is the game Wii U owners have been waiting for From one to four It usually happens that a game offers a great single player experience accompanied by a multiplayer added almost out of obligation, or on the contrary you come across products expressly aimed at use in the company of human opponents that include very thin if not depressing story modes to say the least forgettable. Super Mario 3D World, on the other hand, is the perfect union of the two worlds, precisely because they are not managed as separate entities, but as fundamental ingredients of a single dough. But at the same time, EAD Tokyo's effort is a product with a quality, quantity and variety of content that leaves us almost speechless, also because they simply represent factors that we are no longer used to seeing all together in the same game nowadays . And yet Super Mario 3D World is just that: a surprising concentration of ideas that fit together perfectly like a magnificent puzzle. The starting point of the project was that Super Mario 3D Land which appeared two years ago on Nintendo 3DS, and which in fact represented a sort of prototype, an embryo for a new approach in the development of a Mario platform capable of placing itself in the middle road - as declared by the developers themselves - between the 2D and 3D souls of the series; from there, the concept practically exploded, giving life to what is in fact the first real must have for Wii U. In Super Mario 3D World you can take control of a character of your choice between Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad (plus a fifth to unlock, as you may have read); each of them is strongly distinct in the characteristics concerning running and jumping speed, offering a range of choices capable of bringing substantial differences to the practical act. As previously mentioned, you can choose whether to face the adventure alone or in company of up to a maximum of four participants; all this within the same identical levels, without having to make particular selections or navigate between menus. Everything is there, at your fingertips, just pressing a button. Precisely for this reason, the Nintendo production offers the possibility to choose from a range of controllers that includes practically all those compatible with Wii U: GamePad therefore, but also Wiimote (with or without Nunchuck) and Pro Controller. With the exception of the Remote Control alone, which suffers a little - but not too much to tell the truth - from the absence of an analog stick in a three-dimensional world, all the different types of peripheral guarantee a roughly equivalent experience, without therefore giving to no particular advantages. And this is an element of great importance, because Super Mario 3D World is a game in equal measure at the same time cooperative and competitive: the first for the presence of common objectives and for sharing lives, the second for the ranking that is drawn up inexorably at the end of each level, decreeing a winner destined to be able to wear the coveted crown in the next stage. Which actually in practice only serves to guarantee a small bonus in the score, but represents a fetish intended to bring out the worst in everyone in an attempt to possess it by snatching it from the owner. Played in multiplayer, Super Mario 3D World is an often chaotic yet exceptional experience, balanced, perfectly tuned and monstrously funprovided that the participants possess at least similar skills. The cat cat The narrative device this time sees the usual Bowser kidnapping not the princess, but seven fairies to which the player will have to give back their freedom in order to restore peace to the kingdom. It is obviously a simple plot useful only to give reasons for the existence of Peach as a playable character, but the story certainly does not play an important role in a product of this type. What is instead fundamental is how the effort of EAD Tokyo represents the concretization and realization of a ferment within the development team, of a desire to amaze, of a motivation to fill the game as much as possible with content to truly guarantee a new approach to a genre that Nintendo itself actually invented, shaped and defined. The absolute mastery of the material is perhaps the most evident element in Super Mario 3D World, and we really wouldn't be able to justify otherwise the incredible value of every single element that makes up a product of this size. The innovative character of Nintendo production can already be understood from the game map; although the individual levels are still connected to each other by a well-defined path, this is no longer the only and limiting space for the player to move. On the contrary, now the stage selection area itself is a freely explorable level in itself in which to collect coins, discover secrets, shortcuts and so on. A small revolution that makes this element much more than a simple selection menu as it was in the past, instead transforming it into a sort of toy with which to interact and have fun. This push towards experimentation, the extension of the imposed limits is felt in every moment of the game. And the most obvious and natural representation of this philosophy lies in the cat suit, the new transformation introduced for the occasion, which allows you to take on the appearance of a feline, gaining not only a ~paw~ attack, but also the ability to climbing vertical walls reaching otherwise completely inaccessible areas. A feature that has obviously been well exploited by the level design: in addition to allowing you to reach the end of the level through ~alternative~ ways, it is above all in the collection of secrets, green stars and stamps that the cat suit often and willingly proves to be fundamental. The stars are distributed in groups of three for each level, hidden in ways ranging from ~very obvious~ to ~downright ingenious~, often requiring a certain degree of effort to recover them. An effort, this, however, necessary not only for 100% fetishists: the green stars are in fact a sort of key through which to unlock both secondary levels and, on the contrary, others fundamental for progression, and the required quantities are such as to often require to go and repeat the internships already completed in order to be able to recover them all. The stamps, on the other hand, more than 80 in all and also cleverly hidden, can be used to cheer up, personalize and enrich the Miiverse messages. Green stars + stamp + jump at the top of the flag are the three elements that allow you to obtain the maximum rating in a single level: an objective intended to stimulate and engage even the most experienced players, we assure you. However, the cat suit is certainly not the only transformation available to Mario and his companions: Fire, Boomerang and Tanooki Suit are included in the package, but there are also several others to discover. And there was light We will probably be repetitive, but we would like to underline how it is precisely the amazing combination of abundance and caliber of the offer that surprises in the experience with Super Mario 3D World. The number of levels present is simply incredible and - little spoiler - definitely goes beyond those to be faced up to the fun and challenging confrontation with Bowser which leads to the end credits. And even the gradual and constant increase in difficulty is an element capable of guaranteeing accessibility and fun for players of all abilities: in fact, if in the first worlds Super Mario 3D World can be almost assimilated to a party-casual game with which to entertain relatives, little ones, brothers or girlfriends, in the advanced ones you have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts, perfectly managing the precision and timing of your actions. All this always and in any case with an impeccable control system and a level design that will bring tears to your eyes, compact, dense, inspired and balanced, enhanced by both an aesthetic and stylistic variety that is out of parameters: there is the level inspired by Mario Kart in which you run at breakneck speed, the one withtop view reminiscent of arcade shooters, there are the exhilarating sections riding the dinosaur Plessie, the snowy environments and on an atoll by the sea, the underwater levels and the haunted house and those of Captain Toad Explorer pushing on a really successful puzzle variant. And this is only a fraction of the total, obviously without forgetting the boss fights: many, different, spectacular, even if almost always a little easy. Just to make you understand the goodness of the package packaged by EAD Tokyo, suffice it to say that in the flood of internships addressed, there were perhaps two or three that we found slightly subdued. Stop. Even from a technical point of view, Super Mario 3D World is a show in no uncertain terms. The graphic style used, particularly ~soft~ and rounded, really takes an instant to convince without hesitation; but, beyond the established goodness of the Nintendo artists, it is also in the exploitation of the Wii U hardware that the game is able to raise the bar towards a new point of reference. For example, the texture quality is something spectacular, without even a single smudging or misstep; and each of them performs its function in giving solidity and depth to the elements present on the screen, increasing the liveliness of a vibrant and colorful world. But if we had to point to a single component of the graphics engine capable of standing out above all the rest, it would probably be the lighting. From this point of view it is quite clear how Nintendo has worked a lot, because it is a prominent element that unites a large part of the past, present and future first party games: Nintendo Land, Pikmin 3, The Wind Waker HD, Mario Kart 8 and precisely this Super Mario 3D World are all titles in which the excellent management of light sources is the key component to distinguishing and defining the generational transition on the new home console. And the fact that the resolution is ~only~ at 720p has a negligible impact on the final result, where instead the constant and rocky 60 frames per second have a much more important value. In all of this, the decision to use a fixed camera parallel to the action plan appears to be correct both to optimize the work of the graphics engine and to guarantee an optimal point of view to support multiplayer sessions. In single instead it is possible to act on the view via GamePad, even if honestly the goodness of the default setting has never made us feel the need. Let's take advantage of the Wii U controller citation to describe its use: in addition to the classic off screen mode that allows you to play with the TV off, the touch screen can be used to stun enemies or interact with elements of the setting, while in the microphone you can blow to move certain platforms or push smaller opponents away. In short, marginal stuff, but still enjoyable. On the other hand, the audio component deserves more than a word, not only for the quality of the effects (note how the sounds become muffled underwater, for example) but above all for the orchestrated pieces ranging from classical themes to new melodies created for the occasion; in any case the result is splendid, full-bodied and exciting, an authentic step forward capable of really contributing to increasing the overall value of the gaming experience.", "date": "2013-11-19", "grade": "9.6"}
