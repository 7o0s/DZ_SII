The pixel art, the simple but captivating gameplay and the impeccable exploitation of the free to play formula are characteristics common to almost all the specimens of the Nitrome stable, and are also the main strengths that allow these titles to make inroads between the public and criticism. Among the many successful shots, however, one can happen lopsided, and this is undoubtedly the case with Nano Golf: Hole in One, a title with intriguing premises but which ends up running out of arguments rather quickly. Alternative golf The previous Nano Golf released last year had adopted a more classic approach, offering players a series of holes to be completed in a pre-established order by taking as few strokes as possible: a structure that had led to the Nitrome product being judged pleasant but also short-lived, given that once the routes were exhausted there was nothing left to do but retrace one's steps in search of a better performance. Evidently to make up for this shortcoming, the developers of Rhubarbist have preferred to follow another path with this Nano Golf: Hole in One, allowing the user only one shot per hole (hence the title) and adding elements taken into the equation loan from endless runner and singer company. Basically, the game is made up of many small paths that follow one another in random order, each of which must be completed with a single hit - to be performed by dragging your finger across the screen in proportion to the force you want to apply - and possibly by collecting the coins positioned between the cue point and the hole: if the ball stops before hitting it is game over, and you can only continue by spending a few coins or watching an advertisement. As in all endless runners, the goal is simply to keep going as far as possible, and the only other stimulus to try again and again beyond the rankings is the unlockable rewards, here represented by alternative balls to the classic specimen white. Considering how the playful offer of Nano Golf: Hole in One ends here, it is easy to understand that this is not a mobile game destined to remain etched forever in the memory of the players and in that of their devices: already after a few games the product Nitrome gives the impression of having a little shortness of breath, unable to trigger that proverbial spark that pushes you to play one more game to improve your results. An element that certainly plays against the Rhubarb title is also the fact that the levels are not generated in a procedural way, but are fixed schemes that for better or worse are constantly reproposed during the games, further affecting a variety that already did not shine on the paper. All this despite the fact that the game does its best to keep the user's attention alive: the stages put in place all kinds of gadgets to make things more interesting (quicksand, teleporters, cannons, spiked walls and so on), but in the end they can't move a decidedly mogio gameplay too much. The impression is that for such a product a standard progression model (like that of the prequel) is more suitable to convey the idea of effective progress in the game with a consequent increase in difficulty, while here it is a mere matter of luck based on the more or less demanding schemes that one finds himself facing during a game. The roundup ends with a technical realization that obviously couldn't surprise with special effects (it's still a pixel art golf game with a top view), but which does nothing to avoid being monotonous.", "date": "2019-01-31", "grade": "7.0"}
