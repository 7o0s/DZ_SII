{"name": "Last Day of June", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/187790-last-day-of-june-non-si-sfugge-al-destino.html", "text": "Three years after the publication of Murasaki Baby, Ovosonico is back on track with a second adventure with peculiar characteristics. Despite the uncertainties of the debut title, the studio led by Massimo Guarini hasn't lost the pleasure of experimentation and with Last Day of June offers us new interesting ideas, demonstrating not only stubbornness but also a good dose of courage. Since music is one of the favorite means to touch the strings of the human soul, the team has chosen to rely on the expert hands and crystalline talent of Steven Wilson for the creation of the sound accompaniment. With the help of an original concept, the collaboration of a renowned musician and the artistic support of the director Jess Cope, it was therefore possible to put together a delicate, exciting and well-made interactive experience. As we have already had the opportunity to point out in our trial in July, those who were thinking of being in the presence of one of the many walking simulators with a very linear structure and minimal interaction, would do better to think again. We will shortly explain the reason, but before continuing further we want to remind you that Last Day of June will be available starting August 31st for PC and PlayStation 4, at a price of 19.99 euros. Moreover, a particularly attractive promotion is foreseen on Steam: from day one until September 14th it will be possible to buy the game and get Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons for free. An interesting initiative, considering that the two works develop the theme of affection and loss in their own way, both leveraging emotion and out-of-the-ordinary game mechanics. In other words, if you have not yet had the opportunity to play the Starbreeze title and are inclined to immerse yourself in the colorful and poignant adventure represented in Last Day of June, you better think about it. Crossroads of Destiny There is no escaping the plots of fate. In a nutshell, this is the message that makes its way during the poignant adventure told in Last Day of June. Carl and June have sworn eternal love, yet fate seems to have other projects in store. We meet them on what, at first glance, appears to be a calm summer day, on the shores of a small lake. A flower donated and tucked into your hair, a gift to unwrap before returning home. But it is precisely during the return journey that the irreparable happens. A few moments are enough to make us understand that something went terribly wrong that afternoon. An unpredictable event and the car the couple is in ends up off the road. June doesn't make it, Carl survives but is paralyzed and is forced to live out the rest of his days confined to a wheelchair. In the house now emptied of any joy, the sense of emptiness becomes increasingly unbearable. Then, completely unexpectedly, a glimmer of hope makes its way: through some paintings left by June, the protagonist realizes that he is able to evade the flow of time and that he can try to change the events of that unfortunate day. To do this, he will need to influence the actions performed in those fateful hours by the other villagers, in an attempt to reverse the events and embrace his beloved again. What struck us most about Last Day of June is precisely the idea from which the developers started to represent poor Carl's mental journey of hope, giving the player the task of recomposing a puzzle made up of various combinations, with the aim last to restore serenity in the life of the bespectacled protagonist. As mentioned, if the gameplay gives more than a few surprises, punctuating the progression with a certain grace, the sound component has played a significant role in riding the emotions that are felt during this particular narrative progression. And if from the point of view of interaction, the solutions adopted seemed brilliant, despite their simplicity, the music composed by Steven Wilson represents the classic icing on the cake for those like myself who have been experiencing a great passion and an equally solid respect for a long time for the works of the British artist. Wilson is a master at conveying a whirlwind of emotions to the listener, his compositions associate very well with the images and fit perfectly with the type of story proposed, supporting both moments of harmony and phases of melancholy reflection. The tracks selected to represent Carl's journey have proved to be very spot on and it would be enough to mention The Raven That Refused to Sing, taken from the 2013 album of the same name, to pass the concept without really needingor add much more. Emotions and tenderness Last Day of June would seem to suggest the absence of a real interactive component and instead, through the resolution of the puzzles, it foresees that the user actively intervenes in the story without limiting himself to being little more than a simple spectator. The story is not divided into several levels, but we are dealing with a single explorable game area, in which each segment of the map can be progressively unlocked. In addition to Carl and the unfortunate June, the game involves some secondary subjects who also prove to be instrumental in achieving the final objective. You therefore need to control a pestiferous child, an elderly gentleman with a cane, the friend next door about to move and a bold hunter who lives surrounded by trophies in his luxurious family estate. On that fateful day, each of them performed actions that indirectly contributed to June's death. To bring home the result, the player must make these subjects interact with each other and with the surrounding environment, varying the activities, using some objects and unlocking previously closed doors or passages. Each character is also associated with a card, which changes its appearance based on the choices made and serves to summarize the events put in sequence and the outcomes that will be produced once the day is over for the umpteenth time. This dynamic inevitably leads to repeating specific situations and revising some sequences, given that the context in which we move is always the same, albeit in constant evolution. Moreover, precisely in order to prevent the gaming experience from becoming tedious, Ovosonico has wisely decided to cut certain activities already carried out by the player in the previous segments, optimizing the narrative progression without resulting in boredom. In this sense, the possibility of skipping the videos of the accident could also have been foreseen, which on the contrary must be reviewed in full at each new passage. Even the artistic realization convinced us thanks to a minimal graphic style and with its own personality, capable of transmitting a sense of tenderness, in certain moments of the story, really difficult to tell in words. The choice of colors in turn marks the rhythm of the story, alternating warm and lively tones with darker moments, mostly tending towards blue, in the moments when poor Carl finds himself alone, abandoned between four walls full of memories. Before moving on to the comment, it is worth mentioning the presence of curious collectibles, which are linked to the individual characters and can only be obtained when the correct subject is being controlled, obviously provided that access to the interested area has already been unlocked. Moreover, just like the rest of the game, it is material that can be recovered in complete tranquility without having to rack your brains more than necessary.", "date": "2017-08-29", "grade": "8.5"}
