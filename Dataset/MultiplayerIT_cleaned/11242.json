{"name": "Ninja Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-strike.html", "text": "Ninjas have always exercised a certain fascination, entering the collective imagination by right and occupying an important place within the video game market. How many games have a ninja as a protagonist? It is a still current trend, which has its roots, as usual, in the arcade production of the second half of the 80s. In this sense, SEGA has been a bit of a trailblazer with its Shinobi, a high quality action game that has been a huge success and has given rise to a good number of sequels. Those who have been lucky enough to try it will certainly remember the bonus sections that took place between one stage and another, and which saw us use a first-person view, throwing shurikens at the enemies that overlooked the walls of a Japanese temple . To test the new EyePlay technology, the developers of EyeSight Technologie wanted to take up just that kind of situation, creating a video game in which we take on the role of a ninja and we have to eliminate our enemies by throwing the characteristic star-shaped blades. Live though. Given the huge success of consoles like the Wii and Nintendo DS, it was only a matter of time before someone considered incorporating motion-sensing technology into mobile phones as well. There are some new terminals that include such devices and use them for very simple applications, such as the classic pedometer, but no one had yet thought of using a tool that has been present in telephones for years now: the camera. And this is precisely the idea from which Ninja Strike starts: we will be able to actually throw the shurikens, moving the hand under the mobile phone, with the camera that will detect the movement to start the launch on the screen. The price to pay is that the game is only available for Symbian systems, but it is still a small revolution, which paves the way for a whole series of playful applications with great potential. In the game, we'll have a rather limited control of our ninja: his movement from left to right will be automatic, so we'll only have to worry about throwing the shurikens at the right time to hit the enemies placed in different areas of the stage. They won't be standing there waiting for us, however, so we'll have to be quick and precise so they don't run away. At a certain point, the action will become a little more interesting, with the opponents trying to hit us in turn: in this case, we will have to press the 5 button to raise an arm and parry the attack. Finally, in the more advanced stages our goal will be to hit a particular colored ninja, and succeeding will result in a momentary boost: we will be able to clearly see the trajectory of our throws, so as not to miss a single shot. Without the limitations imposed by the Java platform, Ninja Strike offers us more complex graphics and sound than the average. The coolest thing about the game are the locations, which on balance are limited to static screens but offer a great variety of scenarios and colors. The ninjas that move inside them are equipped with discrete but far from exceptional animations, just as the shuriken throwing movement by our alter ego is not beautiful. The sampled sound effects are quite basic, but they do the job well. As for the control system, there's not much to say: the motion detection is good, even if there is minimal slowdown compared to when the action takes place on screen. PRO New and interesting approach Technically well done Simple and fun... AGAINST ...albeit very, very limited Short lived Response to movements not exactly lightning fast", "date": "2008-08-21", "grade": "S.V."}
