{"name": "Civilization III - Sid Meier torna sulla scena!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/civilization-iii-sid-meier-torna-sulla-scena.html", "text": "Basic concepts (the Civ for beginners) As always, Sid Meier puts us at the helm of an entire civilization, which we will have to lead by the hand through the various historical periods up to global dominance, passing through different stages of development. As new virtual Napoleons, we will be able to found cities, build buildings, make important scientific discoveries, trade, conquer new nations and administer the treasury of our state, without ever losing sight of the well-being of the people we are leading. Everything, strictly in turns. At the beginning we will be at the head of a small group of settlers, with which to found the first city, but already in a short time we will be able to launch ourselves into the unstoppable challenge of evolution. Every civilization develops on several layers, from the economic to the scientific one, passing through the military one. Diplomacy also has its significant weight, given that in the course of the game, sooner or later, we will come into contact with the other races present. Each city can produce units (so, from simple workers to tanks), buildings and wonders. Buildings help the city grow more easily, while wonders provide unique bonuses that can also be applied to the whole civilization. For example, completing the Apollo Program means finally being able to start building the spaceship that will take us to Alpha Centauri. Of course, the bigger and richer a city is, the greater the cultural contribution it makes to the whole civilization. Basic concepts (the Civ for beginners) And while we are busy building ever larger and more beautiful cities, we must not forget to extend the borders of our empire, and in this tiring task the military forces at our disposal will help us. As we progress, new, more advanced and powerful units will become available, while the old ones will become obsolete. But if war is an option not to be overlooked, it will be equally important to maintain good relations with the other powers involved. This can be done through exchanges and treaties and, moreover, the greater our sphere of influence, the greater the credit we will have in diplomatic relations. Finally, of vital importance is the exploitation of the resources present on the map and which allows us not only to build better units, but also to weave profitable trade relationships with other cities and even other populations. The exploitation of resources is, in fact, a cornerstone of the whole game, while in previous versions it had a marginal role. In Civilization III, whoever controls the most resources wields enormous power. Novelty Although, at first glance, this latest chapter may seem like a simple restyling of the previous one, in reality juicy innovations are introduced that radically change the way of approaching the game. In the previous paragraph I deliberately spoke of concepts such as ~cultural contribution~ and ~exploitation of resources~ and which are perhaps the two main innovations. In the face of an evolution that contemplates scientific growth, economic growth, up to military growth, the cultural variable that embodies the intrinsic value of the entire civilization under our control has finally been introduced. As our cities grow, they generate more and more culture, until they extend their sphere of influence to the surrounding territories. In fact, every city has 'boundaries', or rather limits within which its cultural influence is very strong and as these widen, this influence grows hand in hand. When the edges of two cities, belonging to the same faction, touch, they merge into a single large border that will enclose our territory. Culture, therefore, is an indication of our evolutionary level and grows on the basis of the works we have created. A very important factor is the age of our cities and the works they contain, given that the older they are, the more culture points will be provided. Therefore, if on the one hand age makes units obsolete, on the other hand production acquires new value instead of losing it. When one state has a very strong cultural influence, the cities of neighboring states will be fascinated by it and will very often break away from their government to go to the other side. Therefore, a high cultural level also means weakening the opposing states without the use of weapons. But this does not mean that, if we acquire a city from another state, it will be totally at our disposal, given that despite having acquired our 'citizenship' it will mainly be made up of people who will feel legalate to their population of origin. So, in case of war, there will be riots especially in cities from states that we have come into conflict with. Novelty The other important change is the way resources and luxury goods are treated. Finally they are no longer a mere bargaining chip, but are the key to producing the best units and to calming the restless spirits of the citizens. Now, to build some units it is necessary to have certain resources, for example to produce swordsman it is necessary that among the goods in the city there is also steel. This fact, therefore, invests all the most important resources with a strategic value and allows new expansion schemes, more subtle than the simple use of force. For example, blocking a road that connects an opposing city with an oil field means placing a serious mortgage on the production of all those units that really need oil. And again, the planning of territorial expansion assumes considerable importance, given that it is advisable to grab the main resources ahead of time, in order to already have a good margin of advantage over the opponents at the right time. Hence, the vital importance of building a transport network that connects all cities. Strategic resources also play a decisive role in diplomatic exchanges, which now enjoy a renewed, more versatile and powerful interface. When bargaining with another nation's leader, a large number of trade combinations can be proposed, such as offering technology for luxuries or maps for a treaty. Even the military units have not emerged unscathed from the tide of changes, in fact after a certain number of victories from them it is possible to see the birth of a Great Leader who will be able to create, in turn, a Military Academy or to gather other units under him in such a way to form an army. But the war can also be lost and so units in distress will even be able to withdraw from the fight, instead of letting themselves be slaughtered in battle. The interface has also been heavily revamped and is certainly more functional than before. The menus and assistant windows are always useful and the information arranged according to a more ~ergonomic~ criterion, while the city screen allows you to still keep an eye on the map. The possibility of creating a production list for each city has been added, in order to speed up city management, without having to go crazy between a thousand screens at each turn. Novelty Among the many new features, however, there are some that are less pleasant. First, multiplayer support has been completely eliminated, Civilization III can only be played solo! Let's hope for a future expansion... In addition, any type of movie is completely absent, apart from a brief initial introduction, and the construction of the Wonders is 'celebrated' with a very meager summary sheet. Lights and shadows In short, this new chapter of Civilization really puts a lot of irons on the fire, but, in summary, is all that glitters really gold? From an innovative point of view, Firaxis certainly did a great job, introducing the very important concept of culture and forcing the player to carefully manage strategic resources, but other aspects are less well-finished, leaving in some cases a sense of frustration hard to fade. First of all, it is not always easy to navigate between the data and the lists and often we find ourselves losing important units because they are not immediately reachable from the menu. In the more advanced stages of the game, then, the wait between one turn and another is sometimes excessive, especially on intermediate-range computers. A reason for discontent in the gaming community is the difficulty of managing the problem of corruption and waste. If in previous versions of Civ it was possible to build a Courthouse to get rid of it, at least at the beginning, now this is no longer enough: corruption is too high and the game has an imbalance in this sense. It must be said, however, that by building the necessary structures, the results are not seen immediately but after a few rounds and the more time passes, the more this effect seems to increase. I say 'apparently' because we are always dealing with observations made over the long term and it is not easy to attribute the right causes to certain effects. Lights and shadows In this new chapter of Civilization III, therefore, the game takes on a new strategic value, introducing a veryvaried and articulated, where it will not necessarily be necessary to accumulate cities and productions to weaken the adversaries, but it will be possible to intervene on variables with a more subtle influence, and therefore we will be able to try to obtain control over a certain type of resource, for example, or to destroy the roads that bring raw materials to our enemies, during a war, not to mention that we will always be able to use our cultural superiority to attract the favor of foreign cities. Perhaps the only really annoying problem is the length of the turns in the more advanced stages of the game, while the absence of multiplayer support can also take a back seat in a title of this mold. Apart from these considerations, Civilization III is certainly what fans of the series were looking for: the return of Sid Meier as director! Newbies, on the other hand, will be able to appreciate the wealth of ideas and the strategic variety introduced right from the start, even if the learning curve of this type of game is inevitably high. Introduction Sid Meier returns to our screens, more than ten years after the birth of that Civilization from which the entire series was born. It returns and does so with mastery and character, offering us this third chapter of the saga, after various spurious episodes that have seen the light in recent years: after the misadventures of the Microprose brand, in fact the Civilization license has passed through different hands, giving life to some parallel production. Civilization: Call To Power 1 and 2, Civilization Test of Time and Alpha Centauri, a pseudo sequel to Civilization2 produced by Meier himself, have satisfied fans of the series in recent years. Finally, today, the license has returned to the hands of its creator and thus it has been possible to achieve what all the long-time strategists and neophytes of conquest on a planetary scale have been waiting for for a long time: Civilization III! 6", "date": "2001-11-22", "grade": null}
