{"name": "Delusione estrema?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131967-dynasty-warriors-8-xtreme-legends-delusione-estrema.html", "text": "The release of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends - Complete Edition on Steam does not represent an absolute novelty: the action series developed by Omega Force, which boasts a fairly substantial following also in the West, has in fact enjoyed several conversions for PC, conversions which however often they have not crossed the Japanese borders, not even in digital format alone. The opportunity to change course with this last episode was tempting, given that at the same time there was the debut on PlayStation 4, which brought with it an appreciable technical improvement: 1080p resolution, elimination of the hitherto inevitable pop-up of enemies, more characters on screen at once, better texture quality and solid frame rate even in the most hectic situations. Situations that, as fans of this franchise know, occur practically every two seconds. Dynasty Warriors has in fact always been the fair of ~button mashing~, a frenetic action game in which we take on the role of some of the greatest leaders of Imperial China, obviously ~fictitious~ for the occasion, who face entire hostile armies alone and they have incredible power, so much so that they can defeat dozens and dozens of opponents with a single blow. The PC version of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends is based on the ~old gen~ editions and disappoints a lot Complete Edition Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends - Complete Edition arrives on the Windows platform with the same edition released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which includes the base game and its ~extreme~ expansion in a single solution. The latter adds to the experience a new single player campaign with the invincible Lu Bu, some new stages, extra content for Ambition Mode, a new EX attack for each warrior and five playable characters: Fa Zheng, Lu Lingqi, Yu Jin, Chen Gong and Zhu Ran. Not only side elements, therefore, but also an optimization of the mechanics that gives a minimum of variety to offensive maneuvers, a fundamental factor when the gameplay consists solely in trimming combo after combo to free the various areas of each map from the presence of enemy commanders, so as to finally conquer the whole territory and move on to the next one. The many weapons available, to be unlocked during the missions and with which to equip our warrior, as well as the renewed system to ~counterattack~ when an opponent tries to hit us with a special maneuver should also be seen in this light. Small attentions that are extremely appreciated by fans of the series, but which in any case do not improve the yield of the impacts, in our opinion still too ~light~ when compared with what is offered by a direct competitor such as Sengoku Basara. The point is that, however, finally even on PC you can enjoy an episode of Dynasty Warriors, probably the best ever made, and this can only be welcomed with enthusiasm by those who couldn't wait to be able to get their hands on the title of Omega Force in Windows environment. The presence of variations on the theme such as the well-known Ambition mode, however, significantly increases the duration of the experience, for example proposing situations in which battles perform the concrete function of collecting materials to build a magnificent castle, worthy of the Emperor . Old gen? We knew the value and the peculiarities of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends - Complete Edition, and we talked about it in detail in the review of the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions, released last month. Clearly we expected from the PC edition a technical sector comparable, if not superior, to that of the next gen Sony console, but evidently Tecmo Koei preferred to make a different, at least questionable, choice, that is to make a conversion that was as light as possible on the front hardware requirements, so as to increase any user base. Hence, despite the possibility of making various graphic adjustments (resolution, texture filter, vertical synchrony and then, specifically, the general quality, the characters, the drawing distance, the details, etc.), the visual rendering of the game is heavily castrated by the use of the assets of the PlayStation 3 version, which ~flatten~ the graphics and give them that inevitable ~old generation~ flavor, in particular as regards the definition of the textures. Of course, it must be admitted that at least three elements are improved: the frame rate is anchored to 60 frames per second (apart from the cutscenes, stopped at 30 frames per second) even when all hell is on the screen, without uncertainties; and likewise NoThere is no crazy pop-up that on the (now old) Sony console caused enemies to appear out of nowhere. Furthermore, the resolution reaches 1080p, as on PlayStation 4. To counteract these small advantages, we think of the inexplicable lack of cooperative multiplayer mode, a decidedly lacking and cumbersome interface, poor controller support and a customization system of the controls leaking from all sides. In addition, many users have experienced crashes, mysterious blocks and infinite loading, problems that we have fortunately solved by running the game in Windows 7 compatible mode, but which is not really nice to find in an official release that - supposedly - has been tested before publication .", "date": "2014-05-19", "grade": "6.0"}
