{"name": "Mortal Shell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-shell-recensione.html", "text": "Medieval fantasy, particularly cryptic lore, ~souls~ to be consumed around a ~bonfire~. In its most superficial aspects, Mortal Shell looks very closely at Dark Souls, with some slight differences: souls become Tar, a strange nectar that represents both in-game currency and experience points, and the reassuring warmth of a bonfire is replaced a mysterious masked figure known as Sister Genessa, who seems to have lived in this forgotten world long before us. Despite the undeniable similarity, if we strip the Cold Symmetry game of those aspects that we find in every title developed after the From Software cornerstones, we find an action RPG that veers more towards a Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice model and borrows very few aspects of its role-playing component. Mortal Shell thrives on ups and downs and perhaps, in its attempt to get too close to Miyazaki's works, it forgets that it is not enough to borrow its characteristics: it is also necessary to have the same vision, an error into which many have already fallen . Nonetheless, net of a low price and the hours it offers, it is a game that, despite its flaws, could be worth your time, while waiting for an untraceable Elden Ring. Let's see why in this Mortal Shell review. The lives of others One of the most interesting aspects of Mortal Shell undoubtedly concerns its protagonist (Foundling) and the ability that distinguishes him: being able to inhabit the remains of fallen warriors, bringing them back to a non-life to help him in his mission. It has a bittersweet aftertaste living the lives of others, discovering their past piece by piece through a voice - theirs - that the years have consumed like those dead bodies and reawaken a lost conscience in the folds of time. We thus discover a level of characterization a thread deeper than the classic empty soulslike protagonist, so much so that we often forget that we have only borrowed someone and we get used to his presence as if we had never been anything else. Beyond the purely narrative aspect (part of the lore also passes through the memories of these men), the developers have built specific builds on them, to be strengthened from time to time by consuming Tar and Visions: therefore we find the Soldier, the Scholar, the Thief and the Crusader - fictitious names so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering them - each different not only in terms of hit points and stamina but also in terms of skills. A balance between the classes has been sought, and in our opinion, succeeded could meet the preferences of the players; above all we wanted to make them all indispensable in their own way, offering the possibility of switching in real time from one casing to another (not without risk) to diversify one's style even in the middle of a fight and, developing the character correctly , take advantage of these astral projections. The only flaw in this development system is that it has made the Crusader a war machine, with the risk of turning into the preferred choice to the detriment of others, but there are still aspects such as slowness and a low level of stamina that could make opt for another wrap. The combat system After having forgotten about levels, statistics and customization in an aesthetic sense, let's also forget about the loot: Mortal Shell offers a limited number of weapons, essentially one per warrior, and we will have to rely on those by gradually enhancing them with the objects that we will find scattered around the game world. Once again, therefore, the game deviates from the Dark Souls formula to get a little closer to that of Sekiro, putting a few but essential tools of death in our hands. We were not fully satisfied with them, having found a couple too slow and cumbersome, however it is possible to partially limit this handicap and transform them into more or less efficient companions one battle after another. As for the combat system, Mortal Shell is a hybrid between the two From titles mentioned above: it relies heavily on parries to create an opening in the enemy's guard and exploit it in our favor using the potential of the Oxidized Seal (the same which allows us to parry and counterattack) but, unlike Sekiro, revolves around stamina and zeroing all the enemies' hit points. The upgrades of the Seal are obtained by progressing with the story and can be both defensive, such as the possibility of recovering some health, and offensive, such as a timed explosion of considerable power capable of wiping out minor enemies and even stunning bosses. The use of this Seal, combined with the new petrification mechaniction to absorb the damage deriving from any type of offensive, makes the clashes interesting, above all because it is to be dosed carefully: the special attacks consume determination, which accumulates by hitting enemies but empties over time if we fail to fill a segment before to have made a clean sweep. There is therefore a certain urgency in the fights that sometimes pushes us to abandon prudence in favor of a few more hits, but objects that can restore or favor the accumulation of determination also come to our rescue. It must be said that there is no lack of enemies, indeed sometimes they are even excessive, as if to compensate for a certain flatness in the level design. An empty and tangled world If from an artistic point of view Mortal Shell stands out above all in the representation of the shells and in some particularly inspired sections, the world in which we move our steps does not involve enough to push us to explore. Starting from Fallgrim, the central hub of the game in which to practice with weapons, upgrade and buy something from the merchant, the structure develops radially but the few shortcuts present are not satisfying and are often limited to being tunnels that connect between them the different areas of Fallgrim in a rather lazy way. In short, that sense of discovery that From Software has been able to give us, except for very rare cases, is missing. The areas outside Fallgrim, which we will have to enter to recover the Sacred Glands on the orders of a mysterious creature, are divided from the hub by means of uploads and in spite of some interesting twists they suffer from the same problem. One in particular is really evocative to look at but developed in an excessively confusing and intricate way, making it difficult to find a point of reference to understand where to proceed without finding yourself going in circles and falling prey to numerous enemies. As if that weren't enough, as soon as the boss on duty is defeated and the Gland extracted, it is as if everything around us ~rots~: darkness falls, illuminated only by the dim light of our trophy, and the morphology of the level sometimes changes as it we go back trying to survive the creatures that, in some cases, have gone to replace the previous threats. In spite of these partial changes, the boredom due to backtracking makes itself felt more than it should and only a Sister Genessa in the background motivates us , illuminating our path of hope. Precisely by virtue of its more compact experience, both in terms of the breadth of the game world and the hours required to complete it, Mortal Shell could have developed a more solid level design, down to earth as they say, and marked the difference between complicated and confusing: instead, also thanks to an equally difficult lore to put together, it is an experience that thrives on ups and downs, engaging on and off but never enough to motivate exploration. Thus, the game falls into a mistake common to anyone who has tried to follow in the footsteps of Dark Souls: the problem is not in the setting or in the combat system, which, moreover, in Mortal Shell is pleasant despite some flaws, but in the fact of wanting to set up a cryptic plot at all costs without having, as mentioned, the vision of From Software. Technical glitches We encountered some small bugs during our game and a half (as in every soulslike, there is the New Game +), between commands such as dodging or sometimes the attack itself that were no longer taken leading us to a frustrating departure, or hits enemies who made polygonal interpenetration their most faithful ally. Also noteworthy are some problems with the camera and targeting, nothing new under the soulslike sun but equally annoying to come to terms with it every time. Furthermore, there are almost no collisions with the surrounding environment and if on the one hand this limitation is convenient because it allows us to rotate a two-metre broadsword inside a very narrow tunnel, on the other hand it lacks depth in the fight allowing you to exploit advantages that otherwise would not have been possible, both for us and for the enemies. Apart from this and the age-old camera problem, the other impediments have occurred very rarely, but it is all the same appropriate to report them pending the patch.", "date": "2020-08-17", "grade": "6.8"}
