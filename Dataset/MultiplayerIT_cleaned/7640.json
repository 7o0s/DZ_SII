Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. When it was released on the App Store a year and a half ago, Smash Cops offered iPhone and iPad owners an interesting take on the arcade racing genre. putting them at the wheel of a police car engaged in one of those spectacular chases that are broadcast by certain American broadcasts, which film the events from a helicopter and comment on the (sometimes tragic) developments live. Structured with widely replayable missions and an evaluation system, the game had positively impressed us while raising a number of doubts, primarily about the traditional touch control system that used a virtual analog stick. For the sequel, Smash Cops Heat, the guys from Hutch Games worked right on this juncture, implementing an original and innovative solution for managing the car, which was actually driven by pressing a single finger on the screen, moving the touch left or right to make the vehicle turn in the opposite direction, as if we were pushing it directly. So we come to Smash Bandits, the third episode of the series which introduces even more important news. In fact, the mission structure disappears in favor of an endless approach, in which the sense of progression is given by the numerous unlockable achievements and by the cars, which can be purchased and upgraded in various ways; but above all you go on the side of the bad guys, playing the role of the criminal on the run who must do as much damage as possible before crashing into a wall, avoiding being blocked by the police force and making his way through obstacles, traffic and checkpoints block. Smash Bandits confirms the quality of the Hutch Games series, with a fun and spectacular episode Crime rocks The new control system, which also allows you to play by holding the device in a vertical position, undoubtedly represents a strong point for the experience proposed by Smash Bandits. Our car can in fact be managed with precision between breakaways, grazing passages, ramming and spectacular drifts. The phases of greatest impact occur precisely when the car collides with other objects or with police cars, perhaps recalling one of the special abilities to put them out of action in a riot of explosions and bullet time. However, it is in some situations that the title of Hutch Games gives its best, or when we switch fluidly from the car to driving a motorboat (always among a thousand explosions) or when we activate the secret weapon, which is nothing more than a huge tank capable of wiping out everything that stands in front of it. The situations set up by the developers are varied and deliberately exaggerated, in stark contrast to a survival structure which by its nature cannot give that much. Then there are the freemium implications of production, which are revealed in the presence of two currencies (virtual and real) which are used not only to buy new cars and upgrades, but also to continue after game over or to remedy the excessive attention in our confrontations by law enforcement, which results in a forced pause as we become the most wanted criminals in the area. In any case, the good things offered by Smash Bandits can count on the support of an excellent sound accompaniment, made up of convincing effects, the voice of the television commentator (in English) and a signed soundtrack, and equally excellent graphics , very fluid and detailed, capable of enhancing the most important sequences.", "date": "2013-09-07", "grade": "7.8"}
