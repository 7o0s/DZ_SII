From a company that has titles of the caliber of PUBG, League of Legends and Clash of Clans in its portfolio, it is difficult to expect an experimental game that is difficult to place in the somewhat standardized panorama of large-caliber mobile titles, but the fact is that Nishan Shaman is truly a small project, which somehow found space among Tencent's mega-productions. In short, it may be hard to believe but the Chinese online multiplayer giant wanted, in this case, to put its label at the service of a particular rhythm game with a strong artistic imprint, with a somewhat refined taste and, moreover, completely and truly free. The inspiration comes from a legend of Chinese folklore, which tells the story of a shaman engaged in an attempt to recover the soul of a boy who, in spite of himself, has angered the gods following an accident. Shortly after obtaining her shamanic status, the girl is contacted by the young man's parents and immediately accepts the mission, despite the fact that it is a decidedly complex undertaking, out of a spirit of sacrifice but also to test herself with a gigantic challenge. From here begins a strange journey with almost dreamlike hues, which mixes the characteristics of the rhythm game with those of the action adventure based on narration, all represented with a style that recalls the graphic works of classical Chinese antiquity. The Magic Drum The rhythm game setting is based on the use of Nishan Shaman's magic drum, from which comes his power to fight evil spirits. With the protagonist placed in the center of the screen, surrounded by a sort of magical aura, enemies attack from the sides of the screen and the player is required to touch the corner corresponding to the direction the enemy is coming from at the precise moment they make contact with the aura of the shaman, or hold down in case of particularly long and complex spirits. This translates into a rhythmic pressure on the sides of the screen with the search for the best timing, which intersects organically with the game's soundtrack, thus providing inspiration for the gameplay and completion for the musical accompaniment, given the corresponding sound reproduction of the drum. In short, more than Guitar Hero, the models of inspiration can perhaps be found in those games with a rhythmic essence but focused on game mechanics that are not necessarily musical, such as Rez or Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Particularly present, moreover, is the narrative substratum that tells the progression of the story through numerous interlude scenes, inserting the action in a continuous flow of story that makes everything ~story-driven~. The downside, in a setting so strongly structured according to the narrative, is its necessarily having to be a compact experience: Nishan Shaman is in fact quite short, divided into five levels that can be completed in a few hours of play (about two , including any run to unlock the alternate ending). Yet, even for the fact that it is completely free and without any hidden subterfuge to extort money from users, it still represents a complete and very interesting experience, a genuine videogame storytelling project with an alternative game system, which moreover also presents itself in a beautiful art form.", "date": "2018-08-02", "grade": "8.2"}
