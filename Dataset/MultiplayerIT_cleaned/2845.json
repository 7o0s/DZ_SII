{"name": "Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forza-horizon-5-rally-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "Taking a look at the work it has done with the last three chapters of the Horizon series, it is evident that in the creation of the DLCs for its highly appreciated racing video games, Playground Games now follows a well-established modus operandi. The British studio, for almost ten years now, has had the habit of publishing two expansions during the life cycle of each new product, and these have always had the same structure, starting with the third Forza Horizon: the first usually had as protagonist a new wild and extreme setting, while the second abandoned any hint of realism to embrace adrenaline and stunts in a world inspired by the universe of toys. In any case, both were always characterized by the same constant, the desire to offer something very distant from the original material capable of offering the public a totally new racing experience. If the toy-inspired DLC archetype has already made its debut in Forza Horizon 5 with the update dedicated to the Hot Wheels brand, at the announcement of Rally Adventure we were somewhat surprised by the choice of Playground Games, because in its own premises and in defiance of all tradition, this second additional content it didn't seem to want to introduce anything that drastically different than what is basically the same DNA as the base game. A few days before the official release, we hit the chicanes of the Sierra Nueva and covered every kilometer of the DLC, eager to tell you about it in our review of Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure. Will the expansion be worth your attention? A very shy more of the same In Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure we will constantly have the support of a co-pilot, who is however on a helicopter following the race track Having archived the most colorful and imaginative part of the season pass, or rather the one that last July had catapulted us to the splendid flying island of Hot Wheels, it was more than reasonable that the new DLC of Forza Horizon 5 slowly got back on track, proposing a theme much more realistic. Despite this, we were absolutely convinced that we could find ourselves in front of an additional content that was still capable of distorting the classic Horizon formula, as indeed Blizzard Mountain and Fortune Island had done thanks to the introduction of adverse climatic phenomena and extreme driving conditions .In reality, it only takes a few minutes to grapple with Rally Adventure to realize how the new expansion does nothing but offer a shy more of the same experience of the original, mainly due to the strong similarity between the new region protagonist of the DLC and the map of Mexico. Sierra Nueva, the scenery that makes its debut with Rally Adventure, is a wonderful digital fresco of the characteristic canyons of the Mexican hinterland and is simply stunning in its beauty, yet offers largely the same, identical panoramas already admired in the past, reiterating without any novelty that same cross-section of biomes that we had been able to praise in the review of Forza Horizon 5. The new region is crossed by sandy deserts, wide plains, mountain reliefs and a luxuriant jungle of palm trees, and if this variety is enough to make the more than thirty races that we are going to run in the DLC are always different, the feeling of real novelty that we had experienced while whizzing along the Hot Wheels tracks of the last expansion is constantly missing. Countryside A new course in Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure Also with regard to the new campaign at the center of Rally Adventure, it must be said that it follows exactly that structure typical of the other DLCs made in the Playground, even if we must admit that we did not have particular expectations in the matter given that this design has always worked anyway in the past. Curiously, the game takes up the same characters encountered during the main story, but here it puts them in command of three distinct rally teams, each oriented towards a particular category of competition. The Horizon Raptors, ridden by Alex, are mainly involved in mixed surface racing with large sections of gravel while the Apex Predators, led by Alejandra, specialize in very fast road rallies. Finally, Ramiro is the leader of the Grit Reapers, a group that combines the racing disciplines of the other two formations, but which competes exclusively at night and in bad weather. The goal, once again, is to complete the events organized by the three teams by accumulating experience, and climbing the reputation degrees that each group has filled with very rich prizes, such as customizations for their driver and as many as 10 new vehiclesmint eggs. As already anticipated, this progression structure works and generally provides excellent sensations, even if it still plans to face all that long series of activities which here, as in Hot Wheels, follow the exact same script of the basic experience, remaining glued to the classic division between warning signs, speed detectors and skid zones that we know very well by now. Despite the strong impression of monotony, the first hour of the game also flows in a sincerely exalted way, net of a panorama that is now all too familiar: being behind the wheel of the legendary 2001 Ford Focus #4 driven by Colin McRae while the co-driver screams in your ears the next bends to come is an experience we've never experienced in a Forza, and although the wonder doesn't last long, for rally fanatics an incipit of this caliber could be enough to justify the price of the admission ticket. Unfortunately, for everyone else, the expansion struggles to remain sufficiently enveloping for the approximately 10 hours it takes to complete it, mainly due to some design choices that, we realize, were absolutely inevitable. A new racing formula The desert sections of Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure lend themselves perfectly to buggies The peculiarity that separates the rally from the other specialties of the world of motors is that here, basically, one has always raced alone. On the track, except in rare exceptions, there are never other cars and as it was legitimate to expect from a DLC dedicated to this discipline, Playground Games has tried to reproduce the authentic rallying experience as faithfully as possible, paying no attention to any compromises . Even if it is always possible to carry out all the races in the classic format, all the DLC revolves around a new racing formula, which involves racing alone and beating the opponents' time, rather than physically overtaking them on the track. This aspect , combined with the repetitiveness of the campaign design and the great familiarity offered by Sierra Nueva, makes Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure an all too bland DLC, which by its very nature keeps the player glued to the wheel of fundamentally less responsive and fast vehicles, long endless rounds of time trials against opponents that aren't even tangible. We repeat, the execution of the study could hardly achieve better results than this (even if a campaign with more novelties would have been invaluable), while the original sin of Rally Adventure is to be found in the very heart of the expansion, totally inconceivable due to its triviality if we look at the history of the works of Playground Games. What's left? Just a couple more small innovations, such as the new ~launch control~ mechanics useful for performing perfect starts and a new spare part for vehicles equipped with a turbocharger, the anti-latency, which allows you to hurl real flames from the exhaust pipes. Both, unfortunately, are not enough to make the expansion less forgettable.", "date": "2023-03-29", "grade": null}
