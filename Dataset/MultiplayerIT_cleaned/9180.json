{"name": "Transformers 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90876-transformers-3-il-lato-oscuro-della-luna.html", "text": "There is no escaping the tie-in law, and although the latest videogame productions dedicated to Transformers have made many skeptics of licensed titles change their minds (we are referring, of course, to The Battle for Cybertron), the risk of being faced with games made just to ride the wave of popularity is always lurking. In the case of Transformers 3 for iPhone, we can say that the truth lies somewhere in between: on the one hand, the EA Mobile product introduces the important factor of freedom of action, with the characters being able to switch from robot to that of vehicle (or to the stealth set-up), and a touch control system which in many situations proves to be well implemented; on the other hand it remains bound to a highly repetitive action, which finds an element of progression only in the alternation of increasingly stronger enemies. The protagonists of this tie-in are Optimus Prime, leader of the Autobots, and his faithful lieutenant Bumblebee, engaged in a mission aimed at foiling a new assault on Earth by the Decepticons. We can get behind the wheel of one of the two characters depending on the stage, in a story mode consisting of thirteen levels and characterized by the presence of five boss fights. As already mentioned, Optimus and Bumblebee can transform at will and therefore fight the numerous opponents in their path using speed, firepower and brute force. The variations on the theme, inserted to break the monotony of the fights, however, see us necessarily assume the form of a vehicle and overcome a sort of timed race unscathed, complete with checkpoints and game overs in case you are unable to reach the goal with seconds available. For a handful of energon After a short tutorial aimed at making us familiar with the controls, the game follows the plot of the film of the same name in brief, interspersing each level with short cutscenes. Beyond the obligatory driving sessions, Transformers 3's gameplay is mostly made up of fights: the ranks of Decepticons seem full of expendable units, which are thrown at us in considerable numbers, at least until we get to the boss fight on duty. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee can shoot using two different weapons, perform a powerful melee combo and finally resort to two possible variants of the special attack: if the relative bar is only partially full, an energy wave can be launched towards a enemy; if it is completely full, with a slide of the finger we can enter ~lock-on~ mode, lock onto a certain number of targets and then destroy them with homing missiles. The ~bullet time~ effect that is activated in this situation is very nice and recalls some of the most spectacular scenes of the films directed by Michael Bay and dedicated to the Transformers. By collecting energon along the way it is possible to buy new weapons, improve those in our possession and enhance the character in its main characteristics, so as to make it, for example, more resistant to attacks or more incisive in close combat. Operations that must be resorted to, given the fair level of challenge present (finally!). The game control system relies on two virtual analog sticks and therefore takes up the tradition of top-down shooters, but when we have an opponent nearby we can press the right stick (without therefore holding it ~tilted~) to resort to the attack physicist. A brilliant solution, which however in the most chaotic situations is sometimes ~enchanted~, putting us in a bit of difficulty. The transformation into a vehicle is carried out by pressing an additional button on the touch screen, and in this configuration unfortunately the controls leave something to be desired, given that everything must be done with the left virtual stick. The technical realization of Transformers 3 moves between ups and downs: the polygonal count is good, with rather detailed models and with a decent set of animations, while the scenarios range from good to bad, especially during the ~timed races~ at which we have mentioned previously, so much so that it is often not clear which way to go. Overall, though, the production looks well-curated compared to the average App Store game. The tested version is 1.0.0 Price: 2.39 App Store links", "date": "2011-07-12", "grade": "6.5"}
