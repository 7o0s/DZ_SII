Let's make things clear right away: the game in question adheres perfectly to the now granite canon of this sub-genre, without attempting anything new and indeed taking perhaps the most greedy drift possible on the front of micro-transactions, but if nothing else it can count on a truly particular characterization, capable of giving the whole a very strong identity. It is not enough to shake off all the potentially negative elements that are naturally inherent in this type of game, which has long since saturated the mobile market, but it can be fundamental in a totally monolithic panorama also from a graphic and stylistic point of view, therefore it is a game that can be very interesting for all those who, despite everything, still want RPG gacha. Setting and story perhaps owe something to Shin Megami Tensei, Persona or even The World Ends with You, making due proportions: also in this case, the general peculiarity derives from the contrast between characters and scenarios that recall contemporary (or partially futuristic) reality ) and supernatural and metaphysical elements such as deities and ancient mythologies, which somehow blend together. Those who seem normal boys then become reincarnations of ancient gods and mythological beings, against the backdrop of an otherworldly threat that hangs over the world like a new sort of ragnarok to the sound of pop music and sparkling lights. This mixture of K-Pop, ultra-fashionable characters, classic mythologies and hip hop certainly remains impressed and is already enough to make Dislyte emerge from the mass of similar games, focusing strongly on one of the elements that are fundamental for the success of this type of titles, or the charisma of the cast and the setting. Unlike the Atlus games, to which this title seems to look with some interest, unfortunately the narration does not quite live up to the care placed in the graphic style: despite the premise of people municipalities that suddenly find themselves in contact with shocking powers and ~proto-miracles~ always have good potential, the story is rather confused and not very rhythmic, with dialogues that alternate some brilliant moments and a general flatness. Myths, gods and discos Dislyte, some screenshots of the game Dislyte does a really good job of trying to give every aspect of the game its own character, the problem is that beneath the glittering surface lie precisely the same menus and settings as any other mobile RPG with gacha features. So the map becomes a large urban setting that takes us between downtown streets in modern megacities and trendy clubs, but you can't escape the usual progression of quests consisting of three battles in sequence and a possible final boss. The combat system is turn-based and is based on the use of special abilities (three equipped for each character, each with cooldowns related to the amount of turns required for recharging) and elemental characteristics that have strengths or weaknesses against specific enemies . As often happens, this system is not based so much on a strategic elaboration of the fight but rather on mathematics: the more the characters are advanced with the level of experience and with the progression of the equipment, the stronger they are, therefore the solution to every problem it's still the good old grinding to increase the levels, even if for most of the time the difficulty level remains quite low. This tendency to level up is also favored by some design choices, such as the possibility of automatically repeating some battles and carrying them forward in the background, in addition to the classic option to automate the clashes and thus save some time, with the consequence, however, of canceling basically the gameplay. Progression and gacha Dislyte, more scenes from the game The progression of the characters is another key element of this type of game and obviously it is not lacking in Dislyte, which offers a system of relics to be equipped to give power-ups and abilities to the characters, as well as upgrades between level increases and more substantial ascensions, all obviously linked to in-game currencies to be conquered by playing but above all to buy with micro-transactions, which also come into play due to the consumable energy to be invested to take part in the missions. Balancing the numerous rewards a bit and perhaps not being too behind PvP, which is obviousAlthough this is the most selective mode, it is still possible not necessarily to resort to in-app purchases to advance, even if this takes much longer. Even the gacha system is not exactly the most generous: the rarest fighters, i.e. those of level 5, they can only be obtained with a minimal percentage of chance (between 1 and 3%, based on what has been detected) which makes their collection outside of bundles and pre-set packages to purchase extremely difficult. The difference in power and evolution with lower level characters is remarkable and it emerges with particular clarity in the case of PvP. However, it must be said that the graphic style adopted by Lilith Games makes each esper (as fighters are called in this world) truly charismatic, which makes even the collection of less rare characters pleasant, furthermore the different specializations and elements force you to a rather frequent rotation of the party consisting of 5 espers.", "date": "2022-05-21", "grade": "6.5"}
