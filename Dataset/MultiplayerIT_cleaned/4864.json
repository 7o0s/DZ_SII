Fortunately there are also cases in which the DLCs are real expansions that change, when not revolutionize, many aspects. This is the case of Crusade, an expansion for Stardock's strategic 4x Galactic Civilization III, which not only adds content galore, but which also corrects all the most problematic aspects reported by players over the years. In fact, given the time that has passed since the launch of Galactic Civilization III, which took place in May 2015, Stardock could have easily passed Crusade as a real sequel, but this was not the case. Probably the intent was not only to sell a new game, but also to perfect the basic title by giving it that breathing space that it was missing a bit and that Mercenaries, the first expansion, and all the other DLCs already available, had failed to give him. Do you think that the changes are so profound that you don't even miss a new single player campaign, since completely new things are done even in those that already exist. We have reviewed Crusade, an outstanding expansion for Galactic Civilization III Interface and customization As soon as you start Galactic Civilization III, obviously with the Crusade expansion installed, you immediately notice the complete revision of the game interface, now much more practical and functional, as well as rational in appearance. A lot of work has been done to improve the game interface Now it is much easier to get information on research, on citizens, on espionage, on the economy and so on. In short, the criticisms received by the original interface have been fully received by Stardock, who has done everything to meet the requests of the players, completely revolutionizing the setting he had given it. The design itself of the various information panels has been improved, both in appearance and in positioning, so as to make the main window, the graphic one, gain more space, despite the additions. At first glance, you will also notice the new civilization customization options, which allow you to better define their behaviors and appearance. If you want, there's also the option to make your own starships and complete factions, or you can go to the Steam Workshop and download the community's works, which add a little more variety to the whole thing (there are some custom starships that are really excellent ). The possibilities from this point of view are truly unlimited. Do you think that it is also possible to mix existing factions and create a very wide variety of hybrids. Also present are three new factions: the Slyne, the Onyx and the Terran Resistance. The first is formed by gelatinous creatures who love technology, the second by beings who have focused their technological development on rocks and the third, coming from Galactic Civilization II, formed by humans. Citizen Kane As we mentioned, the changes brought to Galactic Civilization III by Crusade are very profound and go beyond the cosmetic aspects. If the interface and the new factions give an extra touch to the game, the new approaches to star colonization are the real core of the whole experience. Each planet now has additional features that define it better and add a new layer of strategy to our moves. The beloved land There are planets that are excellent for life, but poor in raw materials, and others from which to extract precious resources, but on which it is difficult to establish a real colony due to lack of food and water (think of a completely rocky planet). To help in the planetary expansion the ~Citizen~ system comes in handy: every ten turns you get a unit of citizens that can be used in various ways, such as for example to strengthen the central government (the effects change depending on the unit), or to improve production on a certain planet, or even to improve general research, or that of a single planet. Citizen units come in many varieties: there are scientists, workers, bureaucrats, and others, each capable of giving advantages in its areas of expertise, advantages that increase with promotions. With time and research, advanced units are also unlocked, the generals and peasants, which provide military and food production bonuses, respectively. However, the new unit with the most implications in terms of gameplay is that of spies, which has a dedicated options screen. Initially espionage seems to be an additionamong the many, but we soon realize that it is much more, given that, if well exploited, it allows you to obtain great advantages over your opponents. For example, it can be used to slow down the production of a certain planet, or to know in advance where we will be attacked or what our most dangerous opponent is building. In particular in the advanced stages of the game it is essential to have a good network of spies, in order to be able to undermine the points of power of the enemies, such as for example the rich trade routes, without necessarily having to deploy the army. Unfortunately, all these innovations lead to balancing problems, especially when playing in single player (not in multiplayer, unless there are some cheaters). For example, it is clear that the CPU is equipped by default with a large number of extra resources, so that it cannot be overwhelmed too quickly. The imbalances become particularly evident when it comes to fighting, both in space and on planets, where enemy forces always seem to be overwhelming, even when outnumbered. Of course, this is probably the price to pay for all the new features that have been introduced. However, the judgment on Crusade is not penalized too much, even if it is impossible not to take it into account. For the rest we reiterate that Galactic Civilization III with Crusade is a better game, indeed, much better, than what Galactic Civilization III without Crusade was and is. This alone should make you understand why we recommend this expansion without reservations.", "date": "2017-05-21", "grade": "8.8"}
