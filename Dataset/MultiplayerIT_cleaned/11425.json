One of the most important things is to understand what types of monsters you are dealing with and organize ad hoc defenses, choosing the location of each turret with speed and common sense. Strategy and planning are key. The resources made available to us to keep the menacing invaders away are essentially three: trees, coins and gems. With trees you can build defensive turrets, the construction of which will be paid for with solid coins, while gems guarantee upgrades and technological research in order to then be able to create more advanced turrets (some even shoot laser beams). Of course, you also have the option of destroying a tower and recovering spent coins and gems. At the end of each wave of enemies, the infamous ~end-of-level bosses~ make their appearance, which will give much more trouble than their miserable henchmen. Defending the village from these monstrous titans will be difficult, but quite rewarding if the defensive canvas has been organized in the best possible way. You are NOT welcome The controls are rather simplified and easy to learn even for the more ~casual~ players. In essence, it will be enough to move with the left stick and interact with X to perform an action / confirm and circle to cancel. Pleasant both graphics and sound, absolutely consistent with the type of game. Wanting to look for flaws, PixelJunk Monsters simplifies the original concept of Desktop Tower Defense but cannot boast its full thickness, due to a series of limitations that purists may not welcome. First of all, being able to build turrets only on trees, even if on the one hand it forces you to make wiser and more planned choices, limits the freedom and tacticity that were one of the strengths on the original title. The slowness in developing the turrets, making us dance the gouge in front of us, is also sometimes frustrating, as well as the loss of coins and gems if you accidentally bump into a monster during the necessary movements. However, none of this manages to detract from a game that in some way represents a real, very welcome novelty on consoles. Final comment PixelJunk Monsters is a fresh game, extremely nice, which stimulates brain activity and manages to be quite rewarding. A very apt mix between puzzle and strategic, which will keep you busy for a long time guaranteeing a good level of challenge. Unreservedly recommended to all. Pros Fun and challenging One of the best ideas of 2007 Cons Some restrictions on the original concept PixelJunk Monsters is available to download on PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3.
