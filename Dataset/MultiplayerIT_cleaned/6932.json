Lethal League takes only three, not an absolute record but a limited number for a fighting game that tries to take some typical mechanics of the genre and mix them with original or at least not so inflated ideas. The game has been in virtual shops for a few days but already a couple of months ago, during the EVO 2014 competition, it had managed to show off and become a small case among fans. Not a small result in a panorama, that of indie fighting games, which is very complex: in fact, the genre thrives on refined balances and mechanics, requires great knowledge and, especially when resources are not unlimited, a certain sensitivity to achieve an acceptable balance. To overcome some of these problems, Team Reptile has chosen not to create a too technical title, rather aiming for a middle ground between immediate fun and depth. A bet that today can be said to have won. Lethal League is a fun middle ground between immediacy and depth On the fly! Unlike what happens in your favorite fighting game, in Lethal League you don't hit your opponents with punches, kicks and weapons. The only way to knock out the pretenders to win the match is to intercept them with a ball that is exchanged with a baseball bat, hammer or skateboard deck, depending on the character. Each knockdown coincides with the loss of a notch of the bar that makes up life, the complete emptying of which decrees the winner and loser. If desired, this logic can be reversed, assigning a score to be achieved, but the substance is almost the same. A well-aimed blow to the ball and it will pick up more and more speed, gradually increasing its inertia until the exchanges become prodigious and spectacular challenges for those who can boast the best reflexes but also the steadiest nerves. By tilting the left stick while hitting, if you play with the highly recommended pad, you can in fact change the trajectory of the ball so as to make life more difficult for those who, in the blink of an eye, have to understand where and from which direction they will have to intercept it, turn to the right side and get ready to press one of the two keys that manage interactions with the object. In fact, in Lethal League we are not limited to hitting as hard as possible, given that a second button is responsible for slowing down the ball by making it bounce gently in front of our eyes, without however losing the inertia accumulated up to that point. This means that, if one is good enough, in the most agitated situations a good player is able to slow down the action and decide with the correct timing in which direction to take the next shot. The result is moments of pure madness followed by a few seconds of stillness, before the tussle breaks loose again. All supported by reactive and sensitive controls. Barring sensational cases, each round lasts from a few seconds to less than a minute, so you always have the opportunity to start over and try to get back on track after a mistake. Each of the five inserted characters differs from the others, as well as aesthetically, for two fundamental elements: the jump and the special ability. The first, depending on the fighter, provides for a double leap, that one can push against the walls or cling to them, to give three examples. The second is obtained after five successful swings and ranges from lightning-fast power shots to others that go through walls to reappear on the other side of the level. Objectively, five characters aren't many and in the long run this could represent a limit, but more should arrive in the future through free updates, so there's just a bit of patience. A complete offer? Less than twelve euros is not a lot for a quality title like Lethal League, also considering that two and four-copy packages are available on Steam that allow you to save some money. Since it was born as a flash game, however, it is legitimate for those who have already known the project for some time to ask for a certain variety and quality of content in order to consider purchasing it. Team Reptile has done a really good job from a graphic point of view, maintaining the original two-dimensional style but enriching it with a large amount of well-designed and spectacular sprites to observe in motion. Even the levels, which do not have interactive elements, are enriched with effects as the ball reaches ever more extreme speed. The modes are rather limited, especially if you don't consider playing with one or more friends. The single player, if we want to call it that, is limitedin fact to the classic games against artificial intelligence and a series of challenges to be completed in sequence. The multiplayer, the real outlet of Lethal League, allows you to challenge each other in a very tight one-on-one but also to take four to the battlefield and face each other in a free for all or in teams. Locally, perhaps sitting on the sofa at home, this atypical fighting game obviously gives its best but it must be said that the net code, managed through the well-tested GGPO (Good Game, Peace Out) code, which also allows you to choose whether to increase the number of frames losing something in the responsiveness of the controls, it performs very well. Finally, a special mention for the ~chip hop~ music, really successful and well blended with the visual style.", "date": "2014-09-04", "grade": "8.5"}
