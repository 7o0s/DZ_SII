They made a mobile game, Death Rally, and afflicted millions of fans around the world. Alan Wake was supposed to be a free roam of horror, a thriller like you've never seen before, and after years of development under the umbrella of Microsoft and abandoning the PC version, it came out a good game that tried to do things, some well and some not so well, still managing to leave a mark, especially since it was distributed in digital delivery. That of 2012 has turned into Alan's winter queue since, together with the much desired Personal Computer version of the first chapter, the team led by Sam Lake has also managed to churn out an unpublished episode: Alan Wake's American Nightmare via Xbox Live . As had already happened for the DLC released on Xbox 360 following the first episode, here too Remedy experiments with a formula full of potential with a couple of gimmicks which, if maintained and cultivated in the real sequel, can give life to an excellent game . Here they serve to pass some time, having fun with a certainly successful character, in a world full of charm and shadows. Xbox 360 goals Alan Wake's American Nightmare's 200 points, divided into 12 achievements, are easily obtainable with a little perseverance. It's about finishing the game, collecting all the manuscripts (we only missed one on the first pass) and playing the Arcade mode. In short, it is not an unlikely undertaking Night Spring Alan Wake's American Nightmare has no real time location. Alan is always locked up in the dark reality in which he has been trapped and wanders in search of his wife. This time, however, the entity makes fun of him by pitting him against Mr Graffio (the game is completely subtitled in Italian with the original audio in English), his evil alter ego, who ravages a desert area in Arizona, trying to place all the blame on him, in what is an episode of a TV serial, Night Springs, which Alan collaborated on before becoming a famous writer. The action has remained the same as always, with the combat system that still shows no signs of getting old, all centered on the clashes that pit the writer against human beings possessed by darkness, which must first be dissolved with flashlights and then eliminated with firearms . When opponents get too close, an escape route can be obtained by pulling the left-up trigger, with the camera enhancing the aggression and slowing down the speed creating spectacular, high-tension sequences. Everything is accentuated by the proprietary polygonal engine which continues to have one of the best dynamic lighting systems used in this generation of hardware and which is enhanced when throwing flares and flashbang. The vast explorable areas of the first episode are replaced here by three not very large settings in which to fight and collect the texts of the novel that Alan must modify to get to the bottom of his nemesis. The pages, which previously served only to know the details of the plot and the moods of the protagonists, here also come in handy to flesh out the protagonist's arsenal. In fact, the weapons, in addition to being found by exploring the seabed, are found in a series of trunks that are opened by collecting the required number of missing sheets, thus giving a more complete sense to what was previously a collection reserved only for thrill hunters literature or objectives. If, on the one hand, the opportunities for interaction with non-player characters disappear almost completely - there is one for each of the three zones - the solution required to proceed within the game is very interesting, i.e. to solve a couple of environmental puzzles referring to what was written by the protagonist. This is little more than an intuition that hopefully will have a sequel and which here does not distract from the more action part of the gameplay, which reigns supreme and which may not convince those who fondly remember the exploratory and sicker sections of the first chapter . Curiosity Another strong point of Alan Wake is the soundtrack. Even Alan Wake's American Nightmare is no exception with a decidedly above average audio commentary between excellent music and sound effects. There is no shortage of author pearls such as a song by Kasabian (don't you know them? Shame!) and an English singer-songwriter who is not well known in Italy: Ed Harcourt. His is the closing piece of the game, Watching the sun come up, which we advise you to listen carefully. Maybe after you've finished it, so as not to spoil the surprise... In Alan Wake's American Nightmare spara, shoot and have fun for about four / five hours of play, getting lost in collecting more pages and enjoying all the dialogues between the protagonists, however well characterized. The engine, as mentioned, has aged quite well and, even if there are some too many lineups and even if the character models don't boast the textures of the DVD chapter, the complex is still current and worthy of admiration, especially in the never too vaunted lighting system. The story doesn't live up to the previous one, but it's still taken care of and with a turn towards ~live~ recited sequences that always give the sign of a team that wants to stand out, especially moving into the field of digital delivery. Of course, the limitation given by the weight of the download, less than two gigabytes, reverberates on only three locations, through which it is necessary to pass 3 times, called to repeat the same sequence of events as in a horror version of ~Groundhog Day boss~, a comic masterpiece with Bill Murray from 1993. This sequence of events is justified on a narrative level and will not in the least affect the enthusiasm of those who let themselves be captured by the story and by what happens, but it will certainly turn up their noses expected something more like the first chapter. Once the game is over, the excellent arcade mode comes in handy, a sort of Horde to play alone in which to survive by accumulating bonuses (every dodge and every kill raises a points multiplier, which then decreases over time and resets when being hit) and sipping weapons and energy refreshment points, i.e. those lampposts that protect our hero, but which go out once used. Just the shortage of weapons, the crates to open with the pages that come in handy here too by linking the story to this mode, and the good conformation of the maps give the title that pinch of strategy and anxiety capable of involving the player properly . At the end of each map a score and an evaluation is assigned, depending on what has been done and, if you have survived until dawn, you can access the next setting. In short, a nice corollary for a game that is undoubtedly worth what it costs.", "date": "2012-02-24", "grade": "8.2"}
