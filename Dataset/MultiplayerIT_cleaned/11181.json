{"name": "L'Incredibile Hulk - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lincredibile-hulk-recensione.html", "text": "Minigames for all tastes As the map of Manhattan fills up with new missions, numerous minigames of various types will also be unlocked. In some of them we will have to complete paths marked by checkpoints, moving quickly from one circle to another; in others we will have to destroy as much of the city as possible in a limited time, or improvise a darts competition by throwing lampposts at a building. There is also a minigame that pays homage to one of the SEGA classics, Crazy Taxi: Hulk will have to grab certain taxis and take each one to its destination, with a different color for the target depending on the distance it is. The variety and number of these optional short missions are a major contributor to the game's longevity. From movie to game The similarities with the Iron Man tie-in continue as regards the creation of the introductory phase, which in both titles is rather traumatic and ~badly disposes~ the player towards what will be the real game structure, usable immediately afterwards. It is probably a duty to pay towards the history of the film, which somehow needed to be retraced, and which in this case reproduces the sequence of the escape from the factory in Brazil after the attack by the team led by Blonsky. The developers have set this phase as a sort of tutorial, but in fact you find yourself fighting in a very restricted environment, which highlights all the defects that afflict the gameplay when it comes to fighting with simple soldiers, too ~slippery~ for the green giant, who has to work harder than the lawful to catch them. Once the action moves to Manhattan, things change drastically and you can become familiar with the true essence of the SEGA product, whose structure is not organized by internships but by missions. New ~points of interest~ gradually appear on the map, which can simply be characteristic buildings of the city (reproduced quite well on the screen), to be destroyed for pure entertainment, but also and above all missions of various importance and typology: next to those that carry on the ~main~ plot, with the characters present in the film, we will find numerous ~alternative~ and parallel ones, which see the involvement of Rick Jones, of the Enclave, of Dr. Samuel Sterns (who helps Bruce Banner in the search for a cure for his evil, but which then should become the fearsome ~Capo~, one of the most important nemeses in the Hulk comics) and the U-Foes. We will have the option to accept the missions in the order we prefer, just reach the starting points on the map. Among the most important features of this new video game dedicated to the green goliath, there are certainly freedom of movement and interactivity with the environment. Hulk smashes! Among the most important features of this new video game dedicated to the green goliath, there are certainly freedom of movement and interactivity with the environment. We will be able to move around Manhattan as we see fit, running (and automatically generating a shock wave that sweeps away the trees, people and vehicles that are in our way), jumping and climbing any building. The control system meets our needs in the best way, offering us an excellent organization of the commands: the back buttons are used to run, lock onto a target and parry attacks, the left analog stick allows us to move the character while the right adjust the view, finally with the main buttons of the Dual Shock 3 you execute the attacks (two, which when mixed give rise to different devastating combos), you grab things (whether they are people, objects, vehicles, enemies or the walls of a building) and we jump, with a loading system that allows us to make higher and higher leaps, literally ~bouncing~ with each landing. As mentioned, the Hulk can climb any building (by planting his fingers in the walls and lunging upwards faster and faster) and jump from roof to roof, an action that is useful for escaping any enemies when you are low on energy or to slip away when the city alarm level is high. In fact, if we destroy too many things, an indicator on the screen will trigger the civil protection alarm and we will see the army vehicles arrive, which will engage us in virtually infinite clashes, from which we can only escape by moving quickly or by accessing a mission on the map . All this freedom of movement goes hand in hand with an exceptional level of interactivity. We will be able to destroy everything we see on the screen, practically without exception: the walls of the buildings break under our blows, which can leadthe collapse of entire buildings; we can destroy or grab any vehicle in our path, using it as a weapon against armored vehicles or very resistant enemies (you can also break a car in two and make big ~knuckles~, as happens in the film); our jumps make cracks in the ground or cause the destruction of causeways, and so on. Hulk acquires new abilities and powers as he completes missions, increasing his repertoire of special moves and accessing a regeneration system that restores his energy instantly (normally recovery is quite slow, often requiring a momentary escape from battles ). These special actions can be performed by spending so-called ~rage points~, which are obtained by simply destroying things. Likewise, devastating the city will fill our rage bar, boosting the character to the maximum and making his attacks more effective. Technical realization The Incredible Hulk is one of those titles that may not surprise you for the quality of the graphics, for the style or for the technical solutions adopted, at least compared to the best exponents of the action genre, but it makes up for it with quantity. And from this point of view, the developers of Edge of Reality have done an extraordinary job: we have the entire island of Manhattan at our disposal, with an accurate reproduction of its characteristic buildings but above all with an incredible level of interactivity. The streets are heavily populated, both by pedestrians and vehicles, with a good variety and a good level of detail. The Hulk himself is very well done, with a polygonal model extremely similar to that of the film, with a good set of animations. As previously written, we will find ourselves facing army troops, the Enclave and some super-villains: the level of variety of the opponents is good, with five or six basic units (including vehicles and characters) to which special ones are added . On the negative side, the graphics engine is solid in most cases but succumbs to some slowdowns when things get extremely busy, while the workload in rooftop shots is lightened by applying a 'haze effect' on distant buildings. Unfortunately there are quite a few ~pop-ups~, perhaps depending on the speed of access to the PlayStation 3 disk: the loading times of each mission, however, are quite short. There are certainly some things done worse than others: the collapse of the buildings is rendered too simplistically (in practice they are ~swallowed~ by the road, then leaving rubble that can be further destroyed but with a ~predetermined~ appearance), the construction of ships from The Enclave's flying warfare leaves a lot to be desired and even the giant robots aren't as spectacular as one would have expected. The sound sector boasts good music and effects, accompanied by an excellent dubbing in Italian for the interlude scenes. The Wii version As a good multiplatform title, The Incredible Hulk could not ignore the best-selling Nintendo console, and is proposed on Wii with a version that does not differ in structure compared to what was seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Unfortunately, the limits of this choice are of order technical, with the usual non-optimized graphics engine that returns results largely within the reach of a PlayStation 2. In truth, it seems that on the Wii the game is set in London rather than Manhattan, given the enormous amount of ~fog~ that surrounds us prevents you from seeing the buildings already at a short distance, with serious repercussions also on the gameplay: if we are on the roof of a building and we cannot see the other buildings, it becomes impossible to move ~in leaps~ like on PS3. It is precisely the strengths of the game that are penalized by this situation: the streets are almost deserted and it becomes difficult even to find a car to smash the head of the enemy on duty; furthermore, interactivity is severely limited, with the Hulk's actions falling far short of producing the spectacular visual results of nextgen consoles - limited to a few predetermined ~cracks~. We don't know why, but even navigating the city map has become more complicated, since you can't set goals to reach. A Hulk fan who only owns the Wii could also overlook these defects, given that the basic structure is still solid and full-bodied ... too bad a bad job has been done also and above all with the control system. The developers stuck with the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination, adopting cumbersome solutions for the controls without allowing the alternative use of the Classic Controller or the GameCube joypad. This translates in combat phases at the limit of the bearable, with the view that must be moved using the pointing of the controller (where the simple d-pad would have been preferable) and the actions badly distributed between the buttons of the two devices. SCORE: 5.8 Comment After the controversial Iron Man tie-in, which offered very interesting ideas (above all the flight system) together with technical and structural limitations of no small importance, SEGA presents itself with a much better product, which in its versions for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 gives us an exceptional freedom of movement and degree of interactivity. The Incredible Hulk is a game that fans of the Marvel character will surely like, with rich graphics especially in terms of quantity and a solid structure, which guarantees a certain longevity between main and secondary missions, drawing liberally from the comic adventures of the green goliath rather than from the film with Edward Norton as regards enemies and situations. It is certainly not a product without flaws: the combat system is sometimes confusing, there is a lot of ~pop-ups~ and the management of the view and ~targeting~ makes you sweat... but the result final is definitely above expectations. If the idea of destroying an entire city, with everything in it, appeals to you, this is the game for you. Pros Completely destructible environment A large number of missions and minigames Probably the best Hulk game to date Cons Quite a pronounced ~pop-up~ effect Somewhat confusing combat system Understated online multiplayer", "date": "2008-09-22", "grade": null}
