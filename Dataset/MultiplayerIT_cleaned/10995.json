{"name": "FlatOut", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flatout_a.html", "text": "Created by Bugbear Entertainment under the aegis of Empire Interactive, the FlatOut series has for years been synonymous with spectacular racing, to the limit of the possible, in which accidents and collisions are a central element in the gameplay. The first two episodes, released for PC and console, were published between 2004 and 2006, while the rest is recent history: whoever has had the opportunity to try FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage or FlatOut: Head On (the PSP conversion of the same game) knows that the levels reached are absolutely extraordinary from a technical point of view, with the cars damaging each other and challenging each other in completely interactive scenarios. How could the action of FlatOut be translated into a mobile game? Xendex has certainly chosen the most difficult path: rather than transforming everything into an anonymous two-dimensional racer, it has played the polygonal graphics card and has tried in every way to reproduce the characteristic elements of the series on Java-compatible devices. The only available mode sees us face three different leagues (~bronze test~, ~silver test~, ~gold test~) in sequence, each made up of a good number of single events. The structure is ~with prizes~, that is, you have to finish the race in first or second place to unlock the next one, and in the case of FlatOut you gradually find yourself competing on terrains and with profoundly different vehicles. It was not possible for the developers to create interactive locations, so in the game you have to look for the collision with the opponents to fill the boost bar: at that point, you can press the 5 key for our vehicle to splash forward for a limited period of time. Each circuit must be covered three times before crossing the finish line, and during these laps you have to play it all, cutting corners when possible and looking for the best line to gain a few tenths. The opponents are quite combative and their skill grows as you go along, so it is better to prepare for very intense sessions. As far as the control system is concerned, Xendex has fortunately opted for automatic acceleration, so we'll only have to worry about steering (via the d-pad) and keeping up with the other drivers in the race. The response to the inputs is prompt and precise, so we will be able to control the car without problems. As mentioned above, this mobile reduction of FlatOut comes with polygonal graphics that are not extraordinary in terms of style, but technically quite complex: so many polygons move on the screen, the use of textures is good and the locations always appear rather rich in elements , never bare. Furthermore, collisions between competing cars generate sparks with an interesting particle effect. All this, of course, is paid for with much higher than average minimum requirements: tested on a Nokia 6120 Classic, the game unfortunately fails to maintain a decent frame rate, traveling at 10 fps or even less. Beyond the discourse concerning fluidity, it must be said that the scenarios show a heavy pop-up effect, which it would have been appropriate to mask in some way but which instead shows itself in all its sadness. Finally, the sound is undoubtedly mediocre. PRO A large number of races Quite challenging complex graphics...
