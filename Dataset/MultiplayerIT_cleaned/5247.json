{"name": "Il potere delle ombre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174926-aragami-il-potere-delle-ombre.html", "text": "Contaminations of the stealth genre are quite common, but elusive techniques and outflanking enemies are rarely the only tools useful for completing missions. In various cases the player has the possibility to decide how to behave, opting for the silent approach or for attacks with drawn weapons. All this is mostly detached from the universe of Aragami, an interesting third-person stealth action that draws inspiration from some great classics of the genre. The original concept was born from the collaboration of five students from the Pompeu Fabra University of Barcelona, one of the most prestigious universities in the Iberian Peninsula. The academic version is titled ~Path of Shadows~ and is available for free download via the official website. After receiving various awards, the original team decided to continue on the path of independent development by founding the Lince Works studio. Aragami was put in the pipeline precisely with the aim of deepening and expanding the mechanics already explored in the previous experimentation, resorting to sources of inspiration ranging from Tenchu to Dishonored, while on an exquisitely artistic level evocative works such as Okami and Journey were the reference . The game has been available for download since October 4 on PlayStation 4 and PC, but should also arrive on Xbox One in the future. Moreover, PlayStation 4 users can opt for a packaged version that includes the soundtrack disc and an exclusive artbook. Aragami favors stealth, so infiltration always trumps frontal attack The shadow is your ally Aragami is a vengeful spirit summoned at nightfall with an ancient ritual. The entity controlled by the player has the appearance and abilities of an assassin and can take advantage of the shadows to act without being noticed. We soon learn that Yamiko, a girl imprisoned by the dangerous Kaiho clan in the fortress city of Kyuryu, is requesting help. The young woman is among the few survivors of her village and finding herself subdued in the dungeons of the temple, she decides to support Aragami's advance through her own spiritual projection. Under cover of darkness, the player is tasked with making his way through the outposts controlled by Kaiho's soldiers, in order to recover some precious objects and gain access to the fortress without being noticed. To succeed in the enterprise you need to take advantage of the shadows, paying attention to stay in the dark for as long as possible. The guards of the Light are capable of knocking out Aragami with a single blow, consequently the only way to proceed unscathed involves the use of teleportation, with which one can move quickly from one shadow area to the next. Planning plays a crucial role, as it is essential to identify exactly the location and movements made by each sentry before deciding what to do. The skills in one's possession are guaranteed by an indicator called Essence of the Shadow, whose runes appear on the protagonist's cloak and become indispensable to take advantage of the movements. If necessary, it is permitted to create a temporary shadow area to head towards places where light was present until recently, although in these cases the risk of being identified is considerably higher. After having acquired due familiarity with these interaction dynamics, it is possible to chain the movements, for example by creating shadow areas as a bridge to reach a guard, knock him down and immediately return to safety in the less exposed corners of the map. At the end of each level you receive an evaluation that takes into account various factors such as the time taken to complete the path, the number of times you have been identified and the type of approach adopted. The latter item refers to some bonuses, awarded in the event that the level has been completed without ever being discovered, without killing anyone or on the contrary by eliminating all the patrols present in that area. Evasive techniques Being a game that favors stealth interaction, Aragami does not involve the use of frontal attack strategies to get the better of enemies. The sentinels can become suspicious or alerted with a certain ease, consequently it is essential to plan each action carefully, evaluate the easiest path among those available to you and act quickly as soon as someone becomes suspicious. Exposing yourself for a few moments to the light of the lanterns, or knocking down a patrol at the wrong time, is enough to make a question mark appear on the heads of the closest soldiers, who will punctually decide what to do.i go back to the area where the anomaly has just occurred. In these situations it is necessary to act quickly, trying to hide one's tracks or to carefully attack the guards involved and prevent the alarm from being raised. In the event that the operation fails, you will receive a penalty on the final score and all the enemies present in that portion of the level will be put on alert, making it much more difficult to bring home the skin. The enemy artificial intelligence has left us good impressions: the patrols become suspicious very easily, are induced to abandon their usual position at the slightest sign of danger and allow very little space in the event that errors of evaluation occur. Overall we are dealing with a good level of playful experience, which also suffers from a certain repetitiveness in completing the tasks. For the entire span of the campaign, all you have to do is evade enemies, get to the exit point of each sector and start over, with no secondary activities to perform or changes in the composition of the missions. The choice of offering the player a single edged weapon may seem like a limitation, nevertheless one gradually gains access to a range of opportunities focused on the special talents possessed by the protagonist. Thanks to the collection of some scrolls Aragami can access a tree of skills and progress in level. The improvements are divided into three different categories and range from the expansion of the Shadow's powers to the exploitation of new offensive and defensive techniques. With the support of the Kurosu crow, you can better orient yourself on the places to reach or mark certain enemies in order to follow their movements behind obstacles. The use of the bell is also very useful, with which you manage to attract enemies towards your position and then go around or kill them without arousing suspicion. From a graphic point of view, Aragami offers a pleasant and very characteristic style, which alternates dark shades and brighter colors. The places that can be visited during the course of the story are clearly influenced by Japanese culture and landscapes, sometimes drawing inspiration from actually existing structures such as the shrines of Mount Koya - located south of Osaka - or the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima prefecture. The settings are suggestive and well cared for, although there are sporadic glitches that sometimes force you to restart from the closest checkpoint; we hope that a future patch will fix these kind of glitches and make the experience even smoother and cleaner.", "date": "2016-10-10", "grade": "8.0"}
