In short, here are the main features of the third chapter of the saga of the Saints dressed in purple, this time in exile in a Steelport to be conquered. If GTA IV is a serious and ~plastered~ free roaming title, devoted to telling the story of Niko Bellic, Saints Row: The Third is quite the opposite. The narrative component, although present with several crossroads and a double ending, is virtually absent. The 47 missions that make up the main storyline and the dozens of activities present on every street corner are entirely functional to the protagonist's rpgistic progression and no doubt the end is reached not so much for the desire to defeat Killbane and definitively take control of the city , how much to get to the level cap, unlock every single skill, vehicle and weapon, to become a real invincible killing machine. The incipit is still interesting. The Saints are the undisputed masters of Steelwater. They are not simple criminals, but all-round stars. Franchise of clothing, advertising and TV shows, a real intellectual property to be milked to earn as much money as possible. However, the latest heist goes down the drain, the gang will then be forced to start from scratch in the new city, fighting street by street against the three rival gangs, the (fake) Mexican Luchadores, the half emo, half Tron Deckers and the hotties Morning Star . More obviously the useless police with the equally useless SWAT in tow and lastly the formidable STAG military, the only ones to pose a decisive challenge to the player and who, especially since they burst onto the scene, manage to give a decisive change to the game, which for many hours he navigates in a general mediocrity between all the same missions and low-grade humor at times embarrassing. As you want me However, the strengths of the game are different. The first is the editor through which to really build the protagonist as you want, without limits of sex, build or age, choosing all kinds of clothes and accessories, tattoos, scars, masks and so on. In short, the only limit is good taste. Also in the game you can go to the cosmetic surgeon or clothing stores to change your appearance on the fly. The customization is then also extended to the cars, both aesthetically and mechanically, with bolts to be added to the wheel rims to maximize impact damage and numerous engine upgrades. Same thing for our gang members. We can dress them however we want, and arm them properly to call for help if necessary. The various aspects of customization expand with the progression of the experience: as the level of Respect obtained increases, new skills are unlocked, to be understood as real perks, such as resistance to a certain type of damage, more energy or sprint, less notoriety towards a gang, higher hourly income and much more, while with money it is possible to buy what was previously unlocked, but also new weapons and related upgrades, without forgetting ammunition. Remembering before each mission to pass by the neighborhood Friendly Fire is vital in order not to run dry during the most agitated shootings, because later in the game the fists or the huge and much-hyped purple dildo will not be enough against armored soldiers and gigantic armed brutes of flamethrowers and miniguns. Not to mention tanks and helicopters or futuristic tanks and laser-armed V-TOL aircraft. Even the weapons are definitely a plus of the title. In addition to being many and as previously written subject to upgrades, they have a distinct feeling from each other and manage to make sense of the lackluster firefight phases, in which Saints Row: The Third denounces being a mediocre shooter in third person. Alongside the shotguns and assault rifles, machine guns and pistols, we find rocket launchers and a whole series of special weapons that represent the flagship of the arsenal of the Saints. The developers are certainly not inventive. We have the Predator missile that can be launched using the special case like in Call of Duty, the area bombing, a sonic rifle, the remote control to remotely control all the motor vehicles in the game, the usual sniper rifle and a laser weapon ~ digital~. In short, when the situation is hot or when our allies are not enough, it is possible to blow up the entire neighborhood without wasting too much time. With all these weapons in play, all the skills, perks, means and editor, a strange mechanism is triggered. Kill and buy The narrative developments take second placeslowly as written at the beginning, hours of play accumulate just to unlock the third step of that skill that we are missing, to maximize the number of missiles available in the rocket launcher and in the Predator, or simply to have as much health as possible. The mechanics are really on the verge of grinding, all to the detriment of the quality of the missions, which are many, but for long periods of time really uninspired, mechanical and banal. The only moments of real fun are when the game abandons its being a third-person shooter, as during the battle in the skies aboard a tank, the long and ingenious phase in cyberspace in which you browse multiple videogame genres or when you finally manage to get your hands on the sci-fi weapons of STAG, where finally the difficulty level rises and with it the challenge rate. However, these missions are many and also quite successful: after yet another chase or the usual shootout without rhyme or reason, a nice session aboard a helicopter armed with rocket launchers or remotely piloting a car is something that is greatly appreciated. The first half of the game is at times disconcerting for banality and bad taste. It is simply a matter of carrying out missions of low-level criminals, dealing, escorting, delivering, killing and so on, in which to endlessly repeat the usual routine from point A to point B. Fortunately, the dozens of extra activities available are able to make up for this chronic lack of stimuli. Here too the list is long and it is possible to ideally divide it between ~normal~ and ~imaginative~ assignments. Among the first we find the missions in which we are asked to take a prostitute and her client for a walk, or those in which we have to control our traffickers or protect the gang from above. The imaginative ones, between old and new, see us destroy the city aboard a tank, defraud the insurance by throwing cars under us and ringing combos using the bad rag doll model of the protagonist, or carrying a tiger on a car trying not to let us eat on the most beautiful. If this were not enough then we have the successful Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax arenas, in which you have to get to the end of the level between pitfalls and opponents dressed as a purple teddy bear or the check point races in which to blow up cars and passers-by aboard a quad on fire. In short, the ~diversionary~ possibilities are not lacking, and what is very intelligent, they are all of increasing difficulty so as to make the challenge more rewarding. Playstation 3 trophies Saints Row: The Third rewards the player with 51 trophies including 38 bronze, 10 silver, 2 gold and 1 platinum. Most are obtained by completing the missions, but above all by conquering the various areas of the city, carrying out all the activities, killing a certain number of enemies, customizing weapons and cars. From bad to worse There are therefore many activities in Steelport, however plagued by shooting mechanics which are certainly not the game's calling card. But what are the main criticalities once you take up the gun? The lack of covers is a venial sin, in fact the level design always pushes us into the center of the action, but when you find yourself in the midst of rivers of grenades, bullets, lasers and cannon fire, the camera often goes into crisis, leaving us at the mercy of the dozens of enemies and cars that come upon us. The term caciarone doesn't do justice to real drunken brawls on street corners, and when you have only firearms at your disposal and maybe a couple of grenades, if the scene permits, it all boils down to exploiting the enormous weaknesses of artificial intelligence, often remaining in the background and trying to hit the opponents one at a time with precise headshots, perhaps peeping out from behind an indestructible fence. If we then have heavy weapons supplied, the music changes, but the impression of being in the middle of a Bud Spencer-like fistfight is strong, making even the longest and most structured missions uninspiring. Added to this is a blatant and gratuitous search for the scandalous and politically incorrect capable of eliciting a laugh and a cry of amazement only from teenagers with the first itches and a mustache under their noses. Everything is so taken to excess that the continuous goliardic, comical and parodic sexual references quickly become redundant and cloying and thrown there only for ~sensationalistic~ reasons. The line between teasing and bad taste is often crossed in a gross and vulgar way, as in the mission to a brothel full of sex toys that ends with a chase between rickshaws pulled by slaves in sadomasochistic gear or when we are asked if theyto drink or resell a ~cargo~ of rescued prostitutes in a container ship. We certainly don't have moralistic intentions but the style chosen by the developers is vulgar and coarse-grained, not at all intelligent, and above all it adds little or nothing to the game economy. Fortunately, the second part of the adventure escapes from this approach. Appearances, disappearances The game is not only made up of the ~campaign~ (to be played also in network/lan cooperative after using the online pass), for the record completed in just under fifteen hours of play, with the city open after the end game between dozens of activities to undertake and gangs to defeat, but there is the possibility of playing together with a friend in the ~Lorda~ mode, the ~home~ version of the horde seen in many titles lately, but which exploits all the gameplay quirks of the game. Technically speaking Saints Row: The Third has few lights and many shadows. Its being a free roaming with a vast city to be sent to the screen is already synonymous with enormous compromises, unfortunately here very evident and heavy. Alongside the protagonist and the main characters, really well animated and graced with good textures, we find a city that is only sufficient both in the exteriors and in the numerous interiors, then afflicted by showy pop-up and pop-in problems. The cars are really well made, also highly customizable and with a good driving and damage model and the white futuristic STAG vehicles are amazing. Paradoxically then the special effects are the best thing about the game: gigantic explosions, lasers, flames and beautiful particles stand out on dull textures applied on models that are all the same and poorly modeled. Also noteworthy are the recurring frame rate uncertainties and some problems in the behavioral routines of the artificial intelligence of both companions and opponents capable of blocking us in the middle of the action. Honorable mention for the dubbing, in English of course and subtitled in Italian, but with extremely partial actors who paint ~extraordinary~ and out of his mind characters (someone said Zimos?) and the excellent soundtrack that shoots from the radio of the cars licensed music of all kinds, from classical to disco, via black metal and classic 80s, not forgetting hip hop, rap or Adult Swim's comedy programs.", "date": "2011-11-22", "grade": "7.8"}
