Final Fantasy: Record Keeper plays on this element in particular, proposing a succession of fights drawn from the tradition of the series reconstructed with a particular 16-bit style pixel graphics and with slightly different conditions compared to the original ones, but which certainly leverage on the nostalgic spirit of enthusiasts. Between sprites and music taken from the original archives (or adapted in 2D from the more modern ones) and direct references, complete with screenshots, to the stories of each single chapter of the series, the fanservice is served, but there is good substance to keep the operation together. There is a common thread in all this: Tyro, the protagonist of the story, is a kind of guardian of memories and helper of Mr. Mog, the ~Record Keeper~. A mysterious dark force is corrupting the memories and chronicles of all Final Fantasy, contained within various paintings in a sort of gigantic art gallery that makes up the Great Chronicle, and Tyro's task is therefore to enter the paintings and relive the different historical fights of the Final Fantasy series to restore order in the chronicles. Perhaps a somewhat forced pretext to stage fragments of the past, but within an imaginative context like this it is not even out of place and still provides a solid infrastructure for the gameplay pills of which Final Fantasy: Record Keeper is composed. The first experiment of the series in the free-to-play field with All the Bravest was decidedly disappointing, also considering the standards that should be typical of Final Fantasy, therefore the approach to this new chapter can be cautious, but after a few minutes at inside it is clearly understood how Square Enix has corrected the shot in a substantial way, placing this game as a sort of remedy for the mistakes made previously. Record Keeper is an example of a well-designed free-to-play spin-off that puts the player and the gaming experience, not the awful mechanism of micro-transactions, at the center of the whole project. With Final Fantasy: Record Keeper the memories of past chapters of the series are always with us A story made of battles Beyond the feeble, albeit functional and pleasant, narrative connection provided by the question of paintings and memories to be saved, Final Fantasy: Record Keeper is entirely focused on the combat and party management system, an excellent compromise solution to ~reduce~ the complex universe of Final Fantasy in a mobile title with a limited budget. With this we do not want to make a judgment, mind you, we need to understand precisely what we are facing: a free spin-off of this series could not actually offer much more than what this Record Keeper contains, which proves to be a pastime with a taste Final Fantasy really enjoyable and in many respects also deep. The combat system is based on a simplification of the classic Active Battle System of the first chapters, perfected with some more recent additions. The action times for each character are marked by the classic automatic bar and for each one it is possible to choose between attack, defense, spells, summons and Limit Breaks with specific characteristics for each class of fighter taken from the tradition of the series. Final Fantasy fans will have no trouble adapting immediately to this particular interpretation of the classic combat system, which proves to be an excellent compromise between the typical depth of the series and a general simplification carried out to speed up the rhythms and better adapt them to mobile use with touch screens . Each framework consists of progressive sequences of fights with characters and enemies represented in the classic style of 16-bit chapters that culminate with particularly challenging bosses, and it is in these battles above all that the need for a certain strategic turn planning emerges. The way in which the levels are completed is finally evaluated and rewarded in a variable way with scores and bonuses that have various uses, as well as unlocking the historical characters belonging to each chapter of the series which thus become usable in the party. The management of the party and equipment is also particularly profound, with the possibility of making the characters evolve by leveling up and using the orbs collected in fights to unlock new special abilities. The more or less rare materials obtained in the paintings can also be used for fabbricare new weapons or improve those you own thanks to the intervention of the usual Cid, while more or less rare extra weapons and characters can also be conquered by participating in the Relic ~lottery~. In short, there is really a lot of material to be explored around a simplistic structure such as the obsessive succession of clashes and the advice is to try it directly to understand the various nuances.", "date": "2015-04-03", "grade": "8.4"}
