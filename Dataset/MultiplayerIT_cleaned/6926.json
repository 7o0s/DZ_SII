The time available to Nick Ramos and his friends is therefore short: will they be able to escape before it's too late, perhaps while trying to save some other survivors? The narrative component of Dead Rising 3 does not differ much from that of the second episode of the series, given that in the universe created by Capcom the situation is now worthy of the worst post-apocalyptic scenario. In this chaos of infections, massacres and violence, government forces act as a barrier but spare no one, eliminating dead and alive in equal measure so as not to run any risk. In the game we will therefore have to beware of multiple enemies: the myriads of zombies that invade the streets, of course, but also the violent bikers who control certain territories, the agents in riot gear armed with assault rifles and the inevitable bosses, who are indicated on the map by our radio contacts. Some of them are remarkable, but it must be said that the efforts of the western team Capcom Vancouver (formerly Blue Castle Games) do not return the sick atmospheres of the first Dead Rising, actually ending up aping them as already happened in the second chapter. The reason is obvious: the Japanese vision of certain things is different from ours and it is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate its contours. Dead Rising 3: Apocalypse Edition is solid, rich and fun, but suffers from some technical limitations Calm and cool If you already have experience with the series, you know exactly what to expect: a generous sandbox full of undead, with the ability to collect any object and use it as a weapon or build new ones by combining multiple things. However, there are some fundamental differences compared to the previous episodes. Firstly, the time limits that made Frank West's adventure decidedly hardcore (and often frustrating) are now much more affordable and equally optional, in the sense that we will be able to choose to limit ourselves to following the main plot or dedicate time to the survivors and to their stories, helping them most of the time to find objects or completing tasks for them, because they are convinced to save themselves (or not, depending on the case). Secondly, some gameplay elements have been streamlined. Rick is a mechanic and therefore enjoys an out of the ordinary dexterity, which allows him to create new weapons and vehicles without having to find a workbench every time, giving vent to his creativity on the spot and generating tools as imaginative as they are lethal: boxing gloves rocket launchers, cannons, teddy bears that act as defense turrets, armored vehicles of various kinds and so on. In the same way, you can forget the long (very long) walks necessary to reach the ends of the map, since on the streets of Los Perdidos there are fortunately still functioning cars, motorcycles and work vehicles, capable of quickly taking us from one area to another. other and to mow down quite a few zombies at the same time (but be careful not to overdo it: we are no longer in the underground tunnels of the first Dead Rising!). Anyone wishing to experience the ~rigidity~ of the original episode again, however, will be able to do so thanks to the Nightmare mode, available immediately, which sets specific limits in terms of saves and general difficulty. Here's how to unlock the frame rate Capcom Vancouver has made the questionable decision to lock the frame rate of Dead Rising 3: Apocalypse Edition to 30 frames per second due to unclear optimization issues. However, it is possible to unlock it by creating a file with notepad that we will call ~user.ini~, placing it in the main folder of the game and inserting a single string inside it: ~gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True~. Zombie apocalypse The PC version of Dead Rising 3, not surprisingly subtitled ~Apocalypse Edition~, aims to smooth out those corners that have made quite a few people turn up their noses regarding the technical implementation on Xbox One, as well as offer the traditional ~complete package~ to Windows users, natively including the Lost Stories released via DLC but not the recent (and insane) Super Ultra expansion Dead Rising 3: Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + Alpha. From a structural point of view, these extras greatly enrich the experience, which can be used both in single player and in online cooperative multiplayer, adding a few hours to an already rather generous total, especially if you complete not only the main missions but also secondary ones. In shorta, on the content front there's really nothing to complain about: Dead Rising 3 on PC is more substantial than ever and costs a good 30% less than last year's Xbox One edition. The speech of the technical implementation, however, deserves further study, as it is not all rosy, on the contrary. Faced with a large number of options for adjusting the graphic parameters, useful for scaling the experience based on the hardware available, the game turns out to be excessively heavy and finds it difficult to maintain 60 frames per second at 1080p (which, moreover, are obtained exclusively through a little trick - see box - because by default the frame rate is inexplicably locked at 30 fps), unless you have a really extreme configuration. In our specific case, putting all the settings to the maximum, lowering only the quality of the shadows and deactivating the vertical sync, we obtained an average of about 50 fps, unfortunately quite dancers in relation to the situations. Furthermore, with the latest version of the NVIDIA drivers, we ran into constant application crashes, only resolved by returning to 337.88. In principle, the quality of the models is good (especially during the cutscenes) and the zombies on the screen at the same time are really many, however the flatness of the surfaces is evident, while some low-resolution textures stand out which inevitably bring down the average quality. In terms of the sound sector, the Italian dubbing is appreciable but one cannot fail to notice the usual mix with alternating volumes, which forces you to adjust the audio options to be able to hear something when the characters speak without then jumping from the chair after an explosion . It is certainly the curse of dubbing video games without even being able to see on the screen the situation of the subject being voiced, but it is also true that coherence in the levels with respect to the original clips would be enough to avoid such inconveniences.", "date": "2014-09-09", "grade": "7.9"}
