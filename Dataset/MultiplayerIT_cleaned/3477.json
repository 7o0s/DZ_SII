The Simogo title was used as one of the flagship games to advertise the entire Apple Arcade system, complete with a demonstration of the gameplay on stage at the Apple presentation conference, just to make it clear how much it is also considered by the organizers of the new service on In fact, the Swedish team's pedigree is already clear: in its nine-year history, Simogo has distinguished itself for having produced some of the strangest and most interesting experiences designed especially for mobile platforms, from Beat Sneak Bandit to Year Walk up to to Device 6 and The Sailor's Dream, always going to explore the boundaries not only of the videogame medium as well as of its possible applications on the devices in question, often looking for impact effects in the intersections between narration and form, between message and means of communication or even between sight, touch and sound, as in the latter case. Synesthesia could be considered the basis of Sayonara Wild Hearts, which focuses heavily on the effect given by the rhythmic action and on the sensations that come from a harmonious fusion between audio, animations and player interaction. It's not a completely new thing in videogames and running on abstract roads or flying through night skies to the rhythm of music it is natural to think of Tetsuya Mizuguchi or even the more prosaic Harmonix, when it becomes clear that this strange game is basically a rhythm game. However, it is also a title that shuns very precise cataloging and that forces you to pull out of the drawer the hackneyed and notorious phrase ~it's not a game but an experience~, which should actually set off several alarm bells about the possibility of find ourselves in front of another pretentious and pseudo-artistic junk. This is not the case, fortunately: beyond the obvious pop art ambitions, there is a study on the gameplay which is also typical of Simogo productions and which makes this strange ~experience~ also an actually fun game, which is no small thing. Racing, duels, neon and broken hearts Sayonara Wild Hearts is a kind of continuous vision or perhaps a dream, representing an allegory of love and the mammoth challenges that await those who seek to emerge from painful stories and broken hearts. It is a secondary but important element to understand the tone that distinguishes the game, made up of about twenty levels united by the need to follow a flow of movements to the rhythm of the music, but otherwise separated in terms of setting and peculiar mechanics. In most cases, however, we find ourselves racing in a predetermined direction, whether it's riding a motorcycle on neon highways, riding deer in a mysterious forest or flying through metaphysical tunnels and between skyscrapers, with the possibility of moving on parallel planes to avoid threats and collect bonuses, or hovering in the air with daring trajectories or even touching some signals with the right timing in order to attack in perfect rhythm with the music. It is therefore a challenge of the senses and reflexes, which requires quick movements and a glance, moving the finger on the screen with short and quick movements to make the protagonist make small and precise swerves on rough paths, trying not to lose the rhythm and increase the multipliers to reach the maximum score. Beyond the bizarre presentation, it all boils down to these elementary units of the video game: running, the need to dodge obstacles and knock down enemies and the pursuit of high scores, therefore beyond the aesthetic futurism Sayonara Wild Hearts titillates the most depths of the gamer, connecting to the more classic tradition of the arcade. Also for these reasons it is a game particularly suited to be enjoyed on mobile platforms: it lends itself to short and immediate sessions, with gameplay capable of absorbing at an instinctive rather than cerebral level, therefore easily extractable and usable at any time and based on on a control system calibrated on the touch screen. Regarding this last aspect, there are some inconsistencies in the response to commands depending on the different game situations, therefore it may be necessary in some cases to modifythe input sensitivity level in the options screen. However, the remarkable graphic connotation and above all the soundtrack make us immerse ourselves deeply in its mechanics: as we have said, the music here is not only a pleasant background, it is an accompaniment that becomes an integral part of the gameplay and of the overall gaming experience helping to generate a sort of videogame trance that transports us from the beginning to the end of Sayonara Wild Hearts, a path that actually doesn't last long but still invites us to be undertaken several times. Controller and console versions iOS 13 allows you to use console controllers and so we were able to test Sayonara Wild Hearts with an Xbox One Wireless Controller as well, in order to get an idea of what the game looks like on consoles. The response to the commands is always immediate and this option returns a more classic feeling, with a more traditional correspondence to the inputs. It is a game that lends itself well to being controlled via touch screen and which perhaps finds its best expression in terms of immersion in this system, but the controller eliminates that problem on the different sensitivity to touches that we have detected in some particular sections. The short duration (the game can be completed in an hour or so) may clash with the price of 12 euros, but Sayonara Wild Hearts is made to be replayed, with the desire to re-immerse yourself in its strange world several times, therefore its rating can also be applied to the console versions.", "date": "2019-09-26", "grade": "8.5"}
