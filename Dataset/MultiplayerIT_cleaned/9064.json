Of course not! We are talking about much more important things, football played on consoles and PCs, for the moment that all fans are waiting for, to determine the fate of their team and have fun virtually beating their friends and many players scattered around the net. The FIFA series over the years, starting from the 08 edition, has subverted its destiny and slowly has earned the palm of the football simulation par excellence, thanks above all to an extremely varied gameplay that gives the player full freedom, fundamental elements after the initial impact which can be derived from the graphics or the similarity of the footballers with their real life counterparts. Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of atmosphere, on the other hand, however, there is so much substance that this lack can almost take a back seat. Anyway we finally come to FIFA 12, and with a plethora of good news both in terms of options and actual gameplay. It is undeniable that ~putting up~ with a new football simulation every year (two next! Due to the European Championships) jointly decreases tolerance towards differences that are often only subtle or linked to being in step with the times in terms of squads and players , however, this year Electronic Arts has made a risky choice on the one hand, conspicuously modifying some aspects of an extremely tested gameplay, welcome on the other, increasing the variety and number of modes available. Towards a new gameplay Tactical defense and Impact Engine are the two keywords that profoundly change part of the approach to the game being played. In FIFA 12 we have, as always, an excellent response to commands, the possibility of choosing manual controls and the feeling that has distinguished the series for some time; in addition there is a completely renewed management of collisions between players and with the ball, which is immediately noticeable in interceptions and fouls, where injuries are derived from the precise point of impact on the joints, but also in the realism of what happens on the playing field, where variety is king. There are some side effects as evidenced by the video that is all the rage these days on the net, but in general the new physics engine has brought undeniable benefits to match simulation. Even more linked to the skill with the pad is the Tactical Defense, a true element of distinction and change compared to FIFA 11. As is well known, the X key (A on Xbox 360) until last year was assigned to tackles and was the best and most frequent solution in the defensive phase, with the rest left to the skill in marking the opponent using the left analog stick. Sometimes you lost control when overtaken in dribbling, but the practice of using the tackle continuously, together with the pressing of your teammate, was the most popular and made high-profile matches a suffocating battle very far from the realistic ambitions of the title. Well, this year the continuous pressure of the X button allows you to mark the opponent without sinking the shot, staying on his heels and covering any spaces for dribbling or passing. In case you want to intervene, you have to press the square button and you tend to have only one attempt available, in the sense that going empty (whether due to the opponent's dribbling skill or wrong timing choice) causes you to lose ground/balance , with all the consequences of the case. This change completely adds a new level of approach to the game, timing is now much more important and in the defensive phase you have to be careful to cover the spaces and avoid always being impetuous. In the same way things change in attack, because on the one hand you have more time to maneuver, on the other hand dribbling can be a lethal or self-destructive weapon, because you have to use it at the right time even if your CV says ~crazy dribbler~. In this regard, a preferential role is played by the strongest defenders and attackers, with whom it is possible to dribble and defend only with the left analog as they are more reactive; in aid of ~normal~ footballers there is instead precision dribbling, which can be activated with the left bumper (R1) but which requires a better dose of coordination and timing. It's hard to explain in words how much Tactical Defense adds a new level of realism to production, but at the same time you just need to put a few minutes pad in your hand to see a good part of your certainties fall, and roll up your sleeves to fully master a systemto which after the initial phase it gives decidedly greater satisfactions. The same thing is reflected in the matches against the artificial intelligence, the beginning is in fact unsettling and as the difficulty level increases, the problems increase. For example, the gap between Expert and Champion/Legend is clearly visible, and more than once we have been jumped or slipped during the first few games because we didn't pay much attention to all the fundamentals of the defensive phase. Our recent chat with the developers in Canada also confirmed to us that the official intelligence does not cheat in any way, it simply makes less mistakes because it is controlled by a virtual controller that simulates the real one; it can therefore only do things that a rather savvy player can equally replicate with the pad of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. As regards the management of tactics, we have substantially unchanged options, we would have liked greater attention to how one's teammates attack the spaces and suggest the pass, a factor too determined by the type of team you take and its degree of harmony. We'll stop here with regards to the gameplay, but there's still a lot to tell in terms of modes and options. Playstation 3 trophies FIFA 12 offers 46 trophies, 14 of which are silver and 3 hidden, presumably gold. Their distribution covers all game modes, in the transfer market, in Ultimate Team and in online matches. We then have trophies for tunnels, bicycle kick goals, comeback goals, goals in the first five minutes and so on. The others are related to winning competitions, reaching level 5 and then 20 in EA Sports Football Club and attachment to the game, i.e. after a certain number of hours played or goals scored in all modes. The many aspects of football... Let's immediately liquidate BE a Pro, very similar to the previous year with the presence of your own virtual footballer and challenges to increase his characteristics, and the creation center, integrated with the official site for players, clubs and tournaments. The most ~glaring~ novelty is represented by the inclusion of FIFA Ultimate Team 12 within the game disc, a nice addition in terms of longevity because in recent years it arrived after a few months and at an additional cost. For those unfamiliar with it, it is a mode that allows you to create your own ideal team by basing purchases and exchanges on a complex ebay-style system where each player is represented by a sticker that indicates their overall value. Although obviously having all champions allows you to field a very strong eleven, you have to take into account the understanding between the various players, which allows you to obtain further benefits in terms of statistics but also, for example, how your teammates attack the spaces. Chemistry can be increased by choosing, for example, some who play in the same country rather than in the same club team, or who have complementary roles. The differences compared to last year are indeed rather marginal and concentrated above all in the interface, which is much more accessible and requires fewer steps than in the past. Users of previous editions (starting from 10) will be able to ~transport~ their progress to FUT 12 while the training of the week, published every Wednesday and which lists the best used players (based on various statistics) in the last seven days. This training makes available on the market and always for one week an ~enhanced~ version of the players who are part of the ideal training, who will keep these characteristics permanently. Therefore, buying a Messi with even higher values and with skyrocketing morale can be the thing that can make the difference on the pitch between players who are equivalent in terms of ability. There is no shortage of stickers dedicated to stadiums, coaches, balls and so on, which allow you to grow your club in all aesthetic aspects but also in understanding, on the official website it is also possible to manage all the managerial part of Ultimate Team, in in such a way as to keep an eye on the auctions and the formation of the week even when you are away from the actual game. The fruits of all this work, which recalls the much-loved collecting that affected so many of us in our adolescence, can be consumed by playing friendlies and offline and online tournaments created by the developers, each of which has specific requirements and which bring credits for the purchases and experience points, to which we will return later. Alongside FUT 12 and Be a Pro, the third mode that also serves to keep the single player part standing is represented by Career, the subject ofseveral criticisms in the past seasons. The beating heart of the news is certainly the part linked to transfers, much faster and more intuitive thanks to the new filters implemented. We have seen firsthand that the trading between the teams is much more credible than in past editions: in fact, beyond some parameters that can be selected at the beginning, the exchanges are most of the time plausible and the management of contracts and clearer retreats. Players who have just arrived in other teams (see Fabregas but also Suarez last season) have been impossible to buy due to the refusal of their team, players instead like De Rossi, attached to the shirt, have instead refused any offer despite having convinced the club to sell player. This whole phase takes place through a management menu and a section dedicated to news, with statements from the players and the possibility of interacting with the press during matches and other events. FIFA 12 First Lineup of the Week Still speaking of the transfer market, particular emphasis was placed on the last day; in fact there are ten virtual hours available, with each negotiation consuming one, where the presidents of the other teams tend to sell off their players, if they desperately need money, or to make higher offers when they need immediate reinforcements before the negotiation deadline. The search for talent has also undergone several changes, in fact there are three slots available for your scouts, who can be sent around for a defined period of time in search of budding players to be included in your youth team. At the end of their observation period they always report at least a couple of players under sixteen, with a potential range of values they can reach, for example between sixty and ninety. This window can be made more precise based on the level of your scout, the time spent around and also based on his nationality, because an Argentinian will certainly have a better chance of scouting talent in his own country. Hence the minimally strategic choice of considering whether a player should be signed or not, because waiting too long could see the inclusion of other teams and because a maximum of sixteen players can be signed, who, if promoted to the first team, go to weigh on the budget in terms of salary, and then turn out to be trash cans. The Career remains a rather ~light~ mode that has no inclination to imitate more complex managerial simulations (in fact, the management of various parameters is missing, including training and sponsors), the changes and additions have certainly made it more interesting compared to the past, and as always it is possible to simulate the game, play it normally or together with your virtual player, an ideal way to continue to enhance its characteristics by doing other things as well. ...also online To seal a very rich package this year is EA Sports Football Club, a substrate that keeps track of all its activity in FIFA 12, and which will be carried over to future chapters. Whatever you do within FIFA 12, but just anything, it will in fact allow you to acquire experience points, necessary to level up and represent your degree of attachment to the title. Within EASFC you can also compare all your stats with those of your friends, challenge them and access a myriad of stats to determine who is the best. The degree of skill of each player is associated with a sort of division/championship, for example to go from first to second there are ten games available, with each victory returning the classic three points, a draw and zero defeat. The dedicated matchmaking system allows you to challenge ten opponents of similar level and to be ~promoted~ you need to reach a total of twelve points, with the promotion threshold gradually higher. An excellent system to entice you to play online and therefore an additional weapon to curb users who cheat online by logging out even during the first five minutes after kick-off. This is because a big defeat will be awarded on the scoresheet, and there will be one less game out of the ten initially available to rank up. Linked to this sort of social network is the new version of Support your Club, in fact there is a system of championships divided into categories (such as Serie A, B, first division and so on) which last for one week at the end of which there are the winners of the highest one and then to climb relegations and promotions", "date": "2011-09-26", "grade": "9.5"}
