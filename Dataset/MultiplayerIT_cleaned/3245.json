Adding to this delicate balance of factors is having to listen to the feedback of an extremely sensitive community, very demanding and loyal players who are ready to buy the game year after year. One of the companies that knows the importance of all this is undoubtedly Milestone, a company that deals with many of the official licenses inherent to two wheels. We are talking about titles of the caliber of MotoGP, SBK, MXGP and of course Monster Energy Supercross, which has reached its sixth chapter this year, a remarkable achievement for a saga devoted to the official supercross championship. The Milanese company has created a series capable of challenging the market in our area too, where this discipline doesn't actually have a strong following, but thanks to good playability it manages to be appreciated even by those who don't know the name of Jeremy McGrath . In this review of Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6 we will tell you about our exploits riding the official bikes of the American supercross, the news and how it is still fun to get dirty with mud between one race and another. Learn from the best Milestone returns with a new chapter dedicated to American supercross: Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6 In this chapter, the aforementioned Jeremy McGrath returns within a game as a mentor, one of the legends of this sport with seven championships won, who among other things has already been the protagonist of a series of video games to him dedicated between the end of the 90s and the beginning of 2000. The presence of the champion prompted Milestone to make it an integral part of Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6, offering improvements and a more enjoyable tutorial phase. In fact, supercross requires a little more attention than the classic two-wheeled games and the tutorial remains a fundamental part for calibrating the difficulty and the many driving aids that the title provides. For those who know the sport and have experienced the series in recent years, it will be a formality, but they will still be able to appreciate the new balances introduced by Milestone, which appear improved and more incisive compared to the previous chapter. Net of the novelties, if we don't want to experience Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6 as a challenge, but as just healthy fun between one stunt and another, the game gives us the possibility to ~automate~ almost everything, offering a It's more of an arcade experience so you don't pay too much attention on how to balance weight during a jump or the right throttle level on corner entry. Although this choice may distort the complexities that Milestone has instead managed to integrate into the driving model, at the same time simplifying some aspects allows it to attract a wider audience and to grant freedom and genuine fun to any novice driver. Numbers on the track In Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6 Career gets a slight overhaul that makes it more enjoyable and interesting Being an annual licensed game, each chapter presents a list of riders, tracks and bikes that is completely updated and consistent with the current championship in progress. Milestone has done an enormous job in re-proposing all the supercross categories, from the two 250 displacements divided into West and East and the maximum category represented by the 450, as well as faithfully reproducing the 17 Monster Energy Supercross AMA tracks, the 80 participating riders and the 29 two wheels ready to plow through the mud. The career is divided into three stages which increase in difficulty gradually. The first chapter immediately put us in the saddle with Futures, a mode inspired by the official invitational competitions among the best riders in the world, where we can test our riding skills and then introduce us to the Supercross Academy, the real tutorial of the game and finally introducing us Journal, a section that keeps track of our progress, from victories to tricks, performed on the track. At this juncture it is also possible to customize the pilot, with an ever wider range of options than the previous one; modifications and any upgrades remain possible even as you progress in the champion climb in the maximum category, so there is no fear in being able to make changes later. Once you pass this stage, you get to the heart of the experience by taking to the track in about ten races in the 250 East category and as many in the 250 West. Once this phase is completed, it is time to evaluate the offersand the market to choose who to race for in the Pro championship, the latest chapter that brought us to the saddle of the 450 displacement supercross bikes, with the desire and ambition to lift the world champion cup at the end of the season. As with other titles such as SBK or MotoGP, however, the official championship alone, however well done and identical to the real one, cannot be a sufficient offer of content to be able to bring the title to success. There are hardly any new features between one season and the next that overturn the regulations or introduce brand new tracks and this would lead to having practically identical titles every year, discouraging even the most loyal fans from buying. This is where the creativity and talent of the development teams come into play, who can thus take up the challenge of creating methods capable of intriguing the public and keeping them glued to the product. Everyone to the park! In Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6 the most prominent novelty is undoubtedly Rhythm Attack The Milanese studio was not found unprepared and brought to the new Monster Energy Supercross a more engaging experience inside the Supercross Park where you can train freely in the different areas of the park to improve your skill tree, take a break from stress of the championship and hone your skills to avoid injury during the season. However, the most consistent novelty is represented by Rhythm Attack, a one-on-one challenge on a long straight stretch characterized by bumps and jumps where the winner is the first one who crosses the finish line. At the moment there are only two game arenas but it is easy to believe that this novelty will be actively supported by Milestone in the coming months by integrating different scenarios. To complete the offer we find the already known modes such as the Championship, where you can completely customize the season, the track editor where to give space to our creativity and obviously the multiplayer sector where to compete online, which from this chapter integrates cross-play. Watch out for opponents Unfortunately, even in Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6, the AI problems are still quite evident One of the problems that has also plagued the previous chapters of Monster Energy Supercross is inherent in artificial intelligence. In fact, it is not unusual to receive aggressive stripping from the opponents, but this gratuitous vehemence very often leads to irreparably ruining our race, leaving us innocently with a grimace on our face to resort to the rewind. If the work done on physics is palpable and the excellent improvements can be appreciated, unfortunately we cannot say the same for the AI, which, although less impulsive, does not find the right balance in this chapter as well. In fact, it is not uncommon to witness unrealistic chrono times and opponents controlled by artificial intelligence ignoring our positioning on the track and making curve cuts that defy gravity. Added to this is the graphics engine that inexorably shows the signs of time, even on PC and new generation consoles. This is not only found in a general graphic rendering of the dated tracks, but also on the models of the pilots which appear too primitive. This suffering at the engine level had already begun to make itself felt in the previous chapters, but now it is far too evident.", "date": "2023-03-10", "grade": "7.0"}
