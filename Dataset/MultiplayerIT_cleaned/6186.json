Precisely starting from this assumption, Nippon Ichi, NIS, Compile Heart and Idea Factory imagined a strange universe a few years ago in which the consoles ideally represent four deities viscerally venerated by as many groups of faithful, who often fight among themselves to impose the 'one on the other their own reasons. Everything takes place in the world of Gamindustri, divided into four areas that each ideally represent one of the consoles of the main brands in the sector. Thus we have Lastation (PlayStation), Leanbox (Xbox), Lowee (Wii) and Planeptune (the reference is to the Neptune, the never released SEGA console that was supposed to combine MegaDrive and Sega Mega Drive 32X in a single chassis, or the code name of the Dreamcast before release). Four comely deities then watch over each of them, namely White Heart, Purple Heart, Green Heart and Black Heart, who have different looks both according to the form they take (human or divine), and the console they represent. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation is in this sense the third chapter of the saga, a remake of the last episode of the trilogy released on PlayStation 3, namely Hyperdimension Neptunia: Victory, by the Japanese development team Felistella. The remake of Hyperdimension Neptunia: Victory comes to Vita in a better packaged edition Nintendo versus SEGA The plot of the game remains as always on the levels of crazy humor to which the series has accustomed us, telling in this case of how Purple Heart, protector of Planeptune, and her sister Nepgear are scolded daily by Histoire, enraged with the divinities of Gamindustri who according to him now spend too much time playing video games and too little in what should be their ~activities~ as Dee. In reality, the latter idle thanks to the fact that their world is experiencing a period of relative peace, apart from the protests of an anti-CPU movement. For a series of events that we will not reveal so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering them for yourself, Purple Heart's alter-ego, Neptune, is at a certain point catapulted into an alternative unknown dimension where everything is still stuck in the 80s . In fact, it is 1989 there and in addition to the threat of a mysterious organization called ~The Seven Wise Men~, the Console War is in full swing, with SEGA and Nintendo engaged in facing each other in what in our reality (1989-1990) was a period which in some ways gave way to the generational change between the 8bit and 16bit platforms. However, after a few moments in that dimension and the knowledge of Plutia, the CPU equivalent to the Purple Heart of the ~normal~ world, Neptune's real troubles begin. The title itself does not offer major changes in terms of mechanics compared to the past, also because the most important ones, especially in terms of finishes and gameplay, had already been made by the predecessors in the transition from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation Vita. Apart from some significant aesthetic improvements and, compared to the home version, the addition of some new chapters that increase the longevity of the product making it far beyond twenty hours if you decide to play it to the end without leaving anything pending, there are no in fact sensational news. In any case, as far as the structure is concerned, once again the game alternates endless dialogues managed through specific more or less static screens, with the avatars of the anime-style characters, with the exploration of larger and more labyrinthine dungeons than usual where you can carry out missions of various nature, and with non-random turn-based combat. Enemies, in fact, are visible on the screen and therefore can even be avoided. Alternatively, you can try to surprise them from behind and gain an advantage when you are then transported to the appropriate battle screen. These take place as mentioned in alternate turns, but in a fast way: each gesture made by the party members, made up of four elements (plus the same number on the bench), consumes a certain number of points, once which is exhausted the turn passes to the character or to the next opponent. The actions that a character can perform are manifold: he can take up a defensive position, attempt to escape or attack, selecting the move to be performed among those at a distance, in melee or with an object, obviously taking into account his position, the type of weapon and the skills that distinguish it. Without forgetting the combos, whose peculiarity consists in the fact that it is the user who can choose their composition and special powerwith which to conclude the sequence. It even has the ability to customize its visual rendering and name. It is also important to create a certain understanding between the girls, given that thanks to the Lily Rank, the more the couples fight side by side, the more the feeling between them increases and stats and special abilities increase. Be that as it may, during the fight the product does not lose its ironic verve and it is therefore possible to witness amusing interludes between the protagonists, often filmed with ad hoc shots to enhance their shapes and beauty. PSVita trophies Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation offers forty-two Trophies to unlock, divided into 23 bronze, 16 silver, 2 gold and 1 platinum. Most of them are obtained simply by progression in the game, for example by completing 100 quests, beating the Neptral Tower or making 100-hit combos in the adventure. Souls and Cores The challenge level of the fights is never excessive, even if at a certain point in the adventure and in the face of certain bosses it becomes essential, during a fight, to pay attention to what the enemy you are facing could do, who touches the next turn, and so on, thus adopting the right strategy. At the end of each battle, as usual, you are rewarded with experience points and other elements useful for enhancing the skills and parameters of the various characters. Others, on the other hand, are obtained along the adventure: thanks to some side characters or the completion of certain missions, for example, projects can be unlocked which, thanks to the Remake System, an interesting crafting system, can then with the help of materials suitable allow you to make various changes to the difficulty of many dungeons, for example by changing the arrangement or presence of enemies and objects, the type of loot and so on. Furthermore, quite amusingly in our opinion, the game also judges the user's performance, complete with sharp but helpful comments, which often invite him to explore the scenarios further in search of objects, rather than rushing to the end of the game. area, or vice versa, they boast the ability and desire to get to know every corner of the game world. Finally, always present is the Stella's Dungeon, which takes place independently in parallel with the main adventure. For those who don't know it, it is a mini-game where the little Felistella mascot - name of the development team which, as mentioned at the beginning, oversaw this remake and all the others in the series on PlayStation Vita - is sent by the user in a series of automatic missions that he can follow via log while calmly continuing to play his game. When the girl returns, the gamer can then reap the fruits of his labor, grabbing equipment and useful items to improve the characters and other aspects of the game. For the rest, moving on to the technical part, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation does not take particular steps forward compared to its predecessor. The graphics of the game, in cel shading and three-dimensional for the exploratory phases, however reflect the light-hearted and ironic tone of the plot, with an engine that seems to exalt itself on the small screen of Vita and which definitely points to the anime style also for the look of the characters. In particular, the heroines are well drawn, semi-dressed and alluring, but never vulgar, as only Japanese artists can portray. If the main characters are well done, the same cannot be said for the rest. The scenarios, especially the dungeons, tend to be rather dull, bare and repetitive, to the point that in some cases it seems to revisit the same places already explored, while most of the enemies are somewhat anonymous in some ways. For its part, however, the audio is identical to that of the original on PlayStation 3, thus presenting an excellent dubbing in Japanese (available via free DLC), or alternatively a discreet spoken in English for the main dialogues (many, above all the secondary ones are instead only textual and in English), while the soundtrack disappoints where the music, almost all recycled from the previous chapters of the series, lacks the winning starting point.", "date": "2015-07-20", "grade": "7.0"}
