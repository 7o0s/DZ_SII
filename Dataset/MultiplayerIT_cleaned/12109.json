{"name": "SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-us-navy-seals-fireteam-bravo-2-recensione.html", "text": "Good Bravo Bis Once again, in Fireteam Bravo 2 you take on the role of the highly efficient Sandman, engaged in yet another bloodbath disguised as an anti-terrorist operation in the imaginary region of Adjikistan. Translated into purely videogame terms, this means that the game is made up of 14 missions with the most diverse objectives, such as the arrest of enemy officers, the release of hostages, the recovery of files and documents and so on. Exactly like the prequel, Fireteam Bravo 2 is configured as a third-person action game enriched by a pinch of tactics: in addition to direct control over the Sandman, the player can in fact also count on a support companion, who follows the leader quite intelligently and which, if necessary, carries out the orders given to it via a pop-up menu. In reality, the Zipper title is rather poor in simulation ambitions, and prefers to leave the user the freedom to choose whether to act with weapons drawn or in a stealth manner, but always maintaining an extremely condescending tone: the enemies are as numerous as they are easy to shoot, the objectives that are simple to achieve and the medkits are perhaps given too generously, removing the danger of frustration but at the same time flattening the level of challenge. Like the basic gameplay, the control system has also remained substantially unchanged compared to the previous chapter: therefore the lock-on through the R key peeps out again, which on the one hand avoids the danger of an uncomfortable and inaccurate manual pointing method , on the other hand, it makes the firefights decidedly elementary and automated, taking a little spice away from the overall playful experience. However, Zipper must be given the credit for having cleverly inserted a remarkable series of commands among the few keys made available by the Sony handheld, allowing the user to move, shoot, interact and issue commands with considerable fluency. Instead, the developers were beaten on the hands for not having made up for one of the most annoying problems of the old SOCOM, and here returned in all its negativity: that is, the impossibility of saving during a mission, a gap that clashes strongly with the pick and play needs of many handheld console owners. I feel a force inside that I don't KNOW either Once the formalities relating to the aspects inherited from the previous chapter have been completed, it is time to focus on the new - or at least remodeled - elements of this Fireteam Bravo 2. The tip of the iceberg consists of a more complete design of the briefing section, but it is in the gameplay real that you can find the juiciest news. Starting with a new real-time scoring system, aimed at rewarding the most meticulous and efficient players: essentially, the so-called Command Equity Points are obtained by completing secondary objectives during missions, while Local Influence Points are awarded whenever keep innocent citizens safe. The rewards are different but equally useful for the purpose of the adventure (with the former you unlock bonuses such as extra medkits or air strikes, with the latter you receive extra weapons or information on the position of enemies), and Fireteam Bravo 2 does an excellent job of juxtaposition in this sense, even going so far as to force the user to make a choice between duty or compassion for civilians. The other prominent new entry is the intriguing cross-talk functionality, which plays on the union between the title present here and the recent Combined Assault for PS2. In fact, some missions in one have special objectives which - if completed - can alter the course of an internship in the other and vice versa, after uploading the saved data: an aspect clearly exclusive to those who own both games, but still worthy of praise. News are also recorded on the multiplayer front, always intended for a maximum of 16 ad hoc or online players and compatible with the headset for voice chat. In addition to 12 fresh maps, this section of Fireteam Bravo 2 has been enriched with three new modes included among the seven available: Tug of War and Intel Grab are two variants respectively of the classics king of the hill and capture the flag, while Target resolves into free-for-all games in which everyone must find and control an objective for as long as possible. As per tradition for the series, the multiplayer also cuts a fine figure in Fireteam Bravo 2, proving to be complete and exciting and managing by itself to guarantee an enviable longevity to the Zipper product. The result of the title on the technical front is a little less honorable, still good but without great improvements compared to the prequel. Graphically Fireteam Bravotherefore continues to offer wide and quite well-finished scenarios and well-defined characters with realistic movements, but also drastic drops in frame rates in the most agitated situations. Nothing to object to on the other hand about the sound, composed of high-impact orchestral music and realistic and immersive sound effects. Comment Socom: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2 is a sequel that is far from revolutionary but still well done, which develops and expands the strengths of the previous one, forgetting however to correct some defects. Anyone who has appreciated the first exploit of the series on PSP will find bread for their teeth here, thanks to a decent campaign mode and a multiplayer section that is certainly among the best around. Pros Technically sound Solid gameplay Great multiplayer Cons A bit too similar to the prequel No saves during missions While the Sony handheld hasn't always proved to be friendly territory for first- and third-person shooters, the original Socom: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo (released about a year ago) managed to conquer it with relative ease, offering a sufficiently deep gameplay which was accompanied by an at least human control system. The success of public and critics is mathematical, and the release of the second chapter that we are about to review is highly predictable.", "date": "2007-07-23", "grade": null}
