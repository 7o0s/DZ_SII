After Grand Theft Auto, the latest in chronological order was Red Dead Redemption, but in reality another one had been announced a few months earlier, that mysterious L.A. Noire, which seemed to be exclusive to PlayStation 3 but which, with a view to maximizing profits but also to satisfy as many gamers as possible, finally arrives for the Sony console and Xbox 360, with the same important goal as its two older brothers. The developer chosen for this project was Team Bondi, a relatively young studio founded in 2003 by Brendan McNamara, who was previously director of the Soho London studio on behalf of Sony and which counts among its creations the ambitious but controversial The Getaway . Someone may be scratching their nether regions, but the hand of McNamara and his previous works is felt positively within L.A. Noire, who inherits that minimalist, integrated and somewhat cinematic style of information that characterized his project for PlayStation 2. Free roam or not? Let's immediately clarify the characteristics, we are faced with a game that basically shares the structure of the two previous Rockstar productions, intended as a freely explorable map (indeed, in L.A. Noire it is immediately in full), the free third-person view, the ability to drive cars and move on foot, primary missions, secondary missions and collectibles of all sorts. Having established this, it is the ~heart~ of the production and the flow of the gameplay that give that freshness and personality necessary to emerge from those two sacred monsters that have inevitably been used by users as a comparison over the course of the months. The first most visible and obvious difference is represented by the setting: we are in Los Angeles at the end of the 40s, where the skyscrapers of Downtown had not yet taken over and instead Sunset Boulevard was not so far from today. An even more mythical Los Angeles, which after the Second World War began to show the whole world the power of its cinematographic machine and of always living to the fullest. But also a Los Angeles dominated by a criminal underworld created by veterans returned from the war, by betting racketeering, drugs, arson and serial killers who enjoy teasing the investigative police. In this scenario, your alter ego is Cole Phelps, a former marine who, upon returning home, joins the police as an investigator, according to a common thread that will then lead him to a career in homicide, narcotics (also called Vice) and so on. . No space for the multiplayer component, L.A. Although Noire has many of the characteristics of free roams, it prefers a more linear player approach, where wandering around the city becomes more of a visual pleasure than anything else, perhaps even after finishing the main events. There is in fact a special option called free roam which is useful for completing the collection of collectibles or secondary missions. The narration develops according to three parallel plans, the main one involves the resolution of twenty-one investigative cases focused on the problems explained a few lines above, according to a logical thread that initially seems to be disconnected in its parts, but which later brings to light ever greater connections between the characters and the crimes Phelps encounters. Between each case and the next there are non-interactive flashbacks linked to the period prior to the one experienced directly (especially the war in Okinawa in 1945) while during the development of the cases it is possible to collect newspapers thanks to which to launch short films that enrich the main story and which show the vicissitudes of characters involved in some way with the main protagonist. Someone will surely be wondering if it is possible to enter the buildings at will. The answer is ni, in the sense that most of the time it can only be done if they are functional to the mission in progress; in any case, there are famous places that are also accessible on other occasions but which in any case have little to offer except from a purely visual point of view. So here we are at the gameplay, Cole Phelps is controlled as one would expect, with the run linked to the R2 key, the movement delegated toleft analog stick, camera to right, and so on. The same goes for the drive and shootout sections, which share the 'fixed' cover system like Mafia 2's and is standard for the genre. Let me be clear however, the action component in L.A Noire is not the main one at all, but rather it is mainly related to the secondary missions, which can never be used as in this case to break the story and the type of gameplay that the game has to offer most of the time. Their access is simple, when you are driving a police car it can happen randomly to receive a call, you accept it with the X key and the position to reach immediately appears on the map. The secondary missions include, for example, shootings after a bank robbery, car chases or on foot, in the street or through buildings, the nice thing however is represented by the fact that these forty missions have their own names and always a minimum of diversification, testifying that the Bondi Team has tried to make the title as credible as possible and linked to a narrative structure. Playstation 3 trophies THERE. Noire offers 40 trophies, related to all the components of the game. Those related to the story are more or less numerous based on whether the case is closed with the highest rating or not, that all the clues are discovered or that the right questions are asked during the interrogations. Others, on the other hand, are obtained by collecting newspapers, films scattered around the game map and with side missions. Platinum hunters will be happy to know that it can be obtained by playing the title once if you want, but in any case it is possible to replay the single cases without having to start all over again. Case closed We finally come to the cases that distinguish the main story. THERE. Noire is an investigative title and therefore offers largely reasoned and reflective gameplay: you reach the crime scene and you need to examine any circumstantial evidence scattered around it, each useful object can provide telephone numbers, connections or indications on the modus operandi of the suspects. The notebook acts as a link, and depending on the accuracy of the exploratory phase, the variables available for each interrogation are greater or less. For each response received, there are three ways to continue: believing in what the interlocutor says, questioning it or accusing him of lying. In the latter case, the clue to support this thesis must be selected, as proof of the importance of examining the crime scene in detail. In general you have to think and rethink what happened previously to ask the right question, and also examine the facial expressions of the characters, which sometimes clearly indicate whether the interlocutor has something to hide or not. Successfully completing an interrogation allows you to obtain two distinct benefits, with the first reflecting on how the case is resolved: more or less quickly, having to make a greater number of trips or incriminating one suspect rather than another. Let me be clear, the story and the ending of L.A. Noire are already written in stone, change some scene or intermediate dialogue as well as the evaluation for each closed case. The second benefit is that of acquiring a greater number of experience points linked to the twenty levels available, each of which gives one intuition point; these can be used to exclude one of the three types of questions and some wrong clues, or even report all the evidence to be analyzed at the crime scene. In reality, in the options menu it is possible to enable some simplifications, such as a bell noise near a clue or the end of the investigative music when all the elements have been examined, the player can choose whether to use them or not. The flow of the missions therefore follows this canvas with the part of the action that usually takes place in the final moments thanks to tailings, chases and some shootings, especially in the final part of the adventure. In this sense we really liked the chases, with those in the car perfectly balanced, fun and in some cases even exciting, and those on foot shorter but often equally valid. Unfortunately, however, they are not all roses and flowers: where in fact a Heavy Rain manages to return an always engaging narrative structure and super-well-finished puzzles, also thanks to the significantly shorter duration and the different type of gameplay, L.A. Noire suffers from a rather repetitive central part that is struggling to take off from a narrative point of view, in this oneat this point the secondary missions become almost a panacea between one case and another such as for example in homicides, where you have to do practically the same things for four - five crimes and where perhaps some passages should be eliminated to avoid excessive repetitions. Luckily the rest is very valid, the second half of the game flows much better and the transition from one investigative team to another coincides with some major novelties in terms of variety, such as when the transition to narcotics allows you to take part in cases linked to drugs and gambling rackets. We then told you of the developer's desire to give a realistic and cinematic cut to the title; you can see it in every little detail, for example when the hud disappears completely in the investigative sections or when you are about to reach the point of the mission and the sequence that introduces the crime automatically starts, without bright spots or interruptions of any kind. The same navigation between the various places in Los Angeles does not take place using the classic GPS with the line indicating the roads to follow: just press the square button to be told by your partner where to turn at the next intersection, a partner who is practically always present during the course of the game. On the other hand, it's good to always work in pairs to exchange a few jokes and maybe sell your partner in front of a good offer, right? ;) The flagship of the production is the now well-known visual acting of the characters, whose facial expressions are truly impressive. Apart from some unnatural transitions we are faced with a new standard for the genre, not to mention that their implementation is among the main reasons that make the interrogations more profound, the dialogues interesting and the title engaging. The only concession to fiction, which is also welcome, is the possibility of quickly reaching your destination by leaving the guide to your partner, in practice by holding down the triangle button near your car. Moving on to a purely technical L.A. Noire seems to be a slight evolution of previous Rockstar works. In fact, there remains a rather marked aliasing and a visual line that is not exceptional in terms of detail, the situation has instead improved as regards the frame rate and the shadows, finally of greater resolution. The external glimpses are only discreet, except for sporadic cases, while the interior and the attention to detail are absolutely commendable. Thanks to the aforementioned direction and acting, the impact with the game is in any case pleasant and fully fulfills the purpose of creating atmosphere and giving credibility to the production, while not being faultless in all its components. The same thing happens for the sound sector, with music of excellent workmanship but perhaps too small in number, and an English dubbing that goes hand in hand with the exceptional technology used for acting. It is now known that the title offers the Italian translation only in the texts (with the usual problem of readability while driving, even if it is eliminated when it is possible to activate the automatic one), but never as in this case would it have been difficult to have an adequate audio part to visual acting. Footnote for stats lovers and to give a dimension of longevity, we have completed L.A. Noire in about twenty-one hours of gameplay, with twenty out of forty side missions and eleven out of thirteen newspapers, a completion percentage of 74.3%.", "date": "2011-05-16", "grade": "9.3"}
