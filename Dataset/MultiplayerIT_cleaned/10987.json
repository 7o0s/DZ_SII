{"name": "Call of Duty: World at War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-world-at-war-recensione_a.html", "text": "Welcome to Hell! This new Call of Duty chapter immediately reveals itself to be extremely realistic and violent, starting with the introductory sequences (which make extensive use of rather crude historical films) to continue with the actual action, which is told in a very ~cinematographic~, through scenes as barbaric as (unfortunately) related to the reality of a bloody war, which did not look anyone in the face and which caused victims among the military as well as civilians. The way in which the two protagonists are presented to us is emblematic in this sense: the first is freed from a Japanese prison camp, while he is about to be subjected to torture; the second survives piled up among the corpses, while the Nazi soldiers check the bodies and finish off those that are still moving. In short, both characters have excellent reasons to fight, and under their command we will have to make a difference through fifteen stages that will push us further and further into the heart of the conflict. Those who have had the opportunity to try Call of Duty 3 in the Wii version will find themselves faced with a control system that is already quite familiar, with the analog stick used to move the soldier and the infrared aiming system of the Wii-mote which check the view. The B trigger allows us to shoot with the equipped weapon, and at this juncture things have not changed: we will have only two ~slots~ available, starting with a machine gun and a pistol that can be replaced by any weapon we find inside of the locations. To collect them, we will have to hold down the ~-~ key on the Wii-mote, a key that also serves to reload, while the ~+~ key allows us to throw a grenade or a smoke bomb: you decide between one and the other by tilting the side controller (not exactly a good choice). As for the Nunchuck, the C and Z buttons are used respectively to crouch and to aim, an operation that does not change even if you are using a sniper rifle. The game has been deprived of the ~quick time events~ present in Call of Duty 3 (thankfully!) and some pointing problems have been corrected, in particular those ~blocks~ that caused the system to go haywire for some moments. The use of equipment other than the basic ones (turrets, cannons, etc.) returns a much slower movement than normal, as it should be, while the bayonet attack is no longer dependent on the wii-mote shake and has been assigned to the d-pad: although the position of the key is not very comfortable, the maneuver is certainly more precise and reliable. ~It's like autumn...~ Although Treyarch was not responsible for the development of Call of Duty 4, the influence of the last episode of the series on this World at War is clear: the single-player game mode is intense, engaging and also quite demanding, but above all on Wii is identical to what was seen on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Of course, for the rest of the differences compared to the ~nextgen~ versions are not lacking, starting with the cooperative game mode, which has been replaced by a local multiplayer for two players in which the second participant just controls an on-screen crosshair (a bit like a gun shooter). The online is fundamentally based on that of COD4, therefore the modes in which the vehicles are present, as well as the Nazi zombies, are missing. In any case, we are undoubtedly facing the best online multiplayer ever seen on Wii, with very fast access to games and lots of people to challenge. We are undoubtedly facing the best online multiplayer ever seen on Wii. It is possible to organize deathmatches or other things for up to eight players, and in our tests we have not found any problems with lag or anything else: the action flows smoothly and the excellent ~target-based~ growth system that helped decree the success of Call of Duty 4. World at War's multiplayer is therefore a bit of a ~game within a game~, capable of guaranteeing a very high longevity, with a good number of maps and modes. The absence of voice chat, then, weighs only up to a certain point: by its very nature, the multiplayer of the Activision product does not allow the selection of games, so you often end up playing with foreigners. Technical realization In terms of technical implementation, unfortunately, this new episode of Call of Duty does not cry out for a miracle, on the contrary. The developers have used an engine deriving from COD4, but the differences compared to the episode released two years ago are not striking. The comparison with Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 is obvious, and let's say that the two titles are equivalent in many ways: the Electronic Arts product boasts a frame raextremely fluid and solid, but to the detriment of the rest, with very simple polygonal models both as regards the soldiers and the locations; World at War, for its part, offers more detailed and complex characters, much more beautiful to look at especially in online multiplayer, and settings much richer in detail, but the frame rate is mediocre. If there is one thing that must be taken into due consideration when developing an FPS for Wii, it is precisely the fluidity of the graphics, which heavily affects the precision of the pointing system. It goes without saying that MOHH2 is more precise, therefore, where in this sense the Activision title sometimes presents quite problematic phases. The textures are terrible in both cases, while for the sound sector the challenge is undoubtedly won by Medal of Honor, which could boast of great atmosphere music and more ~full-bodied~ effects: those of WaW are decidedly too ~soft~ and fake. The only exception concerns the speech, which is really excellent. The Nintendo DS version In its only portable reduction (a version for PSP will not be released, unfortunately), Call of Duty: World at War continues the discussion started by the developers of the n-Space team with the previous episode, also on Nintendo DS. The campaign is usually introduced by a short tutorial that will show us how the various weapons work, with a control system that is unchanged from COD4: the d-pad to move the character, the left back button to fire the weapon equipped and the combination of stylus and touch screen to manage the view. Similar to what was done for Metroid Prime Hunters, it is a control method that must be ~digested~ and which hardly lends itself to long game sessions, given that you practically always have to hold the DS with only your left hand. While different from the other consoles, the single-player mode proves to be engaging and rich in substance, with numerous variations in the gameplay. To this we must add the presence of an exceptional multiplayer both locally and online, which in fact lengthens the longevity of the Activision title a lot. Technically excellent, even improved compared to the previous episode, World at War on Nintendo DS therefore presents itself as a solid, fun and very well done FPS. Definitely recommended. VOTE: 8 Comment Call of Duty: World at War represents a return of the series on Wii, a return extremely welcome for more than one reason. Firstly, the single player is identical to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, so you will be able to enjoy an extremely similar experience: same number of stages, same situations, same characters, same weapons. Secondly, the online multiplayer mode is the most fun, engaging and well done we have seen at this juncture on the Nintendo console: it is no exaggeration to say that it is a ~game within a game~, as the online of Call of Duty has really set new standards for the genre and on Wii it is presented in the best way (albeit limiting the games to eight participants and removing the innovations introduced in World at War). The control system has been improved compared to COD3, even if it cannot boast the imaginative gimmicks of Medal of Honor: Heroes 2, nor the same precision. In this sense, the speech also concerns the graphics: while offering quite rich and detailed settings, as well as some good polygonal models for the characters, World at War on Wii suffers from a fluctuating frame rate, which often gives way to uncertainties. If we add that the sound sector (spoken aside) is too little incisive, the picture of the technical realization appears far from amazing. Despite this, the new Activision title stands as a reference product for Wii owners who want a solid, engaging FPS with the best online multiplayer ever seen on the Nintendo console. Pros The best online multiplayer on Wii Addictive and challenging Improved control system over COD3... Cons ...but precision is not its forte Frequent drops in frame rate Sound effects too ~fluffy~", "date": "2008-12-08", "grade": null}
