We therefore approached The Night of the Rabbit ready to suffer the childish irreverence or the cloying goodness of its protagonist, Jeremiah Hazelnut. We are glad we were wrong. Jerry is splendid in his twelve years. The developers had the excellent intuition to leave aside the usual graphic adventure protagonists, snooty and ready to mock anyone, victims of a galloping egocentrism, to instead outline a kid who believes in magic and is therefore ready to accept impossible characters he will meet on his way, without spending time making contemptuous judgments. They also managed to escape the trap of doing good, giving Jerry a good soul, but inclined to break some rules with the pirate smile of the child who has designed a plan that he already knows his mother won't be proud of. The success of this twelve-year-old hero is also due to the humble and cheeky style with which he was drawn, and to the effective interpretation of the voice actor, who with a musical and pleasant voice lightens even the less brilliant dialogues. Jerry is worth talking about so much because the heart of the story is mostly about him who, with only two days left before school starts again, makes a startling discovery in the woods near his home. In fact, he finds a trunk of junk belonging to a certain Zaroff, an illusionist by profession. For Jerry, who dreams of becoming a wizard, there is nothing more exciting. But the best of it is contained in a message that is delivered by mail via a flying letter and which contains instructions for a spell. Once the puzzle is solved, we will meet an elegant anthropomorphic rabbit named Marquis de Hoto, who will choose Jerry as his apprentice magician and will lead him to the city of Mousewood through a portal opened in the bark of a tree. Jerry thus crosses the threshold of the fantastic world of adventure and, like Carroll's famous Alice, meets impossible characters, finds himself in dreamlike situations and has to solve problems perhaps bigger than himself. But let's go in order. It's a tradition in Mousewood to throw a big party in honor of a new apprentice, and it's our job to help the townsfolk organize it before the actual training begins. Too bad everyone has other thoughts on their mind. Here then comes the time for Jerry to make a difference. From here on, the path will be long and very, very tortuous but it will lead us to make important discoveries about us and about the fate of Mousewood. Thank you all and see you next time This is Daedalic Entertainment's most ambitious adventure and in general one of the longest and densest of those released in recent years. The town of Mousewood, with its delightful anthropomorphic mice, hedgehogs, owls and frogs is an intricate fantasy world to be discovered in wonder. And to this are added four portals that Jerry will visit to learn spells useful for solving puzzles or revealing details of the plot. These are worlds outside of Mousewood's dimension, very different from each other in style and mood. But there is also the long final sequence set in a theater that seems to have come out of Kafka's America and that displaces us with its surreal atmosphere. In any case, it is not so much the number of screens that can be visited that makes The Night of the Rabbit a vast game, as much as the number of characters, jokes, references to European folklore, videogame quotes and above all puzzles that the developers have slipped into it, at the point of exaggeration. The third part of the game is in fact pulled away from the full-bodied central section and the clash with the archenemy disappoints in its banality, after all the efforts that The Night of the Rabbit made us make to get up to there. The overabundance of imaginative gimmicks perfectly recreates the wandering and overflowing imagination of childhood, but ends up watering down the story. The setting, on the other hand, is coherent and all its elements are linked together in harmony. Between the lines of the dialogues, the rich past of Mousewood can be glimpsed, told by the eight audio books hidden in the game, one of the extras that document the history of the world in which we find ourselves and give a sense of fullness and truth to the gaming experience. However, the pleasure of discovery is undermined by two defects, one related to the puzzles and the other to the story. We talk about puzzles in the next paragraph, so let's get to the story. The Night of the Rabbit may seem like a children's game, and will certainly delight younger players, but it contains enough substance to interest adults as well. Maybe just out of fearto seem childish, the developers have loaded the story with important meanings which, however, have no place in the development of the game. Towards the end the story takes a dark and sinister turn and the narrative accelerates to keep up with the narrative tension but precisely because of the many subplots it gets confused. Instead of following the golden rule of stories - show rather than tell - after a disappointing anticlimax, the game relies on a narrator who, aided by well-designed screens, explains what happened, revealing unthinkable backgrounds. As if to say: Dear player, drop everything and make yourself comfortable, because now I'll explain everything that happened in detail and then good night. With lots of sentences left hanging on black screens. We had to let our actions reveal the events without complicating things so much. In fact, what remains inside us is the taste of an intense adventure where friendship and solidarity triumphed in the end, rather than loss of innocence, vanity and failures of the ego. For us The Night of the Rabbit remains a story that recounts personal desperation in the face of adversity and the strength that comes from encountering the Other. It may be a simple message, but it's universal, and the fact that it's the only one that resonates when it's all over means it's also the most honest and heartfelt by the developers. The only one who, coincidentally, needed no explanation. But from the parts of Daedalic Entertainment they must be well aware of this if during the credits they leave us the possibility to say goodbye one last time to all the inhabitants of Mousewood who, with their unique voices and the most disparate personalities, have kept us excellent company. We have only fond memories of them. Bwahahah: suffer kid, suffer! Even the seasoned player will soon find himself banging his fists on the table, because Mousewood is as beautiful as it is devoid of logic in the sequence of its puzzles. Often a quarter of an hour is enough to understand which direction to go and which characters are involved in the solution, but immediately afterwards we get lost in the intermediate steps, the ones that provide us with the tools to complete the main puzzle. Too often we need to remember details and winks that the game gave us even long ago or hope to nail the starting point of the next step. We happened several times to wander around trying random combinations to move something, since it was not clear what the crux of the matter was. Sure, a magic ring locates sensitive spots in the environment around us but it's rarely the one that blocks us. Too bad because exploring Mousewood and talking to its inhabitants would be very pleasant if it weren't for the long moments of frustration, which reach their peak when the joke of the aids is discovered. Indeed, we have the right to contact the Marquis de Hoto to ask for advice. The first time we did it we felt like crying. In fact, the white rabbit limits itself to repeating the general instructions of our next task - that infamous one. However with dedication and patience and after hours of trying, The Night of the Rabbit allows itself to be penetrated and one gets used to its arbitrary choices. What we didn't go down with was the sadistic repeating puzzle sequence. After all the effort made to start that damn party in our honor, there is no significant advancement in the story or an animated sequence that gives us breathing space and makes us feel gratified, perhaps with some easy-to-solve problem that only serves to trigger new dialogues and happenings. Not at all. After one grind, another begins. Jerry, and us with him, breaks his back to open a portal and immediately has to deal with a rather difficult puzzle inside. He exits the portal to open the next one and, unceremoniously, off with another barrage of puzzles. The stick is fine, but then we demand the carrot, if not really a candy. What the heck: all heroes are entitled to their reward. If in the meantime you have doubts that this is not a classic point and click adventure, we can confirm that it is a more traditional one. The magic is just a nice veil under which the usual point and click mechanics move. And in the end the magic is just a detail. In fact, the nicest spell is the one that allows us to talk to anthropomorphic rocks. It's rarely used to solve a puzzle but on the other hand it gives voice to all those funny faces we've seen around from the beginning, adding flavor to the overall narrative of the world. Then there's a mini card game to play with some of the inhabitants of Mousewood and collectibles, including new playing cards and stickers. Of the tracce audio instead we have already told you. They're all clever gimmicks that enhance the experience, even if they offer no compelling reason for a second trip to Mousewood. Despite its shortcomings, The Night of The Rabbit is still a successful adventure, which leaves the sweet memory of a lively experience. How this is possible is difficult to say. It will be the explosion of imagination, the warmth of the characters, the variety of events. Or maybe the magic just works, and we just forgot. A captivating hero and memorable encounters make us forget the many flaws. This is magic.", "date": "2013-06-08", "grade": "7.6"}
