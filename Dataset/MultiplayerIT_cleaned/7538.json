In fact, practically one was released every year, and whether they were remakes, ports or completely new games, the fans were always satisfied. There are two characteristics that make them so special: first, the bizarre plot and, second, the absurd depth of the game system. We are talking about fights in which the characters launch attacks that cause literally millions of damage, practically the dream of every strategic enthusiast with a lot of time to devote to micromanaging stats, equipment and leveling. In short, if you can digest the generally somewhat old-fashioned technical sector, there is always a bottomless pit of options. It is also true, however, that Nippon Ichi's jRPGs in the long run ended up looking a little too much like each other: this is why The Guided Fate Paradox, in a certain sense, represents something new. Are you a god? Spiritual heir of that Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman released for PSP a few years ago, Nippon Ichi's new proposal immediately presents itself in a slightly different form, both in terms of content and graphics. Mind you, if you think you're in front of a game that squeezes the maximum power of PlayStation 3, then you will be disappointed. Nippon Ichi does not deny himself, and this time too he has only marginally taken care of the technical sector which, with the exception of the high-resolution sprites ~but not too much~, looks just like that of a last generation game. The polygonal backgrounds are essential, the textures dull, the animations not exactly very fluid. Most of the work is done by the clean and refined character design by Noizi Ito and the artwork that often forms the background to the endless dialogues completely in English, fortunately dubbed almost entirely and which can eventually be skipped if you get tired of hearing chatter the voices of the various characters. Which would be a shame, because behind the adolescent patina of a plot that seems to come out of a low budget anime, there is actually a rather intriguing story that offers many food for thought. The premise is quite simple: Renya Kagurazaka, a very ordinary Japanese high school student, wins the lottery in a shopping mall and is just informed that he has become the new God of Creation. Dragged into the otherworldly realm of Celestia, Renya finds himself surrounded by angelic beings who confront him with his new duties, among which is that of granting the wishes of all beings that exist in the universe, whether they are real or fictitious . Therefore, Renya is forced to explore the Fate Revolution Circuit, practically a virtual reconstruction of the ~prayers~ that have been addressed to him, populated by monsters and creatures opposed to change and which therefore must be eliminated. The plot, absolutely bizarre and full of humour, is soon seasoned by a quite interesting cast of supporting actors who stage the canonical battle between the forces of good and evil, sibylline suggesting slightly deeper themes that flow into the social and the moral. There is nothing particularly philosophical or psychological, but for the most attentive players the story will prove to be much more than a mere pretext on which to base dungeon crawling. Playstation 3 trophies The large array of Trophies involves achieving a wide variety of objectives, from the silliest (like simply watching the introductory movie) to the most complex ones (like throwing enemies fifty times). In the end, it will be possible to unlock about thirty bronze trophies, five silver, four gold and the ever-present Platinum. The best of both worlds? In any case, the Nippon Ichi titles are certainly not played for their bizarre plots or antediluvian graphics, but for the depth offered by bizarre as rich and complex mechanics. Earlier we mentioned Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman because indeed The Guided Fate Paradox has many more points in contact with that rather than with the latest iterations of Disgaea; nevertheless, there are not a few references and features borrowed from the main brand Nippon Ichi, and here and there you can also see the ideas conceived in other products (one above all: Makai Kingdom) and then resurrected and perfected for the occasion. The battles of The Guided Fate Paradox always take place on an isometric map divided into boxes, as in the various Disgaea, and here too it is possible to lift one's companions and throw them from one point to another to develop imaginative tactics, but otherwise there he is immediately faced with substantial differences that give him greater pepersonality. The player directly controls Renya, for example, and curiously all the other units on the map move only when he moves: therefore we need to think carefully from box to box on how to proceed, who to attack and how. Moving and acting, however, is tiring, and therefore you also need to feed yourself, collecting the food dropped by defeated enemies. In addition to micromanaging Renya's movements, one must also take into account his equipment, which levels up with him and, as per tradition, can then be converted and used to enhance the character's stats and abilities via the Divinigram screen . Given that Renya and company's special attacks depend on his equipment - which, moreover, includes really crazy stuff, changing the appearance of the sprite on the map with hilarious results to say the least - the player is therefore required to manage the limited inventory, fuse items and take advantage of already unlocked dungeons to upgrade our divine alter ego before venturing into the more difficult areas. Nippon Ichi demonstrates his strategic prowess again with The Guided Fate Paradox Godlike The Guided Fate Paradox is a title that is far from immediate and intuitive, mind you, as evidenced by the abundant hour of tutorials that are fed to us non-stop at the beginning of the adventure and which explain to us in detail only how start playing. As you continue in the adventure and you succeed or fail in the various enterprises, you unlock more and more features and options: from this point of view, the progression is studied with great meticulousness and you never get the feeling of being abandoned to themselves in a tangle of incomprehensible names, data and statistics as happened in some other game by the Japanese developer. The problem, if anything, is that The Guided Fate Paradox relies heavily on the perfectionist spirit of that niche of players who can't wait to sink their nails into a system that, at times, manages to be really bad. The floor plan of the dungeons is randomly generated, for example, and therefore you can end up in areas where it is not physically possible to survive. Death, however, is part of the game: Renya is in fact a god and therefore immortal, so his death is punished with the loss of all objects and levels that were with him at the time of his departure. However, the bonuses to the statistics remain, as well as the objects stored in the main hub of the game: with a little practice and a lot of patience it is possible - indeed, a duty - to exploit this mechanic to make our alter ego more and more powerful. The Guided Fate Paradox would have lent itself very well to quick games in which to nibble on some levels or objects before continuing in the main story, but unfortunately the home-made nature of the proposal and the decidedly awkward implementation of the checkpoints make the game and progression system especially suitable to those who want to commit themselves fully and have a lot of free time to dedicate to it. It goes without saying that it would have been the ideal jRPG to offer on PlayStation Vita, where the graphic carelessness would have been even less evident.", "date": "2013-10-26", "grade": "7.8"}
