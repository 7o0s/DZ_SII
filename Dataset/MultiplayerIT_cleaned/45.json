{"name": "Rampage: Total Destruction - recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rampage-total-destruction-recensione.html", "text": "Side effects As told in the animated introduction (mysteriously devoid of any translation, where the game has all the texts on the screen in Italian), the marketing of a new soft drink gets the company that produces it into trouble. In a limited number of cases, in fact, this drink has such side effects as to transform the drinker into a gigantic monster... The problem is that, given the diffusion of the product, the ~limited number~ in question amounts to almost thirty people... thirty huge creatures now intent on running around eight cities with the sole aim of tearing them apart. Of course, you are in command of one of these monsters and you will have to disintegrate entire neighborhoods trying to defend yourself from the attack of policemen and soldiers, as well as from the sorties of mercenaries hired by the company that produces the fantastic drink... The mechanics of Rampage: Total Destruction is, as in the intentions of the developers, extremely simple: once you have chosen a monster from those available, you will have to destroy various districts of a large city, to then arrive at a confrontation with a final boss. The game The numbers of this new Rampage speak of four game modes, eight cities divided into numerous districts, almost thirty selectable monsters and a multiplayer that can involve up to four players. In the ~Campaign~ mode, for only one player, you will have the possibility to choose a creature and then face the cities in sequence, with an increasing level of difficulty, which mostly becomes evident as the opponents increase. If initially the resistance of the authorities will be weak, in fact, already in the third city you will have to dodge the fire of the military and on several occasions look for energy refills among the ruins of the buildings that you are intent on demolishing. From this point of view, Total Destruction does nothing but maximize what was seen in the original game, since from the various windows and cracks of the buildings it is possible to collect numerous objects and upgrades. Furthermore, at the beginning of each stage you will be entrusted with an optional mission, which consists of collecting a certain number of objects to obtain a bonus in the form of a score or, better, a special move for your character. The game developers wanted to maintain the two-dimensional spirit of the original Rampage, adapting it to a three-dimensional context: the monsters also move in depth and the same buildings to be destroyed can also be facing each other. As a side dish, there are numerous animated elements: unaware citizens (which, of course, you can devour), policemen, cars and moving vehicles, helicopters and so on. The effect of general chaos fits well with Midway's intentions. The contour Alongside the ~Campaign~ mode, we find two modes that can be tackled in multiplayer, namely ~King of the City~ and ~King of the World~, together with a Time Attack in which to limit the speed of one's performance. The only difference between ~King of the City~ and ~King of the World~ is that the first sees us face the computer or a friend (or more: the maximum allowed is four participants) within a selected scenario , the second is a sort of ~Campaign~ made in multiplayer. In both cases, the destruction turns into a race and whoever scores the most points at the end of the stage wins. Given the nature of Total Destruction, they could not miss the repropositions of the original Rampage, in this case available in a version identical to the original together with the ~sequel~ Rampage: World Tour. The titles must be played using the Wii-mote horizontally as if it were a joypad, and the solution turns out to be spot on even in the case of World Tour, despite the fact that the A button is entrusted with the kick (a position that is at least uncomfortable, given the proximity to the directional cross). For the speed and liveliness of the graphics, World Tour is certainly more current than the first Rampage. [C] Demolished a building, you have to move quickly to the next one. There are many ways to hit buildings, but sometimes the collisions aren't accurate. Better not to take the train when there are giant monsters around... [/C] Technical realization On a technical level, Rampage: Total Destruction is a mix of ups and downs. One can't help but turn up one's nose at the lack of a 480p mode, replaced by the equivalent interlaced resolution, and the overall look of the game doesn't suggest any clever use of the Wii's features. On the new Nintendo console we have seen even worse, however, and in general the graphics of this title manage to be functional to the action and to give the idea of destruction in a convincing way. In the pascollapsing jokes in Total Destruction there is none of the detail seen in the best Xbox 360 games, that's for granted. The monsters are well done and are all nice, some more and some less. On the screen there is a large number of moving objects and the graphics engine manages to manage them well until you move on the scenario, causing the view to change (even if slightly): in that situation you notice some uncertainty, even if not serious. And the sound? Functional too, it creates the right atmosphere without excelling in any respect. On Wii the game uses the usual Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination, and the developers have organized the buttons in the right way: the analog stick to move the monster, A to hit and B to jump. Then there are various moves that must be performed by moving the Wii Remote, for example by swinging it you can grab people and vehicles, by shaking it while clinging to a building you can charge a particularly powerful blow, finally by ~squeezing~ the controller the monster hits with punch the roof of the building it is on. Comment Rampage: Total Destruction is certainly not a product without flaws: technically it is just ok, the control system is well thought out but the characters are slow to move and the mechanics are so repetitive that you lose interest in seeing the next city. But it also boasts some important merits: first of all it manages to maintain the spirit of the original Rampage, therefore all those nostalgic for the classic Midway will be able to try their hand at long sessions of total destruction. With all the limitations that this entails. Secondly, Total Destruction is sold at an affordable price, which should never be underestimated. Waiting for a possible revolution in the series, which may perhaps overcome the barriers of a gameplay based on two dimensions, this game deserves a vote that must be increased or decreased by one unit depending on your liking for Rampage. Pros: Technically decent Faithful to the original Affordable price Cons: Cumbersome control Very repetitive No support for 480p mode In the video game sector, attempts to re-adapt old classics to today's canons are wasted. Rampage: Total Destruction is therefore only the latest of this kind of product, which starts from a historical success of Midway (Rampage, in fact) and tries to update it on a technical level without affecting the gameplay.", "date": "2007-03-08", "grade": null}
