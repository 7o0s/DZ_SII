{"name": "Loadout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/128573-loadout-armi-pesanti.html", "text": "You say free to play and the chorus of disapproval, immediate, often unanimous and without the possibility of appeal, rises very high in the digital sky of the network, a symptom that this approach is not yet fully understood by a very large share of gamers, in particular by the hardcore one and more traditionalist. And yet, in addition to being a decidedly well-established model with rosy prospects for economic growth, the so-called free-to-play titles include ~big shots~ with vast and extremely satisfied communities: just think of Planetside 2 and Hawken, the much-appreciated World of Tanks, the League of Legends phenomenon and the spectacular War Thunder by Gaijin Entertainment, recently released also on Playsation 4. For certain genres, and in particular for those with a strong competitive component, the free to play model therefore does not represent a obstacle on the road to success, at least until it leads to the unbearable ~pay to win~ which systematically benefits those who decide to spend money, unbalancing production in terms of balance and foundations. The title that we are going to analyze in this article, the very fresh Loadout of Edge of Reality, fortunately does not fall into the second and hateful category, far from it. After having discouraged many gamers in the very first days due to heavy matchmaking problems, a couple of weeks after its launch we can safely say that this bizarre third-person shooter represents one of the most satisfying, honest and fun free to play experiences on the market. If you're curious, we'll tell you why later. Edge of Reality winks at Team fortress 2 with the bizarre Loadout The Clone War Take Team Fortress 2, add a splash of Team Fortress 2, mix it all together with a portion of Team Fortress 2 and, come on, you get the idea but throw in a nice dose of crass comedy stamped made in USA too on the face, or on the backside if you prefer. Yes, because like the irreverent and iconic shooter made in Valve, from which we say it draws ~profound~ inspiration, Loadout strongly leverages the comic and demented vein, however declined with a concentration of vulgarity, brutality and absurdity far beyond the politically correct . Between dismemberments, copious gushes of blood and viscera on display that support the grotesque spectacle on the screen, in fact, there is not an animation, a modality or a situation that is not made to elicit some healthy laughs, without losing sight the competitiveness - a little ~caciarona~, we admit it - of any more serious shooter. The beating heart and trademark of the Edge of Reality experience is the complete and vast customization of weapons; since the common classes of other similar products do not exist, in fact, it is up to the player through his own imagination, the credits earned in the game (called blute) and a boundless plethora of gadgets and accessories - for over 50 million different combinations - to create his perfect killing machine. Starting from one of the four basic chassis, i.e. rifle, beam, rocket and impulse, it is possible to modify an impressive number of settings which, progressing in the game, allow you to create guns with unique and incredible properties, from the sniper able to cure their comrades up to rifles that shoot spiked balls, passing through rocket launchers with the rate of fire of a machine gun. There is no doubt that facing players with certain weapons, given the boundless variety, one can feel a shred of imbalance, nevertheless the developers have done everything possible to make the firefights exciting even with less exotic and developed arsenals. A fundamental aspect of the upgrades is represented by the fact that they can only be purchased through the game currency, the aforementioned blutes that easily accumulate game after game. With real money, on the other hand, it is only possible to buy - and here lies all the admirable honesty of Loadout - the classic boosts for experience, provocations, slots and a generous set of trinkets and clothes to dress up and customize the aesthetics of the three avatars currently available, namely a shameless caricature of Rambo called Axl, T-Bone winking at Mister T and Helga, a kind damsel with some overweight problems. Just to give an idea of the costumes on sale and the irreverent tones of the game, think that it is possible to buy a completely naked version of Axl with blurred pixels which however do not hide some details at all and the state of ~cheer~ of the aforementioned. Mors tua vita meaThe gargantuan number of weapon upgrades and aesthetic items does not correspond to the same richness in terms of maps and modes, despite the four settings (Brewery, Night Crack, Trailer Parking and Destroyed) and the four game modes that ape the classic ones present in other third person shooters are more than enough to start having fun, waiting for the development team to add more predictable meat to the fire. The general level design is decidedly good and the maps, although not very large, develop both vertically and horizontally, offering numerous alternative routes and solutions for assaulting or ambushing the enemy. Although four against four may appear limited due to the type of game, oriented towards chaos rather than tactical prudence, it is instead the ideal solution, leaving ample room for maneuver - and therefore the possibility of success - both for those who approach as a wolf solitary and to those who decide to commit themselves for the good of the team. After all, there are excellent methods to be exploited in team play and composing a close-knit quartet is undoubtedly fun and effective, in particular in Extraction, where two ~collectors~ are drawn in turn with the aim of collecting and storing blutonium crystals, and in Martello Tyre, a capture the flag where the latter is represented by a lethal and gigantic hammer. The picture of the currently available modes completes Death Snatch, the classic deathmatch in which it is possible to collect the platelets (in this case the blutonium) of the fallen, and Blitz, the king of the hill of the situation where to win it is necessary to conquer and protect a certain point of the map. The gameplay and game modes, on the whole, do not offer anything particularly fresh or innovative, nevertheless everything works properly and, beyond a few small flaws still present in the matchmaking, the games flow smoothly and quickly as in the best titles paid counterparts. Free is nice The need to reach the greatest number of systems often requires the developers of free to play productions to pull the handbrake in certain aspects of the technical sector, however Loadout performs its task admirably also from this point of view, showing off graphics in pleasant and artistically cured cel shading. The video options are limited to the possibility of activating vertical synchronization, changing the resolution, the distance of the field of view and a generic quality level from low to high, all at the service of the gameplay which, thanks to a granite fluidity of 60 frames per second , it is perfectly usable even on configurations that are not the latest trend. The most interesting work has undoubtedly been done on the animations, capable of snatching more than one laugh due to the extreme caricatural violence seasoned with comic - sometimes vulgar - and absurd skits. Suffice it to say that in Loadout it is possible to continue playing even after losing your head (literally) after a firefight. Even the soundtrack and the sound effects perform their task discreetly, while the Italian translation, although the effort is appreciated, is totally to be reviewed and in some cases worthy of the best performances of automatic translators for the web. The netcode is solid, which today guarantees smooth games without particular latency and lag problems, after having created more than a few headaches in the very first days after launch.", "date": "2014-02-18", "grade": "8.0"}
