{"name": "Desperate Housewives", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/desperate-housewives.html", "text": "The isometric 3D board will have a different episode of the desperate housewives on the theme for each level and a corresponding setting of Wisteria Lane as a background, the inseparable friends will take turns as protagonists, forced to pull out their nails to defend themselves from the thousand pitfalls that infest every bet, it seems obvious to say but you will have to roll the dice and wait your turn hoping to land on a favorable box arriving at that of the clues before the antagonist. The clues are actually quizzes to test your knowledge and fidelity to the brilliant US ~soap opera~, solve them all and move on to the next episode, otherwise two steps back, loss of shift and head covered in ashes to make amends (in the sense figuratively!). The episodes, really many for a title on mobile, are divided according to the protagonist and the now usual rule applies that for each one you solve, new ones are unlocked, at the end of each one the time spent, the tokens collected will be counted and the clues challenge completed while in the opening we will have animated curtains that update us on the new emergencies of the four fascinating friends. But let's get to the special boxes: they can contain tokens (with which you can buy bonuses in the boxes marked by a trolley), mini-games (they will earn you extra dice rolls) and mystery cards (a bit like the ~Monopoly~ Unexpected). PRO more loyal than ever nice graphics AGAINST it's a board game impassive faces untied by emotions", "date": "2007-02-17", "grade": "S.V."}
