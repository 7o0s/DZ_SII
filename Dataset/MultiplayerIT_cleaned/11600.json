If we want, even the first chapters of the King's Bounty series were an attempt in this direction, but with an eye to the Heroes of Might and Magic model, while with King's Bounty 2 we are faced with something completely different and overall fresher, despite experiments in this direction have not been lacking in the past. To find out if the attempt was successful or not, continue reading the King's Bounty 2 review. Story and main characters King's Bounty 2: heroes are born, at least in Nostria The kingdom of Nostria is in danger and to save it there is a need to fulfill a prophecy that sees the arrival of a savior or a savior, the one or the one called to find out what is happening and why the forces of darkness are sprouting from everywhere. Who drives them? What are their goals? Why right now? At the beginning of the adventure you have to choose one of three heroes with whom to face the game campaign: Aivar, the classic mercenary warrior contemptuous of danger and a little cynical, disillusioned by the system and its representatives; Katharine, a sorceress from the Rigern region who wants to help her county free itself from the oppression of a noble profiteer; Elisa, a champion full of ideals, determined to defeat all the forces of evil that threaten Nostria. Based on the character chosen, the campaign will offer some differences, largely linked to the system of ideals, which we will discuss in detail in the next paragraphs. What does this mean? Let's put it this way: it takes about 50-60 hours to finish a campaign, but the characters and ideals allow you to replay it at least two more times, greatly multiplying the overall game time that the Prime Matter title has to offer. Once the bureaucratic issues have been resolved, let's try to understand what works and what doesn't work in this fascinating cocktail of genres. Once you have chosen one of the characters and passed the introduction, you can start exploring the first map, going on foot or calling a horse (useful for longer journeys to already known areas). Exploring you will also find obelisks that will unlock the fast travel, but let's say that the stages on foot will continue to be very frequent, given the large number of things hidden in the ravines of the scenario, which require you to look around carefully to be found, or the bonus structures that are worth a visit, such as manastones or altars of power. Also, while on horseback you can't talk to other characters, so you often have to get off if you don't want to lose important pieces of the game. King's Bounty 2: the RPG In King's Bounty 2 there are various types of units Let's get the poisoned tooth out right away and talk about the role-playing side of King's Bounty 2, which on paper is a really good idea: instead of sending the player's avatar around an isometric world with clearly visible enemies and power-ups, such as happened in the previous chapters of the series, we transform everything into an open world RPG in which you have direct control of exploration and in which to build a nice intrigue based on demonic powers and ancient prophecies, thanks to a rich cast of secondary characters to talk to and a varied series of main and side quests that push the player to travel the kingdom of Nostria far and wide. The main problem of King's Bounty 2 is that, however, it never manages to fully become what it would like to be. Now, don't misunderstand: the role-playing part works in general (especially thanks to the combat system), but it has limits that lovers of the genre will find annoying at the very least. The most obvious is in exploration: to ensure that the game world turns into a battlefield as needed and to manage progression without resorting to tricks such as random encounters or other similar gimmicks, the developers have opted for a very rigid design , in which it is possible to travel only on mapped roads, so as not to anticipate certain encounters. Not bad, given that it gives depth to the strategic part, one might say. King's Bounty 2: The fights take place on the same maps as in the RPG phase Too bad that when you find yourself unable to overcome simple rocks or very bland fences, which our character could easily climb over on foot (let alone on horseback), your nose turns up a bit. Absolute freedom would probably have been counterproductive for the game system as a whole, but some barriers could be made in such a way as not to seem absurd, thus undermining the suspension of disbelief. otherhe limit is that of the buildings that can be visited: they are very few. Most of the houses in the cities are mere scenery, as are those in the countryside, and you can only enter key places. What's less role-playing? Another problem, the most serious, concerns the system of ideals, which works very well from a strategic point of view, but from a role-playing point of view it is quite limiting. Also in this case everything is perfect on paper: during the missions the player can follow some ideals (four in all) through his choices. Each ideal unlocks skills (up to three times upgradeable) from a dedicated tree that are reflected to great effect on the battlefield, but inhibiting the other ideals. For example, a character who develops the ideal of order would penalize that of anarchy and vice versa. Based on the espoused ideals, units are more or less effective The problem is that following an ideal does not translate into trying to guess which decisions can make us go in one direction rather than another, but in always choosing the possibility with the icon of the ideal that we are interested in growing next to it. So, in fact, the system greatly limits the player's will, who will always be led, for a mere matter of convenience (unlocking the most powerful skills of the ideal of reference), to make certain choices, even when he deems them less interesting. To compensate there is certainly the replayability factor, which as already mentioned is very high, but which alone still fails to eliminate the perception of the limit that is imposed on the player, who always feels too guided in his actions. Let's take an example: in a quest we will have to choose whether to deliver a pig to a man who claims to be his friend and the rightful owner of the animal, or to a farmer, who claims to have paid for it regularly. Exploring the area where the two characters are, information can be found that clarifies the matter... but it's useless, because it's the icons that tell us what we need to do to grow certain ideals (and suggest who's right and who's wrong). ). So just locate the icon that interests us to decide, without asking too many questions and without wasting time hunting for documents, because in any case we will always be led to make the most convenient choice for our character's progress. Some units in King's Bounty 2 are very nice Having said that, don't think that as an RPG King's Bounty 2 is completely to be thrown away, because it is not. The world of Nostria is well constructed and interesting to explore, despite being faced with a fairly conventional fantasy. Some quests are well designed and allow different levels of insight, as well as visiting fascinating places, such as ruined castles, very dense woods full of mysteries, clearings populated by trolls and so on. The equipment system is also well done, with the weapons and armor worn appearing directly on the character. The equipment itself is also very varied and includes individual objects of different rarity and value and real sets, which when completed give big bonuses. Our heroes can therefore wield weapons, wear magical tunics or warrior armor, wear magic rings and other accessories. The systems for obtaining objects are the classic ones: by purchasing them from merchants, by opening the various containers scattered around the game world, as prizes for particularly challenging quests or fights. In addition to useful items and scrolls, there are also a lot of junk around, which can be sold to make money, so that we can buy other items or troops for our army. King's Bounty 2: the strategic King's Bounty 2: there are so many places to visit Where King's Bounty 2 shines is in the strategic part, that is when you go down on the battlefield, usually an area of the map that is divided into hexagons, in which the troops face each other in turn, following the initiative order dictated by their characteristics. As happened in previous King's Bounty, the hero does not participate directly in the action, but deploys some units, which can be purchased by visiting cities and camps, which he directly influences with the skills linked to the ideals and with the ideals he possesses. Each unit, in fact, is linked to a certain ideal and tends to react badly if coupled with units of different ideals or if led by a commander who has demonstrated that he follows a philosophy of life opposite to his own. The result is that you have to be very careful in the army composition phase, because even the strongest troops in the hands of the wrong commander, or with unsuitable companions, can be insignificant even againstmuch smaller units. Once a battle has begun, you have to deploy your troops according to your tactical preferences and the conformation of the theater of battle, which can be decisive in many circumstances. The first fights are very bland and direct and deliberately do not offer a great challenge to the player, to get him acclimatised with the game system, but when you start wandering around Nostria and find the most powerful enemies, King's Bounty 2 unleashes all its better cards, thanks also to its very rigorous design, giving the player something to meditate on, who often finds himself entangled in very difficult situations, which require a lot of lateral thinking to be overcome. King's Bounty 2 - one of the battles The system is so well done and offers such a tactical richness that the developers have taken the liberty of inserting ~chess~-like tests within the gameplay, in which predetermined armies are led against seemingly insurmountable opponents, just to make the player understand up to to where you can go in the use of certain units and in that of magical powers. The latter are the active part of the hero in battle: in fact, each turn it is possible to cast one or more spells (depending on the skills possessed), to try to help one's units. For example, it is possible to heal them, or harden their armor or maximize their damage. If desired, offensive spells can also be cast against enemies, or others aimed at weakening them. There are two types of spells: those learned by the character, linked to the values of the ideal magic, and those of the parchments, usable only once by everyone. The kingdom of Nostraa offers different biomes All these elements put together create a truly exciting mix, which largely compensates for the other defects of the game, so much so that you often find yourself exploring the map just to go looking for enemies to engage with, disregarding the rest . The units available are of various types: there are the classic human soldiers, divided according to their role (swordsmen, archers, knights and so on); there are the undead warriors who number ghouls, skeletal archers and ghosts in their ranks; there are magical creatures such as golems, spirits and elementals and, in short, there is all the typical sampling of the genre, including some special troops that give a lot of trouble and which characterize the advanced stages of the campaign. Technical issues One of the castles you can visit in King's Bounty 2 From a graphic point of view, King's Bounty 2 defends itself, although it is not a gigantic production. The game world is very varied and full of intriguing landscapes, but the individual objects are not exactly very rich and the general visual style is in the canons of the more commercial fantasy, so nothing particularly innovative. The most accurate part is certainly that of the combat, both in the animations of the units and in the effects of the various powers, whether of the units or of the hero). To use an overused expression, overall we are dealing with a good job, but nothing that makes us cry out for a miracle. The same goes for the soundtrack, which follows the stylistic features of the genre without trying to add anything, but also without disfiguring. If we wish, we can define that of Prime Matter as the perfect average production, that is, it is on a more than acceptable level, but without ever overdoing it positively or negatively. The important thing is that its gameplay works well.", "date": "2021-08-23", "grade": "8.0"}
