{"name": "WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2007 su PSP - La Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2007-su-psp-la-recensione.html", "text": "Yuke's programmers have faithfully reproduced the game modes featured in the home versions for PS2 and XBOX360 Divas and portable superstars After the quick intro (which will alternately display the Raw or Smackdown theme song... too bad they don't take advantage of the whole PSP widescreen...), we make our triumphant entry into the main menu of the game and giving a quick view of the game possibilities provided, we immediately realize that Yuke's programmers have faithfully reproduced the game modes present in the home versions for PS2 and XBOX360. In addition to the presence of all the possibilities present in the past editions (and therefore single matches, tag, three way match, fatal four, royal rumble, elimination chamber, buried alive, bar brawl, fullfill your fantasy), the novelty is represented by the ~Money in The Bank Ladder Match~, a match that involves 6 athletes in the ring ready to give each other a thrashing to get to the briefcase placed at the top and reachable only through the use of a ladder. The career mode, on the other hand, has remained almost unchanged from last year. Divas and portable superstars The presence of the ~General Manager~ mode was also confirmed, which can be considered as a reduced version of a classic management style in Football Manager and the like, only that here we will clearly find ourselves managing one of the federation's shows and our ultimate goal will be to have a greater audience than our antagonist. We are not dealing with a product capable of countering the masterpieces of the genre but it is undoubtedly a ~plus~ that could excite many wrestling maniacs also because the interface and game mechanics are clear and simple to learn and partially improved compared to last year. And on PSP there is also the editor with all the excellent features already highlighted for the home versions with a truly formidable possibility of ~customizing~ the entrances! So forget the very pleasant possibility of exchanging career data from PS2 to PSP and vice versa Weak points... exclusive... If up to now we have noted the strengths of the many game modes present, unfortunately the time has come to note the deficits of the title, moreover exclusive to the PSP version. So forget the very pleasant possibility of exchanging career data from PS2 to PSP and vice versa: the structural changes in the home format have made programmers recede from the feature inserted last year and in the 2007 version there will be no way for our progress to interact from one platform to another. Unfortunately, however, the absence of any possibility of online play has been confirmed: we can still make up for it with the ad hoc mode, with which we can take a beating in the company of other players who, however, have another copy of the game on their PSP. A few more grumbles should be noted for the infamous uploads, an element that negatively distinguishes many titles on the Portable Playstation: if Raw vs Smackdown has always been on PS2 has never stood out for its speed in terms of ~loading~, on PSP the problem becomes even heavier with truly frustrating waiting times which, however, fortunately, have been slightly reduced compared to last year. The Roster The time has almost come to get into the ring, but first let's analyze another very important element in a Wrestling game: the characters available. WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 is updated to spring-summer 2006 with the presence of some wrestlers who are no longer in the federation (starting with Kurt Angle who moved to NWA-TNA, but also Psicosis, Lita, Trish Stratus and others) while not the stars of the resurgence appear, within WWE itself, Extreme Championship Wrestling (and some wrestlers such as Sandman, Kevin Thorn and CM Punk we would have controlled with great pleasure instead). In addition to signaling the presence of Eddie Guerrero ~forever in our hearts~ among the wrestlers, the presence of a congruous number of legends should be noted: the ~regulars~ such as Hogan, Austin and The Rock are joined by other prominent figures such as Bam Bam Bigelow, Mr Perfect, Jim Neidhart, Dusty Rhodes, Tazz and more. The gameplay has remained almost completely unchanged from last year No Revolution As you probably already know, in the 2007 version for home consoles, WWE Raw vs Smackdown has been revolutionized in the control system, especially in terms of grips and interaction with the surrounding environment. On Playstation Portable, probably due to the lack of analogical levers, only the novelty of the multiple and decidedly spectacular ~grapples~ has been added. For the rest, the gameplay has remained almost completely unchanged(even on the PSP, however, the mini-games that started in some moments of the match have been cut, probably due to the negative feedback received from fans ...) compared to last year and even if someone can turn up their noses in the face of a revolution failed, the game remains without a shadow of a doubt very valid and absolutely head and shoulders above any product of more or less direct competition. Then confirmed all those possibilities for customizing the gameplay that we had so much appreciated last year: we will thus be able to operate on a series of parameters both in the capabilities of the AI and for the characteristics of the game itself (the loading speed of the finisher, the intensity of the damage of the latter and much more) thus giving the user the opportunity to fully customize their gaming experience. Music, Master! From a technical point of view, we can only congratulate Yuke's programmers as they confirm and improve last year's excellent performance. The three-dimensional polygonal models of the fighters are of absolute value with excellent animations for each superstar and the presence of aliasing in the contours of the figures has been significantly reduced. Moreover, there is not even one of the arenas seen on PlayStation2 and XBOX360 and made with great care, without neglecting any detail. Moving on to the sound aspect, the choice to accompany the matches not with commentary but with excellent and adrenaline-pumping decidedly rocking musical tracks has been confirmed on PSP, to the happiness of yours truly. Although the reason is probably due to a hardware limitation, the result for the end user is clearly preferable. From a technical point of view, we can only congratulate Yuke's programmers as they confirm and improve last year's excellent performance WWE in Video Library: The News If not even WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 in PSP format hasn't yet completely satisfied your hunger for Wrestling, we point out that three new DVDs dedicated to some Pay per View shows of the Stamford federation have recently been released. In Unforgiven we will be able to follow, among others, one of the most celebrated matches of the past year: the two superstars John Cena and Edge face off in a very violent TLC match. Between ladders, chairs and blunt bodies, will Cena be able to take possession of the champion belt again? Edge also has the advantage of playing at home, in his Toronto... During the show we will also be able to celebrate the farewell from the federation of Trish Stratus, one of the greatest female champions in the history of Wrestling and get excited with the incredible match between De-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) against the McMahon family aided by the giant Big Show. No Mercy instead proposes the incredible challenge between King Booker and three challengers for the world champion belt: The Animail Batista, the quarrelsome Irishman Finlay and the ex-marine Lashley in a truly exciting and non-stop fatal four way match! Also worth following is the match between Mr Kennedy and Undertaker and above all the one between Rey Mysteryo Jr and Chavo Guerrero, the latter accompanied by Eddie Guerrero's wife: Latino Heat is precisely the reason for a rivalry that has transformed the friendship between the two into a negative feeling that seems to know no end! Finally, Cyber Sunday is a pay per view decidedly outside the rules given that it is an interactive show in which many decisions on the progress of the matches are made by the fans who voted in various polls on the official WWE website before the event. The three champions of the federation's shows meet in the main event of the evening: John Cena, King Booker and Big Show. The fans will decide who will have to put their belt up for grabs and make it vacant in case of defeat. We will also be able to follow an unmissable tag team match between De-Generation X and Randy Orton with Edge. But who will be the referee of the contest: Vince McMahon, Erich Bischoff or The Coach? However, all three are bitter enemies of DX: for HHH and HBK it's time for overtime... If you were expecting the revolution that took place in the PS2 and XBOX360 versions as regards gameplay on PSP as well, you will be disappointed since compared to last year the improvements can be found in some small implementations for the grappling system, a filing to the graphics sector, some modes more gameplay and shorter but still excessive loading. Unfortunately, the absence of online gaming has been confirmed and the possibility of career interaction between PS2 and PSP has also been cut. The fact remains that we are always faced with the best Wrestling ever released on PSP. This is enough to recommend the purchase to those who run Wrestlemania in their veins... Pro WWE Smackdown vs Raw is the best wrestling for years Playability and editing at the highest levels Excellent audiovisual quality Cons Still excessive uploads Lack of online play It is no longer possible to make the careers of the PS2 and PSP versions interact with each other Wrestlemania will live forever After having complained about a somewhat bizarre programming of Smackdown on Italia1, finally Wrestling in our country has returned to catalyze attention as it happened in very recent times. The Mediaset network has returned to proposing the show in adequate programming spaces, while Sky has finally transformed a dream of Italian fans into reality: the live broadcast of the legendary royal rumble. So, infected by this return of Wrestlemania, let's immediately discover the PSP version of WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007...", "date": "2007-02-15", "grade": null}
