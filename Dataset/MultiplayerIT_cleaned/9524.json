We are facing a title with totally new gameplay that manages to create a fresh genre starting from the mix of many famous games of the past. The only common feature of all of these: the action, especially in multiplayer. Raskulls, an independent product from the same authors of the beloved Fruit Ninja of iPhone, but published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for its Xbox Live Arcade, draws liberally from the best arcade games ever: Mario Kart, Tetris, Super Mario, with a smattering of the good old Mr. Driller and the recent Castle Crasher (another excellent creature of the Microsoft on demand service). But let's go in order... A game with two faces Raskulls is a game that has the classic two sides of the coin, but surprisingly this time they are both positive. The first feature is that of being an excellent platformer, while the second is that of giving the best of oneself in multiplayer against three other friends. The single player part is made up of a fairly compelling story mode and made such by a plot which, although sketchy and useful as a mere pretext to start playing, is fun and full of irony. Raskulls cracks a smile during cut-scenes. But it's in pure play sessions that the real fun begins. To tell the truth, a level design made up of highs (very high) and lows (little lows) and colored almost as if it were drawn with a felt-tip pen just like Castle Crasher, frames a gameplay that many will remember some of the games most famous of the past. First of all Super Mario Bros, starting from the structure of the schemes inserted in the ~map~ of the world, to be faced one after the other through a road to be discovered slowly. But even during the game, the platform features follow the Nintendo masterpiece in some respects: swimming in water with a 2D view, jumping from one platform to another, slipping into tunnels, pipes and narrow spaces and then jumping out into other environments. But there's also a little bit of Mr. Driller. Who doesn't remember that curious puzzle game from Namco? You had to use the auger to go deeper and deeper, trying not to get crushed by the blocks above that gave way to our destructive passage. Similarly in Raskulls you have to make your way by destroying obstacles, stones, colored blocks and always trying not to stay under those that ~fall~ later. The fun of Raskulls, however, does not lie so much in its tested game mechanics, but in any case made fresh by this improbable mix, rather by knowing how to always create different situations and which challenge us in various ways, with a puzzle solving that becomes almost difficult man as we tackle the levels in sequence. Furthermore, between one scheme and another, it is possible to compete in some special events against other characters, and here we see what is the other ~side~ of the coin: the excellent multiplayer mode. Xbox 360 goals Like any self-respecting Live Arcade game, Raskulls also puts the canonical 200 points on the plate to unlock, through the same 12 classic objectives. 80% of the loot is taken home simply by finishing the single player, while the latest achievements are dedicated to multiplayer, decidedly affordable except for the one that will force us to ~break~ at least 20,000 blocks in any mode. Mario Kart Driller Crasher! The creators of Raskulls evidently had to be great Nintendo fans, given that their creature not only draws (as regards the single player) on Mario Bros, but also takes its cue from Mario Kart. This is evident in the multiplayer sessions, which can be played both online via Xbox Live and in split screen comfortably on the sofa at home with three other friends. It competes over the length of four races, in as many as 16 grands prix. The goal is obviously to reach the finish line first and thus earn more stars than the opponents: at the end of the four competitions, whoever has the most stars wins and gets on the podium (does this remind you of anything? Always him, yes!). The characteristics of the single player remain unchanged: platforming, breaking colored blocks (which cancel each other out if they fall on other blocks, just like in Tetris), trying to grab as much energy as possible to sprint, a sort of sudden acceleration. During the races it is also possible to take gift packages which contain various power ups to be used to our advantage, or directly to be launched against the opponents. There is no savoir faire during the races, as you can jump over the heads of our enemies, kick them, throw objects at them and possibly knock them out (for a few moments). The races are absolutely frenetic and fast, so much so that it is often not donenot even in time to understand ~what~ or which item, powerup or skill we have taken and can use. It therefore takes a lot of practice, a glance and an aptitude for the genre to know how to master it properly; its gameplay is decidedly deep and captivating, made up of a thousand facets all to be discovered and learned to best manage. This is a characteristic only of great games, or rather, those with solid and deep gameplay, exactly as the developers of Raskulls have managed to do.", "date": "2011-01-14", "grade": "8.3"}
