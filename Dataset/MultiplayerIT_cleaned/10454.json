But the frozen expanses of the Arctic, of course! If in the first Motorstorm the dirt tracks were the masters, in short, in this conversion for PSP snow and ice will make the rear end of our car skid. As per tradition for the series, the numbers speak for themselves: eight classes of vehicles with three different models to unlock for each one, who battle it out in twelve tracks for a total of more than one hundred races. Access to the races takes place through a ~level~ system that rewards ours successes also through the now inevitable ~achievements~, so if there is one thing that Motorstorm does not lack: Arctic Edge is quantity. The main game mode sees us select a different vehicle from race to race, then collect as many points as possible to level up and unlock subsequent events. The customization possibilities go beyond ~tuning~ as it is generally understood and are limited to aesthetics, but the freedom we are given is great: we can really indulge ourselves between paints, rims, spoilers and vinyls, saving the result on Memory Sticks. We must keep in mind the arcade nature of the BigBig Studios product, which is first and foremost evident in the behavior of the cars on the track. Riding motocross bikes, for example, often proves to be a ~bouncy~ experience, with wheels that feel like they can take any bump without warping and a fire engine that only stops when we press against a wall. Getting behind the wheel of a big truck is clearly different, but the feeling of ~heaviness~ of the vehicle is hardly rendered at all, so in any case expect spectacular jumps and very unrealistic agility, which is limited only by the setting of the sharpest curves. The very fast crawlers follow more or less the same philosophy, while the buggies are almost always slow and counterbalance with a certain stability even on the most slippery areas. Lastly, a large-engined car is probably the best choice in terms of speed, resistance and grip. The harsh law of the turbo The atypical choices made for the control system, which sees accelerator and brake assigned to the back buttons, find a reason already after a few seconds from the start. In fact, the fundamental element to control and manage within the races is not the mere gas pedal, but rather the turbo. Activated by pressing the X button, the turbo not only makes the difference between winning or losing a race, but is also and above all called into question during cornering. Let's say, for example, that our car is negotiating a slippery corner at full speed: the rear end loses more and more grip and the car starts to skid, coming dangerously close to a barrier. At that point, the activation of the turbo produces a thrust that corrects the trajectory and allows us to overcome the bend unscathed. Clearly this is a limited resource, which must be managed in the best possible way: when we activate the turbo, a bar on the left side of the screen begins to fill up, and not paying attention to it can result in the literal explosion of the engine. Spectacular, perhaps, but far from convenient in the economy of the race. Accidents are managed by Motorstorm: Arctic Edge in a visually ~intense~ but all in all rapid way: if we crash into a wall, we will see our vehicle fall apart during a sort of sadistic ~bullet time~, to then be put back on track like new after a few moments. No one expected a damage system that would affect our performance on the track, let's be clear: Motorstorm has always been something different, completely devoted to fun and frenzy. And when the numerous races of the main mode get a little boring, we can try our hand at some timed races or online multiplayer, a really valuable addition. The snow falls smoothly Despite having to work with a much less powerful console than the PlayStation 3, where the series originated, the game developers have done a great job when it comes to graphics. The tracks available are very well differentiated, characterized by an excellent level of detail and a good use of colours. The classic ~sketches~ on the screen are nice and well implemented, as are the jumps and alternative routes, which are really numerous. The lighting system, complete with reflections from the sun, works well despite its simplicity, and the frame rate remains fluid and stable even in the most difficult conditions. The views available are not mmany, but in all cases they offer good control of the road and don't seem to be added just to make up the numbers. The polygonal models of the vehicles are not splendid, but they are well done and if necessary they ~disassemble~ in a plausible way. Certainly the customization options add a nice touch to everything, allowing our vehicle to stand out over the others with just a few touches. The signature soundtrack offers a good selection of upbeat and upbeat tunes, perfect for the type of action shown on screen, while the effects do their job more than decently.", "date": "2009-10-20", "grade": "8.0"}
