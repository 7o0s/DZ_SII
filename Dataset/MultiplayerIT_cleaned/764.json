{"name": "Castlevania: Lament of Innocence", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-lament-of-innocence_a.html", "text": "I will be your nightmare Lament of Innocence has its roots in the eleventh century after Christ and revolves around the figure of Leon Belmont, first ancestor of the famous lineage of vampire hunters of the Belmonts, who repeatedly made his appearance in the saga. Leon is a knight of an aristocratic nature (clearly visible also from the design adopted for his realization) in the service of the kingdom and the clergy. But the appearance of strange undead creatures will disrupt his existence, and when his girlfriend Sara, who was about to marry, is kidnapped by these creatures, all that remains is to abandon his position and go in search of his beloved. Soon Leon will meet Rinaldo, a person with a mysterious past who lives on the edge of Dracula's castle, and who will provide, thanks to his alchemy arts, a whip to the main protagonist, who will accompany him for the duration of the story. 'adventure. However, the famous vampire does not seem surprised by his arrival, and has indeed prepared many traps and dangers in the path of the main protagonist, who will have to defeat five bosses (located in as many areas) before being able to face the lord of the castle. For this new episode in three dimensions Konami has decided to adopt a camera that follows the player in a dynamic way without the possibility of being controlled, in a very similar way to what has already been seen in more recent productions such as Devil May Cry. This allows you to have a very precise and similar control to the two-dimensional counterparts, but leaves room for various criticisms during the platform phases: in fact, since the movement is relative to the camera, it will not infrequently happen to make a mistake in a sequence of jumps just because the angle of the view does not exactly render the sense of depth or direction. Gothic blood Another questionable choice is the abandonment of the character growth system based on level progress, in favor of collecting some power-up items that will increase the energy bar or the protagonist's hearts. The latter will be used for the use of the secondary weapon (among the five available), which can be enhanced by acquiring some spheres released after defeating the boss of a particular area and in a very similar way to what has already been seen in example in Harmony of Dissonance for Game Boy Advance. Another possibility for Leon will be to use his magic arts using an enchanter's glove, unfortunately their number and use is very limited by the high amount of mana used and by the recharge method, which occurs by parrying some special actions performed by the opponents and graspable by a purple light that will anticipate the particular move. The game dynamics will therefore be more focused on the use of the glove to parry, on the whip and on secondary weapons, which in some cases will allow you to perform ranged attacks, in order to set up a minimum of strategy in relation to the enemies to face. Leon will be able to heal himself thanks to some potions that can be released by enemies or purchased at Rinaldo's shop, while their use will take place in real time by pressing the R3 key. The five different locations can be tackled in any order, the setting, the music and the enemies to face will change, but the actions necessary for their completion will be the same: find some objects, go through long corridors and large rooms interspersed with short platform sections, face the relative boss. If apparently the game mechanics seem similar to the previous chapters, a fairly repetitive level design and an artificial intelligence that is not skyrocketing (if we exclude the Bosses, who offer a good challenge) make the action devoid of big original cues. Fortunately, most of the time the same turns out to be frenetic and fun, the control system does its duty, the secrets are always present in good numbers and the atmosphere you breathe is that typical of the Castlevania series. Technically there is no there is nothing to complain about, the stylistic work done by the Konami graphics is there and it shows, in particular as regards the design of the enemies, the settings and the textures, which, although average in terms of definition, reach much higher peaks in as for inspiration. The graphics engine grinds a fair number of polygons and returns valuable plays of light, all at a constant 60 frames per second. The same excellent work was done for the audio sector, which largely contributes to the gothic atmosphere of Lament of Innocence: the use ofchoirs, violins and pianos fit perfectly with the setting of the game, and their quality is always very high. Finally, we close our analysis of the game with the signaling of the presence of the 60hz mode and the translation into Italian, present in the subtitles and free of gross errors. Comment Castlevania: Lament of Innocente is a decent action game, technically flawless and fortunately far from the unfortunate episodes that appeared on Nintendo 64. Most of the elements and atmospheres typical of the series are present and the transposition into three dimensions is successful, but unfortunately a flat level design and the abandonment of role-playing components make Lament of Innocence a title without bite and that game depth that characterized the best episodes of the saga. A half-successful title, which unfortunately only partially recalls the spirit of Castlevania. Pros: Stylistically and technically excellent Fast-paced and fun Successful 3D transposition of the series Cons: Lack of RPG component Flat level design Fluctuating challenge level How much can charisma, setting and game system affect the tastes of gamers? Really a lot, and Castlevania is the prime example of this. A true cult phenomenon for several generations, the Castlevania series is considered by many to be one of the greatest expressions in terms of video games developed on two dimensions, thanks above all to the three aspects mentioned above. While it continues to shine with its own light on the small laptop made in Nintendo, it hasn't gotten the same luck passing through the transition to three dimensions, with two chapters on Nintendo 64 appearing decidedly below expectations. After a few years of absolute silence Konami has therefore decided to try again believing that the times were now ripe, and has decided to entrust Lament of Innocence to the team of Koji Igarashi, author among others of one of the greatest exponents of the series, or Symphony of Night . So all the premises were there, but unfortunately they were only partially maintained", "date": "2005-11-10", "grade": null}
