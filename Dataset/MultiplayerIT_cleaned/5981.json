Almost unknown in our territories, the series is instead quite followed and appreciated in Rising Sun, where five chapters have been made in the space of twenty years. The first saw the light on Super Nintendo in 1994, replaced a couple of years later by a sequel intended for the first PlayStation in the PC world. In the recent past, however, an episode for PSP, entitled Umihara Kawase Portable, and later a compilation intended for Nintendo DS were marketed, but these were always and in any case products destined to remain within the Japanese market. Sayonara Umihara Kawase has instead embarked on a real change of course, allowing the saga to be cleared for the first time in our territories as well. After having told you about the Nintendo 3DS edition, which has been available on the market for over a year, it is therefore time to also review the PC conversion, which was published on the Steam pages last October 6th. If the protagonist of this title suggests very little to you, we can assure you that the name of its creator will help you even less. In fact, we are talking about Kiyoshi Sakai, a programmer and designer who in fact has not reached the eyes of the Western public. Sakai has always professed to be very skilled in the creation of complex game systems and in the development of an essential level design but at the same time oriented towards making life difficult for the player. Curiously, the extremely conservative philosophy and the presence of such rigid ideas have contributed to making the already reduced development team take an inverse path compared to the current models, much more focused on economic sustainability than on naked and raw passion and with a tendency to focus on growth. Apparently Sakai doesn't seem to be in the least interested in linear paths, just think that the original chapter for Super Nintendo was created by only six developers, while for the creation of Sayonara Umihara Kawase the TNN / NHK SC team is now smaller than it was was just starting out, relying only on the support of a programmer and two designers. After all, it doesn't sound so strange that the series has struggled to find its own market space outside the oriental landscape, especially for its conceptual extremisms. Sayonara Umihara Kawase is an immediate platformer but also rather difficult to complete Multipurpose fishing line In the game it is not at all obvious, but Umihara Kawase is a chef specializing in the preparation of Japanese sushi, which is why we meet her armed with a fishing line and a hook. So far there wouldn't be much to object to, were it not for the fact that the fish present in the more than sixty available levels have legs and wander about on the surface. It is equally true that the absurdity of the maps within which one moves soon leads one to assume that the world with which one is interacting is only a hallucination, or perhaps a dreamlike representation filtered through the eyes of the young Kawase and her desire to get fresh fish for your business, with all the complications involved. Leaving aside the non-existent narrative premises, the most interesting mechanics of this title refer to the functioning of the line and its elastic capabilities, which have been reproduced with great attention. Kawase is able to use this tool to cling to the platforms that make up the scenarios in various ways, so as to find the most suitable way for the conclusion of the level. You can attach yourself to a ledge and swing to jump further, pull yourself up or drop down, as well as catch hiking fish with the push of a button. There are some aesthetic comparisons with Bionic Commando - a great Capcom classic in which a grappling hook was widely used - but the differences appear substantial already after acquiring an initial familiarity with the physics of this instrument, which proves to be much more flexible and articulated. The game levels are not particularly extensive and develop from a starting point to a closing point, in which a door is positioned that allows you to exit and unlock the next stage. Time represents one of the most important variables as there is a stopwatch that keeps track of performance, and then places it within special leaderboards that collect all the best performing walkthroughs. There is also the opportunity to sharpen the view to seize secret exits and unlocksthus some bonus levels, otherwise not accessible from the main map, and also three extra characters who will be able to replace Kawase and extricate themselves in the labyrinthine levels. The most glaring problem of this title concerns above all the imbalance that is perceived in various segments of the adventure. In many situations the level of difficulty is not so much linked to the amount of skill in the player's possession, but rather to a control system that is too limiting, which punishes exaggeratedly without being sufficiently satisfying in the moments in which success is achieved. Kawase's movements are very limited, the jumps minimal, the line is effective in some situations while in other cases it is not as dynamic as one might expect. There is no shortage of sources of frustration even during boss fights, since they will have to be defeated only by following specific environmental interactions and without being shown clues on how to move. Masochism is wasted, the choice to punish the player even without real motivation seems to be a specific design choice that embraces the control system even before the levels. From an exquisitely visual point of view, Sayonara Umihara Kawase certainly does not leave one crying out for a miracle, the details of the settings are as extravagant as they are spartan and the same can be said for the amount of animations that have been attributed to the protagonist and to the enemies scattered within the maps. The feeling of bitterness in the mouth is also perceived on the sound side, excessively repetitive, poor in inspiration and all in all out of context with respect to the type of gameplay that is proposed to us.", "date": "2015-10-13", "grade": "6.5"}
