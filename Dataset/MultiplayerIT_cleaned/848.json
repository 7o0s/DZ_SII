It certainly cannot be said that the developer Eutechnyx has no experience in the field of racing games. LeMans23, Street Racing Syndicate, TestDrive, Formula 1 Grand Prix, Ford Racing. These are some of the works that bear their signature. None of them of excellent quality, to tell the truth, but in any case they represent a good background on which to develop a new racing title. Truck Me Harder tries to have some semblance of completion, not just being a truck game. For example, it has a story. In the first chapter, Big Mutha Trucker, the main character was Mamma Jackson, who all alone in running the family trucking business selected the goods, loaded them and trucked them around the country and the boundless map. This sequel faithfully follows this storyline making us find Ma Jackson in prison accused of tax fraud and all that will remain is us children to get her out of prison. It certainly cannot be said that the developer Eutechnyx has no experience in the field of racing games... Mommy Jackson needs help! The cousin and lawyer Cousin Jacob takes on the job of defending the Mother in the trial, but his account is very salty and therefore we will find ourselves taking control of the company and getting behind the wheel, to raise the money necessary to face the trial and pay our relative. There are basically three ways to get money. The simplest, and the heart of the game, is to buy goods and sell them elsewhere at a higher price. Or we could take part in some special missions characterized by driving tests with some weird means of transport. The last method, the most difficult and risky, is that of gambling which we could participate in by stopping in one of the many clubs scattered along the highways. The linearity of a highway. The main game mode, the one that sees us grappling with the sale of goods and materials, is quite monotonous. The settings are all almost similar and do not offer a great variety of landscapes. But regardless of that, the problem is that the truck driving simulation isn't very polished. Betraying its Arcade nature, all the vehicles in Truck Me Harder 2 are driven in more or less the same way, without distinction. The game map is quite large (certainly not at the levels of a GTA or True Crime), and will itself show us the most convenient destination on where to go and resell our goods. Goods that can be materials such as wood or water, or items to be resold. At the end of each ride we will be faced with a choice: enter one of the bars, sell or buy. Betraying its Arcade nature, all of Truck Me Harder 2's vehicles drive more or less the same way The linearity of a highway. A bit limiting. Just as the video sector is limited, worthy of a low budget title. The use of polygons is sparing, and even if the Xbox (and PC) version is superior to the PS2 counterpart, the feeling of incompleteness and carelessness in the development is evident. Textures are more detailed than the PlayStation2 version, but still below par. The framerate on Xbox is more stable and smooth. Even the audio sector suffers from the general mediocrity of the game, and its quality is directly proportional to the price of the title in question: honest. Comment Truck Me Harder 2 is an unpretentious title, except to make us smile. The characters are nice and well characterized, but the depth of the game is reduced to the bone. Traveling from one part of the map to another is fun for a few minutes, but basing an entire game on this concept is pretentious. Moreover, the simulation capacity of the title is poor, and each Truck will be almost identical to each other in the response of the Joypad. If we add a general graphic and sound flatness, it's easy to understand how Truck Me Harder 2 is very repetitive and not very rewarding. Any online mode, if well thought out, could have been redeeming, at least for this Xbox version. Unless you're an avid highway-loving trucker, stay away. Pros: Well-crafted characters Added minigames compared to the prequel Cons: Technically mediocre Repetitive gameplay No extra (live) content for Xbox The English developers Eutechnyx try once again to entertain us with those beasts of the road which would then be the 18-wheel Super Trucks. About five years ago SEGA had surprised the gaming world by proposing an entire cabinet dedicated to one of these monsters of the asphalt. Vibrations, horn and mega-screen helped a lot in identification. Only one beauty was missingbeer and some blondes in jeans to soap the hood, and the feeling of being a real trucker with stars and stripes was served. Although 18 Wheeler was a good game and was a lot of fun, also given its Arcade nature, the latter represented a major limit in the depth of the game. Truck Me Harder tries to take the concept born from SEGA and to develop it further, thus proposing it with a much stronger appeal, as far as a truck game can have.", "date": "2005-09-08", "grade": null}
