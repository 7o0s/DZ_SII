{"name": "WorldShift - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worldshift-recensione.html", "text": "The single player for online The idea behind WorldShift is to amalgamate all aspects of the experience, making sure that the user is encouraged to experience both the single player campaign and the multiplayer, cooperative and competitive modes, and tying them together in in such a way as to make it one big adventure. By completing solo missions you will therefore earn special items of increasing importance with which to customize the troops used when challenging other human opponents - these rewards cover all three races, which will be freely selectable outside of single player - and similarly you will have to clean up the maps for the cooperative unlocked from time to time, eliminating the most disparate enemies in order to obtain rewards of equal value with which to improve. The many artifacts obtainable by progressing as described above are joined by abilities, valid for all units or specific to the heroes and their officers, which are unlocked by spending the special xenolite points obtainable through the devices scattered throughout the game environments or by recycling the objects that they consider themselves useless for their purposes. These mechanics prove to be decidedly more agile and easier to understand when putting them into practice and represent the success of the development team's vision, which thus wanted to combine the supporting structure in full RTS style with many nuances taken from the world of role-playing games and also from MMOGs, given that every statistic and modification made will be memorized only and exclusively on the game servers, making them persistent and allowing them to be accessed from any computer on which WorldShift is installed. The 18 missions that will make up the plot and the 8 coop maps to be played in the company of up to two other adventurers take up a few dozen hours of play, while the competitive challenges - from two to six players - will be a full-bodied end game and lasting, for which, however, there is a lack of options that go beyond the simple challenge to the death. However, new modes can be added in the future, perhaps already with the first update expected shortly after the official release. Immediacy and thinking small Once you get onto the battlefield, you almost instantly feel at home: the troops move like in any other strategic game, with the mouse as the absolute protagonist and well supported by an interface that allows you to move along the map with just a few clicks and select all skills, common or specific, collected in a special bar. The action unfolds fast-paced and nonstop, with hordes of enemies to destroy, positions to capture and defend, and all the other tasks you'd expect from a real-time strategy game. Rather than putting the user at the head of a huge army, it was preferred to place him in the position of selecting a few dozen units, to be managed carefully, exploiting their individual peculiarities and being careful to divide them sparingly, given that the risk of having multiple groups in constant inferiority is tangible. Always in the name of rhythm, the resource management phase and the building construction phase are extremely thin: each race has a main structure for the extraction of xenolith, capable of fleshing out and replacing troops, activating some special abilities and to evolve when certain requests are met. The complex that is thus created is fun and well suited to an apt difficulty curve, even if it must be noted that in the single player you feel, in the long run and after several missions completed, a certain repetitiveness in the objectives offered. The structure of the maps is also averagely good: articulated at the right point and with more ways to go, weak perhaps only in their cooperative version, given that the random creation of the same in this context - intended to make replayability more pleasant and sensible - leads to a not always perfect disposition of the enemies, as often happens when it is decided to develop this kind of algorithms. Mama Blizzard Visually, the work done is pleasant and valid, with the artistic side that owes more than a debt to titles such as Starcraft and Warcraft, understandably taken as models to then develop and customize a world between sci-fi and fantasy. The settings that have a certain variety while often remaining linked to those already seen on many occasions are beautiful, which are crossed by equally valid polygonal models, only occasionally not very detailed but often animated with imperfect movements. There are also several computer graphics videos, which do not make a miracle but perform their narrative task well and are strong in good direction. Totalpositively positive, also by virtue of hardware requests definitely within everyone's reach. The sound is also good, equipped with normal effects and epic music at the right point, managed in such a way as to start and adjust according to what happens on the battlefield, in a dynamic way. Text and speech are in Italian, as well as all the rich manuals. Finally, a mention of the menus, which in addition to the usual options hide a chat to view the players online at that moment, allowing you to invite them to talk privately and organize games with them. During installation and at each launch, then, a special launch center of the application will accompany with films or special initiatives relating to the community of enthusiasts linked to the Spanish publisher. on Spanish soil On the occasion of the launch of WorldShift it was possible to travel to Madrid and visit the headquarters of FX Interactive. The general impression received during the day was positive beyond all expectations, especially for the clarity of intent demonstrated by speaking with those who have been building this reality for years: the process of selecting the titles to be published - or republished -, a pricing policy as good for users as for FX itself and the idea of focusing on just the two markets of Spain and Italy, form an atypical picture compared to the giants usually taken into consideration, but which obviously works. In addition to the launch of the games and their editing phase, FX Interactive is currently developing a title internally, Navy Moves, of which little information is still available, except that it will be the sequel to an 80s success by the original Spanish developer and which will involve the interaction of multiple media, including mobile phones and the Internet. Comment WorldShift is a successful experiment: the newest ideas have been placed in the structure that manages the growth of its units and the integration of game modes, while once you start a mission or engage in a fight with other human opponents, a more traditional, pleasant and immediate gameplay. The intention to expand this universe and the persistent nature of the player profiles leave ample room for future additions, who will also be able to count on a good technical profile, capable of not aging within a season. It will hardly win the palm of best title of the year, it will certainly be very welcome on hot summer days, also leaving some money in your pocket for ice creams and granitas.
