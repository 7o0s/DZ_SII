{"name": "Il bello del Circus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108512-f1-2012-il-bello-del-circus.html", "text": "The sad refrain that sees sports titles always the same from year to year seems to no longer sound. Games like FIFA and PES, not to mention products like NBA2K and NHL, have proven that twelve months is more than enough time to innovate, improve and add content. In this sense, F1 2012 is a perfect example of how to develop an annual game. The framework is the same, of course, but Codemasters Birmingham has been able to remove where it should have been removed and add where it felt the need to add, trying to improve everything to offer the definitive Circus experience. The developers therefore concentrated on making everything faster and more usable, favoring both the most passionate and hardcore users and those who want a less demanding but never banal and not very exciting gaming experience. Much more, a little less The choice therefore fell on proposing the usual and effective scalability of the driving physics (combined with numerous levels of difficulty and artificial intelligence) but above all on adding a couple of new game modes, to meet all types of users. The Grand Prix mode has been removed, alongside the Career, the quick race, timed and against the time, we find in addition to the interesting, but little more than a tutorial, tests for young drivers, the Champion mode and the Championship challenge. It is possible to summarize this new game offering in one simple sentence: all the thrill of the races but without the delays of the Career. The Champion mode sees us engaged in a series of particularly complex scenarios that throw unexpected events such as tire decay, rain, safety car and much more into the fray. You then enter the middle of the competition, fighting against particularly adverse situations. We start off strong right away: in the role of Romain Grosjean, in the Formula 1 temple of Spa, we have to try to pass teammate Kimi Raikkonen, with the last three laps available and a nice group in front of us to slow us down further. We could say nothing shocking, but when you have to attempt the impossible in the wet like at Silverstone or Brazil, the music changes, not to mention the fearsome last race. You have to give it your all right away, but without the worries that afflict us in your Career, and within three to five laps, push hard without compromise. Our advice is to try immediately (if you know the slopes perhaps) with the highest level of difficulty, intermediate poses a good challenge without a doubt, but if you already have an ~important past~ in the Circus you risk reaching the end without too many worries. In short, Champion Mode is a lot of fun and, as previously written, like the Championship challenge it allows us to ~cut~ the long physiological times of the Career, without losing all the charm of the extreme situations in the race. Championship Challenge is a mini Career over ten races without the long weekends of practice and qualifying. A test ride and immediately on the track, so knowing the tracks is a great advantage. There's no checking for fuel consumption or tire wear. The only thing to keep an eye on is the rival you chose before getting into the single-seater. If you cross the finish line before him, there's a good chance that the other teams will offer us a contract, thus moving from one team to another during the same season. Here too you ride without compromise, there are a few laps available in which you don't have to make calculations, but keep your foot down until you see the checkered flag. The real life of the pilot In short, these two new modes work very well in condensing the best of the Circus. In fact, a Career is not something to be undertaken lightly. If you choose to do the entire race weekend with all the trappings of the case, even keeping the number of laps of the race to a minimum, you will find yourself spending almost a good couple of hours per track. Without forgetting the ~pleasant stress~ that it entails, partially mitigated by the possibility of pressing the rewind button up to a maximum of four times. In short, F1 2012 is not aimed only at hard-core drivers, but also at those who want the best experience ~everything at once~ and it undoubtedly hits the target. So far we have talked about what F1 2012 offers as ~secondary missions~, but obviously the heart is the real Career, to be tackled according to one's taste since we can adjust a wide range of parameters in order to face the seasons just as we want. We can calibrate the difficulty automatically by modifying all the values together, or one by one, in order to tailor the experienceof game. ABS, traction control, automatic brake, but also assistance at stops, dynamic trajectory, aesthetic and mechanical damage, up to the regulation and artificial intelligence of the opponents. Everything can be changed, the title (like the previous editions anyway) does not place constraints on us to try to diversify each single sector as much as possible. Once the career has begun, the first difference with the past is that the game's television apparatus has been completely removed. You enter the pits from a quick summary screen and from there you start the sessions. The Career mechanism has remained unchanged, we start with a low-profile team (how low it is relative to the level of difficulty chosen) to attempt the climb to the world championship and to the top teams, but this time the pantomime of the interviews has been completely eliminated , which should have altered the relationship between driver and mechanics/engineers, thus impacting the development of improvements to the car during the course of the season. Now the improvements must be earned by sweating on the track, reaching objectives on particular tracks that are set for us at the beginning of the season. If we manage to exceed what the team proposes over the course of a weekend, we will be given, for example, improvements to aerodynamics, kers and more. This method undoubtedly makes the refinement of personal skills more tangible and effectively takes us inside the Circus. But the best is when before the race we have to establish the race strategy. That is when to stop to replace the tires and above all how much petrol to put in the tank. This variant is very important given that there is no possibility of refueling once in the race. We can start off with a lot of petrol, therefore being heavy, but free to play with the various mixtures, which guarantee more or less power and obviously different consumption, or use little to be fast and aggressive right away, but carefully managing fuel reserves to avoid to finish it prematurely, thus working with the directional cross to set the petrol. Without forgetting once in the race the whims of the weather, brakes and tires to be brought up to temperature and the complete set-up system of the car to be carried out obviously before the parc ferm regime is triggered. With or without arm out? In short, those who decide to play Career in depth will find themselves faced with a series of variations, rules, and adjustments that can only tease the more simulative side of each player. Times are getting longer, emotional involvement and stress as well, but it's a fair price to pay to receive an offer from one of the top teams. In terms of the F1 2012 driving model, how does it behave? We have already written it, it behaves as we want given the many adjustments, adapting to everyone and thus stimulating replayability. By activating ABS and Traction Control at maximum, the only way to lose the car is to open the throttle abruptly on the curb when exiting a corner, practically eliminating tire grip. It drives rather nimbly, but finding the exact point for braking, without ending up on the curbs when accelerating, didn't seem so immediate. We never get to talking about arcade, the game often engages us in trajectory corrections, but we will hardly suffer power oversteers. By setting the aids to medium values, the challenge immediately becomes more demanding, even if not extreme, with the choking of the throttle becoming the protagonists of the game, otherwise the car will rotate lightning fast. By deactivating everything instead, the music changes. Opening the throttle often means doing a nice 360 in the middle of the track, not to mention braking, with the single-seater no longer allowing us to throw the nose smoothly towards the apex of the corner. The sensation is that as the assistances with the pad are removed, it will be really necessary to work a lot and even more to better tame the hundreds of horses of the single-seater, in this perspective the steering wheel and pedals seem to be made on purpose to keep the nervous cars under control . A driving model which is therefore in perfect harmony with the general scalability of the title. As far as multiplayer is concerned, the game offer does not differ much from what was proposed last year. The online cooperative is back, which is also joined by the split screen one, so as not to displease anyone. Choosing then to freely take to the track, the range of possibilities is usually very high. The quick game, for example, offers us three different types of competition, while if you choose to create a session all those parameters that distinguish the paOffline rts can be activated or not here too, with the possibility above all of banning driving aids, so that the disparities between those who use them and those who instead want to bite the asphalt as they once did are eliminated. PC version Simultaneously with the console counterparts, as per tradition Codemasters launches the PC version of F1 2012. Although in terms of content it is identical to the others, this edition proves to be preferable for some reasons, not just technical. The first good news relating to this year's chapter concerns support for Steam; in fact, the English developers have finally abandoned the Microsoft Games for Windows platform in favor of the Valve service, implemented with lots of cloud saves and objectives. The PC version, then, stands out compared to the console ones for the technical aspect. In general, the level of detail offered is significantly improved, with more detailed textures, more elaborate effects and post-processing as well as obviously the resolution. The reflections on the bodywork, as well as the atmospheric agents, in turn denote a higher quality. All with the possibility of running the game even at sixty frames per second - hardware configuration permitting - a detail that is anything but marginal for a racing title. Seeing a visual spectacle of this magnitude whizzing by at full speed really has its effect, with wet races probably representing the maximum visual achievable point. Codemasters has worked hard in trying to offer a product with attention to the smallest details, leaving aside the exaggerated aesthetics seen in the DiRT series, with the EGO engine that in F1 2012 does its utmost to get as close as possible to photo realism. Looking at the single-seaters in replays, for example, you can see details such as the vibrations of the spoilers that respond to stress in a credible way, just as the tires deform and visually show signs of wear. Although the judgment is absolutely positive, some falls in style are noted which highlight the multi-platform nature of the title. In particular, some low-resolution textures such as certain sponsors on the livery, rather than elements of the tracks that are anything but exciting. For example, in Montecarlo the Casino looks like a legacy of a past generation, appearing more like a cardboard scenario than a carefully modeled palace. Furthermore, even setting the detail to Ultra, the opponents' cars are always slightly less refined than the player's - a shame given that the more powerful PCs are certainly able to handle a higher polygonal mass. On the other hand, Codemasters has worked excellently on optimization, since we were able to run the title in maximum detail with lots of MSAA at 4X ensuring stable 30 frames per second with an AMD Phenom II X3 with 4GB of RAM and video card HD 5770, decidedly not top computer nowadays. The configuration menu offers various options in order to obtain the best compromise between performance and graphics, complete with benchmarks to use to carry out your own tests. Our result with the PC mentioned above, maximum settings and resolution set to 1080p, was an average of 34 FPS. As for steering wheel support, Codemasters should ensure compatibility with all popular models. We were able to test it with a Logitech Driving Force, with more than acceptable results considering the economic nature of the device. We have not been able to test the online component at the moment, unfortunately, but on the other hand we appreciated the presence of the split-screen for two players, which slightly lowers the graphic detail but allows you to race with all the opposing cars on the track. In conclusion, if you have a sufficiently recent computer, the PC version has something more to offer and is also the most convenient, since it costs at least ten euros less than its console counterparts, a detail that is far from marginal. Playstation 3 trophies For lovers of side challenges, F1 2012 offers the usual slew of trophies to unlock in each of the game modes. As usual, you will find yourself pocketing several simply by moving forward in your Career, playing online and winning races, but there are some more particular and interesting ones. One of these challenges the player to change teams five times in a season, another requires him to complete a race without even a collision, while others entice him to experiment with more complex and unaided driving models. Quick but judiciously On a technical level, F1 2012 does not differ much from the previous edition", "date": "2012-09-17", "grade": "9.0"}
