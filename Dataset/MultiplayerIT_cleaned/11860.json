{"name": "Real  Football 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-football-2008-recensione.html", "text": "The autumn release of iterations of football titles has become an established tradition. So rooted and oppressive in its fiscal punctuality that it has become boring and a little grotesque. Fifa and Pes. Pes and Fifa. And behind them their subjects, arrayed. Those that Pes is the king, those that the throne creaks, those that we are the overtaking of Fifa is close, those that do not joke Pes is always Pes. A situation that has stagnated for years, marked by marginal restyling that is good only for larks. On NintendoDS the Konami exponent is slow to show up (at least here in the West), and to make up for its absence Ubisoft presents itself with its little-known Real Football, a series until now relegated to the mobile phone game market. The challenge to the EA megabrand seems lost from the start. Unless... you know David against Goliath? Better or worse than Fifa? On the one hand, clashing with a giant like Fifa (and with Pes on the way) may seem like a big gamble. The risk is clearly that of being the classic earthenware vase among iron vases. On the other hand, however, it can prove to be a great opportunity, since no football title has yet managed to establish itself fully on the Nintendo portable. It remains to be seen whether the work done by Gameloft is really able to stand out and represent a breath of fresh air. Let's cut the bull's head right away: he can't make it. When developing and publishing a title that enters a market monopolized by infinitely more powerful brands, it would be good practice to differentiate it as much as possible from that of its competitors. Alternatively, if possible, it would be appreciable to take up the formula, polish it, enrich it and perfect it. RF2008 does neither. From the very first approach, one has the feeling of dealing with a sort of ~Poor FIFA~: almost identical in the control system, cruder in the technical implementation, orphaned of official licenses. Which doesn't necessarily mean that the game is bad in every respect. Quickly skipping through the various menus (which hold no surprises of any kind and include the usual modes and options) to start playing right away, you immediately notice that even the graphic setting of the title closely follows the ~made in IT'S AT~. To an inattentive eye, the two titles might seem identical, but paying attention to the details, the reductions appear evident: the stadiums, free of flags and smoke bombs, are less lively and choreographic, while the players' jerseys have no number or name. The level of detail has generally decreased, to the advantage of the fluidity of the graphics engine. What annoys is rather the very rigid camera which, following the changes in direction of the ball carrier, frames the action with too abrupt movements. Referee wake up!! Some might argue that RF2008 is, after all, a small production from which it is not possible to expect miracles. Understandable, but not acceptable for this. The same goes for the choice not to move a millimeter from the tested control layout (clockwise: passing, shooting, filtering, crossing. R for running), as if Konami that time had inscribed an eleventh commandment on the Sacred Tables, and woe to anyone who strays. But at least on DS could a gamedesign effort be made? A creative twist? Nothing. Everything is managed via keys, pace of the touch pad and the second screen. Exceptions are the penalty kicks, which are shot and saved by pressing the touch screen, determining the direction and power of the conclusion. Actually there is something new: in RF2008 you can insult the referee by shouting into the microphone. Well, better to say you can protest in order to influence his decisions regarding disciplinary management. In other words, to avoid a yellow card, since the black jacket will be adamant on expulsion fouls. Bah. Referee wake up!! The development of the game and the unraveling of the actions, not entirely credible, clash a bit with the title of the game. Starting from the physics of the ball, unconvincing, but mainly regarding the athletic gestures of the players, who make a mockery of the laws of physics and human anatomy; the norm is that the attackers, with their backs to goal, turn around in a fraction of a second and, kicking from a standstill, shoot racing cars that not even Mark Lenders... Generally speaking, the offensive phase appears too easy: even at higher difficulty levels, the strikers are free to maramaldeggiate in the sixteen meters and harpoon the goalkeepers with terrifying ground-to-air shots. The gist of the story is that actions that are as spectacular as they are improbable are often given life. In the face of ~real~... CommentThe biggest fault of RF2008 is that it doesn't dare as much as it could. Everything appears obvious, already seen and played elsewhere. Instead of experimenting with new solutions, Gameloft limits itself to proposing a faded carbon copy of EA football. What results is another title without infamy or praise, which detaches a one-way ticket to oblivion. In truth, the gap compared to FIFA is not very large, but we struggle to find a single reason to recommend this title as an alternative to the more well-known competitor.
