The case of Mass Effect 3 is so singular that it has no historical precedent. Specifically, it would be better to talk about the ~controversial ending of Mass Effect 3~, the epic closure of a trilogy that has marked this generation, the battle of Commander Shepard against the terrible Reapers, cleverly presented as mysterious aliens intent on putting an end to organic races . But most of all a battle against himself, with the awareness of the lives lost and saved along these three exciting chapters. The unbearable weight of free will, decisions and consequences. This has always been the fundamental feature of the BioWare blockbuster, yet for many, perhaps too many people who have lived the ~preparation of interplanetary resistance~ intensely, the idyll is over once they enter the Citadel for the final confrontation. Perhaps, we would add, ignoring the many signals launched by the screenwriters between the lines, not only those of a suspected indoctrination by the Reapers, but of the very characteristics of a story that has never suggested a positive epilogue, or at least aligned with the canons of trivial narrative . And here the donkey falls: if the thought on how Mass Effect suffers from being ~only~ a video game is legitimate, it is less so to ascertain the exploitation of a science fiction iconography that is anything but experimental, it is useless to deny it, made up of dialogues verbose, sophisticated and full of details, but also a great desire to tell stories flirting with the great popular works of the past. Almost a galactic soap opera, with plenty of space for sentimental and sex stories, incredibly elaborated to the point of becoming misleading, the focus is so schizophrenic that it is not surprising that it even wants to arrive at a philosophical vision. Whoever is writing the ending of Mass Effect 3 really liked it, for the ability to so intensely tear the emotional surface before the analytical one, for the exploitation of the Shepard avatar, our image reflected in the code, the metaphorical means of meta communication so dear to Hideo Kojima. But if the commander does not activate the vibration of the pad and never looks into the camera, the obsessive reference to the infamous dialogue pie for every question, even the most insignificant, refers to a fetish worthy of a game book. It is always the player who decides what to do and suffer the consequences, even serious ones, which can manifest themselves with an unexpected, painful loss. The Hollywood narrative scaffolding of this third chapter, certainly (subtly?) animated by a childish patriotism worthy of Roland Emmerich, is perhaps the main cause of the excessive amount of criticism received, because once you enter that blessed Crucible everything changes and leads to a cryptic and highly interpretable ending. However, some points are very clear. It changes the concept of the bastard alien to be kicked home, when we see the child image of our remorse-Starchild-Architect or whatever the hell you want to call him that destroys our reassuring self-centeredness, bringing us back to the dark reality of irrelevance. That of organic existence, fatally imprisoned in the pernicious myth of immortality. A curse of which we know the results, even before the boy opens his mouth. Evolution can find its culmination and end only in the creation of the perfect synthetic form, the sentient one, which however, like the geth, will rebel against its creator. The image of the Reapers is therefore radically upset, even transforming into Deus Ex Machina to ensure galactic order. Shock. The dread of the unknown gives way to a no less heartbreaking awareness, repeatedly hinted throughout the saga, of Shepard as the vector of first choice for a decisive breakthrough that will finally end the eternal cycle of chaos between organics and synthetics. The Reapers know who the commander is, who we are who guide him in every action, they know us, they have observed us for five years and ask for our sacrifice to decree the fate of humanity. New possibilities, they say. Perhaps a test that is not limited to our alter ego. That is why, even culminating in a scenario that transcends space and time, any rationale for the search for pure emotional concentrate is completely denied. A Space Odyssey video game? Perhaps - and rightly so - Maestro Kubrick will be turning over in his grave, but we still want to take the risk. There are no good or bad endings in Mass Effect, bad or good, just ~our~ endings and the subjective perceptions we owe get from them. Whether our model is Anderson and his gun, dim but saturated with good feelings, or the creepy Illusive Man and his visions of domination, or finally the artificial intelligence represented by EDI; there is a Game Over for each of us and a new story to tell our grandchildren. BioWare seems to want to communicate directly with the unconscious, making our instinct prevail over reason and also destroying the taboo of Hero/Renegade actions (by inverting the colors), thus sweeping away any moral obligation. Deciding has never been a gesture as pure as full of meaning. The finished story However, the many criticisms received have prompted BioWare to create a complementary and free DLC, which doubles the duration of the endings by adding new dialogues and cutscenes, created both with the game engine and through renderings, which try to clarify the many obscure points left within the user, trying at the same time not to alter its meaning. To access it, it is sufficient to recover a save file before the final confrontation, otherwise the game will automatically create one before the attack on the Cerberus base. The material inserted is considerable, but the result is emblematic to say the least. The type of content covered clearly demonstrates the influence of the complaints expressed by users, which for us is not positive from the point of view of artistic expression, but the result leads to final sequences which curiously weaken the narrative joints rather than strengthen them. Unbelievable but true. The description of the Normandy's escape, now rendered captive to the point of embarrassment, is of little account compared to the heavy modification on the portals, which no longer explode, but simply remain damaged. A difference that is certainly not irrelevant, given that in the DLC The Advent it was clearly explained that their explosion would lead to the destruction of an entire system. In our opinion, this detail pollutes the legitimacy of the script, making it impossible to understand whether it was an error or a change dictated by complaints. It is very difficult to think that the one proposed is the true ending as BioWare had conceived it, since each sequence rarely escapes narrative redundancy and everything seems rather forced to run for cover. In addition to the aforementioned Normandy, the cathartic value of the unknown planet where it lands is altered, originally emphasized by the destruction of the portals, and where Joker and his companions should have inaugurated a new beginning. And again, the infamous sequence of Shepard still alive in the rubble that we can admire in the Destruction finale clashes visibly with the new added scenes, among which we see a heartbroken Liara in the act of commemorating her adventure companion. On the other hand, many will appreciate the insights into the various races, shown through the many illustrations, this too actually seems to be part of a consolatory fan service policy, but which adds little or nothing to the implications that can be deduced from the original endings. Among these the messianism of the Shepard-Raider in the ending Control, or the comment of EDI for the Synthesis must be mentioned. Curiously we also find an unreleased ending, where Shepard doesn't make any decisions, forcing the Reapers to end the cycle. In this way humans suffer the same fate as the Protheans, leaving however to posterity the projects for a new Crucible. Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut remains a piece of content recommended for everyone, on the other hand it is free, which many will appreciate for the greater didactic value and the added scenes, which however do not strengthen what was previously built by BioWare, but rather weaken it in some ways consistency. One way or another the story is over, this time we hope for real. Let's say a last goodbye to the heroic Captain Shepard!", "date": "2012-06-27", "grade": null}
