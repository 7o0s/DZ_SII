The charming journalist has a very, very important task: to save the Earth from an alien threat. The aliens in question are gradually capturing all human beings, forcing them to dance like the possessed. At the end of the game, after having freed them all, you will become obsessed as you will literally be catapulted into an adventure in which frenzy and speed are the order of the day. In each fight you will have to press the arrow keys on the keyboard to keep the rhythm and the circle or X keys if you want to shoot the aliens or free the hostages. In addition, you will also have to defend your scoop from the other competing reporters and this will give rise to other exciting battles to the sound of ballets. Dance dance dance dizzying... As you will have understood Space Channel 5 belongs to that category of games like Parappa The Rapper where the main fulcrum of the action is to correctly execute the sequences that appear from time to time on the screen with the keys. However, in the game developed by Uga it is not always easy to execute each sequence perfectly, especially when we are facing the final bosses. Mnemonics is a fundamental component of the game but speed also wants its part. Despite this, it is not at all difficult to play Space Channel 5 and indeed to reach Game Over you will practically have to make a lot of mistakes or better too much. In fact, a simple distraction will not cause any damage other than lowering the audience bar which, on the other hand, will do if you carry out the movements correctly. The graphics of Space Channel 5 are basically the same seen in the Dreamcast version. Although the technical characteristics of the PS2 could have had an impact with the contribution of significant improvements, however the developers themselves have decided to leave the graphics sector unchanged, already appreciable in itself and with bright and engaging colors, counting on the actual fun imprinted on the gamer from the gameplay even if the eye wants its share. Finally worthy of note is the soundtrack of the game, made up mostly of very engaging 60s music that will make you dance in the chair together with Ulala and the aliens. ... dance dance dance breathless! Ultimately Space Channel 5 is a fun game, original whose fun has already been tested by the user group of the now ~defunct~ Dreamcast. If you want to try a different genre very similar to a puzzle, but with frenetic contours, based on speed and mnemonics, all you have to do is buy the Space Channel 5 CD, insert it into your PS2 and start....dancing! Pros: Colorful and engaging graphics Gameplay for lovers of frenetic movements Ulala will seduce you with its charm Cons: It won't take long to finish it Some sequences are exhausting and you will start to make tons of mistakes But how many do I know! Who knows how many times you may have wondered if one day on your favorite console you could have played something different than the usual platform or fighting game while experiencing the same sensation of pleasure. In my case I was able to experience this new emotion since I met the UGA team and its last two titles produced for the Dreamcast and immediately converted for PS2. Don't tell me now that you didn't know about the existence of titles like Rez or Space Channel 5. In confidence I would have preferred to review Rez because it attracted me more, but fate wanted me to deal with Space Channel 5, a game that was anything but horrid. In fact, space adventures have always attracted me, but I didn't expect someone to invent a game where you have to fight aliens with ~dance~! You got it right! In Space Channel 5 all the action or if you want 99% of it is based on dances, sometimes exhausting that will keep you glued to the screen in the frantic attempt to correctly execute the sequence to complete the ballet and defeat the bad alien !", "date": "2002-05-09", "grade": null}
