{"name": "Fantasie stellari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68341-phantasy-star-portable-fantasie-stellari.html", "text": "In the beginning it was Phantasy Star which, back in 1987, thrilled the then owners of the Sega Master System with its clean graphics, its first-person view during rigorously turn-based combat and the vast map to explore. Then, over the years and a few consoles later, it was the turn of Phantasy Star Online on Dreamcast to mark the history of the saga with the first episode dedicated mainly to online, and with a game setting more similar to a normal hack and slash than a classic RPG. Since then, over the years, the SEGA RPG saga has been able to evolve, gradually transforming to become the one we know best today, thanks also to the excellent chapter created on PS2, PC and Xbox 360, Phantasy Star Universe which, strong a series of interesting expansions released in a continuous stream has been able to give a definitive imprint to the series by perfecting the style that had characterized its predecessors. And it is precisely from this last episode that SEGA restarts for its new Phantasy Star Portable produced exclusively for PSP, which draws most of its primary characteristics from the aforementioned game, from which it differs mainly only or almost for the presence of a single character that can be used in both Story and Mutiplayer modes, as we will see later, and some other details. Races and Classes Once you start playing, you can actually build your own hero from scratch: physique, gender, eye color, voice, all just a click away. There are four races and three basic classes from which to draw in this sense for the personalization of the protagonist of the adventure. Each race, called Human, Newman, CAST and Beast respectively, has its own peculiarities that make it unique even in the parameters that regulate the various aspects of the use of weapons or powers. The first, as the name suggests, represents that of human beings, while the second, Newman, of creatures with great mental powers but very weak physically. The Casts are a sort of Cyborg with human features who have managed to gain a special social status while the Beasts are beings who possess the ability to transform themselves into powerful creatures that are very strong in hand-to-hand combat. The classes, as mentioned, are initially three (others, however, can be unlocked): Hunter, Ranger and Force. The first is the traditional one of the warrior skilled in the use of short-range weapons and capable of equipping any type of sword, while the Ranger allows the character to use long-range weapons such as pistols and bows (he has the possibility of grappling with the enemy during the fight). Finally, the Force is the canonical magician capable of using magic sticks and skills in the occult arts. However, each of them can learn the skills of the other. The possible combinations are in fact many and all to be discovered. Among other things, both the physical aspect and the classes can be changed at any time of the game in the Guardian's Colony by paying the due amount. Multiplayer and content Basically a portable version of Phantasy Star Universe aimed solely at the PSP. The game includes local network multiplayer support for up to four players and new content compared to the PS2/X360 version, such as the story and the ~log~ function, which allows you to catalog each of the 150 collected objects. Gameplay The plot of Phantasy Star Portable tells the events that occurred after the Universe episode and shortly before those that occurred later in the Ambition of Illumines expansion, and sees the protagonist engaged in support of Vivienne, a creature of the CAST, between mysterious terrorists and the usual SEED threat. The style of play is essentially the same as always, that is a sort of action-RPG simply focused on the continuous search for weapons and upgrades released by enemies in colored boxes in the form of drops. Phantasy Star Portable can be played in three distinct modes: Story Mode, Free Missions and Multi-Mode. For the latter linked to multiplayer, we refer you to the appropriate box, while, leaving aside the second, which as the title suggests is focused only on a series of free missions, let's focus on the main one. The story mode is the fulcrum of the product, with the real adventure, even if it must be said that unfortunately the plot develops and goes on only through static screens complete with dialogues (no exploratory phases within ship or lobby), reducing the gaming experience to endless dungeon crawling. However, it is fair to underline how this has been one of the peculiarities of the saga for several years now and therefore those who approach this product already know what they will find. Battlesto go-go The player therefore completes a series of missions in which he is continuously attacked by numerous enemies intent on stopping him in any way, and of which he must be freed in order to continue in the next area on a par with the recovery of keys and objects. Some stages also have very difficult final bosses to face which, however, at the end of the battle release, in case of defeat, interesting items or weapons, in addition to the canonical level-up points. Leveling up (up to a maximum of 99) among other things will not only be the race and class of the characters, but everything that was used during the mission, from weapons to spells, etc. The new feature implemented by the developers linked to a faster and more effective management of the commands during battles is interesting. In practice, thanks to a special ~pop-up menu~ it is possible to equip weapons or use the various objects (including healing) quickly, without having to waste time looking for them to select them, while perhaps a group of monsters is attacking the party. Multiple endings, a good number of missions with varying degrees of difficulty, many objects to recover and various achievements / titles to conquer complete the general picture of the product. Phantasy Star Portable takes almost full advantage of the potential offered by the PSP by offering the user a good level of graphics. With Select it is possible to target enemies in first person. The general glance is in fact qualitatively valid, with well-crafted and brightly colored scenarios, characters, enemies and weapons. The animations deserve a separate note: really excellent and varied, often linked to the type of weapon used in that particular situation, special move or combo. A show. The only disappointment is the inevitable slowdowns perhaps when playing Multiplayer. As for the soundtrack of the game, the term that best describes it adequately is ~functional to the context~, and therefore excellent for what it aims to do. The tracks are numerous, apparently almost all borrowed from Phantasy Star Universe, the sound effects well made and effective especially as regards the sounds emitted by some monsters or even the rarest weapons.", "date": "2009-07-29", "grade": "6.5"}
