The new package can be downloaded from Tuesday, at a price of 9.99 euros, and requires the purchase of the Intro Pack to be fully used. On the contrary, it is not necessary to own the episode set in Sapienza, which can be purchased later or avoided without any problems. The content update was accompanied by the release of patch 1.07, thanks to which some firearm balances were introduced, a series of changes to the structure of the inventory and further improvements to the map and the functioning of the main menu. The Marrakesh map is less stratified than the previous ones, but still very suggestive Coup d'etat The situation that awaits Agent 47 on sunny Moroccan days is not the best, given that the city is on the brink of civil war. The targets are once again multiple: on the one hand the financial advisor Claus Strandberg and on the other General Reza Zaydan, both involved in a plot against the Moroccan government. Strandberg is the former CEO of a banking institution and has been put on trial for defrauding thousands of savers. A group of mercenaries attacked the armored vehicle in which the man was and brought him to safety within the walls of the Swedish embassy. An angry crowd has gathered in front of the building, clamoring for Strandberg's release, unaware that in the meantime Zaydan is organizing his escape with the aim of fomenting a revolt and imposing martial law. Diana informs us that the general has placed his headquarters at an abandoned school, waiting to convince the army leaders to support the coup. Obviously the initiative supported by the ICA does not happen by chance but has some private interests of a certain importance upstream, including the possible loss of some crucial tenders, which would fail if the overthrow of the established power were to succeed . The map of Marrakesh is less stratified and broader than the previous two appointments, but no less interesting to enjoy. First of all, we have a large area - which we could define as touristic - where the Medina is located, with its most characteristic bazaars and clubs. In these segments of the map we meet a much larger crowd than in Paris and Sapienza, distributed between the main square and the small streets in the centre. This area is counterbalanced by the two areas within which the targets move. The entrance to the embassy is stormed by activists, while only employees and security agents meet inside the building. The scenario in the basement is different, where the army militias have complete control of the garage and the long underground tunnel that connects the embassy to a shop near Zaydan's headquarters. As usual, the approaches useful for completing the assignments are the most varied, although the opportunities attributable to dialogues and documents are numerically lower than what the previous location offered. Seize the moment, but do it right As we have already remarked in previous pieces, the choice of a well-defined strategy is one of the primary purposes offered by the gaming experience. After arriving in the city and starting the exploration, we learned that the old principal of the school where Zaydan was stationed had kept a passepartout useful for opening any lock and facilitating the achievement of the objective. Going up to the adjacent building we stunned the writer without too many pleasantries and stole the key, but were soon distracted by a second chance. Thanks to some leaflets, abandoned in an alley, we discovered that some activists were intent on spreading false propaganda for the Pan-African liberation movement and were on the streets wearing masks. After stealing one of their uniforms, infiltrating the school was almost a formality and it was enough to disable the machine that printed the posters to attract the general's attention and complete the assignment without a hitch. It was therefore time to set out on Strandberg's trail. To achieve this, we took advantage of an opportunity similar to the one already tested in the Paris map: an exclusive interview given to a GNN journalist. Posing as a cameraman freelance we got instant access to the embassy. The recovery operation of suitable clothing led us to sneak inside a private club, passing through the roofs. After having attracted the prey to the toilets thanks to the taps left open, it was possible to clean up the area and carelessly go to the prearranged appointment. Once inside the embassy we chose to close the game in a picturesque way, avoiding using explosives as in Paris and preferring to blow up the supports of a statue suspended from the ceiling. The latter collapsed with a crash on the target's head, also providing us with a diversion to quickly leave the complex. What we have briefly described represents only a small part of the possibilities that the map has in store for the player. Once again we can't help but point out the excellent work done by IO Interactive to stimulate players, allow them to learn the secrets and induce them to complete all the available opportunities. Playstation 4 trophies There are seven Marrakesh Trophies, three of which are focused on completing the main assignment. The others involve completing the escalation contract, choosing a starting position and using an additional resource during the mission, and finally reaching the level of Professionalism 20 respectively. Middle Eastern Escalation The third episode also introduces a new Escalation mission, titled Ignatiev's Integrity, which develops a further progression of assignments. The first task involves eliminating a soldier of Zaydan's militia by starting a fire that seems fortuitous. In the following levels, the main task is associated with other activities, such as the recovery of an object from a safe, the elimination of a second target using only a shotgun, the destruction of the footage taken by the CCTV cameras and finally the maintaining the same type of disguise for the entire duration of the session. As before, the Escalation missions are those that allow you to acquire the best familiarity with all the details inherent in the map and give you the opportunity to learn, down to the details, both the shortcuts and the most effective techniques to achieve your objectives with the highest score . Finally, a new lens belonging to the so-called Sarajevo Six was introduced. The new mission involves the elimination of Walter Menard, a veteran of the SIGMA Unit paramilitary unit, already active during the Yugoslav war in the 1990s and in turn implicated in the affair involving Claus Strandberg. On a purely technical level, this third episode of Hitman also highlights some limitations, especially as regards the stability of the frame rate and the quality of some textures. In this case the greater density of civilians, present above all in the Medina and in front of the entrance to the consulate, has created some embarrassment on more than one occasion.", "date": "2016-06-02", "grade": "8.5"}
