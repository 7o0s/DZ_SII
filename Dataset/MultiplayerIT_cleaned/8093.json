The mix between game jam and reality show is an original gimmick to foment the community and deceive the wait, but the release of Middle Manager of Justice has received less visibility, a game for iOS apparently born to test the soil of the free market to play. After a beta released by mistake a few weeks ago, Schafer's team has finally launched the game on the App Store, but unfortunately, we say it right away, it flies to lower peaks than the Californian company has been used to so far. A super boss From the team behind Psychonauts, Costume Quest and Brtal Legend one could not expect a game overflowing with personality. Middle Manager of Justice catapults the user into the small Justice Corp, a company that trains superheroes and sends them around the city to thwart crimes. In short, imagine a mix between Monsters & Co., the Ghostbusters and the Fantastic 4. Yet, for once the player is not a muscular man of boundless strength or a woman capable of going at the speed of light, but an administrator with no characteristics other than that of being in the midst of a midlife crisis. By spending the resources at your disposal, you must therefore hire new superheroes by choosing them from a funny catalog, send them to the gym to increase their stats, let them rest to regenerate their health and hold meetings from time to time to boost team morale. Everything is aimed at the success of missions and fights around the city, ranging from knocking out. a group of robbers from stopping an out of control bus, to rescuing civilians inside burning buildings. Unfortunately it will take some time before you can appreciate the game, on the one hand due to the initial scarcity of content and things to do, on the other hand due to the need to wait more or less long times for any activity to be carried out . Thumbs twiddling is the eternal plague of free to play games. Predictably, the only way to shorten waiting times and make life easier is by spending Superium, the usual special currency that is difficult to obtain in-game and can be purchased by using a credit card. In short, we twirl our thumbs a lot, but things improve significantly as the company expands: new rooms are built in which to engage the super-employees, including laboratories for researching new equipment and relaxation rooms in which to rest . After the slow introductory part, the experience turns into a race against time, as each mission has an expiration period, and the player is not always able to help the citizens and manage the internal activities of the company at the same time. The incredible precarious However, it is with the increase of superheroes in one's team that Middle Manager of Justice becomes much more dynamic and less monotonous; the macro-management element is finally highlighted, and it becomes essential to plan the activities of the various superheroes, dividing them into groups and sending them to solve different missions simultaneously. Traditional fights can be resolved automatically and are decided on the basis of a system of probabilities: also in this case waiting times are imposed, but less patient and more cautious players can actively take part in the battle, choosing special abilities or items to use through a simple turn-based combat system. The long waiting times and a repetitive and not too deep gameplay substantially represent the most evident defects of a game that has style and comic vein as its strong point. Vibrant and colourful, Middle Manager of Justice is extremely pleasant to look at, especially thanks to the funny design of the protagonists: divided into three catalogues, the superheroes range from old pensioners to alien women, from androids to muscular geeks, occasionally mimicking the usual clichs seen in comics and movies. By investing money in the improvement of the company, both practical and aesthetic bonuses are obtained, passing from a small shack to a large and modern structure within a few hours. At the time of writing, the main hall of Justice Corp is decorated with gift packages and Christmas trees, a gem that suggests the addition of further graphic surprises contextually to the time of year. While Schafer wasn't directly involved in the game's development, humor has always been Double Fine's trademark, and of course Middle Manager of Justice is no exception:seeing a bunch of costumed characters hit the treadmill, brainstorming or lounging on the couch watching TV is sure to elicit a smile, but it's in the hilarious boss dialogues and crazy loadouts that the game reaches the pinnacle of its charisma .", "date": "2012-12-24", "grade": "7.0"}
