We also took the opportunity to better clarify some controversial aspects of the original article, above all the question of the frame rate and the remastering work carried out by the developers. Gears of War was jaw-dropping. Almost ten years have passed but it is difficult to forget that sensation, the same one that the writer had previously experienced only in front of video games capable of moving the bar higher in terms of the concept of visual impact: the Dragon's Lair coin-op, Batman for NES, Streets of Rage 2 for Mega Drive, Donkey Kong Country for SNES and Daytona USA cabinet. Epic Games had done the miracle, completing an epochal project, capable of revolutionizing the genre of third-person shooters and setting new standards in terms of graphics, sound, gameplay and multiplayer. Gears was rough and tough, very violent, its characters communicated that weight and physicality that later became a trademark for the Unreal Engine; and if a certain type of online competitiveness was until then reserved for productions that were in many ways less accessible, with a microphone and an Xbox LIVE Gold subscription we were all ready to shoot each other, to grab the Boomshot first, to kill each other treason by throwing grenades blindly or cowardly positioned with the Arco Torque or the sniper rifle. Those were times when we even felt patriotic, in forming Italian teams and embarking on the arduous task of competing with American teams, even though we were aware that the different speed of our connections transformed the contest into an acceleration race between a city bike and a Yamaha R6. Those sensations undoubtedly deserved a remastering treatment, which arrives precisely today with Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, an edition created by the development team that is working on Gears 4 and which therefore serves as a test bed, in particular from the point of technical view, for the boys of The Coalition. Let's see how it went. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is an excellent remaster for Epic Games' third person shooter The resurrection of the phoenix The story of Gears of War takes place on the planet Sera, in an unspecified future, when the world is shocked by the sudden attack of a race that until then had lived underground, the Locusts, and which emerges bringing death and destruction in the cities. The offensive is so violent that humans are forced to bomb their own capitals to try to counter it, but not even this desperate move seems to be enough. As sometimes happens, it will therefore have to be a handful of chosen soldiers, a compact and determined group, to carry the weight of the war on their shoulders and try to win it: in the role of the surly Marcus Fenix, accompanied by his brotherly friend Dominic ~Dom~ Santiago and then, subsequently, by the wily Damon Baird and the disruptive Augustus Cole, our task will be to infiltrate enemy lines to get hold of important data on the position of their bases and try to destroy them thanks to the very powerful Solar Bomb. It won't be easy, and those who have already played with Gears years ago know well that there will be some sacrifices along the way, especially after the fierce general RAAM takes to the field. The original campaign, which can also be played alone or in cooperative mode in this Ultimate Edition, both locally via split-screen and online, has been enriched by the addition of the five extra chapters present only in the PC version of the game, which add new situations to the part central to the adventure and culminate in the fight with the huge Brumak. This brings the duration of the single player close to ten hours, in an alternation of firefights, small environmental puzzles and twists that still appears coherent and well directed today. All the more reason thanks to the complete makeover of all the cutscenes, made in CG instead of with in-game graphics, following an unusual approach but which acts as an effective narrative glue. In fact, the kinematics go to deepen the relationship between the characters, but also to emphasize sequences such as the historical one in which the lieutenant Minh Young Kim is the protagonist. Solid as a rock... In Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, two concepts of solidity hold the table. The first is related to the gameplay, which has not exactly remained in 2006 but has indeed undergone a series of changes and optimizations, most of which are based on the successful episodestherein of the series. There is therefore a lesser tendency for the characters to ~stick~ to cover, but also greater agility and a sense of lightness which at first leaves you even a little displaced. The possibility of passing around the companions in the context of a stakeout has not been inserted, therefore their presence can still represent an annoying obstacle and lead to frustrating game overs where the body of a character prevents us, for example, from making a swerve lateral to avoid an enemy blow. In the same way, on the artificial intelligence front, there are no substantial changes: the Locusts lurk to shoot at us and generally maintain their position, allowing us to hit them as soon as they put their snout in the open; but there are also situations in which they charge to pick us up, and which represent an interesting variation on the theme. On the other hand, the behavior of the COG team is decidedly unfortunate, especially when the group is reduced to only two components: in this situation one must be careful not to try to raise one's friends at any cost, because one would risk being knocked down in turn. On the other hand, the gunplay remains extraordinarily impactful, that is to say everything concerning the shooter mechanics, from managing weapons to aiming, from the sensation of impact to the selection of equipment via d-pad, from the use of active reloading to ammunition factor, the latter rendered in a very balanced and effective way. Forget that you can always use the combination of Lancer and Gnasher, because in some situations the shortage of bullets will force you to switch; and that's when you can appreciate the personality of weapons like the aforementioned Torque Bow, Sniper Rifle, Boltok Pistol, Hammer of Dawn, and so on. Each of these tools has its own peculiarities and lends itself to different approaches, and there are very few that are ~little guessed~ in terms of gameplay: from this point of view, the Epic Games title still has a lot to teach current shooters . A note of demerit only for the Boomshot, whose explosive bullets often fail, unable to land the enemies that are in the immediate vicinity. A flaw in the balance of the weapon? ...or not? The second concept of solidity concerns the frame rate, which however in the case of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition ends up disappointing expectations. The news that the game would run at 1080p and 30 fps in single player, reaching 60 fps only in multiplayer, made quite a few users turn up their noses, who cared in a particular way about this aspect, moreover implemented with success in the Halo remaster. It seems that the developers have decided from the beginning to try to push on the quality of the graphics and the renewal of the assets rather than on the fluidity, but there are moments in the campaign in which there are rather noticeable uncertainties in the frame rate, both in the most crowded situations and chaotic as in some relatively calm junctures. It is not a question of the rule or of a factor that compromises playability, but in the eyes of an enthusiast these ~shots~ can be annoying, especially considering the values in the field, in particular the fact that it is a first party production and that The Coalition is the team that is currently working on Gears of War 4. In short, having taken note of the choice not to go beyond thirty frames per second in the single player, an unassailable performance was expected at this juncture. We are therefore talking about a question of principle, with which the developers will necessarily have to deal with, possibly by releasing a patch that fixes all the slowdowns. Fortunately, the frame rate factor is practically the only weak point of a remastering work carried out for real and not in words, which has seen not only the increase in resolution from 720p to 1080p, but also and above all the remake of most graphic assets. The characters, even the secondary ones (see the uniformed version of Anya Stroud, but also the Stranded ones), appear substantially more detailed and a great deal of work has been done on the scenarios, aimed at enhancing their peculiarities, without forgetting even a few touches of class use and consumption of those who know well the lore created by Epic Games. The textures have undergone a resampling where possible, others have been replaced, and the final result appears almost perfect, in the sense that you will never find yourself faced with a low definition texture, as sometimes happens instead. Precise stylistic choices were also made, which in this case led to a decreasetion of contrast and an increase in saturation: the original Gears of War was practically gray and with many references to chiaroscuro, while the new version boasts more lively colors (although without coming from Naughty Dog's parts) and less marked outlines. The animations have held up fairly well over time, but some transition movements are missing. The audio sector also benefited greatly from the remastering work, in particular the splendid orchestral soundtrack, which has regained vigor and incisiveness, making itself noticed much more now than in the past. The Italian dubbing is the original one, excellent for the time and here synchronized with the movement of the lips of the protagonists. It's just a pity that the tone of some sentences clashes with what actually happens during some sequences, but there we enter questions concerning the dynamics of the adaptation and which often see the guilty voice actors placed in front of a screen watching the graphic representation of an audio file instead of the scene they are supposed to play. Xbox One goals Gears of War: Ultimate Edition includes 56 Achievements, for a total of 1250 Gamerpoints. Most of the achievements are obtained simply by completing the single player campaign, since they concern the conclusion of the individual chapters, but there is also a whole series of rewards related to progression in multiplayer and numbers related to online performance. Here we are! The competitive multiplayer of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition represents the core of the offer, thanks to its numbers and the substantial technical revision compared to the original. In fact, this part of the game runs at sixty frames per second, even in this case with sporadic uncertainties, which however do not affect the enjoyment of the experience, capable of benefiting greatly from the greater fluidity. Once logged into Xbox LIVE, the manual selector for dedicated servers immediately stands out, which are divided by geographical area, with a clear indication of latency. No more ~host power~, therefore, and games which, played on European infrastructures, guarantee a negligible lag, a rather rapid matchmaking and the possibility of competing on an equal footing even with the most savvy users, who in truth were already present after a few hours . There are nine modes available, currently organized in this way: Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill and War Zone in unranked public matches; Execute, King of the Hill, Blitz, Team Deathmatch, Assassinate, and Execute Gnasher 2v2 in ranked public matches; all those already mentioned, plus Annex and Execution Gnasher, in private matches. We don't know if the developers will move certain modes from one sector to another, but this seems likely as well as desirable, given that it is a pity that Annex is relegated to invitation-only matches, albeit King of the Hill (borrowed from Gears of War 3) presents itself as an excellent alternative, even in the Blitz variant (the only one that, one day after the European day one, still doesn't work). Unfortunately, the Horde is missing, originally introduced with the second chapter, in which a team of players had to work together to eliminate ever-increasing waves of Locusts. There are factors that would certainly have made it difficult to insert it, above all the connotation of the locations and the lack of a turret construction system, but let's not lose hope of seeing it arrive in the future, perhaps with a variant designed for the occasion. The maps for the multiplayer modes are nineteen, they include all the original scenarios plus the three present in the PC version (transporting you to Gears of War 2), with the addition of the small ~Boxes~ portion for the 2v2 Gnasher Execution. The latter turned out to be a not exactly exciting novelty, mainly due to the repetitiveness of such a ~restricted~ action, which also translates into very short and potentially unbalanced matches. For the rest, however, the multiplayer sector lacks practically nothing and the remastering work has drastically changed certain scenarios, adding unedited details and even distorting some architectures, with the only flaw being the very ~old-gen~ rendering of the water in the Swamp map. It seemed like a smart move to leave the possibility of split-screen play on the same console to face online opponents, as well as to include the original options for network play. The competitive multiplayer is then joined by the cooperative one, both locally and online, the latter now equipped with a drop-in / drop-out system that allows you to enter and exit games in progress, very quickly and immediately.", "date": "2015-08-31", "grade": "8.5"}
