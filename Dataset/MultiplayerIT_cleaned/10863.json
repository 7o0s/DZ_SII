Established with the first Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, another RTS greatly appreciated even by those who had very little in common with the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Definitively consecrated in the videogame Olympus with the exceptional Company of Heroes, yet another war strategy with incredible historical care, Relic Entertainment, a Canadian software house of small size and fiercely defended independence, tries again the coup by exploiting the popular futuristic fantasy license by Games Workshop, to bring new life into the strategy market. A genre for too long now linked to outdated and obsolete mechanics and which, if on the one hand it cannot find adequate innovations to be attractive on consoles, on the other hand it is now also struggling to give an adequate gaming experience, fun and pounding , on PC. But before discovering in detail where Relic amazed for its originality and design expertise, let's do a little historical excursus. So narrate the ancient books of the Chapter The game follows the story of the Blood Ravens, a group of Space Marines belonging to a Chapter of rather uncertain origins, suddenly hit by a powerful Ork attack on their recruiting world: Calderis. The player's first missions will therefore take place in this location, in a sort of long, well thought-out tutorial perfectly intertwined with the plot, which will lead us to familiarize ourselves first with the RPG component of Dawn of War 2, through the management of the heroes, and then with the star map screen. In fact, after about the first hour of play, the player will have the opportunity to navigate through three different planets to face the various missions that are proposed to him from time to time. The story is well thought out, pleasant and overall well narrated, even if there are the usual clichs typical of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. We will then discover that the Orks are succubus of Eldar scams and soon we will have to deal with a devastating Tyranid assault that will bring the Space Marines to their knees. The story is shown to the player through a small handful of hand-drawn cutscenes with a pleasant stylistic rendering that intervene on the occasion of some crucial and mandatory missions (you will meet about a dozen of them) while all the in-depth analysis, the climate and the characterization of the characters , is poured into the numerous dialogues that we will witness both during the missions and at their completion once we return to the Armageddon mothership and to the planetary selection screen. But the only great narrative flaw of Dawn of War 2 takes over precisely on this front: first of all, if you are not a great fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, you will miss a whole series of references to historical battles and previous events but, above all, the strategic of Relic will in no way be able to make you change your mind, or to make you passionate about the Games Workshop universe. The story runs too much in the background, it is densely packed with anecdotes and references that have little to do with the game and the small handful of heroes that you will have at your disposal fails in any way to stand out, to create empathy with the player. Even the commander in chief is a figure with a flattened charisma in which you will find it very difficult to impersonate yourself. From this point of view, probably the first Dawn of War with all the various expansions has been able to give more and we hope to be able to change this thought of ours on the occasion of the Dawn of War 2 add-ons which will certainly not be long in coming in the coming months. A unique gameplay But let's start right from the heroes, since we have mentioned them just above and above all since the greatest innovation of Dawn of War 2 lurks in them. In fact, in the creature of Relic there will be no bases to build, resources to collect and units to build or train. So forget the classic canons of any self-respecting real-time strategy but also the most daring attempts at Ground Control since there won't even be reinforcements that you can access during a mission. In fact, the game will give you six heroes (not all available from the start), each with its own combat specialty (ranged, melee, specialized in barrage fire and so on) and you will have to select four of them before entering battle. In fact, through a particularly well-inspired planetary map, you will have to manage your troops according to the task you are preparing to face. The single campaign player is divided into days: in each of these you can carry out a single mission among those available on the three planets around which the plot revolves. In case this mission is completed with a score from excellent to exceptional you can receive as a bonus one or even two additional deployments for that day. In fact, throughout the course of the game, the strategic component that you will have to keep an eye on is precisely the careful choice of missions to be carried out. Alongside the obligatory ones and which will serve to carry on the narrative plot, you will have a whole series of optional missions, very often with deadlines (that is, you will have a maximum of days within which to complete them) which will serve you on the one hand to fortify and better equip your heroes and on the other to slow down the tyranid infection on the three planets. Once you have chosen your four heroes, you will launch them on land and from this moment on you will be immersed in the most extreme tactics. Each of them, with the exception of the commander-in-chief and the Dreadnought that will unlock later, will have two or three soldiers at his side who are still managed together with the hero as a single unit during the battle. During the mission these soldiers can be killed in the field and the only way to get them again is to be near one of the radio beacons scattered on the map and which can be conquered, or next to one of the three conquerable structures to have long-range bonuses or , again, near a descent pod. The real hero, on the other hand, will never die but, at the very least, remain stunned on the ground where it will be necessary to revive him with another hero. The situation of defeat therefore occurs only and exclusively in the event that all the heroes are inhibited. Among other things, the optional mission structure allows you to lose a battle without compromising the entire campaign for this. The variety, this unknown And so far, so good: the matches are frenetic, fast, they don't give room for strategic reflection but they force the player to face with lightning reflexes and boldly applied tactics, the battles that rarely exceed fifteen minutes in duration. The combat differences of each hero are mastered in an instant, while much more time will be needed to digest their management in the most chaotic situations since it will be essential to always keep an eye on the scenario to choose the ideal positioning of the structures. Directly borrowed from Company of Heroes, the gameplay is based on a cover system that the player will have to exploit to shelter his units and offer them the best positioning during combat. Among other things, practically all covers, including buildings within which you can barricade yourself, can be destroyed with bombing, explosives and hero skills. Especially in the first hours of the game you will have a lot of fun facing the chaotic combat of the Orks, the refined infiltration tactics of the Eldar or the enormous quantity of creatures that will make up a Tyranid attack. The problem, however, is that the entire single player campaign is basically developed through only two types of missions. In fact, if we exclude the very few ~mandatory~ battles that serve to carry on the narrative plot, all the others can be summarized in two types. In one we will start from one side of the map and we will have to reach the opposite one to face the final mini-boss and defeat him, in the meantime capturing the radio beacons or destroying some randomly scattered structures on the ground. In the other we will have to defend a previously conquered structure from 3 or 4 consecutive assaults by the enemy. Enough. No escort, infiltration, timed missions or any interesting narrative gimmick. Of course, Relic must be recognized for having created numerous interesting mini-bosses to face and with a fairly varied skill package but soon, especially in the battles against the Tyranids, also thanks to the growth of your heroes, you will find yourself exclusively attacking them with all the your forces using every skill and equipment and literally ignoring their special attacks. And to make everything even more negative, there is the fact that the missions always take place on the same three, four maps for each planet. So soon even the scenarios will tend to get boring. And all of this is really a great pity, given that the single player campaign, entirely focused on the Space Marines and which will require you from 15 to 25 hours of play depending on how many optional missions you manage to do, has a theoretical degree of replayability on its side trulynt very high. The double E: equipment and experience During the missions by killing the bosses and sometimes randomly massacring groups of enemies, it will be possible to see loot drop, or equipment that can be collected. This, together with the reward that is unlocked by completing the main objective, makes up the general inventory that can be accessed between missions, from the squad logistics screen. And here too Relic has pushed hard on the innovation front. Each hero can in fact be equipped according to his skills, by selecting armour, one or more weapons (one-handed and two-handed), a variable number of accessories and, in the case of the commander, an additional item of usually devastating power. These equipments follow a system of minimum requirements in order to be used and are subject to different rarity values in a system that closely resembles what is seen in the most famous MMORPG in the world, World of Warcraft (even the coloring of the item's name follows the same style). The other aspect that can be managed from the screen is the heroes' stats. In fact, these gain experience by fighting and ~trashing~ any unnecessary equipment, and upon leveling up (the level cap is set at 20) you will have two points available to spend on the four skills that make up the role-playing component of Dawn of War 2: stamina , ranged combat, strength and will. Here too lurks the germ of replayability given that you will immediately have to deal with the type of specialization to be followed by your heroes considering that during the campaign you will be able to maximize only one of these four values. Furthermore, for each skill, at fairly regular intervals, special active or passive abilities are unlocked which are in most cases unique to that hero in a style that closely resembles Mass Effect's growth system. We don't hide from you that on more than one occasion we felt like restarting the campaign to try to specialize the commander in chief in ranged combat rather than in melee damage just to see unlocked and be able to use powers of indisputable charm. However, even in this case there are flaws: the growth of experience is linked to combat, which means that the two heroes not brought onto the battlefield tend to level up much more slowly. The result is that already in the middle of the single player you will find yourself always using the same squadrons both for a matter of specialized equipment and because bringing a hero perhaps 4 or 5 levels back to the ground, especially in the more advanced missions, is equivalent to certain defeat. And perhaps, to be honest, a minimum of imbalance between the units is noticeable going forward given that the game seems to prefer close-quarters clashes more than those at a distance and almost forcing the player to make more use of melee heroes. But that's just the appetizer As Relic has more often underlined, the single player, despite the narrative and design investment made on it, has always been conceived as a simple stepping stone to get to grips with the multiplayer, a real keystone of Dawn of War 2. First of all, the game arrives on the market with a powerful day one patch precisely to balance the units to the maximum, taking advantage of the intense beta testing that preceded the game's release by about three weeks. Then, unlike single player, in multiplayer you can choose all four races implemented in the game. And for each race you can select from three heroes, usually one focused on attack, one on defense and healing, and another support (for building defensive turrets or focused on infiltration). The game mechanic in this case differs greatly from the campaign and in this regard we refer you to our in-depth trial of the multiplayer beta, but suffice it to say that there will be a sort of base available with which to train the various units by spending energy points and relics which they can be earned by conquering and holding certain structures. Also in this case the battles settle on a very fast pace, given that the player is practically forced to immediately go on the assault to conquer the few resources on the game map and a challenge will hardly exceed twenty minutes of play. The upgrades and equipment of your units take place directly on the battlefield, by spending the usual energy and relic points. Also there will be some general super abilities that can be used", "date": "2009-02-20", "grade": null}
