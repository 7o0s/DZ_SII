{"name": "Il Padrino: The Don's Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-padrino-the-dons-edition.html", "text": "Keep your friends close, but your enemies even more America, 1940s. New York is in the hands of five mafia families who divide up, not without bloodshed, the various neighborhoods of the city: the Corleones in Little Italy, the Tattaglias in Brooklyn, the Straccis in New Jersey, the Cuneos in Hell's Kitchen and the Barreses in Midtown. It all begins with a background that takes place several years before the beginning of the story, or when some thugs of the Barzinis kill a collaborator of Don Vito Corleone by beating him to death and blowing up his bakery. To witness the scene are his wife and son Aldo. Nine years later, Aldo's mother takes advantage of Conie Corleone's marriage to ask the Godfather for a favor: to help her wayward son embroiled in the shady dealings of a gang of criminals. Favor to which the ~magnanimous~ Don Vito does not shirk, ordering one of his subordinates to enlist Aldo in his ranks. Keep your friends close, but your enemies even more The player will therefore be given the opportunity to impersonate Aldo, or to customize him as desired in name and appearance using the ~MobFace~, an editor already mastered in Fight Night Round 3. The variety of parameters is remarkable, and allows a perfect reconstruction of the mobster of your dreams. A man who spends too little time with his family will never be a real man Once you pass a short tutorial you will be catapulted into the universe of The Godfather. The aim of the game is very simple: to gain hierarchies within the Corleones, until you become their Don and control the entire city of New York. To do this, you will have many possibilities. In addition to completing the main missions, which outline the storyline, you can try your hand at the numerous secondary missions, which vary from the commission of murders, to the most varied favors, such as bribing a police commissioner, or setting a rival in the legs. One of the focal points of the side-quests is extortion. In fact, you will be called upon to intimidate New York shopkeepers in order to make you pay for the famous ~pizzo~. The methods to bend the will of the shopkeepers are many, and it will be up to the player to guess the weak point of each person: some may be particularly sensitive to the destruction of the furniture, while others will suffer in a special way purely physical intimidation, such as punches, kicks or tested. To complicate your work, in addition to the rival gangs, there will be a bar which, if on the one hand it will make you understand what type of intimidation to insist on, on the other it risks ruining your plans: in fact, if the indicator of voltage will exceed the limit, you may forget the payment. A man who spends too little time with his family will never be a real man Another easy way to enrich the Family coffers is to own a racket. In this case, the biggest problem will be to find them, since, being illegal activities, they are often ambushed in the back rooms. Once you convince the racketeer boss that he will do better business working with the Corleones, you can get a share of the proceeds. By completing your tasks, you will be rewarded not only in money, but also with experience points that can be spent to improve the characteristics of the protagonist. It will be up to you to decide whether to favor physical prowess, rather than the mastery of firearms or persuasion skills. Particular importance is also attached to corruption. Money allows people's dreams to come true, and don't be surprised if, with a few pennies, you can earn the indifference of the neighborhood policemen. From the series: No eye sees... Same thing goes for journalists: the last thing you need is too much talk about you around. You will have to make them understand, with due ~kindness~, that it is better for them if they keep their mouths shut. The controls are particularly intuitive: the fights with bare hands and those with blunt weapons are entirely managed by the right analog stick, which allows for a good variety of combinations. Furthermore, the motion sensor has been exploited properly, useful for throwing enemies to the ground, hanging them on walls or smashing their heads against tables or cash registers. Another new feature is represented by the possibility of recruiting up to 4 henchmen to carry out the most dangerous missions. Choice dictated above all by the complexity of the more advanced levels, in which the A.I. who manages the enemies will prove to be a tough rival. The increase in difficulty is also due to the presence of the ~Revenge~ indicator. In fact, by killing members of rival Families you will gain not only respect, but also the growth of hatred towards you. In case you exaggerate with the rain oflead, revenge could reach unbearable peaks, unleashing a fearsome war between clans. At that point, all the delinquents with some connection to the enemy Family will come looking for you, and it will certainly not be a courtesy visit. In any case, it should be excluded that frustration reigns supreme, also thanks to the checkpoints that save your position every time you complete one of the mission's objectives. Graphics and sound Technically speaking, The Godfather is strongly affected by its status as an old-generation console pot. Let's be clear: the high resolution, the greater number of polygons, and the more detailed textures (especially of the faces of the characters, very close to the real counterparts) suggest that we are faced with a much more refined game in terms of graphics. However, it is impossible not to breathe the hybrid atmosphere between the ~old~ 128 bits and the now dominant Next Gen. The audio sector is excellent, however. The music, among which the splendid original ~theme~ of the film deserves an honorable mention, helps to increase the player's identification, while the dubbing, completely in Italian, is certainly successful, even if the advice is to opt for the English version, which can boast the participation of Marlon Brando himself, called to record shortly before his death to return, 30 years later, to the role of Don Vito Corleone. On the other hand, the absence of Al Pacino should be noted, who, having not granted the rights to EA, forced the programmers to create the character of Michael Corleone anonymously, devoid of similarity both visually and vocally. The Godfather, while not reaching the majesty of GTA, is confirmed as a game that lives up to the name it bears. The good variety of situations, combined with the incredible atmosphere, make the EA title particularly attractive especially for those who love Francis Ford Coppola's films, and in general the historical period narrated. The few who have never enjoyed the magnificence of the film will instead be able to run for cover by reliving the key scenes (in the original language with Italian subtitles) thanks to the inevitable unlockable film library by completing the missions. Pros Varied and long-lived Incomparable atmosphere All characters are easily recognizable... Cons ...except Al Pacino who did not grant the rights Graphically subdued No online components Not just pizza and mandolin. Italy, it is useless to deny it, is also the Mafia. Commonplaces aside, and 35 years after the first, unforgettable film of the Godfather trilogy, a brand that had done well in the versions for Xbox360, PlayStation 2 and so on arrives on Playstation 3. The novelties, underlined by the subtitle (The Don's Edition) add salt to a game which, while not reaching the levels of GTA, will give hours and hours of fun to Free Roaming lovers and, in general, to all those who have been fascinated from the atmosphere and raw screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola. After all, what feeling gives more satisfaction than revenge?", "date": "2007-06-11", "grade": null}
