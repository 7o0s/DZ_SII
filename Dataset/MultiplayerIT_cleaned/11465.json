{"name": "Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-clash-of-ninja-revolution-recensione.html", "text": "Naruto has been talked about several times, and in very flattering terms. The manga created by Masashi Kishimoto, published for the first time in Japan almost ten years ago (and still ongoing!), tells of an alternative feudal society, in which fishing and trading villages exist as well as villages populated exclusively by ninjas . Naruto is one of these, a boy isolated from his peers due to a curse (a very powerful demon was sealed in his body), who tries in every way to become a strong and valiant warrior to take revenge on those who have marginalized him. His dream is to become a Hokage, or a legendary ninja capable of leading the whole village. Naruto's life changes when he meets Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, as well as the master Kakashi Hatake. With them not only will the character begin a long process of maturation, but he will be able to understand profound values such as friendship, affection and a sense of belonging. We are faced with what is a bit like the Dragon Ball of 2000, given that the central theme of the manga is action and the various ninjas possess peculiar and spectacular skills, which they must use in every mission entrusted to them. The success of the series meant that a good quality cartoon was made of it, broadcast all over the world and also arrived in Italy for some time. And that was followed by numerous video games, of which the Clash of Ninja series is perhaps the best exponent. From GameCube to Wii Anyone who has had the opportunity to try that beautiful fighting game that is Naruto: Clash of Ninja for GameCube will find the same mechanics and most of the same methods in this Revolution version. As for the latter, we have the single game that varies between a classic ~story mode~, a survival and a time attack, a multiplayer mode for up to four players in split screen, a mission mode and one focused on simple minigames to be tackled exclusively with the Wii-mote. Speaking of controls, it must be said that the developers have indeed introduced complete support for motion detection, with the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination that also allows us to perform exclusive combos, but they have left the possibility of experimenting with the play in a more classic way, by connecting a GameCube joypad or the Classic Controller to the console. Choosing one or the other configuration is simply a matter of taste: if you want something different from the usual in terms of fighting games, you can opt for controllers with motion detection; if instead you want a feeling identical to that experienced on GameCube, the advice is to connect a normal joypad. Among the things that have not changed compared to Clash of Ninja, there is certainly the immediacy and simplicity of the commands: we will be able to execute devastating combos by pressing a single button, varying the maneuvers according to the direction indicated and activating the special moves in the fastest way possible. At the same time, we will be able to avoid the attacks at the very moment in which they are brought thanks to the pressure of a backbone, disappearing and then reappearing behind the opponent. In short, we are faced with an extremely fast and engaging fighting game, which does not get lost in chatter or useless technicalities and immediately offers us maximum action and spectacularity. Revolution! Alongside the elements that have not changed since the episode of the series available for the GameCube, there are also some new features. First of all, the stages are all new and hide two faces: by hitting the enemy at the right time and with due force, we'll throw him to another part of the location, complete with an explanatory animated sequence. Secondly, some interactable objects have been introduced that can change our approach to fighting: crates, vases and anything else to hide behind and shelter from attacks, and then jump out suddenly. The third novelty concerns a clear cut to fights with three or more characters at a time: in the story mode of Clash of Ninja it often happened that you had to face several opponents at the same time, in daring and often cumbersome situations to manage. We will find this kind of clashes in a very limited number and mostly during the missions. The latter is a mode that follows the plot of the cartoon until the advent of Orochimaru, and in which we will have to complete sixteen (seventeen, actually) levels, each characterized by a different goal to achieve. Sometimes we will simply have to defeat the opponent, in other cases we will have to be able to do it with some handicap (low vital energy, chakra that does not regenerate, numerical inferiority, etc.)or through particular situations (executing a certain special move as a last hit). Completing all missions results in unlocking many characters that were initially unavailable. In addition to other rather classic modes, such as survival and time attack, we find an option created specifically for use with the Wii-mote: it is a series of skill tests (throwing shurikens, for example) which do not revolutionize the gaming experience but certainly enrich it in a nice way. Technical realization Being an ~enhanced~ version of Clash of Ninja, it is clear that graphically the game does not revolutionize anything: the characters are exactly those, made in cel shading and equipped with animations that vary from good to excellent. It's a shame that almost nothing has changed in the movements nor in the ~poses~ assumed once a match is won, and above all it is a shame that the shadows are still plagued by a very low resolution. In any case, everything flows very smoothly, at 60 frames per second, even in the most agitated situations, with different wrestlers on the screen or during the most chaotic and spectacular special moves. The uncertainties of the graphics engine are really limited to a minimum, and it was a surprise to see that the game is also displayed splendidly on LCD televisions: tested on a 16:9 32-inch panel, by connecting the Wii with a simple RGB Scart, you see beautiful colors and hardly any ladders. Wanting to criticize the graphics sector, it must be said that very often characters and background appear uneven, given the use of cel shading for the former but not for the environment in which they move. The game is translated into good Italian in the screen texts, even if unfortunately the voices are only in horrid English and it is not possible to activate the audio in Japanese. Music and effects are good, with some peaks in particular. For the rest, the control system is widely configurable and performs well in any situation: a credit to the developers for providing the possibility of using practically any controller. Comment The Wii toy library, as far as fighting games are concerned, is starting to count really interesting titles. Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution arises from the outset as an enhanced version of the episode released for the GameCube, characterized by a great deal of freedom as regards the configuration of the controls (which always turn out to be up to the situation) and by the introduction of some very interesting new features: all new stages divided into two parts (a bit like Naruto: Ultimate Ninja, albeit with a different philosophy), the presence of ~obstacles~ (an idea still to be developed properly) and the minigames designed exclusively for the Wii-mote. The rest is all already seen, but still excellent: well-drawn and animated characters, great fluidity, simple and immediate combat system, matches marked by spectacular sequences and very fast exchanges between moves and counter-moves. The game is very enjoyable even if you have already completed the GameCube version, so it is clear that if you have never tried the Clash of Ninja series before and you are a fan of Naruto, this Revolution version for Wii is a must buy. Pros Immediate and addictive combat system Smooth graphics, completely renewed stages A large number of characters to unlock Cons The ~medium~ difficulty is too low Not essential for those who already own Clash of Ninja for GC Voices only in English", "date": "2008-04-23", "grade": null}
