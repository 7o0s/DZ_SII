{"name": "Ghost Recon : Island Of Thunder", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-island-of-thunder.html", "text": "The multiplayer aspect and, above all, that linked to the Xbox Live world is undoubtedly the heart of Ghost Recon Island Of Thunder: there are twelve new maps for the multiplayer experience, including the four most famous and used among these by players in the title released last fall. The code for online play has been optimized, making it easier to host games on Xbox live, even for those who don't have a lot of bandwidth available. But are there other news? Of course, real-time rankings have also been introduced in Island Of Thunder, divided by type of game and soldier used in matches, such as the famous Rifleman. The number of players in a single game has also been increased from twelve to sixteen soldiers as well as the division into teams has undergone changes. In this ~expansion~ we could, in fact, create up to four different teams. The review of the Multiplayer section has also affected some new options by the player who acts as a server. In particular, for fans of network gaming, Island Of Thunder offers a large number of selectable game types, starting from the main subdivision, i.e. Cooperative, Team or Solo, to arrive at a fairly wide branching, covering from the classic ~ Last man, whose objective is easily identifiable, up to the Siege mode, in which a team starts from inside a base that the opponents, starting from the positions, must conquer in a certain time limit. Above all, the ~Hamburger Hill~ mode is noteworthy, in which the main purpose is to keep an area fixed in the center of the map for as long as possible, obviously, in Team mode. Island Of Thunder will remain very familiar to all veterans of the first campaign, even the menus have remained (unfortunately?) unchanged and are certainly not the symbol of practicality. Technical aspect As far as the strictly technical part of the game is concerned, some improvements, or rather optimizations, can be seen in the graphics engine. For example in the creation of some light effects or in some textures and polygonal construction renewed compared to the first Ghost Recon, in particular the sections in the forest or in any case outside the urban centers are more accurate and realistic, moreover more details for the soldiers and team members and the items that make up the equipment. Everything else remained unchanged. Ghost Recon was certainly not one of the titles that pushed Xbox to its limits and Island Of Thunder does not improve this situation much. It's a pity because Ubisoft has decidedly more up-to-date graphics engines available, such as that of the next Rainbow Six, and Island of Thunder would have definitely benefited from it. As for the audio department, new environmental and game effects have been introduced, already very valid in its predecessor. In this field the programming team has confirmed itself in a positive way, the speech is not localized in Italian, but it's probably better this way: in this way, in my opinion, the atmosphere has remained intact and in Island of Thunder there is certainly no the danger of running into long or incomprehensible dialogue. However, the report must be made for all those players who are not comfortable in games not localized in Italian. Comment Ghost Recon: Island of Thunder is certainly promoted thanks to the favorable quality / price ratio of the game, the updates introduced for the multiplayer, and the possibility of obtaining new missions via xbox live, Island Of Thunder is a very valid choice, particularly aimed at online gaming enthusiasts. Certainly it is not a sequel proper, nor a substantial update of the technical part, but still a game that will please veterans of Ghost Recon, and probably will push new users to get to know the whole series. Pros: New missions Xbox Live support Great sound effects Cons: Graphics not up to Xbox Some challenging achievements Not really a sequel Ghost Recon Island Of Thunder, born as an Add-on to one of the most loved and played titles on Xbox live, has reached the world market in the form of a stand-alone game, which can therefore be used even without having a copy of the predecessor. The American assault team this time will have to solve a crisis that broke out on an island (hence the title of the game) in the Cuban area and as usual you will not find much hospitality among the local soldiers ... so no more talk and let's talk of the innovations introduced in Island Of ThunderFirst of all, a new campaign has been planned in the single player game, consisting of eight missions, naturally not only new environments, but also equipment, kits and weapons suitable for the occasion. This campaign has a slightly higher level of difficulty than the first missions in the first Ghost Recon, but experienced players will have absolutely no difficulty getting used to it. Even if the part dedicated to the single player may seem short-lived, there is no need to worry since Ubisoft has already made it known that downloadable updates will be available in the future via Xbox Live, with some new missions to download and this obviously also applies to the maps dedicated to the multiplayer game.", "date": "2003-09-12", "grade": null}
