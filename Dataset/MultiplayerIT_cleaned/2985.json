{"name": "Maid of Sker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/maid-of-sker-recensione.html", "text": "Dealing with purely narrative video games, especially horror, always brings with it interesting discoveries: this is the case of Maid of Sker, a horror film developed and published by Wales Interactive that literally takes us to the border between reality and legend. Leafing a little here and there after finishing the game, in order not to ruin the experience, we traced back to the sources of inspiration of the developers who intertwine concrete facts with stories whose truth is difficult to understand. This premise is in a certain sense due because it is interesting how the most in-depth research possible was derived from an apparently very common title and without particular flashes, which allowed us to better understand the creative process behind its development. For example, the hotel in which the whole story takes place is inspired by the actually existing Sker House: it is a building dating back to around 1110, built by the Cistercian order as a farm for the nearby Neath Abbey, of whose original structure remains very little, especially in the face of the almost total reconstruction that took place in the 16th century. It seems that Elizabeth Williams lived in this building in the 18th century, the Maid of Sker to whom the homonymous ballad composed by Thomas Evans is dedicated, whose original Gaelic title is Y Ferch O'r Scer (and which you can listen to here): it is at this point that reality mixes with legend in such a way as to make it difficult to draw a line between the two sides. The first reference to this dates back to 1806, when the historian William Davies of Neath translated the words of a Welsh aria composed by a harpist whose identity is not entirely certain but it seems probable it was Thomas Evans, of the parish of Newton- Nottage. Further information was collected by Thomas Morgan of Maesteg, to whom an old woman revealed that she had actually known Elizabeth and hers was the universally recognized version. Like all stories, there are doubts about the veracity that the author Arthur Leslie Evans addresses in the book The Story of Sker House: two supposed descendants of Elizabeth ensure that the woman was happily married, while the still most accepted version portrays her as a tragedy. Daughter of a wealthy farmer, Elizabeth fell in love with the harpist Thomas Evans after seeing him perform but their relationship was immediately opposed by her father due to Thomas' inferior social position: after a failed love elopement even before to begin, Elizabeth was locked in her room and prevented from leaving Sker House for a long time. However, the feeling for Thomas did not fade, so the father arranged the marriage to another man. After nine years, between marital friction and a love that never faded, Elizabeth presumably died of a broken heart and was buried in Llansamlet on 6 January 1776. Legend has it that her ghost, together with that of the captain of a shipwrecked ship near Sker Point, you still haunt the house. This long premise contextualizes a game that has much more research behind it than it seems: Maid of Sker in fact features Thomas and Elizabeth as protagonists, albeit in a horror key, but is based on two main points of the original story or rather the music and the confinement of the woman at Sker Hotel. In the role of the talented musician we will therefore have to lift the veil of mystery around the Williams family. Ear issue Maid of Sker is a first-person horror that bases all of its gameplay on listening, both to us and to the monsters that roam the Sker Hotel. Once we reach the decaying building and talk to Elizabeth on the phone, the only way we have to communicate with her, we will immediately be made aware of the main objective of the game - which yes, basically is to escape from that place of death but it requires a bit more involved than backing up and taking the door. A mysterious evil has befallen Elizabeth's family and the hotel staff, rendering them grotesquely blind but gifted with exceptional hearing; the causes would be to be found in a strange discovery made in the wreck of a ship not far from Sker Point. Whatever it was, it had a devastating effect on all members of the family with the exception of Elizabeth, whose role in the story seems to be more predominant than one might think. Despite the danger she's in, her request is that we help her end this sort of curse in order to stop it from spreading and save her own family. To do this we will have to find four specific cylinders useful for playing a melody that seems to have a benevolent, or at least definitive, effect on the creatures. Easier said than done since the hotelhe and the area that surrounds it are very articulated and we will have to cross them far and wide facing dangers of sorts. The creatures that patrol the area, known as Quiet Men, are sensitive to noise and the developers have focused in particular on sound in general: from the disturbing music that accompanies our steps (sometimes imposing a bit too much, it must be said) , up to the typical creaks of an abandoned hotel, Maid of Sker is a game that must be experienced with headphones both for a matter of immersion and necessity. The binaural audio allows us to guess where the enemy's footsteps are coming from and understand when the way is clear, as well as how many of them are nearby, managing our actions accordingly. Thomas has no object at his disposal to distract them, if not some very rare contextual element, and his best defense is to keep a low profile. There is the possibility of temporarily stopping the Quiet Men with a device that is obtained at a certain point in the plot, for the rest if you get caught the only solution is to put wings on your feet. Given their refined hearing, the two key points of the game are to move crouched and hold your breath in the essential moments, in particular this last mechanic has been managed in an interesting way: in fact, if we happen to pass in a particularly dusty or too near a campfire, Thomas will start coughing attracting the attention of anyone within earshot. Considering that the breath can be held for a limited time, there are cases where it is necessary to plan one's moves after carefully observing the surroundings, on pain of being beaten to death by the Quiet Men. Overall basing the core of the experience around the 'listening works but it wouldn't have been bad to perfect the hearing of creatures even more, along the lines of an Alien: Isolation, to make the experience even more tense: the scarcity of resources is a bit of a counterbalance (even in Normal mode) and the fact that Thomas produces more noise when he is injured, forcing us on the one hand not to abuse the treatments and on the other to avoid getting hit. The total absence of autosave, in favor of DIY phonographs, invites you to exercise the utmost caution. Between immortal giants and enigmas As you would expect from an abandoned building in a horror context, few areas of the hotel are directly accessible: some are only blocked from our side, others need a special key and finally there are those areas where to pass it is necessary to solve the puzzle of the moment, be it completing family crests or activating the power at specific points. The options in themselves are not among the most varied but are often accompanied by another kind of difficulty, such as a profusion of Quiet Man, ~poisonous~ areas, traps and so on until you get to the aspect that most made us twist the nose: it wouldn't be a fight for survival if there weren't the usual immortal boss chasing us in a specific point of the game and the problem isn't so much that, on the contrary it gives a little spice to a tense but generally rather quiet gameplay . However, the fact that he is omniscient and knows of our presence the moment we set foot in the area we liked less, as it forces us to give up any stealth claim to run and hope to be faster. To put the negative emphasis on the matter there is also the fact of the famous invisible barriers that it cannot cross, such as Nemesis and the toy shop in the Resident Evil 3 remake. We stressed the game a bit in this respect and we realizing that, on the same level, there were points that the boss could not overcome and limited himself to waiting for us there, going around in circles to kill boredom. Obviously it was all to our detriment, he being big enough to block the passage in the corridors, but the point is that even hiding us he knew perfectly where to find us. While heart-pounding, it's a frustrating choice in the long run and quite drowns out the idea of not having to produce any sound. Except for these two aspects, a greater focus on hearing enemies and the omniscient boss, Maid of Sker puts standing an average experience in terms of duration (six hours), which invites you to take risks to explore by collecting both the scarce resources and the objects necessary to obtain the desired ending - yes, there is also the unfortunate conclusion. The sound design is effective in creating tension, the jump scares are minimized (an added value in a genre that now tends to abuse them) and the hotel setting is disturbing to the right point. The story makes good use of the source material, be it fact or legend, and manages to connect the dots for oneplot also capable of giving a couple of rather effective twists.", "date": "2020-07-28", "grade": "7.0"}
