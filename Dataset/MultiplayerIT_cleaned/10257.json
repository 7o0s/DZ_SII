Among these, the sequel to that Army of Two fits very well, which in his time showed good things, launching the idea of shoulder-to-shoulder adventure with a companion and his pungent camaraderie, even if with some flaws that wings. The expert developers of EA Montreal have capitalized on the criticisms leveled at their first creature and are back on track with the second chapter, called ~The 40th Day~, revised, corrected and extremely enhanced in all the main aspects regarding gameplay, co- op, multiplayer and graphics. Times and spatiality change radically: where the original unfolded through years along numerous locations scattered here and there in the world, Army of Two: The 40th Day is set only in Shanghai in a span of time that spans a handful of days. The protagonists Salem and Rios have returned to carry out a new mission, they are mercenaries belonging to a private company, but things definitely start to go wrong when they notice that the city is starting to descend into chaos. Terrorist attacks, hijacked planes, skyscrapers collapsing one after another and the post apocalyptic scenario is served. Now the mission is to survive, while trying to figure out who is responsible for this chaos and decimating the terrorists who stand in their way. The news The basic gameplay has remained unchanged from the first chapter, however many changes and improvements have been made to all that ~outline~ that diminished some parts of Army of Two. The 40th Day is a decidedly more solid, complete and finished game from all points of view, a clear sign that the criticisms made have successfully reached the recipient. The movement system, aiming and framing have remained the same that made famous games such as Gears of War and Resident Evil 4, with a camera just behind the shoulders ready to zoom and leave the field of vision free in case of pointing the weapon. The possibility of modifying weapons has been enormously increased, now giving free rein to the fantasies of all artillery lovers with dozens and dozens of upgrades, secondary weapons, gadgets and options related to the ballistics of each rifle, submachine gun or pistol. During the adventure you earn money (found or stolen from enemies) which you can use to make purchases at any moment of pause, between one guerrilla war and another, thus unlocking the new weapons and all the technological marvels indispensable to modern soldiers such as those of Army of Two. Obviously, as the title also suggests, cooperation has remained the fundamental pillar on which all the gameplay rests. Our companion (real or virtual) can be a friend at our side, a CPU bot, or anyone connected to Xbox Live or PSN. The options dedicated to simultaneous action have also been expanded and made more incisive and profound on gameplay. At any time you can order your partner to cover us, to advance, to wait for us at a certain point, or we can follow him behind an armored shield. In fact, the aggro system returns which records the degree of attention of the enemies towards the two companions, depending on how openly they fired or how silent they were in moving, in a virtual ballet in which to strategically build the role that from time to time you want to cover in battle. In addition, however, by pressing the select button, a special viewer is activated which allows you to frame the enemies and be able to always keep them in sight through the markings, so as to be able to give precise and direct orders to our partner even when playing alone. Often, for example, we are called upon to rescue hostages held by terrorists. After signaling the position of the enemies with the marker, our alter-ego will thus be able to fire in unison with us in order to eliminate them at the same time or take all the aggro to let us act undisturbed, in a much more precise way than in happened in the prequel. The problem is that the CPU in this two-way relationship sometimes plays a slightly too passive role, leaving us with the task of almost always tagging the enemies, reducing the variety of tactical solutions that can be adopted. Xbox 360 goals Like any Xbox 360 game, Army of Two: The 40th Day also provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock, through 50 objectives made up of 16 secret and 34 visible. The latter are composed exclusively of ~progressive~ objectives that are obtainedThey are progressing through the various levels, completing the game or making a certain number of kills with particular weapons. The secret ones, on the other hand, are linked to the multiplayer modes and will require a considerably greater effort to be obtained. The most challenging are certainly those that require the rescue of all the hostages and the killing of an enemy with all the weapons available in the game, even the special and secret ones. Double firepower The two mercenaries are unscrupulous and heroic if necessary, but they don't always make morally impeccable choices. In some cases the game tests our actions and judges us, assigning scores as a ~good~ or ~bad~ soldier. Kill an ally to increase your salary, or leave him alive by giving up dollars? It's just one of the doubts before which Army of Two: The 40th Day puts our morality into crisis. This yardstick has the only major flaw of being reset at the beginning of each level, making the attempt to give us a permanent alignment that affects, for example, the progress of the game or the behavior and relationship that ours has companion towards us, limiting the choices to variations that exhaust their effectiveness in the moment. Speaking instead of the ~choices~ put in place by the CPU, it is necessary to speak of a tough and well thought-out artificial intelligence, even if fluctuating. In most situations the enemies prove to be very hostile and decidedly cunning, hiding everywhere, dragging shelters behind them if they are hit, helping comrades in difficulty, reviving them, surrounding us from all sides. Sporadically, however, we notice that when a very high amount of terrorists appear on the screen, some of them seem to be less ~smart~ than the others, starting to walk undeterred and careless in our direction. Sometimes, if taken aback, they react too slowly, while others are too precise and lethal, a sign of an Artificial Intelligence that is a little too fluctuating. Destruction in Shanghai The AI of our partner, playing single, is still very realistic and humane, certainly much improved from the first, immature chapter. In some levels where our friend has to defend us he does his job diligently, without making the task too much easier for us but still showing himself active and at work. The balance, in this sense, is excellent. It's definitely not easy to get the CPU to work in a way that helps us, without giving the impression that it's doing all the work itself. However, the situation is always in our hands, regardless of the partner (unless you play alongside a real friend). Another clear improvement, compared to the previous Army of Two chapter, is the implementation of a deep and perfectly balanced multiplayer that extends the life of the game once the main adventure is over. There are three modes of which the most fun is certainly the Deathmach Co-Op, in which we fight alongside our partner against up to eight teams of two people each. Also in this case all the options designed to work for two are widely exploited for gameplay purposes: defending with a shield while the other shoots, cover our friend by sniping from afar, make diversions, attack shoulder to shoulder. The other modes are the classic ~capture the flag~ and a ~warzone~ in which we have to complete objectives sequentially within specially designed maps. The multiplayer sector serves to give even more substance and body to a game that is already complete and now mature in itself. Let's stay calm! It's the worst zoo ever! With this joke the protagonist of Army of Two: The 40th Day greets the end of one of the most successful levels of the game, the zoo. The entire game is set totally in the city of Shanghai, starting from a burning building to its slums. Each level is really well structured and designed differently, expanding horizontally, vertically, long and narrow, wide and circular. Even with an excellent level design, the fact that we are perpetually in Shanghai could make many return the desire to travel the world as in the first chapter of Army of Two. The attention paid to detail is disarming. The alleys of the Chinese city are teeming with people, cats, dogs, waste paper that flies away, clothes stretched from the windows that wave with the wind, shops and houses full of details, and a myriad of objects scattered everywhere that make the setting detailed and realistic as ever. The graphics engine manages the impressive polygonal mass that all buildings, skyscrapers and houses impose on the CPU in total freedom and effortlessly. Some sporadic pop-up isthe least that could be expected, given that the game does not suffer even in the most intricate situations. The unfolding of events enhances the catastrophes that occur as we continue through the levels, in which, in a scripted and therefore very engaging way, airliners crash down, buildings explode, skyscrapers collapse. The sound sector goes hand in hand with the visual one, with a pressing and engaging soundtrack that underlines the most dramatic and emotional moments. The voices, all well recited, change intonation if they come from external or internal environments. The effects of the weapons are all different and ~sound~ very differently if the weapon is upgraded; the feeling is that of being in a real war zone, with bullets coming from every corner, voices, desperate cries, our companion telling us what to do or asking for help. The ironic aspect of the dialogues (hugely scaled down compared to the first Army of Two, where the two heroes perhaps exaggerated a little in talkativeness) often puts a smile on the lips, even in that infernal chaos that appears on the screen.", "date": "2010-01-12", "grade": "8.4"}
