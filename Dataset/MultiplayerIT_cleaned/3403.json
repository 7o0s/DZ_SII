{"name": "Disgaea 4 Complete+", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disgaea-4-complete-recensione-playstation-4.html", "text": "Above all, the series that made Nippon Ichi Software famous all over the world has a big problem: each episode is so long-lived, full-bodied and rich in content that you end up reaching a kind of tolerance threshold... a refractory period, so to say. It must be said that NIS has developed only a handful of Disgaea in the space of fifteen years, but in the last two years the studio has been busy, publishing the revised and corrected versions of Disgaea and Disgaea 5, therefore of this Disgaea 4 Complete+ whose review you are about to read. An overdose of Disgaea, in short, which threatens to overwhelm even the most ardent fan of this hilarious series of turn-based strategic JRPGs. If you have never played Disgaea 4, and it's been a while since your last raids in the Netherworld, this new edition of the game released first on PlayStation 3 in 2011, and then on PlayStation Vita in 2014, could certainly interest you. New cast, same nonsense Disgaea 4 Complete +, originally titled A Promise Unforgotten and then A Promise Revisited in previous editions, focuses on a completely new cast which therefore makes it an ideal starting point for those who have never dealt with this franchise. Although there are some tasty and relevant cameos, especially in the final bars of the game, the story has Valvatorez as its protagonist, a former afterlife vampire who lost his powers after swearing never to drink human blood again from a girl who was not was minimally terrifying. Now Valvatorez trains the Prinny, the funny demonic penguins into which sinful souls transform themselves, but when the government of the Netherworld decides to exterminate them for a matter of overpopulation, our anti-hero and his lackey Fenrich set out in search of political allies to overthrow the Corrupternment and take command of the afterlife. It goes without saying that things will not go as planned and that the search for Valvatorez will lead him to come across the most absurd individuals and monsters. The cast of Disgaea 4 is perhaps one of the most successful in the series. The various characters we will meet are quite stereotyped, but Nippon Ichi forces them to face increasingly hallucinatory situations that highlight their every idiosyncrasy. It is an interesting and engaging alchemy, even if the dialogues sometimes tend to be unnecessarily verbose and it almost seems that no one has to say anything concretely useful for the development of the story: the latter is divided into chapters, even if we could define them sketches, and although it is extremely comical, making tasty references to the gaming and entertainment industry in general, it does not fail to address vaguely political themes with the same humor that make you think between one laugh and another. Obviously the game is completely in English, although it is possible to choose the dubbing in English or in Japanese, highly recommended if you love Japanese animation which Disgaea is particularly inspired by. Disgaea 4 in pills Explaining for the umpteenth time the dynamics of a complex title like Disgaea could be quite useless: we are quite sure that many readers know this series well enough, but if you don't fall into that group, don't worry, because in the next few lines we will review the milestones of the game. If, on the other hand, you want to read an in-depth examination of the combat system and the main contents of Disgaea 4, we cannot help but refer you to the review of Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited, since we are essentially talking about the same game. Disgaea 4 Complete +, in fact, is the conversion of A Promise Revisited, and as such includes all the DLC and extra content published over time for this chapter of the NIS series. In addition to all the improvements made to the 2014 PlayStation Vita version, Disgaea 4 Complete+ can boast some minor innovations, such as for example the automatic save at the end of the mission and a new 1080p resolution that polishes the beautiful 2D sprites, while putting highlighting the paucity of the old-gen three-dimensional scenarios. To be completely honest, the Japanese developer has never particularly cared about the aspect of the isometric battlefields in which the missions take place, preferring rather their functionality. Disgaea 4 Complete+ is a turn-based strategic RPG: the missions, interspersed with cinematics and long dialogues that describe the story, take place in locations specifically designed to rack the brains of the players thanks to a system inaugurated in the very first Disgaea of 2003 and then refined from chapter to chapter. In practically every map we will find colored blocks that conferendows a portion of it with particular advantages or disadvantages. By moving these blocks, we will also move their properties, and by destroying them we will be able to extend them to the entire battlefield. It is a very simple mechanic, apparently, which lends itself to the most sophisticated and ingenious strategies. The game, especially in the final chapters, is specially designed around this feature, which must be assimilated in the shortest possible time. This makes Disgaea 4 Complete+ a not very easy title to learn to play, especially if you are not very familiar with the genre. We need to think about actions and movements, turn after turn, also because the opposing artificial intelligence, although not exactly brilliant, is designed to target our weakest units. A plethora of secondary functions add to the basic capabilities of our units, which can attack and use spells or other special abilities related to the weapons they wield. Humanoid units can grab each other and form columns that expand the range of attacks and grant new capabilities. Recruited monsters, on the other hand, can merge into larger monsters or temporarily transform into super-powerful weapons that other characters will wield. There is an interesting level of customization that explodes once the numerous functions of Hades are unlocked, the hub where we can wander between one mission and another: we can enter the random worlds of the individual weapons to upgrade them by defeating the enemies inside them , or introduce new laws to the senate of the afterlife and force the senators to pass them by force or money. It is even possible to build special buildings on a sort of checkerboard map that will affect the characters arranged around them, improving some stats and worsening others. Every mechanic or possibility in Disgaea 4 Complete+ exists to allow the player to build his very own army in a game that, unlike many other RPGs, allows you to reach astronomical numbers, four-digit levels and damage in the billions. It goes without saying that players who enjoy this aspect of strategic combat will love an approach that provides a considerable grind of missions: fortunately the variety of situations and the exaggerated absurdity of some attack animations make the experience very pleasant, even if in the long run it may be tiring to sift through the crowded screens of the management side. Between the long campaign, the amount of extra content to sift through and even some pleasant multiplayer features, Disgaea 4 Complete + makes up for its biggest flaw: it doesn't bring anything really new to a title with five years on its shoulders.", "date": "2019-10-28", "grade": "8.0"}
