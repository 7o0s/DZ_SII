Before starting to play it for the review, we feared that it was the classic case of unmotivated monetization, that is, an attempt to exploit a successful game by producing completely useless extra content. Fortunately, this is not the case, in the sense that for what it costs ( 4.99) and what it offers, The Bad Seed is more than valid and will appeal to the most hardcore fans of the game, those who are tired of always facing the same maps ( as far as procedurally generated). In terms of content, The Bad Seed brings with it two new settings: The Arboretum in Ruins and The Swamp of the Outcast; as well as a boss called Mama Tick, housed in the mini-level The Nest. They are both well characterized scenically, with some points of visual excellence in the Swamp and in the Nest, qualitatively close to the best that has been seen in the other levels of Dead Cells. To access the new content there is no need to have finished the game, as was the case for example for those of the free DLC Rise of the Giant. To reach the Arboretum, just explore the very first level, that of the prisons, and find the access, after having recovered the key from a corpse. The three levels of The Bad Seed can be played in sequence and essentially represent an alternative to the classic levels at the start of the adventure. They are however more difficult, so be careful to choose them only when you are familiar with the game. The new contents The Ruined Arboretum is a now disused greenhouse inhabited by some fungiform creatures, called Yeeter and Jerkshroom, who would simply like to be in peace, but who will not hesitate to attack us on sight, collaborating to get to kill us. The big Yeeters can in fact throw the little Jerckhrooms at us, even from platforms placed on different levels from the one we are on. Structurally, the Arboretum is a very interesting level: it is divided into two independent parts, accessible by going left or right from the starting point, which do not require both to be explored to get to the exit. In practice, these are two distinct architecturally very compact buildings, with very few open spaces and against many micro rooms, where you fight frantically against the many enemies present. The Swamp of the Exiled, on the other hand, is a level made up of many large towers divided into tiny rooms, which however open onto large courtyards where you have to face the Giant Ticks, large creatures full of eyes that are really resistant but not too intelligent. The other new enemies are the Banished, small spear-wielding warriors who usually attack in pairs and let themselves fall from the ceilings throughout the level, and the Blowgunners, very agile creatures armed with blowguns. Here too the fights are often played in speed, both because you are subjected to continuous ambushes from the Banished, and because the Blowgunners have the bad habit of constantly changing platforms and escaping our attacks. Finally, the Nest is a small level that is really successful from a stylistic point of view, where you face the new boss, Mama Tick, who we won't describe to you so as not to spoil the surprise, but who we can generally define as very successful in terms of choreography / spectacular. but at the same time equipped with predictable attack patterns. In short, it's nice to fight with it but for a veteran player it doesn't represent a big challenge, especially since in its second phase it exposes itself too much to any weapon. Defeat Mama Tick we return to known tracks, i.e. in the levels we already know. Overall, The Bad Seed adds several hours of gameplay to Dead Cells, either because it's a title whose levels are replayed several times, or because it takes time to find and unlock the six new objects and twelve new clothes added to the gameplay. Just the new objects deserve a few separate words, because they are all designed to have peculiar effects and add variety to the action. For example, the fan can repel projectiles, while the claw scythe alone takes up two weapon slots because it has two devastating attacks.", "date": "2020-02-21", "grade": "8.5"}
