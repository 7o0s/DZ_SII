We are clearly talking about videogame realities, given that the offer of golf and mini-golf simulations appears fairly rich and over the years has allowed us to gain a lot of experience, but never like in the Super Stickman Golf series. The developers of Noodlecake Studios have worked on simple but effective ideas, putting us in the shoes of a stylized little man who throws his ball up, down, between hedges, mountains, cliffs and so on, confronting situations that can be defined as extreme it is little but being able to count on uncommon power and ability. After the spectacular holes of the first episode, the anonymous golfer is back in Super Stickman Golf 2 with a new load of scenarios and powers, as well as with two competitive multiplayer modes, which can be played online via Game Center or locally, and which allow us to challenge friends or complete strangers in matches based on a simple turn-based, asynchronous or real-time system. An excellent way to further lengthen the life of a product that in any case promises hours of fun, considering not only the number of levels (twenty, divided into five settings) but also and above all the degree of challenge, which increases significantly from one path to another due to the introduction of obstacles, chasms, moving objects, anomalous surfaces and more. Balls in the hole The gameplay of Super Stickman Golf 2 has not undergone any particular changes compared to the first episode, but undoubtedly work has been done in the direction of optimization, polishing some edges. Completely based on the touch screen, the controls are extremely simple: two arrows to determine the trajectory of the swing and a button to activate the movement of the power indicator and lock it on the desired value, trying to touch the screen at the right moment. A swing at maximum power produces a special shot, characterized by a clearly visible trail, which bounces well on solid surfaces and can get in the way in a situation where you need a lot of inspiration. However, you also need to know how to proceed delicately, especially when the hole is nearby and you don't want to waste the opportunity to place the ball there without further loss of time. Successfully completing a course is in fact a matter of differential, ergo a greater number of shots equals a negative score, as in real golf. When things get more complicated and the scenarios take on a more tangled aspect than usual, some special skills that the character learns as he gains experience and levels up come in handy. Available in limited quantities, these powers allow us to undo the last shot and repeat it, or to make the ball sticky and therefore make it adhere to any surface, or even make it immune to certain substances, and so on. The number of extra skills is quite high, and that factor really mixes the cards in terms of action variety. As for the technical sector, the graphic style is somewhat reminiscent of the works of Q-Games with the PixelJunk series, therefore bright and ~flat~ colors, essential lines but with a recognizable design. The musical accompaniment, on the other hand, seemed mediocre to us.", "date": "2013-03-20", "grade": "8.0"}
