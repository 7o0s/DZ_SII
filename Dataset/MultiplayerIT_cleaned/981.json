{"name": "Phantom Brave", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phantom-brave.html", "text": "Story of Japanese ghosts and ghosts The introduction of Phantom Brave is unsettling: three dark individuals are on the run in the darkness, hunted by something horrible that reaches them and takes their lives. This is the past. Immediately, we are brought back to the present: Marone lives on a small island, a good and sensitive girl... indeed, psychic. In fact, Marone can communicate with ghosts, which is why she is often called by the inhabitants of the nearby islands to resolve thorny situations related to the supernatural. Yet, everyone keeps their distance from this little girl, everyone fears her, because they say she's possessed or something dark revolves around her. You fear what you can't understand, it's usually said, and Ash knows it well. Ash is Marona's ~guardian~, a specter who is always close to her and protects, advises and helps her. Ash is a brave warrior, but he's not just any warrior: he's one of three individuals who perished at the hands of a cruel demon in the prologue of this story, along with two other demon hunters who, twist, were Marona's parents . And Ash stayed to watch over her, because Marona is destined to experience great adventures, meet bizarre characters and save the world. The usual tale of courage and high hopes? Perhaps, but told by Nippon Ichi, despite the dark atmospheres that distinguish it, the story of Phantom Brave takes on the sparkling and hilarious outlines that were the main narrative element of Disgaea and La Pucelle, offering the user a very balanced mix between seriousness and parody. The characters in Phantom Brave are well characterized and original, and the plot proves to be compelling and full of twists and turns, encouraging the player to face increasingly complex missions to reach the conclusion that opens the door to the sequel, recently released in Japan, titled Phantom Kingdom. The spectrum of tradition So the general atmosphere of the narrative has undergone a marked change, while maintaining the humorous elements that have made Nippon Ichi's other videogame stories famous, and also the gameplay, as we will see later, has been radically revised and transformed. Can we also talk about a technical restyling, then? Premise: it is useless to criticize the Nippon Ichi works for their retro, almost sixteen-bittian look, it is a precise choice of the skilful software house to use a visual setting far from the three-dimensional glories of 2005, getting closer to the first games of the genre for PSOne (Vandal Hearts, Final Fantasy Tactics, Hoshigami to name a few), with an isometric view, three-dimensional environments with ~sections~ and exquisitely 2D interactive units and elements. The result, already in Disgaea and La Pucelle, was convincing and fascinating, so as to convince Nippon Ichi to continue on this path by making only a few aesthetic improvements: and here the settings have become much more varied, detailed, colorful and full of details and visual goodies, while the sprites, having increased their general size, also enjoy better, more fluid and numerous animations. Also noteworthy is the greater definition of the lighting effects, whose massive but well-dosed use becomes the spectacular element of the battles, between special shots and spells of various kinds. The splendid character design also helps a lot, halfway between super deformed and realistic, with a purely Japanese and irresistible setting. And if we can therefore see the considerable commitment of the Nippon Ichi graphics and the improvements enjoyed by Phantom Brave compared to its little brothers Disgaea and La Pucelle, it must be said however that the same does not happen for the sound department: the funny musical tracks are back violin, pleasant and well orchestrated, but often not very suitable for game situations and sometimes even annoying during the most demanding or epic fights. Luckily the dubbing decisively solves the situation and although it is possible to select the track in Japanese or in English, the latter for once proves to be even superior to the Japanese one at times, thanks to truly talented actors. Ghost Task Force Talking about the deliberately modest technical realization of Phantom Brave is a necessary introduction to the analysis of the gameplay, given that the technical aspect has always been the most marginal element in the Nippon Ichi production. As in Disgaea and La Pucelle, also in Phantom Brave we will find ourselves facing a series of missions in which to better fight the player-strategist will have to take into consideration multiple environmental variables and numerous statistics in order to act in the most appropriate way to defeat the opponents, placing their units on the field and ifby lecturing the appropriate actions from time to time, including spells, special attacks, items to be consumed and more. Described in this way, the Phantom Brave game system monstrously resembles that of Disgaea and La Pucelle, and moreover between the two titles there was already no clear differentiation in terms of gameplay. And here the donkey falls: here we have the innovative Confine System. Speaking of the plot, we said that little Marona is able to communicate with ghosts, and it is through her medium skills that it is possible to field our army: in fact, through a simple command that only she is able to use, it is possible to have certain elements of the environment (such as trees, rocks, flowers and more) possessed by the spirits of our units, to physically manifest them and use them in battle. Depending on the object, a spirit that enters it will acquire certain bonuses, special abilities or weaknesses, consequently it will be up to us to decide which object to possess and which unit, based on its level of experience, its class, its innate abilities and psychophysical statistics. In other words, we are faced with one of the funniest and most complex mechanics ever, capable of satisfying the most experienced strategist thanks to the practically infinite possibilities it offers. Obviously this innovative system is linked to a playful tradition very dear to Nippon Ichi, that of unbridled level-up: even in Phantom Brave, as in Disgaea or La Pucelle, it will be necessary to spend hours creating new units (once again, as in Disgaea and La Pucelle it is possible to churn out dozens of warriors and magicians with different abilities based on the class), enhancing them by repeating the fights to the bitter end, in order to obtain real war machines capable of countering the most aggressive enemies. ~We are faced with one of the funniest and most complex mechanics ever, able to satisfy the most experienced strategist thanks to the practically infinite possibilities it offers.~ Ghost Task Force A somewhat old-fashioned mechanic that you may or may not like, but which when dropped into the playful context proves to be incredibly satisfying for those who have the patience and desire to dedicate some time to it. Otherwise you can fly to the end with a fake army, overcoming the basic missions of the plot, but skipping the extra chapters and the numerous secrets protected by enemies that only hard training will allow us to defeat. However, not everything is pink and flowers, given that two other innovative elements of Phantom Brave would have deserved some revision, given that their presence, however interesting, is not entirely positive. In the first place, the possibility of moving freely in the action area of a unit without remaining anchored to the archaic layout of the environment is certainly pleasant and original, but the uncertain collisions between the sprites and the isometric view generate some difficulty in positioning of the unit itself, in a game where the slightest mistake can jeopardize an already long battle. And then, the possibility of throwing enemies out of the battlefield, by throwing or pushing them, could be an interesting strategic option, given that it would allow you to balance the number of units on the field or to ~clean~ the areas in which they are most concentrated our opponents, but unfortunately Nippon Ichi has well thought of implementing a feedback for which, if an enemy is excluded through this technique, the others will suffer a bonus on the level of experience, thus becoming more difficult to defeat, while the same thing will not it happens if the player's units end up outside the battleground: consequently, this potentially useful strategy to facilitate clashes instead becomes a way to make them even more complex, making their use futile. Beyond these two unconvincing features, in addition to the excellent Confine System Phantom Brave presents countless other possibilities that are practically impossible to list in full, but among which it is worth mentioning the possibility of using any interactive element of the scenarios as a weapon, of enhancing any object and to generate random ~dungeons~ to train our units and recover otherwise unobtainable objects. Phantom Brave is undoubtedly the best strategy available for PS2, there's little to do. Nippon Ichi surpasses itself, improving or revolutionizing practically every element that could be considered ~weak~ in Disgaea and La Pucelle: the compelling and mature plot does not lack ironic and sparkling situations, graphically a significant step forward has been made while remaining deliberately anchored to the retro style halfway between 2D and 3D and the gameplay has been partially revolutionizedthanks to the ingenious and highly enjoyable Confine System. The flaws found in the review phase go practically into the background, especially if you are a lover of the genre and experienced strategists able to appreciate the most typical feature of Nippon Ichi productions, that is, employing time and patience in the creation and cyclical upgrading of units. While waiting for Phantom Kingdom, which has received very positive reviews in Japan, Phantom Brave is a must-buy for any fan of the genre and for lovers of RPGs with beautiful plots who are not afraid of complex mechanics and difficult challenges. Pros: Excellent plot Confine System: brilliant and innovative Complex, varied and satisfying Cons: Even if desired, the graphic style may not be liked Some options not particularly convincing Music sometimes not very adequate Nippon Ichi was a virtually unknown software house until a couple of years ago. In the past, it stood out for a particularly original game for PSOne, Rhapsody, the first RPG-musical ever made. Musical? Oh yes, because the wacky protagonists of Rhapsody, out of the blue, sang like in a real musical. And it is with intelligent and bizarre ideas like these that Nippon Ichi re-proposed itself to the general public of the PlayStation 2 a couple of years ago with La Pucelle, the story of a young schizophrenic exorcist, released in America after the hilarious Disgaea, which definitively conquered the players with his sparkling humor set in the most absurd context: the rise to power of the young and evil heir to a hellish kingdom. To unite these three games, their genre: RPG-strategic. Because Nippon Ichi is a teacher in the field of strategy: it is not only the narrative background that embellishes Nippon Ichi productions, but also the depth and variety of the gameplay, well structured, ingenious, complex and satisfying. And Phantom Brave belongs to the same category, but with a difference: here the light-hearted tone, although present, gives way to a more mature, more epic and compelling plot, which makes the difference. Because Phantom Brave is the best strategy available on PlayStation 2.", "date": "2005-04-01", "grade": null}
