Seven years and not hear them, some would say. Welcomed at the time with the almost hysterical enthusiasm of those who have finally found themselves faced with an inspired, passionate and very thick tie-in after a very long wait and countless disappointments, the game produced by SEGA has aged very well and it is incredible to see it in movement on mobile devices. History Alien: Isolation, the early stages of the campaign before leaving for the space station From a narrative point of view, Alien: Isolation stands as a real sequel to the first episode of the film saga with Sigourney Weaver and puts us in the shoes of Amanda, her daughter, who fifteen years after the disappearance of the Nostromo is still desperately of the truth about what happened to the crew. A search that could finally find a conclusion: it seems that the black box of the Nostromo has been found and taken to the Sevastopol space station, and that is where Amanda decides to go, in the company of a team in charge by Weyland-Yutani. He doesn't know, however, that in the meantime something has happened inside the station and that a lethal Xenomorph is hiding in the darkness of its corridors without electricity. Gameplay Alien: Isolation, the contrasts between light and shadow help create a great atmosphere Halfway between traditional survival horror and the so-called ~passive~ ones, in which it is only possible to flee and hide in the face of any threats, Alien: Isolation uses a first-person view to lead us into our exploration sessions aboard the Sevastopol , which as mentioned quickly fell into chaos after the arrival of the Xenomorph and was abandoned by most of the crew. The people left on board are often disreputable, and with them there are androids who will help make life even more difficult after we find ourselves alone, without any equipment in an attempt to resume communications with the ship that has led there. Alien: Isolation, the cassette where to make the saves We will therefore have to collect objects and resources, build tools useful for our survival and obtain weapons that however we could choose not to use. The Xenomorph is in fact moved by a brilliant intelligence, he knows how to move and hide from view, but above all he perceives lights and sounds that can lead him to the next prey. Between environmental puzzles, frequent save points, proximity detectors and high-voltage sequences , managing to escape from Sevastopol without being killed by the dangerous alien will take at least twenty hours, but the mobile version of Aien: Isolation also includes the Expendable Crew and Sole Survivor DLCs, as well as Survival mode. Technical realization Alien: Isolation boasts great visuals, even though it's been seven years since its original release The English studio of Feral Interactive has now several projects for iOS and Android that have been able to amaze with graphics and sound, see for example the review of GRID Autosport and the review of XCOM 2 Collection. It is also the team responsible for the excellent conversion we told you about in the Alien: Isolation for Nintendo Switch review. It is evidently from there that the game reduction project for mobile devices started, although depending on the terminal it is It is possible to enjoy benefits that were not present on the Japanese hybrid console. On the iPhone 12 Pro, for example, the options allow you to choose between a mode focused on the resolution at 30 fps or on one that focuses on performance and runs at 60 fps, while on the third generation iPad Pro it travels only at 30 frames. The game supports cross-save and it is therefore possible to carry on the game on smartphones, perhaps while you are away from home, and continue it once back on the tablet to take advantage of the larger screen and support for the controller, which changes to radically the quality of the gameplay and allows you to play very well even at low frame rates. In fact, with the touch controls, wriggling at 30 fps gives a general feeling of poor reactivity, but fortunately the options on the sensitivity of the controls improve things a bit. Specifically in terms of graphics, Alien: Isolation is certainly surprising on mobile . It seems that assets and effects have not suffered particular cuts,and thus it is possible to explore the space station which is the backdrop to the adventure, appreciating the play of light and shadow functional to the atmospheres, the volumetric lighting and the excellent rendering of the fire. The animations of the characters and their appearance appear dated compared to more recent productions on PC and consoles, but on iOS and Android they still stand out today, especially the Xenomorph. The sound is also enriched by a good dubbing in Italian.", "date": "2021-12-18", "grade": "8.5"}
