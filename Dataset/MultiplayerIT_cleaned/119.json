{"name": "Superman Returns", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/superman-returns.html", "text": "Does Superman do it better? The assumption behind the entire concept of Superman as a ~hero~ isn't easy to apply to just any video game, and it's something that programmers have always had to grapple with and work around: Superman is invincible, invulnerable, he can do anything. How do you produce a video game where there can't really be a challenge, if the protagonist isn't in danger in any way? The idea behind this Superman Returns for DS is that Superman is not the one in danger, but his city, Metropolis. From the outset, Metropolis is shown as a sort of chessboard, divided into boxes, complete with a vital energy indicator: each box can be threatened in some way by the enemy on duty, and Superman must move from box to box towards the 'goal, solve a stage of the game and save Metropolis. Obviously, the longer it takes to reach the goal, the more energy the city will lose, and at the same time once in the ~stage~ time will still be the main enemy of the DC Comics superhero. We could therefore define Superman Returns as a sort of ~compilation~ of mini-games, one more banal than the other: we will have to save hostages or men in danger, moving them from one point to another in the action area, or sometimes we will have to engage in ~rhythm~ duels some historical enemies of the comic series such as Brainiac or Metallo, which Electronic Arts has decided to include in the cartridge, given that Lex Luthor, Superman's only opponent in the film, was not enough even in the video game . It is undeniable however that proposing a timed race as a level to reach the Daily Planet is quite sad, for someone who turns back time by circling the planet at mach speed. The most ironic thing is probably the very high difficulty of the product, not only represented by the awkwardness of the controls, not very reactive and strangely complex even when Superman has only one action, but by the central mechanics itself: basically, Metropolis loses energy faster than it It takes Superman to achieve the goals, and the ~game over~ seems constantly around the corner. The DS and 3D The technical realization of Superman Returns is extremely flawed, demonstrating that the game was developed in a hurry on the wave of the success of the film. The problem is not so much the polygonal engine, all in all decent considering the hardware and the ideas of Electronic Arts, as some notable transversal defects: seeing a loading screen (?!) complete with the writing ~Loading~ flashing for more than 10 seconds between screens, or the very long and soporific initial loading of the game... they are already bad calling cards. The rest is done by the uncomfortable controls in their simplicity, considering the banal flight mechanics: the backbones are used to change Superman's altitude when he flies, but combining them with the directional cross is a terrible operation when the camera works so badly . The all in all decent animations of Superman and the enemies are opposed by a really poor realization of the settings: the locations lack detail and show an extremely flat and monotonous color palette. Even Metropolis, the cradle of civilization, is a mass of polygonal buildings without a reason. Making a videogame dedicated to Superman is always a challenge, but once again Clark Kent was unlucky: the DS cartridge contains one of the worst action-games of recent years, lacking in gameplay and technical implementation, despite some good ideas that maybe it will be exploited in the future by other games. The visual and playful monotony bring down this tie-in, which as expected will perhaps only appeal to those who have enjoyed the film and are under 15 years old. Interesting Pro Concept It's still Superman... Cons Awkward controls Some unbearable stages Technically bad It was absolutely obvious that the man of steel would visit video game consoles, with the release of the new film dedicated to his deeds, a direct sequel to the feature films starring the late Christopher Reeves: the new Superman has the face of Brandon Routh, the his nemesis is the great Kevin Spacey in the role of Lex Luthor, Bryan Singer is now directing, in short, the actors and the director change but Kal-el always has a world to save and in this case a woman to win back, the beautiful Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Fresh from the challenge of the first two films dedicated to the X-Men, Bryan Singer directs a blockbuster on Superman trying to renew the character and at the same time create a ~superhero movie~ far from the canons of pure action without reflection or plot. But that doesn't change the fact that Superman is a super-hero, that he's a video gamecan be produced and that only the brand can sell a lot. Moral of the story? Here's yet another bad tie-in.", "date": "2007-02-01", "grade": null}
