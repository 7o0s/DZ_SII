{"name": "Colin McRae Rally 2.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-rally-22.html", "text": "Those who have already had the opportunity to play the second chapter on PC or PSone will immediately find both the graphic style and the menu options familiar. In fact, there are the two classic Championship and Arcade modes which, in turn, allow you to tackle an entire racing session, a single race, a single stage (only in championship mode) or the Time Trial. Unlike what is reported in the manual, it is possible to set the difficulty level only in the Championship: once the first two levels have been passed, a third will be unlocked just like in the PC and PSone versions. The choice of the degree of difficulty involves variations not only on the speed of the opponents, but also on the number of stages to be faced in order to be able to pass a race. For the few who don't know it yet, it seems appropriate to me to add that, while in the Arcade mode you will compete against three opponents (of course the one who arrives first wins), in the Championship mode you will be alone and you will have to beat the times of the other fifteen drivers. The graphics, while not reaching the spectacularity of V-Rally 3, are in themselves a small miracle when compared to the hardware on which the game runs. The desire to copy the home version has in fact led to the use of 3D for cars with its strengths and weaknesses; if the cars and the various effects connected to them are appreciable (the cars get dirty and damaged), the very constant updating on the screen (except in replays), and a good sense of speed, the poor definition of the textures is instead criticisable and the low perception of the position of the corners (the situation improves in the championship thanks to the indicative arrows) due to a visible horizon very close to the nose of the car, which in turn is placed too far forward of the screen and with no possibility of changing its framing (in short, a view from the inside would have been very welcome). Also noteworthy is the presence of a few surrounding elements and a notable pop-up effect both for these and for the opposing cars. All these considerations are to be considered in an absolute sense; if, on the other hand, we think that CMRR2 runs on a console that we easily carry in our pockets, the technical side is more than fine, as are the soundtrack, the effects and the speech of the co-pilot Nicky Grist. The peculiarity that distinguishes the series is the high degree of realism in simulating this particular sport and also this version does not want to be outdone. Broadly speaking, it could be said that the behavior of the car repeats that of the home editions with the only difference in an apparent greater lightness of the cars which results in spectacular overturning of your car or in dangerous maneuvers on two wheels if you face cornering at a higher speed than necessary. For the rest, there is nothing to complain about: the machines are subject to mechanical breakdowns (in addition to the dirt and deformations already mentioned) which must be repaired between stages, taking into account the time available, the level of challenge offered is high (at the higher difficulty levels it will not be very easy to get the best times) and the driving feeling is very good, even if you miss the vibrations especially when you go off the road and in the snowy stretches. The control system is simple but you have to get used to it a little before being able to seriously master the car and I can already see the less experienced grappling with spins and rollovers in the initial stages, quickly replaced by spectacular drifting corner exits complete with exhaust flame and clouds of dust. Ultimately a title that should not be missing in your collection, whether you are passionate about rallying or simply love driving games. Technically there is better around (read V-Rally 3) but the quality of the simulation and the longevity is not comparable: before you manage to complete the arcade part and the 36 circuits of the championship mode (to see them all you need to unlock the higher difficulty level) it will take quite some time and even after that you can always challenge up to three friends using the link cable and a single game cartridge (if they were all like that). Pros: It's Colin McRae! Exciting Long-lived Cons: Horizon not far away Lack of alternative visuals On the small screens of the millions of GBAs around the world it seems that the games dedicated to motor sports never see the word Game Over; I'm infthe titles released since the launch of the Nintendo portable are many acts, with the last pearl constituted by the technically superb V- Rally 3 by Infogrames. Given the great success of the latter title, it was very unlikely that Codemasters would not churn out a small-format transposition of its famous rally simulator. The only regret (but not so much) is that the version you find on the shelves is 2.0; choice due (I think) to the desire to release the new episode first on the ~larger~ consoles.", "date": "2002-10-15", "grade": null}
