{"name": "APB Reloaded", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/97938-apb-reloaded-buoni-o-cattivi.html", "text": "A sandbox-style MMO where two factions, vigilantes and criminals, clash for control of the city of San Paro? Many would have bet on such a project, powered by the tested Unreal Engine 3, but there are some ~ifs~ and ~buts~ that obviously the original development team of APB - All Points Bulletin, Realtime Worlds, had not taken into account serious consideration. Released in June 2010, the game took only a couple of months to turn out to be a catastrophe from an economic point of view: on the one hand due to the types of subscriptions available, in which you had to pay by time and pay additional money for certain upgrades ; on the other hand for some obvious limitations in terms of gameplay and structure, which have resulted in an at least tepid reception by sector critics. A series of factors, therefore, which led to the shutdown of the servers in September of the same year, while Realtime Worlds ended up in controlled administration. Two months after the acquisition by Gamersfirsts, which after a quick beta re-released the game with the title APB Reloaded, transforming it into a free-to-play and thus enriching its catalog of productions belonging to the same category. In its new incarnation, APB has primarily opened the door again to original users, guaranteeing them the restoration of the customizations and equipment obtained, while simultaneously attracting some three million new players. More than meets the eye It is clear that the operation carried out by the Californian publisher was not aimed simply at re-proposing the same product seen in 2010. With this in mind, the features promised (but never implemented) by Realtime Worlds were quickly added, starting with the new districts dedicated to pure action. Next to the already known Financial, Waterfront and Social, therefore, we now find a section called ~Fight Club~ with two locations: The Beacon and Baylan Shipping. The first consists of a huge building under construction and includes the immediate surrounding area, therefore boasting a large number of possible positions behind which to take shelter during firefights, as well as a sort of ~race within a race~ for control of the upper floors of the building. building, from which we enjoy a privileged position with respect to those who will try to eliminate our team. The second is located near the sea, in a port area characterized above all by containers that allow not only shelter from enemy fire, but also hiding in a confined space to then catch the opponent off guard. Once the mandatory tutorial phase is over, however, immediately grappling with the fights might not be the best idea, as always happens in titles in which the level of the players can be very different and the phenomenon of ~cannon fodder~ is created in relation to the novices. In short, if you want to shoot immediately you can do it, but the chances that it will go wrong, and therefore that the first impact with the game will not prove to be exactly positive, are high. Therefore, it is better to become familiar with the ~classic~ districts based on missions, Financial and Waterfront, which depending on your alignment (Criminal or Enforcer) can prove to be more or less busy, and focus on improving the character by completing the challenges. In fact, beyond the outlay of real money, leveling is the only mechanism that allows us to access more powerful weapons and a series of customizations to make our alter ego unique. And I pay! So let's face the question of the free experience, immediately clarifying that the virtual money earned through the missions, in conjunction with the level increase, allows us to play for hours without paying a penny. Those who want to try APB Reloaded can therefore do so without fearing for the safety of their credit card, given that there are no particular limitations for free users. The matter of competitiveness is different, where the ~pay to win~ motto is invariably valid: you will happen to come across opponents who move aboard extremely customized cars, armed to the teeth and capable of blowing up the vehicle you are on in seconds. Checking it in these circumstances is not impossible, but the quality of the gameplay is not yet at the level of triple A productions and therefore does not offer great outlets for those who want to bring out their skills without switching to premium status. The in-game purchase system is the classic Gamersfirst one and uses blocks of credits equal to 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, 3200 and 6400 units, respectively at the price of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 80 dollars. What can you comprare? Maybe the Premium status, which implies the multiplication of bonuses and experience points, as well as the extension for the use of certain weapons, and costs 999 credits for thirty days. Or additional weapons, vehicles, clothing and slots for characters: most rifles cost around 700 credits, cars from 1400 credits and up, accessories start at 300 credits, and so on. In the end, a fair level of competitiveness can be achieved by spending relatively little, unless you want everything right away. The evolution of gameplay Beyond the transition to the free-to-play format and the addition of the new districts, APB Reloaded has also undergone a process of optimization in terms of gameplay, smoothing out some of the most annoying edges that undermined the experience in its previous incarnation. Shooter dynamics have been improved in the first place, and the level of damage inflicted by bullets has been increased. In a nutshell, it is much easier to kill and be killed, which makes any firefights faster to complete and the deathmatch phases more dynamic and frenetic. Secondly, driving the vehicles has been completely redesigned to make it more enjoyable and less cumbersome. We can say that the objective has been achieved in half, given that the cars still suffer from a considerable delay in responding to commands and this makes it almost impossible to perform seemingly trivial maneuvers (run over an opponent walking unaware, for example). The problem is further amplified by the lack of support for joypads: the Xbox 360 controller is detected but you have to customize all the controls to work, and yet many things do not behave properly (analog sticks are not taken into account, for example , eliminating the ability to assign actions to the d-pad). In short, you necessarily need to play with mouse and keyboard, which is not very unpleasant during the action phases (although making an already non-glamorous impact sensation even more ethereal) but, as mentioned, it greatly affects the driving of vehicles. As far as the technical sector is concerned, on the one hand the city of San Paro offers a beautiful panorama and fairly populated and plausible streets, on the other the location design is not always convincing and sometimes appears simplistic. To this we must add the problems relating to matchmaking and connection, which made our tests really difficult both on the Gamersfirst platform and on Steam.", "date": "2012-01-25", "grade": "6.8"}
