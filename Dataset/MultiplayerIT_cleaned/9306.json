Located in an alternative past, where apparently the Cold War has ceased to be such and the world superpowers have helped to destroy the known world thanks to a nuclear holocaust, the work of Xpect Games features some brave pilots who, for reasons not better specified (and which probably nobody cares about), decide to challenge each other in races to the death, making fun of the deadly radiation inevitably present in all areas of the game. Atypical bounces In full Motorstorm style, therefore, Race After 1977 proposes a series of challenges on dirt circuits (but also snow-covered or asphalt) at the limit of practicability, where to continue along the countryside it is necessary to reach at least the podium in each race, accumulating points; therefore, no tickets for the festival, but each series of competitions becomes available only after reaching at least the third place total in the previous one, considering the score obtained at the end of the championship. A classic structure with progressive increase, therefore, which in addition to unlocking new circuits (there are 10 in total, including those on the contrary) and new cars, is the setting for a game that does not actually offer any news worthy of note, both in terms of gameplay and technical innovations. While not considering the lack of new ideas in itself necessarily a bad thing (in fact many sequels surpass the original titles in quality), on this occasion the lack of freshness of content weighs heavily, also because the ~classic~ ones are certainly not been implemented perfectly. The feeling you get when trying any of the game cars (quite diversified in appearance but not in driving) is that of being faced with approximate physics, capable of alternating spectacular moments with others that are apparently inexplicable; thus, for example, one has the opportunity to tackle in the same lap a ramp capable of making the vehicle perform unthinkable jumps and a wall which, on the contrary, stops it instantly if hit without any consequences. Even the bounces of the cars on the ground suffer from the same ambiguous behavior, with well-recreated movements alternating with other absolutely improbable ones. Given then the total absence of physical or mechanical damage (a not insignificant flaw, considering the genre that makes spectacular accidents one of its strong points), at least an animation of total destruction following terrifying frontals would have been desirable; on the other hand, just the collisions overwhelmingly fill the box of against. A few small notes to mention also on the controls: available both via accelerometers and via touch screen (or with two arrows at the edges of the screen or by proposing a steering wheel on the preferred side of the display), for response and immediacy the configuration with accelerometers is clearly preferable , which give a more credible feeling. However, it is easy to see how even in this case the cars assume attitudes that are difficult to interpret, forcing constant trajectory adjustments even in the presence of simple curves to tackle and making it quite difficult to get back into the race; finally, a marked ~pendulum effect~ contributes to making handling even more difficult. Acceleration is automatic (but no turbo is present) while the brake remains manual, not shining in terms of reactivity and intensity (and above all its use with the wheels turned unfortunately does not facilitate corner entry through a controlled skid, unless after a long press). From a technical point of view, if possible, the total dualism of Race After 1977 is even more confirmed. If at first sight the glance appears above average, as the various tracks are tackled, a whole series of limitations begin to show themselves. not very nice, especially on a title that competes against numerous other ~90 pieces~. So here are grainy or bad quality textures, angular rocks, pop-ups, frame rate drops and very similar scenarios interspersed however with good light effects and a fair realization of the cars; to aggravate the already controversial situation, however, there is a distinctly inadequate audio sector in terms of sound effects (the roars of the engines look more like meaningless buzzes) and just sufficient with regard to the accompanying music. Good news from the front instead I knowcial: despite not having any multiplayer mode at the moment, the title fully supports Game Center and has 50 unlockable achievements, a factor that will push score fanatics to replay it for a long time.
