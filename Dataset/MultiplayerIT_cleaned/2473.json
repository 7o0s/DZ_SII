{"name": "Gangsters 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gangsters-2.html", "text": "Don Corleone and his family In Gangsters 2: Vendetta, the player assumes control of Joshep ~Joey~ Bane, son of a small Mafia Boss in the area, whose purpose is to shed light on the murder of his father, which took place in a very suspicious way (an ambush ). The America of the 1920s, that of prohibition, machine guns and clandestine gambling dens, is the backdrop to the story, which unfolds very clearly from the very first moments. In fact, once the player has heard the news and identified the culprit of the crime, he does not go to the police (partially corrupted by the various mafia groups in the area), but decides to take over his father's company and use it to take revenge. Unlike the original title, the game is developed through a series of mission-based ~levels~: that is, in each city, there will be some particular objectives to be achieved (the beautiful one that sees us forced to steal bodies from a laundry or keep some income in the stripper club, particularly those that see us engaged in the recovery of some kidnapped people, in the destruction of some buildings or in the assassination of enemy bosses) which certainly give the title a temporal coherence and a little more variety than the predecessor . So much so that, once you kill the person responsible for your father's murder, you will discover that you have fallen into a much deeper net than expected However, it should be emphasized, with regard to the variety of objectives, that it affects a lot during the first games, but already after a few hours of play, and above all after a few completed missions, it loses its charm and tends to get lost in repetitiveness. The only thing, and this is really a pity, that will distinguish one mission from another, is only the size of the territory (which will tend to increase) and the number of missions to be accomplished. To make matters worse, the absolutely non-dynamic initial briefing, absolutely slow (in this regard I tried to play the game in the English version, hoping it was a translation error, but I discovered that the defect is also present in the original master), so as to lead us to think that the same narrator (as well as adviser during the game) of the first job reads the lottery drawings. This is a wasted opportunity, as the initial briefings are very complete and are often accompanied by a more than discreetly made film: it won't take you long to hate the slowness with which they are exposed The Godfather Part Four Graphically, the title is set up with an isometric 2D view, typical of many other squad-based games (among all the magnificent Jagged Alliance2), and this allows you to recreate the various settings (all external) in a rather realistic and convincing way. The defect of this setting turns out to be the lackluster choice of the translucency of the buildings, which can be activated by pressing a particular key (F9), which for the most part will represent more of a hindrance to the vision of one's own actions than a help. This is really a pity, because in the face of the splendid reproduction of the buildings and the characters roaming the streets (the animations of the police teams are very beautiful, those of the vehicles are less convincing, especially when we are driving them), a lightness of genre particularly affects the playability of the product, which fortunately remains discreet. Discreet thanks above all to the small map that we can activate at any time, which turns out to be our main source of information (it will show the enemies, the critical points of the city, the important places, the movements of our gangsters), but above all, paradoxical to say, the place where we will spend most of our time directing men and following the evolution of situations. I haven't used the term paradoxical at all, since even if this map will be much less pleasant from a graphic point of view, it represents the only truly functional way to be able to interact with the surrounding environment. The programmers must have realized this, so much so that a convenient function has been implemented that allows you to instantly switch from a real-time action to a turn-based one. In fact, the ability to press the space bar (Baldur's Gate Anyone?), and to pause to assign tasks to your gangster, gives the player the opportunity to reflect more calmly, planning the next moves in the best way; the player is further benefited by the simplification, compared to the first episode, of the game interface, which this time is more manageable and less complex. What unfortunatelythe player will be forced to do after just a few games, is to plan everything in the two-dimensional map, to then observe the result of the actions in real time; and it's really a shame, because this takes away a lot of dynamism from the gameplay and gives the title a sense of incompleteness. Earlier I mentioned a clear improvement in the interface compared to the first episode: now to order a kill, just click first on the Gangster (each of them can have up to four henchmen who will be given weapons), observe if he has any specialties ( is able to drive a car, can mine buildings, is very skilled with heavy weapons, has good sniping skills), and click on the enemy to attack. This simplification benefits gameplay, which is certainly much less complicated than before, when everything was done in turn-based mode and it was necessary to go through a myriad of windows to create even the simplest of orders. However, the flaw, in this case, concerns the variety of Gangsters that we can hire, all more or less similar to each other. Sure, everyone has, as mentioned before, their own specialties, but no one will ever interact in any way with non-player characters (speaking of which, you can never kill someone who isn't part of another gang or is of the body police officers, in spite of mafia cruelty...), nor with you, making everything rather anonymous. Among other things, none of the Gangsters will be truly unique, as it is absolutely indifferent to give one weapon or another to one member or the next, since there are no particular skills or preferences. On the other hand, a positive side of the matter concerns the experience points that it is possible to accumulate during the game, every time you manage to successfully complete a mission: these points will be distributed among the gangsters of the gang as you choose, making them a little stronger or a little more precise. But what's the point of doing this, if when you have to change city it won't be possible to take all the members with you? Another negative note must be spent in the connection between the managerial part (that is, the collection of funds that allow us to guarantee the salary of the hired men and their arsenal) and the tactical one: unfortunately the enemy AI, as we will see, allows such a simplification of the clashes (ambushes in the car are a prime example of this, given their power), that it will be enough to have the most powerful weapon to get the better of it, in spite of any deeper tactical approach. Therefore, accumulating the money will only serve us to equip the members of our team, i.e. both the Gangsters, with the best arsenal. And that's that. Cooler than Michael. Taking a quote on the intelligence of the two most beloved brothers of the Corleone family, it will not have been difficult for you to understand what I mean: AI, Artificial Intelligence. On more than one occasion, during the game, I had the opportunity to ask myself how some behavior routines were implemented; not only is it necessary to bombard our gangsters with orders, on pain of their elimination by the enemy gangs in any way, even the most trivial, but it is also necessary to be their nurse during any firefight. Imagine the aforementioned Baldur's Gate, turn off the AI of your party characters and watch them face the enemy helplessly. In most cases, even if you have them well equipped, they will tend to flee as soon as someone dares to shoot at them The only consolation concerns those cases in which you will assign the Gangster with henchmen, because you will always watch them throw themselves in the middle of the line of fire . This is definitely an improvement over the original title, but in this case we would have preferred a more brilliant programming of the Gangsters AI themselves. Words of praise instead for the good tutorial present at the beginning of the game, which also allows those who are not familiar with the series to quickly familiarize themselves with the game structure: this is accompanied, for all the missions that follow, by an excellent figure of ~advisers~ (actually the former business partner of the protagonist's father), who will be able to show us at all times the best way forward to get the better of our opponents. From this point of view, the management interface is also very nice, with which we constantly monitor the various activities from our office. Very beautiful, but very little used, given the relative little importance it assumes during the missions. Half a faux pas? If we had to sum up, and perhaps the time has come to do so, we could only express our disappointment for this wasted opportunityta. It is true that, as we mentioned in the prologue, it is impossible to create an original game starting from an already present idea; however the margins for improvement compared to the first Gangster were many, and only some of them were exploited by Eidos. I wasn't too happy with the original Gangster when I had the chance to play it some time ago, and I don't deny that I kept some hope of being able to see such an intriguing concept improved. However, the fun that this Vendetta can give for the first hours of the game, for the first missions, disappears when the lack of consistency of the realization is realized, but above all the poor strategic use of the resources (the Gangsters) at one's disposal. More focused on the use of violence and weapons than its predecessor (you will spend much more time this time in the streets than in the monitoring menus of your activities and you will find the Business part too simplistic and already pre-packaged), Vendetta tends to get lost rather easily in a slightly too simplistic realization, almost as if the programmers had not fully believed in the project. The passage from day to night is beautiful, the introduction of the missions is remarkable (but up to the saturation point, after which repetitiveness is the master ... and this happens really too soon), the addition of the henchmen to the Gangsters is useless for the reasons mentioned above, the Multiplayer support to the game is quite good (even if it seems that the same, numerous, community passionate about the first episode is organizing itself to recreate something worthy of note), the (failed) attempt to mix real time with turns ... everything this is positive, but what really needed to be improved has not been changed much: artificial intelligence in the first place, with blunders that lead to frustration in a very short time. And why hasn't the interface been changed radically, given the failure of the same in the first edition, instead of trying to modify it? The answer lies in the excessive imprecision with which our men receive orders, and carry out what is requested of them. Ultimately this Gangster2 seems to belong to a world of its own, a world of passage where the first episode is ferrying, driven by the desire to offer the public something competitive. Where will this game concept, more intriguing than ever, arrive? To Gangsters 3 or to oblivion? For the moment we can only be content with this episode, trying not to complain too much about what could have been done and hasn't been done, about what could have been changed and has instead remained as before. Mind you, Gangsters 2 is not a totally negative game, and in its own way it also knows how to give a few hours of fun, especially to those who have not had the opportunity to play the first episode. But what is there is still too weak, and is swept away by the numerous defects, by the lightness, in a few hours of play. And what remains is just a series of questions: why haven't we thought of a graphics of the main game screen that is perhaps less redundant, but more functional? Why hasn't anyone thought of making an interface more accessible and devoid of gross shortcomings (how is it possible that our gangsters don't acquire some commands at the first opportunity remains a mystery)? Why doesn't the variety of missions that characterize the first half of the game continue until the end? Why make the management part of the game so trivial? Why exalt the real-time combat part, when to kill someone just have the strongest weapon and click on it? Why aren't Gangsters customized like the mercenaries from Jagged Alliance2? But above all, why did we want to try once again to merge shifts with real time, creating an unsuccessful clone of Baldur's Gate in the part relating to the fights? Only when we have an answer to these questions, then we will be faced with a big game: for the moment, we can safely wait and look further. P.S: As usual, and in this case it's really a must, a little comment about the localization of the product. The title has been completely localized in Italian, and all the work (which includes from the shortest dialogue to the smallest menu) is truly splendid, also because it is surrounded by a rather ironic aura. For once, and we hope it won't be the last, the translation clearly beats the original version, where all the voices appear to have been done by a single actor! The compliments to Leader, whether it was she who translated or Eidos itself, are really serious this time. Prologue: or rather how good it is to be bad!
