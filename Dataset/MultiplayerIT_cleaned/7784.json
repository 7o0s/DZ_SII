The funny thing then, thinking about it for a second, is that the fascination linked to this imaginary is as predictable as it is totally irrational, being linked to concepts that can be counted on the fingers of one hand and which are repeated identically in each production. The fact is one: it is enough for us to see a dead man staggering and looking for human flesh and we are happy. At least as long as all this remains in fiction, of course. The predictability of certain human archetypes reaches its peak in the face of Zombies, any plot that binds or revolves around the expansion of a (non) deadly virus, the extinction of the human race and post-disaster survival kidnaps us and captures the 'Attention. And if we also add convincing gameplay to the plot, all the better. Here comes the new video game created by the equally new Undead Labs: State of Decay, available on the Xbox Live marketplace for a few days. A name that is a program The State of Decay developers seem to really believe in Zombies, or at least they don't joke about it at all. It is clear by scrutinizing their (newly born) official website where we read that the arrival of the undead and their proliferation in the world is not so much a question of if, rather than when. Perhaps thinking of creating an ~educational~ video game for this purpose, they created their first and (for now) last effort with the intention of making us understand what normal social life could be like after a particularly devastating event such as the arrival of this very particular and powerful degenerative ~disease~. Let's start by giving a particularly valuable piece of information: the founder and head of the newborn Undead Labs team is not just any guy, he's not a last-minute Zombie enthusiast and he's not a programmer found around the corner, but it's nothing-popo -less-than by Jeff Strain. And who is it? Suffice it to say that he was a founding member of ArenaNet (he understands something about online gaming, let's say, since he developed Guild Wars), but above all lead programmer of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Warcraft III, as well as StarCraft campaign editor. A prominent and respectable curriculum vitae that lays the foundations and premises to give birth to an excellent title like State of Decay. Was all his experience enough to create the definitive Zombie title? Maybe not. First of all because State of Decay is not a game that can be played online, as the premises had initially led to believe, but it is a completely offline sandbox game (GTA-style). The title, code-named Class3, will lay and is already doing so, the foundations for the creation of Class4, the next fully online project always based on the same universe. One of the tricks to make Zombie-based stories more exciting and intriguing has been to shift the focus not so much on them, but on the personal stories, intrigues and social relationships of the survivors (The Walking Dead is one of the latest examples) , and State of Decay very intelligently starts from these concepts, makes them its own and manages to make the gameplay particular and very original. Xbox 360 goals State of Decay offers 400 points to unlock through 30 objectives. It is mostly about carrying out particular actions such as killing a companion to prevent it from ~transforming~, diverting the attention of a horde of zombies, expanding one's community of survivors and increasing one's popularity within it, kill at least one of each ~type~ of zombies and so on. They will not be obtained automatically by progressing in the game but a consultation is necessary to be able to unlock all the objectives foreseen by the programmers. A new interpretation Finally here is a zombie game where the gameplay is not based on the indiscriminate and forced slaughter of hordes of undead and progress through various levels. As any fan of this genre knows, the most important and difficult thing to do in these situations is not so much physically eliminating the man-eaters, but literally being able to survive in a way devastated by looting, food and petrol scarcity, the psychological fatigue of always being hunted down and never safe, anywhere. State of Decay tries to put us in the role of a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by hordes of hungry zombies, where our main tasks are to get water and supplies, fortify your base, save lives, but above alltry at all costs to avoid attracting the attention of all that fauna of ravenous creatures that now populate the earth, well aware that the direct confrontation between us (few and tired) and them (many and angry) would inevitably lead to nothing good . What State of Decay succeeds most in is precisely creating a sort of atmosphere based on a tangible and plausible precarious condition, a believable micro world full of things to do, places to explore and people to meet. Regardless of the Zombies: those are only the assumption on which the whole story rests, not the focus. The moribund world created for State of Decay is tremendously alive and pulsating, exciting like a Romero film, gripping like a Resident Evil action movie, dramatic like an episode of the first series of The Walking Dead because the expendable actions are not limited to shooting but rather expand the range of options by expanding with new possibilities. State of Decay is a successful mix of genres ranging from free roaming to action, from survival to management, even managing something role-playing (and given the past of the creator of Undead Labs we had no doubts). We have to find a safe haven and manage it in the best possible way, supplying it with raw materials and food, fortifying it, equipping it for survival with medicines and a functioning infirmary, but without forgetting that basically people live there. People who are often close to psychological breakdown with whom we must interact, who we must encourage and give them security in a world that is now perpetually insecure. Our stats are updated all the time, regardless of the discounted levels of agility, weapon use, dexterity, endurance and so on, we have to manage the popularity within the group, morale, happiness and stability of the rescued people. There is no more room in hell The objective of State of Decay, or at least one of the most important of the game, is in fact ~create group~ and try to maintain a community of survivors as large and happy as possible. The clash with the undead, therefore, is always preferable to avoid it. Zombies are not the focus of the gameplay and the game, but a sort of additional ~difficulty~, a stake, just like the ghosts of Pac-Man were placed there, between us and the pills to eat. And just like Pac-Man's ghosts, the goal is not so much to destroy them as to go around them, avoid them and not make them angry to try to get what we want: a safe place, food, supplies, medicine for our group. State of Decay's modern Pac-Man has a strong role-playing component that differentiates each character based on their skills and specific statistics that evolve based on the player's behavior. So it's better to use a stealthy to get into a palace without being noticed, or one with good use of weapons to make your way through a crowded horde. One of the defects that we can underline of this game is that the combat system could probably have been better refined and made more varied: after a few hours you realize you are always doing the same ~button mashing~ in front of the undead. But we also underline, once again, that the focus of the game is not dealing with zombies so the flaw is relative. However, regarding the clashes with zombies, the nice thing is that once a certain character passes away ... he is really gone forever, with the consequence that we become very attached to our companions, establishing an almost lifelong relationship. 'affection aware that that particular character could leave us pens at any moment. In fact, it is possible to use any character, changing from one to another at will when one is tired or run down. The management phase of the game, on the other hand, sets the goal of creating and keeping your shelter constantly efficient, at the cost of having to change it or rebuild it from scratch. Create the infirmary, the bodywork where to repair the vehicles, manage food supplies, fortify windows and doors to prevent the undead from breaking through and being able to enter. There are many things to do in the game and many actions to perform but we will not dwell on these simply because what we want to convey in this title is not just a list of what you can or cannot do, but the real apocalyptic atmosphere set in a desolate and remote place in the American countryside and how a group of people try to survive in the midst of many difficulties so well highlighted and digitally represented. State of Decay is a Live Arcade title, let's always keep it in mind, and in the face of its 1600 Microsoft Points it offers several hours of inentertainment. The game is very long. Depending on how we play it, it can vary from around 15 to 30 hours, especially if we like to explore the places on the map, which is really extensive and full of points of interest. The difficulty of the game is well calibrated, resulting never too simple but neither frustrating and difficult: the game is challenging, always linked to a double thread survival action that induces the player to constant attention, anxiety and tension that cut into slices . Let's not forget that we are dealing with a low budget game even when we ~look~ at it: State of Decay, whose release coincides absurdly with the publication of the first incredible nextgen videos, is at this point two generations behind in terms of technician. Pop-ups, tearing, low resolution and so on and so forth; the now forgotten clipping that had accompanied us so much in the old generations of video games is also back. State of Decay has a decidedly vintage look, but with content that we would all like to see in the nextgen as well. The great variety of things to do, the stealth survival approach and the management rpg component bode well for the future of this newborn brand and the developer's next project, but above all they make up for those graphic defects which, honestly, in the face of all the ~flab~ put inside those 2 GB doesn't give any trouble at all.
