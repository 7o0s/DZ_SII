The local delay depended on the airing of the computer graphics television series of the same name, which in theory should have been the driving force behind the game and contributed to a real relaunch of the character among the new generations who, for obvious reasons, do not have never seen in action in the original puzzle games nor in its classic adventures. In any case, now it's the turn of the sequel, which we had tried out in Tokyo and which, with the final version, confirms both the merits and the defects of a project that has evidently been reworked after the criticisms it received at its debut, which maintains its target of very young people and therefore proves to be too linear at times and full of suggestions (quite invasive for those with a minimum of experience with action platforms), but in the same way it solves some problems (visual management) and offers an interesting exploratory approach , interspersed with some variations on the theme. Pac-Man and the Monster Adventures 2 is a simple platformer full of ideas, ideal for the youngest The hero of the five worlds Beyond the details of a plot that leaves the time it finds, Pac-Man and the Monstrous Adventures 2 puts us back in the shoes of the Namco mascot in a fight without quarter with the usual ghosts, who have invaded five different locations, accompanied by a series of creatures as large as hostile. It will be up to us to stop its advance and bring the situation back to normal, with a view to a fairly full-bodied campaign, which inserts quotes that draw on the cinematic imagination (Godzilla, King Kong, Back to the Future among others) into the mix. , a level design that tries to mimic Super Mario Galaxy as much as possible and an emphasis on exploration, which is encouraged through the introduction of alternative passages and hidden areas where you can collect the missing candy to get a perfect score at the end of the stage . There are also variations on the theme, even if you have to distinguish them carefully. In fact, the special powers are back, which are integrated into the gameplay in an all too gradual way but then end up carving out a significant space for themselves and to represent an added value. By swallowing the right pill, Pac-Man can acquire abilities related to fire, ice or rock, transform into a ~bouncy sphere~ very close to his original forms or take on the appearance of a chameleon with a long forked tongue. Everything that was in the first episode is revived with an extra gear, see for example the possibility of ~gliding~ when using the power of fire, but not only. The repertoire of skills of the character, unpublished and not, fits well into the mechanisms that regulate the action and makes it more interesting, while suffering from the obligation to always maintain a certain level of accessibility, an attention to the younger ones who unfortunately it cuts the wings of those who ask the game for something more, in terms of challenge and pace. Playstation 3 trophies The twenty-six Trophies present in Pac-Man and the Monstrous Adventures 2 are obtained with a little effort and patience, as they depend on the achievement of high scores in the various levels and on the execution of certain operations repeated over time, such as the elimination of a particular type of ghost. Unsuccessful experiments The feeling, after the first few hours, is that the developers of Pac-Man and the Monstrous Adventures 2 have tried to insert as much stuff as possible. In addition to the standard levels of the single player campaign, which is completed within six hours, there are in fact missions that reflect the historical two-dimensional approach of the series and which act as a tutorial to learn the functions of each new power. Within the scenarios, then, there is a continuous appearance of mobile and/or rotating platforms, panels that open and close when we jump, speed-based impromptu challenges and then ghosts, lots of ghosts to eat but paying attention to their peculiarities, because often they will throw something at us, spin like tornadoes or disappear into the ground only to reappear behind us. A good variety, a pity that something more elaborate was not thought of for the mini bosses, which can instead be liquidated in a few moments, see for example the fire-breathing demons or the sharks. The desire to push on content at a certain point even turns out to be harmful, in this case during some variations on the theme. In fact, there are shooter-style sections, also in the third persona, really bad to play, while the bosses have on the one hand the advantage of proposing different situations each time, on the other hand the defect of betting everything on solutions similar to quick time events that end up trivializing the action. As already mentioned, the big problems that afflicted the management of the view in the first episode have been solved, resorting to an automatic positioning system that works quite well, a corrective that already in itself gives an edge to the game. However, the limits of a too anonymous design for the characters and the stages remain, with the onset of serious and prolonged drops in the frame rate during some not too excited moments, to highlight an optimization work carried out without the necessary attention, perhaps due to tight deadlines before publication. Wanting to imitate Super Mario Galaxy at all costs, Pac-Man and the Monstrous Adventures 2 needed a much more significant and inspired artistic figure, which the guys from Monkey Bar Games evidently don't have in their own right.", "date": "2014-10-30", "grade": "6.9"}
