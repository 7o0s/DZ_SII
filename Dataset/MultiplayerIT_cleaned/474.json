I said FOR the park!~; Bruce Willis - Die Hard 3 (too bad I didn't have a taxi available at the moment...) Central Grand Station (where the final scene of ~The Untouchables~ is set) [/C] Troubled cops From the suspended and reinstated violent cop of True Crime SoLA to a multiple murder criminal, son of the city boss, who becomes a cop to redeem himself, but never forgets his roots. From good to better... This time we play Marcus Reed, whose father, Isaiah The King Reed, was the city's top crime lord. One day a ragtag gang tried to get Marcus and his father out of the picture, attempting to kill them and take over the empire. The only problem is that both survived and Marcus sought immediate revenge. The first mission of the game in fact consists in making a clean sweep (let's face it, a real slaughterhouse) of their lair. Thanks to a detective friend of the family, Terence ~Terry~ Higgins, Marcus was cleared of the implications of the massacre and brought back to the right path, and, five years later, joined the police force, while The King ended up behind the bars. Shortly after we witness Terry's sudden and suspicious death in an explosion, and Marcus decides to find out who is responsible for his second father's death and bring him to justice. The philosophy of the game is always the same: complete the tasks that are assigned to us to continue with the story. However, the way the story is developed changes a lot. No more crossroads plot as in the past episode, but four distinct and independent cases to be solved in the order we want to get the clues that will lead us to the last mission. No crossroads, therefore, to give strength to the plot, and consequently no multiple endings, but only an aseptic and not at all gratifying ~good cop / bad cop~. Good cop, bad cop True Crime is fundamentally about this dualism. The distinction between the two endings that we will be able to witness will in fact depend entirely on the attitude that we will have held during the entire game, represented trivially by the ~Good Cop / Bad Cop~ points that we will receive for each of our actions. By busting crimes, arresting criminals, and turning over evidence, we'll be considered good cops, while killing innocent civilians, extorting money, and reselling evidence, we'll soon become bad cops. A similar points system represents the progression of our police career, therefore the rank, the equipment we will have available and our paycheck. Exactly, the paycheck, because everything in this game is bought as in real life, with good old money. Incredibly, however, the first shop we will come across is the police station, and where we will be able to get all the weapons and vehicles we need. However, not only money will have its importance, but also our own rank, in fact only by making a career will we be able to unlock, and therefore have the possibility to buy, not only ever better equipment, but also special shooting and driving skills. A real pity that the upgrades also ended up on the shop counter, considering how much more fun it was to have to sweat in training to acquire them, and how useful it was also for getting used to the new commands, while in this way we will have to experience everything directly in the field. [C] Disabling Called Shot: Good Cop When evidence of a crime is found we can arrest the suspect (and if we don't find it we can always place it ourselves...) Lethal Headshot: Bad Cop [/C] Too many things to do, too little time to do them There are two ways to make a game like True Crime long lasting: equip it with a long and varied storyline, or fill it with secondary tasks unrelated to the main story. The first is the case of the last episode, the second of this one (then choose which one you prefer). In general, the various assignments can be traced back to three main categories: driving, shooting, melee. Of the three, driving is undoubtedly the most fulfilling part. It takes a while to get used to it, and you have to deal with the keyboard controls (so it's all or nothing), but as soon as you learn how to adjust the handbrake when cornering, the music changes immediately. There are many advanced maneuvers that should improve performance (radical turns, spin, driving on two wheels...), but among all of them the only really useful one is the nitro boost which suddenly increases acceleration. In reality, everything else is of very little use, indeed sometimes it is even uncomfortable (better a U-turn with the simple handbrake, which is a 180 that keeps all the inertia, catapulting us into reverse at full speed), and in any case one of the greatest amusements is undoubtedly letting the cars slide with less grip on the four wheels in a controlled drift. The choice of vehicles is extremely varied, and includes about thirty cars (with a wide choice of models from the last forty years), some motorbikes (very not recommended, they explode on first impact), and a series of heavy vehicles such as buses, concrete mixers, armored cars... The difference between the various vehicles is not only noticeable in the acceleration, speed, and resistance to damage, but also and above all in the control one has during the most reckless manoeuvres. A sports car will hold the road well, drifting little, unlike a sedan, or an older model, while it will not be possible to tail with heavier vehicles at all. Among the various tasks related to driving there are the very common races against time, in which we have to reach a certain place in a limited time, the pursuits in which we will have to stop a vehicle and the tailings, during which we will have to be careful not to lose the target , but also not to let us notice. Among the extra assignments then, we need to vanquish a clandestine racing circuit, and, needless to say, to be able to get to the organizer, we will have to try our hand at a large number of illegal races. Too many things to do, too little time to do them The shootings have remained almost unchanged, apart from one detail, which however is so important as to completely upset its economy: the automatic viewfinder. Just press the right mouse button, and our Marcus will automatically aim at the closest target. Too bad that in this way all the difficulty of the game is lost, given that a couple of clicks are enough to solve even the most dangerous situations in an instant, to the point that you only really find yourself in difficulty the first few times you face multiple opponents equipped with a machine gun. The number of weapons available has been significantly increased (including rocket launchers and sniper rifles), and the indispensable inventory has been added which allows you to carry some weapons of your choice in addition to the service pistol, albeit with a limited number of ammunition . On the other hand, however, all the upgrades present in the last episode have been removed. Too many things to do, too little time to do them The whole melee system has undergone a great revolution, very simplified in the commands, but also not at all realistic, thanks to the inclusion of five different styles (plus two that involve the use of weapons), each with its own strengths and weaknesses , which can be learned in the dojos scattered around the city at prices that are all too affordable. Four commands allow you to do everything: light attack, heavy attack, parry, grab. Speed and power obviously depend on the style used. Every now and then an opponent is stunned, and at that moment a bar appears that we can fill by quickly pressing light attack and heavy attack: the more the bar is full, the more devastating the resulting special attack will be (up to the ShoRyuKen of sfreetfighteriana memory). The idea itself isn't a bad one, but once you learn a few tricks it becomes nearly impossible to lose. Too many things to do, too little time to do them The really good news, however, is the total removal of the stealth sections that were the real scourge of the previous episode. To tell the truth, they haven't been completely removed, but they use the same controls as normal movement, so those who can't handle them can simply handle situations like simple assaults and move forward, weapon in hand. The extra assignments deserve a separate section, which we will be able to complete during the ~Free Time Missions~, and which occupy a huge portion of the game. We go from simple street crimes (car thefts, brawls, kidnappings, shootings...) to the main novelty: missions inside buildings. You reach the place indicated on the map, find the door, press ~E~ and enter a smaller area, even if all too often recycled, in which the crime is taking place. So we can find ourselves dealing with a new range of situations that were previously closed to us: bomb attacks, rock bands trashing hotel rooms, family quarrels, robberies and hostage situations of all kinds. Keeping the city's crime at bay is an important duty, not only because of the points it earns, but also because ~cleaning up~ the districts is one of the main tasks we have to accomplish, and it is necessary for 100% completion of the game. Each individual district is indicated with a color indicating the level of crime. Once made verde, the area is cleaned up and we can ignore subsequent alarms, which instead, in an uncleaned district would lead to an increase in crime. Unfortunately, however, some areas seem to have defects in the spawning function of street crimes, which occur very rarely, and are therefore alternated with very mangy round-ups (real solo assaults on buildings defended by a dozen people armed to the teeth) in one of the four established spots in the city. Of course, since there are only four roundup locations, the districts they're in are among the first to be cleared, and add to that the fact that it takes over 10 minutes to wait for missions within to be canceled, in order to tick off a more useful one, you will get an idea of how much ~cleaning up~ certain districts quickly becomes a very long and frustrating undertaking. Too many things to do, too little time to do them In addition to street crimes, we will also be able to get involved in clandestine races and participate in fights in illegal arenas to arrest their promoters, or carry out dirty assignments for the three main informants of Manhattan (including, who knows why, there is also dad ~The King~). These informants have an important role, as they serve as a backup mission in case of failure of a primary mission and refusal to repeat it. In any case, however, the tasks of the informants must still be completed if you want to complete the now frustrating 100% of the game. The feeling that is not there  A game made to be won The various aspects of True Crime NYC look very promising, now let's see if the missions related to the main cases, which form the very heart of the game, are equally promising. The impression is that we have stubbornly tried to build strange and atypical situations, in the hope of thus captivating the player. Well... mission failed... The scenarios are improbable, in some cases absurd, and too often repetitive ad nauseam. Just to make you understand, more complex missions than the main cases are all along the same lines: climb the various floors of huge buildings, filled with more opponents than an anthill, to chase the boss on duty who is always a couple of steps ahead of us, until you meet him and press him well. In the first moments they are actually interesting, more than anything else for the curiosity of understanding what improbable situation we have been thrust into (often and willingly due to the incredible ability that our Marcus Reed has to systematically let himself be discovered, and consequently stunned, during the cutscenes). But after the second, maximum third, repetition of the exact same scene, one hopes only not to make mistakes and get rid of the annoyance as soon as possible. [C] Maximum variety: climbing all these absolutely identical floors... But does it seem probable to you that such a cavern is under Manhattan (which is an island) and moreover, under Manhattan? under the lair of a boss? We just needed the brawl with the insane in the asylum... and then what? [/C] Sure, you come across all kinds of situations, and there's something for all tastes, but you have too much the feeling of an artifact that really makes many missions implausible at all (shooting from the roof of a runaway limousine with a gatling in perfect 80's arcade style?!?). Another serious defect found, but for some it could also be an advantage (you see), is the feeling of excessive ease that one gets when playing True Crime NYC. It seems to be done with the sole purpose of not creating difficulties for the players, instead of being a challenge. At first it seems just a sensation, but then a series of details prove it. Meanwhile, the infinite number of repetitions and ~lives~ that the protagonist has, with the obvious ~continuation by inertia~ effect, furthermore we notice how in all (and I mean all) the chase situations (there aren't just those in cars ), the target always stops and waits for us whenever we get into trouble. A couple of practical examples to better understand the thing. During the races on the clandestine circuit, the other cars will seem to be driven by Michael Schumacher as long as we are in front, but as soon as we find ourselves in trouble, they will begin to slow down and be involved in accidents with disarming frequency, thus allowing us to recover from even the most absurd situations. . The same thing happens in the foot chases of the main missions: instead of making the right ~Enemy lost: retry?~ appear, the criminal on duty stops to look at us. At the end of some of these missions it will be necessary to convince the duty boy to spit out what he knows. You will see a vertical bar on the screen with a colored sector in the centre. With some quick work of ~convincing~ you can modify", "date": "2006-06-06", "grade": null}
