{"name": "Super Leap Day", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-leap-day-recensione-platform-hardcore-apple-arcade.html", "text": "The review of Super Leap Day confirms in a few moments that the formula of the hardcore platform branded Nitrome hasn't changed one iota compared to the release of Leap Day in 2016, but is revived with some important tricks on the occasion of the debut of this new version of the Apple Arcade experience. The differences compared to the beginning are related to the introduction of some interesting variations on the theme, as well as the elimination of the freemium mechanisms and microtransactions which originally strongly characterized the progression, linked to the unlocking of the checkpoints within the levels, and which on the Apple subscription platform they have always been banned. So yes, you can play Super Leap Day without any limitations. Gameplay Super Leap Day, one of the much coveted checkpoints The basic formula, as mentioned, is exactly that of the original Leap Day: under the command of a funny little yellow being, our task in the game is to ~climb~ the shift level (a new one is added every day!) jumping on walls and platforms, avoiding traps and enemies but having to come to terms with a difficult movement system, in which the character continuously moves left and right until he encounters an obstacle. It is precisely this factor that makes it particularly difficult to carry out maneuvers required from time to time, getting the timing right to the hundredth and precision to the millimeter, on pain of a ruinous fall or an unfavorable impact that immediately determines game over. At that point we start again from the last unlocked checkpoint, but even in the presence of this lifeline, the frustration does not fail to make itself felt. Of course, Super Leap Day can also count on other important differences compared to the 2016 debut chapter: not only are the constraints represented by the microtransactions missing, but several unlockable characters have been introduced, each equipped with specific abilities, and a series of alternative stages that also develop horizontally, recalling car races, golf matches and other sports activities. Furthermore, there is now support for Bluetooth controllers, a feature capable of profoundly changing the gameplay and making it more friendly, being able to count on the precision guaranteed by the buttons that simplifies everything and simultaneously smooths out the edges of a hardcore approach that remains preponderant when playing with the touch screen. Structure and technique Super Leap Day, the character bounces off walls and breaks barriers to climb the levels A new level every day remains the motto of the game developed by Nitrome, which therefore does not lack substance and promises to entertain users for a long time, if they wish. Yes, because it is clear that an experience like the one proposed by Super Leap Day is the classic mobile game to be pulled out when necessary, extemporaneously, to try to complete a level as soon as you have a free minute. The system is supported by a technical realization perfectly in line with the assumptions of Super Leap Day, characterized by pleasant and very colorful graphics, characters with a funny design and an undoubted degree of visual variety, able to clearly distinguish the various settings . Less brilliant sound accompaniment, functional and little more.", "date": "2021-08-11", "grade": "7.7"}
