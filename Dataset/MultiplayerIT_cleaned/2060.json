{"name": "Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/smash-court-tennis-pro-tournament.html", "text": "Conquering the ~Grand Slam~ Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament is presented to us in the proven simulation arcade game formula. The exasperated simulation of titles that appeared in the past on PC is far away, as is the pure arcade of Midas' Center Court, which appeared on PlayStation 2 a few months ago. The result is instead very similar to what was seen not in Tennis 2k2 but more in the first Virtua Tennis, a game capable of combining great visual realism with the simplicity and immediacy of arcade titles. As in Sega's game, the protagonists are still some of the best-known racket champions together with the surfaces, the tournaments that have made a sport that has already well over one hundred years of life great. The cast boasts four female and 4 male stars. Among the women are Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and the ~image girl~ (who still considers her a tennis player?) Anna Kournikova. Among the men we find three former number one in the world rankings, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Yevgeny Kafelnikov and the Australian Patrick Rafter, one of the last interpreters of the ~serve & volley~ game. Of note is the impossibility of creating a user-customized tennis player from scratch, a not indifferent lack. All these champions will compete on the central courts of the most prestigious tournaments on the planet, the legendary four rounds of the ~grand Slam~: Australian Open, French Open (here called World Open for licensing reasons), Wimbledon and US Open. Around the world... The game modes available are Arcade, World Tour, Exhibition and Time Trials. In the arcade mode we will have to participate in four matches in sequence, each on a different surface, trying to win them all to unlock extra options to activate in the game. The World Tour represents the richest section of the game, allowing us to take part in all four Grand Slam tournaments starting from the first round (16th finals). During the matches we will have the opportunity to participate in a challenge within the challenge, as in addition to winning we will be required to achieve some objectives such as finishing the match with at least five forehand volleys, or winning with four drop shots (short balls). By successfully completing matches, tournaments and individual challenges, other extras will be unlocked including new uniforms, game tips, visuals and music. With Exhibition we will instead have to cross rackets with players controlled by the computer in single or double matches, or challenge up to three friends in endless and exciting matches. Just the multiplayer mode proves to be one of the most interesting so much so that I have rarely had fun in such an extent with friends. Finally, we find the time challenge which, as the title itself says, consists of games to be faced and won in the shortest possible time. Miiiii.... I'm never wrong! As in any sports game, a very important role is played by the control system which must be simple and have an immediate response. In Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament, player movement control takes place with the usual left analog stick while the keys used for shots are only three. With the Circle you can hit in topspin, with the square in backspin while with the triangle it is possible to hit lobs/court balls. Combining the pressure of the key with the movement of the analog stick in the right way you can obtain different results and thus make a lob instead of a drop shot or a tight cross instead of a long shot. The same goes for the volleys, performed very well even if you may have some problems with the stop volleys, not at all simple to perform, as in reality ... Thanks also to the use of the inevitable motion capture, all shots they have been made in the image and likeness of the original shots of the tennis players. The result is more than appreciable not only visually but also from the point of view of playability which gives us exchanges from the baseline of great competition alternating with lightning descents to the net. All very realistic and rewarding! Tennis fans will have no trouble recognizing the shots of real champions and this only adds quality to a game that effectively manages to recreate many of the emotions and highlights of tennis on the screen. However, there are defects and it is precisely these that preclude Smash Cout Tennis Pro Tournament from being able to fully rival Virtua Tennis. To begin with, it is almost immediately striking the infallibility of the players who never run into itno in measurement errors. In dozens of games I have never seen a shot go over the baseline or into the corridor and only a couple of times at the net, mostly in an attempt to hit a volley. Another ~partial~ defect is the lack of variety of shots available, above all if once again a comparison is made with Virtua Tennis, or rather with the sequel Tennis 2k2. In the long run the game could become repetitive and you will get tired after you have managed to win all the competitions. The last neo, if you can call it that, is that of the difficulty, perhaps too high, of the matches played at the higher levels. Like two drops of water, or almost... Unfortunately, the most disappointing notes come to us from the technical realization. After having witnessed the excellent work done with Tekken 4 (Japanese version) and MotoGP, we expected the usual design lesson from the Namco graphics and instead, surprisingly, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament turns out to be in all respects more beautiful to to play than to see. The graphic rendering is undoubtedly lower than that of the first Virtua Tennis on Dreamcast which, I remind you, has been available for some years now. In the light of the now proven technical capabilities of the PlayStation 2, something more could certainly have been expected, in particular from the player models, characterized by a modest number of polygons and the creation of their faces, not at all or almost resembling their real counterparts. In the same way, the playgrounds are not convincing, so much so that the appearance of Wimbledon grass and red clay is very close to that of a carpet. On the other hand, the animations are excellent, reconstructed with great care and perfectly similar, if not exactly the same, to the movements of the original tennis players. The sound, on the other hand, does its part without particular inconveniences thanks to adequate sound effects and discreet music, which I strongly advise you to deactivate during the games. Game, Set, Match Namco! Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament is, on balance, a good game and certainly the best video game transposition of tennis on PlayStation 2. The large number of challenges available and the excellent overall playability are certainly the main advantages of a game that succeeds in its main intent is to entertain. Virtua Tennis still remains more than a step above but this is due more to the merits of the Sega game than to the demerits of the Namco title which, at least until the release of Tennis 2k2 for PlayStation 2, will probably remain the best exponent of the genre. I therefore recommend the purchase to all tennis enthusiasts and to anyone who wants to enjoy a fun sports title in single and, above all, in multiplayer. Game, Set, Match Namco! Pros: Immediate and fun Good simulation thickness Sampras, Agassi, Hingis, Kournikova... Very realistic animations Very addictive multiplayer mode Cons: Subdued graphics Small number of tennis players available Tennis 2k2 is at least two steps above... Namco takes the field In the darkest period that can be remembered for Italian tennis and beyond, a large group of pretenders to the title of best tennis simulation appears on consoles. While awaiting the highly anticipated conversion of Tennis 2k2 for PlayStation 2, I was delighted to receive the arrival of Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament to the editorial staff, yet another attempt to overwhelm the overwhelming power of Sega's sports game. This time however, it is none other than Namco who tries and, as you all know, its productions, from Tekken to Soul Calibur, from Ridge Racer to MotoGP (not to go too far back over the years) have always left an indelible mark on the history of video games . It is therefore reasonable to expect something good from this game which, however, I'll tell you right away, fails to match the global quality of the illustrious colleague while proving to be a very enjoyable title. After all, it is no small thing that the Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament has managed in the last few days to excite me considerably more than the mediocre 2002 edition of the Wimbledon tournament...", "date": "2002-07-11", "grade": null}
