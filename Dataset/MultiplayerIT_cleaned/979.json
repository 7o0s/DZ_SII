{"name": "The Urbz: Sims in the city", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-urbz-sims-in-the-city_a.html", "text": "The urbz is in 'da house Also this chapter of the infinite saga of the Sims is based on the human-managerial system that has made the fortune of the series in recent years. The protagonists of the game will be you, in all the meanings that this sentence could have, as soon as you start a new game you will be asked for a series of information to best characterize your virtual counterpart, clothing, hair, skin color, zodiac sign, birthday, this and much more to make the relationship between your real self and the digital miniature one more engaging. After the very first configuration phase of the game you will find yourself catapulted onto the roof of a building to carry out what will be explained to you as your temporary job: the window cleaner. If you have never played The Sims, given the abrupt start, the common feeling may be that of having been shot with a cannon in an inhospitable world where people speak an incomprehensible language and the menu interface is far too vast to be assimilated. The inexperienced player will need a couple of hours to understand the functioning of the life mechanics of an urbz, the experienced player will instead recognize parameters and energy bars with a clear meaning. The game simulates in all respects the life of an ~ordinary~ human being, the time factor marks the rhythm of the days that alternate between day and night, with the passage of time our virtual counterpart will have more and more urgent needs from which free himself to be able to carry on with his work. To make it simple, the upper screen of the ds will contain a series of physiological parameters (watching TV, sleeping, sitting, going to the bathroom, washing, eating,) which will pass from a maximum to a minimum value over time resulting in loud complaints from the protagonist. At this point, depending on the deficient factor, it will be necessary to go in search of a bathroom, a bed or a TV to ~recharge~ the energy bar and continue in the game. A good 50% of the game is set to your own biorhythms, when an urbz gets into a low level farmer they will in fact refuse to do anything else (this will bring your real frustration bar to critical levels on more than one occasion). In the remaining 50% you will have the opportunity to carry out certain sub-quests in order to progress during the adventure, unlock locations and new jobs that will allow you to pay the rent of the house, furnish it and increase the level of comfort by installing boilers and burglar alarm systems. The jobs in the game are nothing more than ten mini-games that allow you to make sure money at pre-established times of the day without having to be away from your home for a long time (a washing of windows does not take more than three hours, when you decide to shoot hoops we won't steal more than two hours of our precious time) unlike the very first chapter of the sims where, accepting a job, you were away from home for the entire working time; more than jobs, therefore we can no longer consider them as fun, profitable entertainment to play with the stylus. However, as in any society, to do a certain job (to unlock it, videogame speaking) it will be necessary to take theoretical courses at the university of the city and thus increase one's level of knowledge. Another element that has always characterized the Sims is represented by the dialogues between characters, in this portable version we note with a pinch of displeasure that to turn the sympathy of an npc in our favor, we just need to remember his favorite topics and tediously continue to propose them again as soon as we get the chance and until we reach our goals. Miniworlds The graphic setting of The Urbz is solid and tested already from the previous gba version, animations, colors, characterization of the characters and settings, graphics engine and mini-games, everything seems tailor-made for this mini-world created by the Griptonite programmers, even if the he metropolitan air that the game would like to convey is slightly lower than the home console versions much more full of street culture with murals along the walls of the city. Even the sound sector defends itself well with a whole series of sounds aimed at the character and very ~urban~ musical themes that accompany our steps through miniopolis. one is left with a bitter taste in the mouth from the almost absolute lack of use of the touch screen Up to here the merits of the game and if the review ended here we could undoubtedly speak of a good product, in reality the biggest deficiency of the game is that it does not exploit the potential offered by the new laptop in any wayby nintendo. The stylus is used exclusively for the mini-games (and not even for all of them), otherwise the analog cross is always used both to move through the city and to navigate the menus. The only real difference from the previous gba version is, thanks to the double screen of the DS, the simultaneous presence of the game screen and the game menus which allows a much more overview of what we are doing. A missed opportunity therefore by Electronic Arts to exploit the peculiarities of the DS by producing a game that adds little or nothing to the one released recently on game boy advance. The sims make their debut on the DS and if on the one hand one can only be satisfied by the complexity and care of the product, on the other one is left with a bitter taste in the mouth by the almost absolute lack of use of the touch screen. The dual screen helps in viewing the game area and menu interface at the same time for a better gaming experience. For the rest, that slight layer of frustration always prevails due to the continuous and endless requests of your digital alter-ego regarding his primary needs. If you are a fan of the series and you haven't bought the gba version, you will only like it, if you expect a product worthy of the revolution brought about by the DS, lower your rating by one point. Pros: Graphically cared for Various and fun sub-quests Very customizable Cons: Almost absolute lack of use of the touch screen at times the environment is less urban than one professes The fast physiological rhythms of the character become frustrating Once upon a time there was a family, it was part of the Sims population and had built its home and its descendants where once there was only earth and brushwood. The furniture arrived, the swimming pool in the garden and the street lamps on the driveway, parties and meetings were organized with the neighbors in the desperate search for their soul mate, then it was the turn of the children and they grew up until they reached university. Now the Sims no longer live in the suburbs of the world, they have integrated into big cities and are grappling with the usual small problems of everyday life.
