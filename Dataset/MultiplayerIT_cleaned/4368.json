Over the past few months we have already given you a smattering of what this massive update would mean for Rainbow Six Siege and the importance this support has represented for the title. Now that Lion and Finka are ready to be used during matches and that the Outbreak mode is available to everyone, the time has come to sum up and evaluate how much value has been added to the production. Before going into specifics, however, we would like to observe how Ubisoft is trying to change, in an absolutely positive way, the approach to DLC and extra content in the universe of shooters. Call of Duty and Activision have had the good times and the bad times to date by directing the public to think that perhaps fifteen euros for four maps and some new skins could be somehow justifiable. Instead, the French giant thinks and thanks the proponents of the success of Rainbow Six: Siege, proposing for the past year now, all the contents for free and making it clear out there that a relationship of mutual trust can be built between developers and between who actively enjoys the game. In short, if you don't want to spend a lira, you can give your contribution by filling up the servers and keeping the community alive, unlocking the operators with the credits obtained after each game, or directly finance the development by buying the season pass and obtaining all the contents with a week of advance. Two formulas that embrace the market 100%, satisfying every type of player with an incredible return on image. In short, we have a new parameter to judge and define support for the other multiplayer FPS too, which now have to deal with Ubisoft and its idea of DLC. If all this were still not enough, know that from now on, and even retroactively, all gadgets and weapon attachments will be available immediately, without the further need to buy them, and players who buy Rainbow Six Siege will they will also find all twenty initial operators in their hands, in order to be able to immediately enter the meta without having to kill hours of play to have a fairly large roster. All choices that alone would be enough to make us promote Chimera without hesitation. Leon at Wembley! Usually we focus on the content when an update of this type arrives, but Operation Chimera brings some really important balances in the Operators, so much so that we risk revolutionizing the meta just with these measures. Ela was clearly a much too useful operator, with very strong gadgets and equally dangerous weapons. The damage has therefore been reduced, the recoil increased and instead of the impact grenades there is now a shield for the hands. The changes to Kapkan are also interesting and the removal of the barbed wire, often little used since you had to run from side to side to place mines, should give him more flexibility. The last operator to be heavily reworked is the excellent Blitz, who goes from a 1 speed and 3 armor operator to a balanced 2-2: a monster now closing the gap after blinding opponents. In the matches we've seen he's always been chosen in attack, either for the novelty or because now he's really very effective in one-on-one situations. There are also changes to the reload animations - which can now be stopped - and to the usual map rotation. If, on the other hand, you want to experience something new, Finka and Lion are right for you and are part of a new Ubisoft vision for operators with global capabilities who can therefore impact the game regardless of their positioning. The idea came with Dokkaebi and now it's being expanded even more dangerously. Finka is in fact a kind of DOC dedicated to the assault: her special ability allows her to give an overshield to her companions of twenty hit points and to heal even the frail companions, without the need to see them, of course. The buff also improves speed, shortens cooldowns, and enhances resistance to stuns. The biggest problem we've seen during matches is that in order to work well, the boost must be launched by coordinating with your teammates, a really difficult solution to achieve when playing solo relying on matchmaking. Therefore, for normal users, Finka will probably remain on the margins of choices, relegating the operator to organized groups only, something we don't think will happen with Lion. Lion is a monster. Two of armor and two of speed lor make an attacker fearsome and the possibility of highlighting enemies by outlining their silhouette in the event of movement always makes him very dangerous, both before a breakthrough and even just to annoy the defenders and force them to remain motionless. Unlike Finka, Lion has a timer beautifully highlighted thanks to the integrated interface, freeing players from tedious organization or communication. Its usefulness is undeniable and if used intelligently it can be truly devastating. The ability can be used offensively but also defensively when protecting the defuser kit, preventing opponents from breaking in, otherwise they will receive a couple of bullets in the chest through the walls. A welcome gift based on aliens And then, in addition to all these changes, Outbreak also arrives, a limited-time mode that overturns the concept of Rainbow Six: Siege and arrives in thunder offering something really different. Different for the title, obviously, and not for the genre since Left 4 Dead and also COD's Extinction mode had already shown something very similar. It is a tribute from the development team to the players and a gift from the studio to their developers, giving them something new and challenging to work on. Outbreak must therefore be taken for what it is: an extra mode lasting a handful of weeks made and designed with the sole purpose of entertaining. It's part of that vision we told you about at the beginning, with Ubisoft Montreal intent on giving away content to keep its players on the servers. In this case you can throw yourself into the fray head-on with two friends, or two other random players, in three different locations and try to eradicate the alien menace. Ubisoft has worked little, however, on the design of the enemies, which turn out to be uninspired and mere clones of creatures seen in other titles. There is the classic beast that charges head down and needs to be hit in a weak spot on the back, anonymous very ignorant corpses that will launch an attack, other explosive beasts capable of breaching reinforced walls and hags capable of launching power-ups and shots from a distance, with animations very similar to those seen in Destiny. Everything is accepted aware that it is a temporary and extra content, even if with a little more effort it could have become a mode to be desired at all costs. Even the maps and tasks don't offer anything really innovative, while remaining pleasant to play for a handful of attempts. In short, the mode lacks depth and although there has been an attempt to give the operators present a new look by partially modifying their skills, you will hardly want to continue playing it once it is completed and any skins and rewards have been unlocked. A good distraction, which cannot and does not want to aspire to be anything else.", "date": "2018-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
