{"name": "Avventurieri a vita", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/122807-spelunky-avventurieri-a-vita.html", "text": "After its debut on PC in 2008 and the recent remake, released a year ago on Xbox 360 and last month on Steam, Spelunky finally arrives on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, bringing one of the most refined and at the same time most infamous in recent years. Derek Yu and Andy Hull's mix of platformer and roguelike is severe and doesn't make discounts: the ease with which one dies was the cause of nervous breakdowns and anger, but the game design is polished so well that the fault is always and only of the player. Player who is aware of his mistakes, and for this reason continues to play undaunted. The games are short, there are many secrets to discover, and the levels are always different with each adventure: after several hours and a disproportionate amount of deaths, we can say without a doubt that Vita is the definitive platform for the Mossmouth title. With its hit-and-run design, Spelunky feels like it was born to be played on the Vita PSVita trophies The Spelunky Trophies on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 take up exactly the objectives already offered by the PC and Xbox 360 versions. Many will be unlocked simply by accessing the various settings, while others are more interesting, perhaps challenging you to complete the game without using shortcuts, without collecting treasures or in an 8-minute time limit. A pocket mine We enter for the umpteenth time the mysterious mine that somewhere hides the City of Gold. The aim is to pass each level without leaving the pens, using the whip to eliminate enemies, bombs to create shortcuts in the walls and ropes to climb too high points. Every level, every enemy and every trap is procedurally generated, thus managing to create completely new challenges even for those who have already devoured Spelunky on PC or Xbox 360. The way in which new levels are formed is very intelligent, and although many elements are randomly placed, they still tend to follow a sort of pattern decided by the developers: there is always a way to overcome a trap, and it is not possible to get stuck because there will always be a path that does not require the use of objects. For those who have never played Spelunky, the first few hours hide one surprise after another, but what will keep them hooked the most is the sense of progression of the adventure, which is there but cannot be seen. From the roguelike tradition, Mossmouth's platformer inherits the severity of permadeath: when you die you start over and say goodbye to all the money, all the objects and all the power-ups collected up to that moment. In Spelunky there is no role-playing component, the protagonist does not level up and is not upgraded. It is the player who, game after game, improves himself and learns new lessons that allow him to take a few more steps towards the end of the adventure. Through a learning process, the player discovers that passing in front of a trap he is pierced by an arrow; he discovers that when he lifts a golden idol he is chased by a rolling boulder, or he discovers that shopkeepers do not look kindly on anyone who tries to steal his goods. Soon you find yourself paying much more attention when playing, but above all you deal with certain situations in a very different way than in the first games. Before being able to see all the secret worlds, all the power-ups and all the monsters it will take several hours and a lot of patience, while the death counter rises from ten to a hundred, then from a hundred to a thousand. In terms of content, the PlayStation Vita version adds nothing new compared to other platforms, but the mere possibility of having the game with you at any time and in any place is a decisive factor: Spelunky is designed for games lasting few minutes, and the idea of always having different levels, completely unrelated to each other and without a plot to act as glue, makes it a perfect portable game. Before you can start playing, in the versions for PC and home consoles it is necessary to start the platform, then the game, navigate the menus and wait for the initial sequence to end: a procedure that is too long if you only have a few minutes of leisure available. On PlayStation Vita instead it is a matter of a moment. However, portability is not the only factor that makes us prefer the version for the small Sony console. One of the main problems in the cooperative mode of Spelunky on Xbox 360 and Steam is the management of the camera, since it only follows the main player and forces the others to stay close to him in order not to go off the screen. By playing together on PlayStation Vita, or by linking PlayStation Vita to PlayStation 3, each friend can follow their own character on their ownuo screen, which on the one hand makes playing in company much more comfortable and less frustrating, and on the other makes new strategies and new approaches possible: now, for example, the various players can split up to explore every corner of the level to collect all hidden treasures, or they can activate traps without forcing others to stay dangerously close. What is unfortunately missing is the support for the daily challenges of the Steam edition, an excellent option that gives users a single chance every 24 hours to complete certain objectives; Derek Yu has said that sooner or later these challenges could also be introduced on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, but nothing is confirmed at the moment. This is accompanied by some bugs related to online rankings and frame drops in particular scenarios, although BlitWorks, the group that dealt with the porting, seems to be already working on an imminent update.", "date": "2013-09-03", "grade": "9.0"}
