{"name": "Iron Man - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iron-man-recensione.html", "text": "Plot changes? Those who have seen the film must bear in mind that the story used for this tie-in is much more ~cartoony~ than ~cinematic~, in the sense that Tony Stark's character appears as an unblemished hero, moved by a sort of ~ sacred fire of justice~: a very different characterization from the (excellent) one seen in the cinema and much more insipid even than the worst comic Iron Man. But above all, the terrorist organization of the ~Ten Rings~ has been sidelined in favor of historical paper nemeses of the iron man: the Maggia, the A.I.M., Whiplash, the Controller (no, not the one who asks for the ticket on the bus...), Madame Masque, Titanium Man and so on. The game Released almost simultaneously worldwide, ~Iron Man~ has already exceeded one hundred million dollars in receipts, and there are talks of a sequel for 2010. An extraordinary result for Marvel Studios, in their baptism of fire, and it is clear that a tie-in of a certain quality was expected. The development of the game, handled by SEGA, was entrusted to the Secret Level team for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, while the A2M team took care of all the other versions. In any case, we are faced with a series of missions to be completed in sequence, which can then be replayed in a sort of ~time attack~ to unlock the ~classic~ Iron Man armor, the ones seen in the comic. At the end of each one we will be credited with a sum of money (which varies according to our precision and our speed) which we will be able to use to enhance the various parts of the armor, modifying its behavior and offensive capabilities substantially. In this case, we will be able to change the type of propulsion to favor agility in flight rather than speed, use powerful repulsor beams but with a slow rate of fire or fast but with a lower penetration capacity, equip different secondary weapons (grenades or homing missiles of various types) and modify the shielding to withstand different types of attack. A setup that we usually do in video games where you fly a fighter plane, right? Well, controlling Iron Man's armor is a pretty close experience. Let's see why... The game The approach to the fights is very similar to what can be found in an episode of Ace Combat. To the command posts! A bit like what happens in the film, the first stage that we will face in the ~shoes~ of Iron Man has an introductory value: we go around the mountains on foot (caves, in the case of the Wii version), becoming familiar with the flamethrower and the homing missiles, as well as with the very bad close attack (absurdly ~slippery~). Already from the second stage things change radically, since you start flying and you realize that there is a huge difference between being on the ground or in the air: the developers have paid much greater attention to realizing the flight dynamics , which are precisely managed as if you were controlling an airplane, compared to the ~on foot~ action, which is really mediocre. To get off the ground you have to act on the left trigger of the joypad, pressing it more or less depending on the height we want to reach and moving with the left stick, while to fly in one direction you have to hold down the LB key and act on the stick for turns. The A button acts as a ~booster~ in both cases: while we are off the ground it is used to move quickly in one direction, perhaps to avoid missiles, while holding it down during flight activates the thrusters to the maximum, making us reach extraordinary speed. The armor is equipped with an energy routing system that allows us to favor life support from time to time (Iron Man recovers more quickly from the blows suffered), weapons (which become more effective), melee attacks or thrusters (which acquire an otherwise impossible autonomy). At the same time, the approach to combat is very similar to what can be found in an episode of Ace Combat, with the difference that we can attack while hovering instead of moving: the sensors detect and automatically lock on to targets once we move the crosshair in their vicinity, and in the same way the secondary weapon is directed towards one or more targets. Technical realization Similar to what happens with the game structure, the technical realization of Iron Man is made up of ups and downs. The armor is identical to that seen in the film, with a number of effects and reflections that make it really nice to see (too bad the shot is too far away to fully appreciate it), and the animation of the character is generally of good quality.ty. The flight phases are rendered very well, especially when speed is gained, and the fact that everything moves at sixty fps is a great help... even if some slowdowns betray a not too thorough optimization phase. The enemies we'll face are almost always of the ~mechanical~ type: helicopters, tanks of various kinds, missile launchers, energy cannons, planes... there's a great variety and the design is good. As for the locations, unfortunately they represent the lowest point of the technical realization: they are too, too poor and stingy towards any type of interaction. This may be fine when fighting in the desert, but seeing urban scenarios with skyscrapers and anything else that don't scratch under our attacks, while the streets are perfectly clear, is bleak. Also in terms of gameplay, because destructible settings could have contributed significantly to the final quality of the product. The sound sector boasts a good quality Italian dubbing, but with different voices compared to the film, while music and effects are average. Seeing urban scenarios with skyscrapers and anything else that don't get scratched under our attacks is bleak. Comment It's really a shame to see how many good ideas there are in this Iron Man tie-in, good ideas that have been hastily and superficially put into practice. The game finds its ideal dimension in the flight phases, rendered very well, yet the first stage must be faced on foot. The difficulty is deadly, we find ourselves in extremely chaotic situations in which we are targeted from all directions and we can't even figure out who or what is shooting at us. It really takes a lot of passion and a lot of perseverance to overcome certain obstacles and enjoy the good things the game offers (for example the stage in which you have to destroy a gigantic flying fortress), trying again at every game over and planning strategies so as not to end up trapped in the usual bullet storm. Iron Man can grab enemy missiles and send them back to the sender, but doing so is far from simple. He can activate an obfuscation device that's supposed to make him invisible to radar, but that doesn't quite work as it should. In short, there are things that are decidedly wrong with the game mechanics, alongside elements that instead deserve more (the upgrading of the various parts of the armor, the energy routing system, the possibility of unlocking almost all the armor seen in the comic...). It is a half-successful product, in short, to be taken into consideration only if you are a huge fan of the Marvel character. Pros Flying in Iron Man's armor is an experience to try Excellent upgrade and resource management system Some really exciting moments Cons Locations often poor and almost not at all interactable Terrible close combat Very difficult and has few modes Xbox 360 - Goals Iron Man offers 75 points for completing the story mode (this is multiplied by the three difficulty levels available), as well as a long series of 25 and 15-point objectives. Among the former, those in which you have to complete missions within a time limit or without taking damage stand out, while the latter generally concern single actions (for example ~grab the enemy using the Hulk Buster armor~, or ~defeat the opponent with the 'Extremis armor and a knock on the ground'). Finally, it is possible to earn a whopping 70 points by completing all ~Hero~ objectives in all missions. The Wii version There are many differences between the Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Iron Man. First of all, clearly, we are faced with a technical realization that on the Wii is impoverished from all points of view: the polygonal models are much simpler , the superhero's armor itself is reproduced in an approximate way and there are solutions that it would be appropriate to consider the legacy of a generation of video games that (fortunately!) no longer exist, in this case in enemies that magically disappear after being eliminated and explosions horrendous, formed by many small pixelated ~booms~. There is also a substantial change regarding the stages, all modified in some way compared to the Xbox 360 version: some are set indoors rather than outdoors, the dimensions in general are very small and at the same time appear poorer and more bare. The cutscenes are the same for all versions of the game: they absolutely do not shine for the quality, but they boast the same dubbing in Italian. Fun fact: Pepper Potts character on Wii seems to have at least one size of reggiseno plus... As far as the control system is concerned, you have to use Wii-mote and Nunchuck and the commands are organized in a very similar way to what was seen on the Microsoft console, with the Nunchuck's back buttons to regulate the thrust of the thrusters in suspension or actual flight, while again the A button provides the extra boost needed to travel faster or to dodge missiles. Shooting requires aiming the Wii-mote at the screen, to good effect... at least until things get particularly messy, in which case everything becomes truly chaotic. The choice of assigning close attacks to the shaking of the controller does not shine for convenience, but it can be safely ignored given the lack of importance of these maneuvers. The problem, more than anything else, occurs during grabs, which allow us to do interesting things (for example, use an enemy vehicle against others before destroying it) but which on Wii must be activated with a very fast shake of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck instead of repeatedly pressing a single key. Ultimately, Iron Man for Wii appears heavily impoverished from a technical point of view: bearing in mind that it shares a structure not without problems and shortcomings with the Xbox 360 version, there is very little left to save.
