It is a very popular type of product on the App Store and Google Play, considering the success of its first exponents, but which has in fact bastardized a trend that can express great potential precisely in the mobile sector, given the immediacy and precision guaranteed by touch controls. Ankama has therefore seen fit to exploit this lack to create a game that was able to guarantee a minimum of tactical depth, avoiding annoying freemium mechanisms based on timers or action energy, but above all providing us with control of the ground units that we will have the Task to ship into enemy territory to conquer other users' bases. All with a view to a structure that does not see the presence of a real single player campaign, but rather an ~endless~ based asymmetrical multiplayer that confronts us with increasingly more complex challenges, depending on how the bases are organized and the level of experience of those who manage them. Tactile Wars is an immediate, fun, multifaceted and even challenging real-time strategy game Tap here After completing a short tutorial, Tactile Wars immediately reveals its cards, offering us a ~tap and go~ control system and units that automatically attack targets as soon as they are within range. In the context of the missions, this translates into advancing inside the enemy base, eliminating the troops that come towards us and any turrets or armored vehicles, avoiding the traps and occupying the sensitive points of the map for a few seconds, which at that point we will have to defend against a series of waves to obtain the final victory and earn coins and experience points. The touch of originality of the game lies in allowing us to draw on the screen the formation we would like the team to assume, which will consequently arrange itself to intercept the opponents, passing from compact gatherings to lines or circles, more suitable for operating a defense on multiple fronts . However, we are not talking about an ~automatic~ gameplay based solely on numbers, as in the various casual productions we mentioned at the beginning, but about a system that allows you to dynamically manage the team's position and therefore to direct its attacks, but also to avoid mortar and vehicle fire. A substantial difference in terms of thickness and challenge, elements that are then further enhanced by a skill tree that unlocks new defense devices for our base with coins and experience (which will be attacked exactly like the others), but also greater efficiency of offensive units and obtaining extra figures that can make a difference on the battlefield. To clip the wings of Tactile Wars, wanting to nitpick, is the discreet repetitiveness of the missions applied to the endless structure, devoid of a real campaign. Nothing to say instead on the technical sector, which boasts a colorful, fluid and effective, very modern and pleasant style.", "date": "2015-08-29", "grade": "8.0"}
