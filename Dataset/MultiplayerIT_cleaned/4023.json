All those puzzles that ask the player to observe, study the scenario and manipulate objects, unequivocally have an edge in the VR version. Even the smallest and simplest ideas acquire a different flavor, like the very tender and brainy PathCraft. It's actually not the first time we've come across this game: the first work of the developer Daniel Yu, we had tried it during Gamescom 2022 at the Vertigo Games stand and we liked the prototype very much at the time. Does this feeling persist even after the test done close to the release of the game? We tell you our experience in the review of PathCraft, tested on Meta Quest 2. Game mechanics PathCraft's avatars are adorable If you think that PathCraft is a simple puzzle game only because of its colorful and naive aesthetic, you are making a big mistake. In fact, we are talking about a particularly stimulating product, despite the very simple game mechanics. The scenarios are made up of a series of blocks, lots of toy cubes that create a path on which our character can walk. The goal is to lead our little man towards one or more batteries scattered throughout the scenario. The character, which has the features of a boy or girl, dressed in pajamas and cardboard armor, is constantly moving and moves in a straight line, climbing over a cube placed in its path but changing direction if it finds an obstacle insurmountable. The player is then asked to manipulate the level by moving one or more blocks, in order to direct the little man towards the battery. This simple mechanic gives rise to dozens and dozens of different scenarios, where obviously new variables are gradually introduced such as unsafe blocks, bullets and so on. In addition to grabbing and placing blocks, the player can manipulate the scenery by moving it around the level on the X and Y axis, but without being able to rotate the scenery, which we'll talk about later in this review. From an artistic point of view, as mentioned, PathCraft looks delightful. The avatars are really nice and during the adventure it is possible to buy by spending coins to unlock new costumes for our child, such as a dragon or a unicorn. Coins are bought by solving the scenarios in the best possible way. In fact, each level can be completed with a minimum number of moves: the fewer moves we use, the higher the score obtained and consequently the number of coins earned, from a minimum of zero to a maximum of three for the perfect solution. This obviously adds a second layer of difficulty to the puzzles where, in addition to simple resolution, perfectionists and completionists will certainly want to close the scenarios in the best possible way. A desire that we actually had too, but that soon ran out after the first 25 levels given that the game's difficulty curve rises quite quickly... and from wanting to do everything perfectly you soon get to just wanting to switch to next internship. After introducing the basic mechanics with a handful of very very simple levels, the game offers increasingly complex puzzles, slightly balancing the difficulty when a new mechanic is introduced. Technical aspect and criticality In Pathcraft you start from simple scenarios to get to really difficult levels From a technical point of view, the experience is solid, but not perfect. The graphics aren't very clean and the hand gestures, visible on the screen during the act of picking up and placing the blocks in the scenario, are a bit coarse. As you may have understood, PathCraft is a title truly reduced to the minimum terms, perhaps even too much in some respects. In a game like this, of course, there's no shortage of story or narrative line, but there are some gaps that could have been filled. The game menu is really very meager and barely consists of five items, in order: the choice of sitting / standing mode, the language, two options dedicated to audio and one to special effects. The title is not localized in Italian and basically this has never been a point against a game, but it is equally true that the material to be translated is so small that the publisher could have easily compensated, after all we are talking about modifying only the menu points and some small tutorials that appear during the experience. In complex scenarios, rotating the scenario would help a lot The most perplexing aspect of PathCraft is the choice not to allow the player to rotate the scenario while solving a puzzle. PressBy using the two back triggers of the Meta Quest 2 controllers, it is possible to grab the environment and move it in space, to be able to look at it from above, from below, on its right and left side, but you can never rotate it. This is because the game was designed to put the scenario at the center of the action, asking the player to move around like a satellite. A choice that we personally didn't appreciate, but that we don't feel like penalizing to the end, despite a fairly obvious short circuit. Rotation of the player around the environment is conceptually opposed to the arbitrary option to play PathCraft standing or sitting: if you play it standing it is easy to move around the scenario, but playing it sitting it is practically impossible. So why not add rotation in sitting mode? In some respects, PathCraft is a bit sparse There are VR puzzle games that make the exploration of the environment the strong point of the experience: for example the very sweet The Curious Tale of the Stolen Pets asks us to explore many small worlds and find the animals hidden inside them. Or Down to the Rabbit Hole, inspired by Alice in Wonderland, where we stand still inside an increasingly deeper diorama, moving the scenarios around us in a downward spiral. And these games work precisely because of the ability to rotate the scenario. Even without this option, the game is still very enjoyable, but it happened on several occasions to think that we had done everything to then realize that there was actually one last battery to collect behind a blind corner. Not to mention that some angles and perspectives are not optimal for solving puzzles, because in some cases, in addition to developing the right strategy, a certain amount of timing is required to divert the path of the little man in time. To compensate for this aspect, which as mentioned we do not consider as a problem or error but simply a design choice, there is the whole part of the editor, a huge toy box where the user is free to create his own levels and own puzzles by uploading them online and making them available to the community. Certainly not a new thing, on the contrary, but which adds further depth to the experience, as well as providing a reason to stay and play even after completing the almost 100 levels that make it up.", "date": "2023-01-19", "grade": "7.5"}
