Playing the role of a Predator and facing a small group of humans is like cheating; a lawful cheat, an infamous trick, a rigged hand in a poker game. It's like Brazil playing against the neighborhood soccer team or Godzilla coming face-to-face with a Japanese schoolgirl. The devastating power of these extraterrestrial killers has already inspired some of the funniest and most frenetic moments of past games, but the recent cinematic film directed by Nimrd Antal has given Chillingo the opportunity to present iPhone and iPod Touch users with what is surely one of the deadliest characters in the Galaxy. However, it should immediately be noted that, although PREDATORS is based on the feature film of the same name that has just been launched in theaters, the references to the latter are limited to a handful of characters and nothing more. The game developed by Angry Mob Games, in fact, is basically a frenetic action game that hides, not too covertly, its nature as an arena shooter. Or at least, that's just one of several ways it can be addressed. In fact, the player is asked to get rid of all the humans present in a closed scenario, continuing through the 23 levels that will lead him to the long-awaited final challenge, thanks to which he will finally be able to prove that he is worthy of being appointed clan chief. If the enemies have different weapons and abilities, the ways in which the Predator can make them meatballs are equally original. Running back and forth in the game arena it is possible to become familiar with the various types of attacks, combinations and holds: the player can make a feline leap towards an opponent, grab him and unplug his skull from his body like a bottle of champagne . There's no time to bleed Some firearms, such as a discus or plasma pistol, allow you to target enemies with an automatic targeting system and quickly get rid of them while maintaining a long distance. By tackling a level using mainly this type of weapon, the game turns into a sort of brutal and splatter MiniGore, although the long reload times often force you to launch into reckless melee clashes. Whether you decide to use the iconic wrist blades or the lethal Combi Stick, it doesn't matter: the helpless humans fall one after the other, flee or are crushed like ants. Real cannon fodder, left in the sadistic hands of a player who is far too advantaged. The latest update of the application improves the human AI and corrects a balance that initially made the Predator almost invincible, but changes very little, given that the player continues to be an unstoppable weapon of war. After unlocking new weapons, it will be possible to upgrade them or buy new ones by spending the points earned: we go from the aforementioned Combi Stick to the famous Netgun, a rifle capable of immobilizing enemies with a net, up to masks that improve certain characteristics . However, those who have already played the role of a Predator in the past will have already become acquainted with some of its skills and technologies: in PREDATORS for iPhone, the player can activate thermal vision to better distinguish hidden enemies, or he can decide to make himself invisible and move undisturbed in the scenario for a short period of time. This last ability, in particular, makes it even more unlikely to be defeated, since, in case of danger, you just need to blend in and wait for your health to fully recover. Mediocre boss battles are offered from time to time, while some levels try to break the linearity of the game with some different objective. However, this is not enough to mask its repetitiveness and the total absence of variety between one mission and another, and the impression is that the first 23 levels of the game actually represent a very long tutorial before the last battle. The final chapter, in fact, is nothing more than a timeless version of the previous deathmatches with infinite enemies, in which the player's goal is to score the most points to climb the tops of the online ranking.
