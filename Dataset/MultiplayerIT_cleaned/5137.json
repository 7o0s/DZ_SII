Finding yourself operating on a broken-down bed using a stapler, pizza wheel and chainsaw, supported by assistants with clear murderous intent may not exactly represent the ideal of Hippocrates, but this is the Adult Swim style gentlemen, you must be prepared for what you could find yourself opposite when it comes to the team made famous with a game based on a destructive cybernetic unicorn. The story is very simple, as are the medical solutions adopted in this game: Doctor Bleed, apparently the pioneer of ~amateur surgery~, has come back to life for mysterious reasons. Upset by what happened, but not even that much, the doctor decides to investigate the mystery of his own post-mortem existence and in the meantime start over with his amateur surgeon activity, which suddenly becomes more intense than ever. There are over 100 patients to treat in this new chapter of the series, using an even larger number of tools and intervening on a large number of different pathologies on very varied anatomies which include humans, mummies, robots, bears, giant squids and quant 'more in this sort of accurate simulation of everything you shouldn't be doing inside an operating room. Beyond the merits of the game action, what characterizes Amateur Surgeon 4 is obviously its demented humor, which manages to create a very particular identity for this title, acting as the glue in the bizarre series of mini-games that makes up its structure. Adult Swim shows us how to become a surgeon without a special degree, in Amateur Surgeon 4 Cut and sew If you know the Trauma Center series, imagine Amateur Surgeon 4 as a parody of the Atlus game, obviously removing all the serious implications of the visual novel component. Not that the narrative is missing here too, but we are quite far from the dramatic atmospheres of the Japanese title. In the role of the surgeon, we find ourselves having to operate on various patients belonging to various organic and non-organic species, using various instruments that should recall the medical tradition, even if they may seem decidedly out of place. This fourth chapter is presented as a sort of collection of the four previous titles, with the levels presented in an improved and enriched form and all connected by a new narrative line. In essence, it is a question of treating the various pathologies by choosing the right tools to incise, extract, aspirate, cut, reassemble, suture and cauterise, to which are added any extra operations to choose from. Everything must be done within a time limit and trying not to drop the patient's vital parameters too much, on pain of losing him if the appropriate corrective maneuvers are not taken (injections of stimulants, transfusions, defibrillation and more) . All this happens through a simple interface centered on the touch screen, touching the instruments and then the various anatomical parts to achieve the desired results, heal the patient, close everything and clean up. To face the most difficult challenges, it is possible to take advantage of the help of various assistants, each capable of performing simple support operations and using any special skills. The mechanics of the microtransactions are based precisely on these, which assume a rather annoying relevance within a not too long time: in fact, to face some challenges (in particular the ~bosses~ that periodically appear throughout the story) it is necessary to have the support of assistants, only these hide behind energy bars and long loading times. After a use, or an operation gone wrong, the various assistants will not be available for even very long periods of time, forcing the player to have to pay to reduce the wait and unblock the situation.", "date": "2016-12-08", "grade": "7.5"}
