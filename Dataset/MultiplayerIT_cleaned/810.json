{"name": "Blitzkrieg 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blitzkrieg-2-recensione.html", "text": "Sir, a textbook victory The accuracy of the game context and the information provided before each mission are undoubtedly the first sign of the meticulous research for the faithful reproduction of the battles, divided into four chapters for each deployment, made up in turn of five playable scenarios, for a total of 68 missions to complete. An element of interest is represented by the relative freedom with which one can reach the end of the chapter, which represents a fundamental turning point from a historical point of view and which can also be played without completing all the previous scenarios. However, this imposes a penalty in terms of difficulty, since the success of a task brings new resources in the form of vehicles and troop experience, so as to make it easier to complete subsequent missions. As could be expected from a title that tries in every way to maintain a high profile of historical credibility, Blitzkrieg II offers numerous videos accompanied by a voiceover that explains the war background of each clash, with a wealth of information and data regarding the historical moment. There are therefore many facts that really happened and here reproposed without therefore being able to reverse the fate of the conflict, but setting the terms of victory in the form of a certain number of objectives to be achieved; then how the war really ended as they say, is history. the sequel represents a good step forward and an excellent strategic title with a historical flavor also suitable for a more casual audience Sir, a textbook victory To understand the spirit of the game you need to think of an open approach beyond the historical constraints that form the background to the events, thinking that there is not a single winning strategy, but creativity and foresight in the choices are qualities that will lead you to victory by following different paths, without one being better than the other for this reason. In fact, you can concentrate on the encirclement of tactical units by creating a diversion elsewhere to cut them off from the bulk of the platoon, thus weakening the army without giving it the opportunity to regroup, or you can choose a targeted siege by focusing on the surprise arrival of support vehicles. with which to close the escape route for the enemy. Everything must be planned, this is certain and the starting point is the strategic map on which to choose which mission to undertake but above all to access a rich section that includes more than 200 units, among which to favor the forces available to deploy in the field . However, this represents only the beginning since the heart of the choices is represented by the investments made on future units. It is in fact possible to improve the vehicles and the infantry troops to increase the resistance of the armor, for example. However, the real novelty lies in the promotion mechanism very similar to that of role-playing games, where the units that survive the clashes level up with experience, improving the characteristics of their arsenal and shooting accuracy. However, the crucial point for learning new specializations consists in assigning officers and commanders to a limited number of divisions, so that with the experience gained in the field they can increase the possibilities of the infantry or the vehicles they command, guaranteeing performance additions on the battlefield. The real defect of Blitzkrieg II consists beyond its merits in the difficulty of managing the army in the field, in particular as regards the choices of artificial intelligence on the most logical routes to follow and for the disposition of vehicles and infantry, often haphazardly matched, resulting in huge, entirely avoidable losses in the phase of large-scale advances. Even the autonomous choices of the individual units, which if lost from sight sometimes end up facing mortar fire, perhaps ~distracted~ by a tracked vehicle that passes too close to their range of action, force a meticulous care and revision of the orders given , which becomes quite demanding and frustrating in the most agitated game phases. Furthermore, the doubt remains about some scenarios where you find yourself having to maintain a very high pace of play, ending up focusing more on how to contain the enemy's inexhaustible reserves rather than on how to develop strategic subtleties in view of the objectives to be achieved, even if it is a marginal problem not so present as to affect the playability of this title so pressing. The enemy is hiding Sir, shall we rotate the map? A big step forward has been made in this sequel so full of appeal and the merit lies in large part, as regards the aesthetic aspectof the game, in the new fully three-dimensional engine, which embraces every element with solid and detailed models. This means that things will crumble under the bombardment, with high-impact graphic effects that you can enjoy up close by zooming the map or rotating the view at will. However, it is not just a touch of style, since the smoke rising from the bombings or the destructible elements of the landscape (practically all, from the farmhouses to the trees themselves), can prove to be an integral part of the action, in the form of strategic elements to be take into consideration: if you are stationed behind some houses and the barrage of tanks makes a clean sweep of the habitable settlement you certainly cannot expect to continue your stealthy advance. Strategic disquisitions aside, each unit on the field moves with great naturalness and realism, in full respect of its real counterpart. There is also the alternation of day with night and the whole battlefield resounds with the excited cries of your men and enemy infantry, between explosions and unnerving sessions of positional machine guns, so that you cannot help but feel enveloped by the adrenaline of the clash. The last gem, even if it is an option now taken for granted, is the possibility of playing on the net for up to a maximum of eight players, complete with options for creating customized battlegrounds. Ultimately Blitzkrieg II is all that its predecessor offered good with several interesting additions and a decisive revision of the many gaps seen previously, even if a greater enhancement of artificial intelligence and movement is missing to be able to speak of absolute greatness. What matters is that the sequel represents a good step forward and an excellent strategic title with a historical flavor also suitable for a more casual audience. If you loved Blitzkrieg you can only rejoice and praise the arrival of the second chapter, which offers a beautiful three-dimensional overview of the battlefield, a detailed encyclopedia of all 200 and more units recreated for you, but above all a cure for the representation historic worthy of attention by all enthusiasts. Of course, there is also the heart of the game to consider, which goes beyond the concept of ~accumulation and squandering~ of resources in favor of total adherence at the moment of the actual battle, very fast and full of tension, where a single wrong decision he can screw up a well-thought-out maneuver. Many interesting ideas lack an artificial intelligence that complains about various gaps, which sometimes become critical during travel, especially if they involve many mixed-type units. Fortunately, this is not what prevents Blitzkrieg II from taking a decisive step forward and positioning itself as a new generation real-time strategy game, very entertaining and usable by a wide audience, as long as you are not exhausted by now by the vicissitudes of the Nazis and Bolsheviks with the supervision of Americans, but this is one of the most loved themes of video games. Pro New commander advancement system A cure for historical representation that includes 250 units Engaging and finely strategic No resource extraction, only frontline combat! It's all three-dimensional at last Against I.A. not always logical in the choices Managing movements can become frustrating Reinforcements take away some realism from the game At school with Rommel An important sequel to Blitzkrieg II, developed by Nival Interactive, the same ones from the first chapter, who now intend to carry on their pupil by focusing more and more on a type of RTS that moves away from the various WarCraft and Command & Conquer for two fundamental reasons. The first concerns the historical accuracy that goes to a level of great detail and depth, the second perhaps far more relevant concerns the absence of the managerial part reserved for the accumulation and transformation of resources. In fact, Blitzkrieg focuses directly on armed conflict in the open field, where the only thing that matters is your ability to predict what will happen following the choices you make and what you can expect from the enemy. There is therefore much more tension, but psychological pressure is the basis for appreciating a winning tactic. It is certainly not a genre open to everyone but Blitzkrieg II can offer many satisfactions even to players less accustomed to large-scale conflicts. The timeless scenario is that of the Second World War and the campaign for the single player will take you into the shoes of the three armies most present on the battlefields: the Wehrmacht (the never loved Nazis), the Soviet forces (Stalingrad taught us something) and the U.S. Army (already ubiquitous on a global scale at the time). So let's see what has changed compared to the past and what are the qualities necessary to be able to earn the title of ~Desert Fox~.", "date": "2005-10-13", "grade": null}
