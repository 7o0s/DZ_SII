Already from the storyline you can guess the light and tastefully insane character of the product: after wasting the first 35 years of his life, Tingle is called by the elusive Uncle Rupia, who promises to take him with him to the wonderful realm of Rupilandia. All Tingle has to do is amass as much money as possible and throw it into a magical pond, destined to turn into a tower that leads directly to the aforementioned heavenly place. Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is, quite simply, the essence of capitalism applied to video games: everything revolves around rupees, the ultimate goal is to earn an excess of them and every human relationship passes through the exchange of money. On a playful level, the product is configured as a sort of bizarre point-and-click adventure: the user moves the protagonist on the screen with the directional cross, and carries out any other action by pointing the stylus on the touchscreen. In his economic epic, Tingle will find himself exploring various settings, collecting objects, fighting monsters, drawing maps and interacting with NPCs, interspersing all this with more or less frequent visits to the aforementioned pond or to the only city in the game. It is in fact here that our grotesque hero will be able to receive information and carry out trades of objects with the various inhabitants, using a system that is the cross and delight of Nintendo production. Whenever Tingle has to make an offer to buy something (it can be an item or simple information), a calculator will appear on the touchscreen which will serve to type in the amount deemed most appropriate: the problem is that no minimum help to the user, who often finds himself having to repeat the operation due to too low a quantity of rupees or, worse still, to pay excessively for something of considerably lower value. The same happens when an NPC, in the act of rewarding Tingle, asks for information on the desired amount: the total absence of references constantly risks making ~shoot low~, getting much less than expected. Since his first appearance in Majora's Mask, Tingle has immediately captured the attention of players: in fact, it's not every day (not even in the fantastic world of video games) that you come across an ugly, small 35-year-old with dubious sexuality squeezed into a green outfit that would make even the toughest of cosplayers shiver. Therefore, the promotion of Tingle to the protagonist of a title of his own, the Rosy Rupeeland which we are now going to analyze, is inevitable. If I could have a thousand rupees a month As mentioned, it is not only the purely commercial aspect that revolves around rupees, but the entire game system, including the combat sections. In essence, Tingle's wallet also acts as an energy indicator, as the damage suffered by the protagonist is quantified in rupees, with the inevitable game over arriving in case of exhaustion. The battles are indeed extremely basic and not very fun: all you have to do is go at an enemy and wait for Tingle to do it himself. The only discretionary factors left to the user concern the possibility of involving more opponents in a single fight (doing so increases the number of objects obtained in the end, but also loses more rupees) and that of tapping on the screen to give a - impalpable- help to the effeminate hero. Soon, however, the possibility of hiring mercenaries is granted who throw their hands in Tingle's place, an almost indispensable option given his very poor physical skills: even here, however, it is necessary to bargain with the interested parties, falling back on the irritating trial-and-error mechanics of above. However, there are several ways to accumulate rupees beyond the pure exploration of islands and dungeons: the main ones are the preparation of recipes and the creation of maps. In the first case, the ingredients found here and there are used to make compounds that can be sold to the town shopkeeper, while in the second, points of interest must be identified in the scenario, their position circled on the touchscreen and the information just obtained is exchanged with a 'lovely old lady, of course in exchange for ringing rupees. It must be said that, despite the interesting premises, the actions that can be carried out in Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland soon take on the contours of a repetitive cyclicality, with the risk of prematurely boring the most demanding users. Too bad because, among other things, from a technical point of view the work Nintendo really has nothing to envy to more ~serious~ products: the two-dimensional graphics are in fact distinguished by an excellent use of colours, a remarkable visual impact of the backdrops and a more than discreet variety of animations. The sound, on the other hand, arouses a little less enthusiasm, even if it settles on more than good levels and decidedly above average. Comment Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is certainly a bizarre title, either for the difficulty of placing it in a well-defined category, or for the demented humor that permeates the storyline and the various characters that are part of it. Interesting from some points of view, the Nintendo product is however held back by obvious limitations, primarily concerning the excessive exploitation of trial-and-error mechanics and a significant underlying repetitiveness of the action. In short, although undoubtedly appreciable for its originality. Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is certainly not a product for everyone.
