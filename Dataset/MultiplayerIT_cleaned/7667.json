A theme that has never been so current, given the situation in Ukraine, and it is unfortunately very probable that the inhabitants of the bombed and invaded cities have experienced long days similar to those of the protagonists of the game. Hidden inside ruined buildings, the characters of the developed survival from 11 bit studios must try to resist for a variable number of weeks, fighting hunger, cold and exhaustion in the hope that one day their city will be liberated. A formula that, almost eight years after its debut, is being revived for the last time in definitive form on new generation consoles. How was our new journey through the horrors of war? We tell you about it in the review of This War of Mine: Final Cut for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Structure This War of Mine: Final Cut, the refuge of our characters in the base campaign Let's start with the contents, because This War of Mine: Final Cut is presented above all as a complete and definitive edition of the title that made the Polish studio famous: the end of a journey that began as mentioned in 2014 on PC and also landed along the way on console and mobile, albeit with some inevitable compromises on the interface and controls front. From the starting screen of the game it is possible to opt for the Final Cut of the This War of Mine campaign or for Stories, three narrative DLCs (~The Promise of a father~, ~The last transmission~ and ~Dying embers~) which apply the same formula to a structure that includes some variations on the theme, possible malus with respect to the survival mechanics and a greater focus on the characterization of the characters and their stories . The need was to tell more structured stories than the random elements of the basic campaign, focusing more on the representation of the feelings and legitimate doubts of those who try to survive under a military siege but also have to deal with many unforeseen and specific events. A goal that the developers have undoubtedly achieved and which gives us three short but poignant mini-campaigns. Returning instead to the original mode, it is possible to start a new session with a whole series of random elements, from the survivors we will have to manage to their conditions, from the time of year to the duration of the siege, or create your own story by manually adjusting all these aspects and thus also determining the difficulty of the experience. Gameplay This War of Mine: Final Cut, the exploration of a building at night Whatever our preferences, the gameplay of This War of Mine requires us to take turns commanding a variable number of characters, usually three, who have all taken refuge inside a battered building. The first thing to do is explore this place in search of useful resources, after which to understand if the materials at our disposal are sufficient to build a shovel, a file or perhaps a bed or a stove to cook food. The hours of the day must be dedicated to crafting and caring for survivors, who may be tired, sad, sick, injured and/or hungry, with a different and progressive level of intensity which in the most extreme cases can lead to dramatic consequences. The hours of the night will instead see us choose an element of the group to go around in search of food, medicines and objects, fill the backpack and try to return safely. This War of Mine: Final Cut, the interface for crafting items The possible destinations of our expeditions increase as the days go by, adding places that are not recommended due to the presence of other survivors, who will obviously try to defend their possessions in a more or less aggressive way, or soldiers and snipers who could shoot at view. Initially we will not be able to defend ourselves, but at a certain point in the crafting menu edged and firearms will also begin to appear. However, this War of Mine is in no way an action game, therefore an approach devoted to violence is very often proves counterproductive and ends up determining the premature (and definitive!) death of one of our characters, which will also affect the chances of survival of his friends. This War of Mine: Final Cut, the map of places that we can explore at night in search of resources It is therefore necessary to choose the path to follow carefully, and the most prudent and silent stealth often arises as the best solution. However, the unexpected is around the corner and even once you get back to the pot shelterSituations could arise in which humanely helping someone (a neighbor who needs to bar her doors because she is terrified that soldiers might break into her house) could turn out to be a mistake. control born with the mouse in mind and therefore not very suitable for controllers, which makes the execution of operations an often slow and problematic practice since you cannot assign an action to a character and immediately switch to another, but you have to wait from time to time. Graphics and sound This War of Mine: Final Cut, one of the settings of the Stories This War of Mine is characterized by graphics with a peculiar style, almost monochromatic and ~dashed~ as if they were a moving drawing: the effect is fascinating even more so with a 4K resolution and 60 fps, values which guarantee unprecedented sharpness and fluidity, enhancing the quality of the scenarios and some animations. As for the sound, the effects are extremely essential but the music is truly inspired and fascinating, capable of perfectly capturing the sad and dramatic atmosphere of the days spent cultivating hopes or feeding fears about what will happen.
