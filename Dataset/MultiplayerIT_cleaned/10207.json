With the departure of Ken Levine as the thinking and creative head of the game, now grappling with a brand new title in the pipeline at the offices of Irrational Games (at the time 2K Boston), the situation was certainly not the best: how to manage such a legacy ? How can we achieve the same quality level as the predecessor? Of that BioShock that has been able to re-invent narrative in a first person shooter, like it hasn't happened since Half-Life? Precisely that BioShock which, now 2 and a half years ago, saw videogame critics performing in votes with the highest scores as had practically never happened in the past? Surely having this kind of pressure in the development phase will not have made the software house's work simple but nevertheless, probably against all rosy expectations, BioShock 2 manages to amaze and stun, to capture the skeptics of too much hype and to satisfy fans of the franchise . Rapture, ten years (almost) later BioShock 2 opens with a small prologue that immediately demonstrates the narrative quality of the sequel. You are a Big Daddy, the last prototype built before the outbreak of the civil war and the consequent social and structural degeneration of Rapture. You respond to the name of Delta and, unlike the other mammoth dads, you are linked in a visceral, intimate, paternal way with a single Little Sister: Eleanor. You have fun with her, your aim is to protect her at the cost of your life and excessive spatial distance would cause your own death. But Eleanor is not really your daughter: it is the genetic construct, probably made at the table, of Sofia Lamb. She is almost jealous of your relationship or knows something that you don't know yet and with a disturbing subterfuge she manages to get the better of you: she forces you to take off your helmet and shoot yourself in the head. Ten years later you wake up completely unaware of what happened, of Jack's passage into Rapture, of his decline, of Andrew Ryan's death. You only know that you have to reach Eleanor, that Sofia will do everything to prevent you and, as per BioShock's narrative tradition, different figures will take turns throughout the story to help you on your way, almost always, indeed perhaps a little too often, for a their personal gain or for the inevitable sudden change in the story that brings down all the certainties timidly collected during the adventure. We will have Dr. Tenenbaum, the same as in the first chapter, who will act as a point of connection with the prequel, ready to guide us in our initial wanderings in a now devastated Rapture and to explain our obsessive relationship with the Little Sisters. And obviously a cloud of figures just mentioned through the numerous diaries scattered throughout the game: all perfectly in line with the setting that usually surrounds the discovery of these audio fragments and able to create that palpable and engaging atmosphere that permeates the entire experience of game. We will therefore discover different facets of Andrew Ryan, of his projects, of his twisted relationship with Fountaine but above all we will learn about Sofia Lamb, a psychiatrist wanted by the founder of Rapture to try to restore order to the social degeneration of his city, but soon become a real moral adversary. Where Ryan is the promoter of a meritocratic spirit, of individual freedom, of a sort of controlled capitalism, Lamb expresses at best a social, almost communist ambition, the search for strength in the group, in mutual aid with the negative drift of the ideological cult where the individual vanishes in sociality, the family. Dozens are the pieces that manage to convey this second personality that makes its way into Rapture and there will be numerous characters that we will have to meet and fight (sometimes even save) blinded by the charisma of Sofia Lamb and ready to defend her community ideas in the guise of mini - end-of-level bosses. Unfortunately, however, Ryan's charm is unapproachable, nothing of the events narrated in BioShock 2 manages to match the plot upheaval that made the narration of the first title characteristic. We are probably already prepared for the inevitable twist or some sporadic cliffhanger. The story flows fast and passionate from the first minute, but the intimate surprises aroused by the first BioShock remain only a memory. The timeline The BioShock universe, although designed by just two titles, is already quite intricate from a chronological point of view. So here it isi a concise, microscopic scheme, to be able to better understand the timeline of the series. 1958: Prologue to BioShock 2 New Year's Eve 1959-1960: BioShock 2 in multiplayer 1960: History of BioShock 1968: History of BioShock 2 The fighting, ten years (almost) later And let's talk about fights since BioShock 2, beyond its excellent narrative vein, remains a ~simple~ first person shooter. In the role of a rather special Big Daddy we will have 8 different weapons available, each with different types of ammunition and the possibility of using them also for melee attacks. We will therefore have a sort of nail gun, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a heavy machine gun and so on. But what really makes the difference, compared to the first BioShock, is the drill that we will be able to use from the beginning of the game and which will allow our protagonist to be devastating in close encounters also thanks to a particularly successful feedback from the weapons which restores the strength and the intensity of the blows inflicted on the enemy. In addition, our prototypical nature manages to elevate us above other Dads, for proficiency in the use of plasmids. A true revolution in the BioShock universe, these special liquids allow for real-time modification of the DNA once injected and guarantee the use of ~special~ powers. In the sequel we will find practically the same plasmids of the first chapter, from electroshock, to incineration, through telekinesis, vortex traps and hypnosis, but a different selection of tonics (a sort of passive skills) decidedly more in line with the new characteristics of the protagonist. In terms of controls, by pressing the LB and RB keys we will have access to the two radial menus for choosing weapons and plasmids, which can be used through the two triggers. With the front buttons we will be able to jump (Y), reload the weapon (X), perform the close shot (B) and activate the various machines scattered throughout the playing area (A). The two analog sticks close the appeal which, in addition to the movement of the character and the camera, if pressed, allow us to lower our Big Daddy or to use the close-up view from the weapon's viewfinder (a rather uncomfortable choice to be honest). And of course what would BioShock be without ADAM? In fact, this sort of Rapture currency allows the purchase of plasmids and tonics and is an integral part of the imagery that links the Little Sisters to the Big Daddies. In addition we will also have the classic dollars that can be collected from killed enemies and rummaging in the furnishings scattered throughout the game, and which can be spent to buy ammunition, medkits, EVE syringes (the material necessary to activate the plasmids) or to bypass machinery hacking. In this sequel we will no longer have to deal with the PipeMania-style mini-game but with a simpler needle that moves horizontally and which must be stopped near some green areas, carefully avoiding the red ones. The mini-game is now completely in real time: the action will no longer be paused and it will not happen infrequently (especially when alarms are triggered) that you will have to attempt a hack while at the same time the enemy is attacking you. To further stimulate this decidedly more frenetic gameplay, there is also a brand new small ~weapon~: a hacking dart gun that will allow you, from a distance, to attempt to tamper with any mechanical system. The action, ten years (almost) later And it is precisely the frenzy, the rhythm, the tension of the action that distinguishes BioShock 2. Immediately, already during the first minutes of the game which also act as a tutorial, we will find ourselves having to fight a Big Sister practically unarmed and still stunned by the new look of Rapture. In fact, as mentioned in the opening phase, the sequel is set just under ten years after the events of the first BioShock: the little sisters continue to roam the utopian city protected by the Big Daddies, only this time we will also have to deal with teenage sisters inspired in their clothing by that unique protective figure who has defended them for years. The Big Sisters are very fast, extremely diabolical in their aggressive behavior, they use plasmids and above all they perfectly exploit the verticality of the game environment. They will give you no rest and will often use their characteristic cry to call to themselves numerous Splicers (humans now addicted to ADAM and gone mad in their animalistic behavior) to send against you or to exploit to recover energy. In fact, the ~big sisters~ are armed with the characteristic syringe used to suck the ADAM from the corpses and do not fThey'll have too many qualms about stabbing it on you or other enemies. But we won't only face the Big Daddies, the Big Sisters and the different types of Splicers that we will meet in Rapture since another of the key innovations of BioShock 2 is the possibility of adopting a Little Sister as soon as she is deprived of her Big Daddy . Once loaded on the shoulder, we will be able to use its sense of smell to go in search of corpses to ~empty~ (by holding down the X key). In fact, not everyone can be skewered to capture ADAM, but only certain dead, usually positioned in areas of the levels rather exposed to enemy fire. Once we reach these corpses we will be able to bring down the little sister and we will start a series of enemy assaults that will try in every way to hit her. An indicator on the screen will show in real time how much ADAM has been collected and our goal will be to defend the Little Sister in every possible way. Let me be clear: she cannot die but the shots of the Splicers will temporarily block her collection and the more time passes the more enemies increase. Once two collections have been made, it will be necessary to bring the little sister to the nearest ventilation opening and in that context we will have the dramatic choice of saving or killing her to earn different quantities of ADAM. At this precise moment we can risk ~waking up~ a Big Sister who, after a couple of warning cries, will run in our direction to attack us. All these different areas of combat tend to make BioShock 2 much more immediate and frenetic than its predecessor which suffered in the long run from excessive repetitiveness and numerous dead times. The shorter duration also contributes (in about fifteen hours you will complete it) but now the variety is palpable and the artificial intelligence has also improved: enemies attack en masse, cover themselves, try to track you down by throwing grenades at you, exploit elevated levels and don't fail to jump on them from above. There is no breathing space and this tends to make the player's attention practically never wane. Xbox 360 goals BioShock 2 offers 50 achievements for a total of 1000 points. 17 of these are secret and related to the unfolding of the plot in the single player while just a dozen are related to the multiplayer component. All the rest are objectives that stimulate exploration in an attempt to collect the various audio diaries, rather than adopting all the Little Sisters or recovering all the weapon upgrades or plasmids. By completing the game with an average exploration degree, you tend to accumulate at least 500 objective points. The setting, ten years (almost) later The other big flaw of the first BioShock was all in the game concept that had resulted in a level design that was extremely inward looking in terms of backtracking. The sequel quite corrects the shot with a series of tricks. First, each level is completely separate from the previous and subsequent ones. These are very extensive maps, with attention to many details, with a feeling and a setting that is different and extremely characterized each time. Everything that is not collected or purchased, the little sisters themselves, is inexorably lost at the level change. The maps tend to have a sort of central area from which numerous routes branch off which you will need to travel from time to time for a personal taste of exploration or for the continuation of the adventure. And it will not rarely happen to retrace one's steps even if for short distances. But fortunately we can forget entire levels to go backwards: in BioShock 2 the event will happen on a couple of occasions but the geography of the setting will always be greatly altered or reduced by some scripted event or shortcuts that have come to light. This minimum backtracking obviously forced the developers to insert a minimum of respawns to keep the tension level high. And here it comes down to personal taste. Whether or not it is condemnable as a design practice, its value for keeping the player's interest alive is unquestionable, however seeing previously cleaned rooms now populated by one, two Splicers appearing out of nowhere, or breaking into a safe and getting a good blow from behind by an enemy jumped out from who knows where, it is always difficult to justify and, in the opinion of the writer, little appreciable. The underwater exploration sequences are completely new, rather short to be honest and also decidedly useless. They are not only lacking in combat or worthy exploratory ambitions, but also rather poor in terms of design and empathy. Virtually nothing new however, however", "date": "2010-02-08", "grade": "9.2"}
