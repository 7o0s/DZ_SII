Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a single cent. We've seen various interpretations of top-down arcade driving games on mobile devices, but Speed Kills demonstrates right from the start that it captures the essence of this sub-genre in its merits and in its defects, with the latter which are often amplified by touch controls. A recent update has made the Holy Warp game usable in a dignified way even on small screens, such as those of the iPhone and iPod Touch, where initially the experience seemed confined to the broad limits of the iPad. The reason is obvious: the developers have made available only two possible layouts for the controls and both provide for manual rather than automatic acceleration. On smaller touch screens, this almost always resulted in an unwanted ~encumbrance~ with respect to the view, which had to be corrected by raising the thumb but which in this way made us lose cue and acceleration. In short, a disaster. To this tangled situation it was also necessary to add a collision management that seemed to be based on one of Murphy's most famous laws: ~if something can go wrong, it will~. And so our vehicle slammed into that of an opponent and got stuck in a barrier, or it overturned, or it ended up marching in the opposite direction to the direction of travel. We said, with the update to version 1.2 fortunately these serious shortcomings have been remedied, also introducing a selector that regulates the sensitivity of the controls and which therefore allows us to adapt the gameplay to our needs. Run and shoot It is clear that it would have been a great shame to risk the credibility of Speed Kills in the panorama of racers for iOS only for a series of lack of optimizations, let's say. The game, in addition to being completely free, can in fact count on the powerful Unreal Engine for the technical sector, which makes a fine show of fairly detailed polygonal models and scenarios full of elements, well differentiated from each other, plus the variant of weapons. Between missiles, bombs and momentary boosts, races always know how to hold big surprises and it therefore becomes a must to invest the credits obtained with victories in the purchase of upgrades for our car or a new vehicle, which can serve as a more solid for subsequent upgrades. The numbers prove the guys at Holy Warp right, given that we're talking about eight different upgradable vehicles, over fifty tracks set within five planets (each with its own championship) for a total of over one hundred races. That's a lot for a product that you can download for free. Of course, there are still some uncertainties that we hope will be resolved with the next updates, for example a questionable balance regarding the speed of the various vehicles and above all the use of the boost, which sometimes appears almost useless, as well as still several disputes related to collisions. In short, Speed Kills stands as an ~open building site~, at the moment, with great potential that is still unexpressed and an immediate attraction that is not a small one, i.e. the gratuity.", "date": "2013-03-30", "grade": "7.0"}
