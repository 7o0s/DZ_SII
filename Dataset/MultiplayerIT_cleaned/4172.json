{"name": "Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ys-viii-lacrimosa-dana-recensione-switch-201921.html", "text": "The Ys series has always been unpopular, but dates back as far as 1987: it debuted on the NEC PC-88 and has since crossed over to a multitude of platforms over eight main episodes and a couple of spin-offs. Developed by Nihon Falcom, the saga has never had blockbuster pretensions nor has it ever wanted to challenge giant RPGs such as Square Enix, Atlus or Bandai Namco in the field, but over time it has carved out a hard core of fans thanks to a fascinating universe, beautiful soundtracks and old-school gameplay infused with exciting new features in every chapter. Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana was released in 2016 in Japan and landed on our shelves only last autumn, in the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 versions, then on PC a couple of months ago, while raising quite a few criticisms of a hasty localization and superficial that forced the developer to publish numerous updates and to officially apologize to consumers. Now Ys VIII also arrives on the new Nintendo console: in the next few lines you will find out how it ended. history and structure Ys tells the adventures of Adol Christin, a young adventurer who somehow always ends up shipwrecked here and there, often discovering that he is a chosen one destined for great enterprises. In Ys VIII, however, Adol finds himself in good company. The story begins on the ship Lombardia: Adol is traveling with his best friend, Dogi, when the ship, carrying a colorful crew, passes too close to the cursed island of Seiren. Many boats have disappeared around that island, needless to say that the same fate awaits Lombardy: Adol thus finds himself on the shore, alone and confused. After meeting Laxia, a surly young swordswoman shipwrecked just like him, the two begin to explore the island and, having found the captain, decide on a plan of action. First, you'll need to set up camp. Then it will be necessary to explore the island in order to find any other castaways and, getting to know it better, an escape route. In summary, Adol's objectives also describe the dynamics of this new Ys, at the most that the progression in the story is hand-in-hand with the discovery of new locations and the ~recruitment~, so to speak, of the missing shipwrecked . The island of Seiren is in fact a huge region, divided into large spaces separated by very short loads: following the main objective of the moment, Adol gradually pushes deeper, coming across new characters who will join his group or take refuge in the camp, expanding a range of services that includes shops, blacksmiths and other functions. There is a scent of Suikoden that we haven't smelled for a long time and that makes the discovery of every new passenger from Lombardy more exciting. Furthermore, some of them will provide us with the means or powers to retrace our steps and reach previously inaccessible areas: it would not be wrong to define Ys VIII as a kind of ~metroidvania~ given that the progression system is essentially the same. It must be said that the story struggles to take off for a good half of the adventure. The beginning is disarmingly slow and evokes the lilting rhythms of the old school JRPGs: the fault is also of an obsolete technical sector that frequently resorts to dialogues - in English at launch, with the possibility of selecting the Japanese language thanks to a future update - and which lends itself to a certain directorial stiffness even in the most important cutscenes. Fortunately, the dreams of Adol, a silent protagonist who seems to remember the life of a girl named Dana, acquire meaning with a turning point that finally gives meaning and substance to the narrative: at that point Ys VIII takes off with a series of twists interesting that dig deep into the mythology of the franchise. We have to hold on for a few hours, but Ys VIII then repays the wait with what is easily considered as Adol Christin's best adventure. The combat system Ys VIII is an action RPG in the sense that the player has complete real-time control of the movements and actions of Adol or one of his traveling companions. The party can in fact be composed of up to three characters and the player can swap them at any time by pressing a simple button that allows you to cyclically control one at a time. The map can be explored far and wide using runs and jumps, while the combat system is entrusted to a few keys which, however, guarantee perfect control. In fact, a key allows you to repeatedly attack the target - the enemies appear in specific points on the map and the battle takes place in real time asin a The Legend of Zelda, to be clear - and another, combined with the other buttons, allows you to perform the special shots previously set in the appropriate screen. In combat, however, dodging and parrying take the lion's share: by pressing the relevant keys at the right moment, the player triggers a power-up called, respectively, Flash Dodge and Flash Guard. The effect lasts a few seconds, but in this juncture time slows down and the player gains a significant bonus to damage inflicted and movement speed. The game, in fact, rewards aggressiveness a lot; there are no real healing spells, since life is restored by standing still, and there are no specific points to save in anticipation of some boss: the player accumulates the resource from which special moves draw simply by attacking the enemy, therefore it is encouraged to use his best attacks, but also to work on strategy. In fact, each member of the party uses a weapon that inflicts a certain type of damage and the enemies, needless to say, are more or less weak to certain types of attacks. It goes without saying that building the party based on the enemies to be faced soon becomes very important, but also learning the behavior of the monsters, so as to predict their next attacks and make the most of the effects of Flash Guard and Flash Dodge, charge the indicator of super attacks and unleash hell upon helpless enemies. Not a happy conversion The gameplay is therefore the strong point of Ys VIII, an action RPG that entertains for about thirty hours thanks to a sparkling and dynamic combat system which, however, travels at thirty frames per second and not even always, given that occasionally, in more frantic circumstances, some slowdowns occur. This usually wouldn't be a huge problem, except that the Nihon Falcom title kept the constant sixty frames in the PlayStation 4 version and certainly, having been developed for the PlayStation Vita, this is not a last generation title, Switch or non-Switch. In short, playing Ys VIII means coming to terms above all with an old-fashioned graphic sector in which a generally coarse polygonal modeling catches the eye - fortunately, the main characters enjoy a remarkable level of detail - and a frequent use of textures in low resolution. The artistic direction compensates for the shortcomings on the technological front with a sober and convincing character design, but above all with a variety of locations that is a pleasure to explore on the notes of a very high-level soundtrack as usual. Ys VIII is a very playable title both on TV and in handheld mode, even if we sincerely preferred the first option. When docked, the Switch conveys a cleaner, sharper picture, so the action retains a certain clarity in every situation, which certainly helps in more demanding and chaotic fights, especially when getting familiar with the control system and stringing aerial combos and instant character swaps. In portable mode, however, we noticed a fair amount of dirt which, together with some additional frame rate drops, makes some moments of the experience a bit unpleasant. On the localization front, we were lucky enough to play the conversion after installing a series of updates aimed at correcting various problems already on launch day, so we didn't stumble upon the opprobrium reported months ago, even if some typos continue to persist between one dialogue and another. Nothing transcendental: Ys VIII has been translated into school English and easy to understand, even if unfortunately the absence of an Italian localization was foreseeable.", "date": "2018-07-04", "grade": "S.V."}
