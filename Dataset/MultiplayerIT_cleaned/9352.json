This horizontal scrolling shoot'em up by the Caves immediately met with great success among enthusiasts, a community that has never died out especially in the country of the rising sun, as evidenced by the numerous shmup cabinets present in Tokyo's arcades. After all, in the current videogame panorama, the guys from Cave, based in the very vertical Shinjuku district of the Japanese capital, appear as masters of the genre, having to their credit despite the modest size of the studio, numerous shoot 'em ups developed for multiple platforms : from arcades to consoles, passing through a respectable presence on the iPhone app store. Among the most famous brands we can certainly remember the sagas of DoDonPachi and Espgaluda, in addition to the famous Guwange which has also recently benefited from a conversion on XBOX Live Arcade. The transposition of Deathsmiles on consoles was made to wait far too long, coming out on Xbox 360 in the Japanese version in 2009, the following year in North American territory and only in February 2011 did the European release finally come. But was it really worth undergoing this exhausting wait? And has the loyalty of the numerous fans and enthusiasts been adequately repaid? Lolita witches Deathsmiles is characterized by its eccentricity in character design and frenetic bullet hell situations with dozens, hundreds of hostile bullets to avoid by staging a choreographic dance with millimeter movements between enemy attack patterns. In short, serious stuff, there is no time for useless pleasantries, in Deathsmiles you are immediately catapulted into the action in a frenetic crescendo of action and explosions. This time, however, distributing large quantities of destruction on the screen are not spaceships launched at breakneck speed in the immensity of space or mechs armed to the teeth, but rather... young witches, witches dressed as gothic lolitas to be precise, accompanied by faithful and unusual pets always in tow that contribute to the fight with their offensive potential. However extravagant the setting of Deathsmiles may seem, a feature that can also be found in the particular characterization of the enemies appearing in the most bizarre and unusual shapes and features, the general contextualization makes the scene appear very close to an anime where each sprite on the screen has been drawn with an eye to the functionality of the gameplay so that the size and animations of the opponents never appear excessive or invasive for the player's concentration. The characterization on which the Caves have dedicated particular attention also has implications on the substance, which can be found in the different characteristics of the four protagonists differentiated by the type of shot and by the familiar, the support animal used. The action follows a horizontal scrolling, Deathsmiles is only the second shoot 'em up Cave that adopts this approach after Progear no Arashi which however never reached western markets. Unfortunately, although scrolling from right to left fits much better with the dimensions of today's widescreen televisions than the classic longitudinal shmups, the dimensions of the play area maintain a proportion of 4:3 borrowed from the arcade version, nevertheless there is the possibility to extend the playable area over the entire surface of the television, however sacrificing the aspect ratio of the scene by subjecting it to a horizontal ~stretching~. A peculiar feature of the Cave product is undoubtedly the possibility of orienting the shot both to the right and to the left, using two different keys so as to be able to counter the enemy waves that do not hesitate to appear from both ends of the screen. This creates a less linear progression of levels in favor of greater dynamism. The levels are structured in three chapters divided in turn by two scenes of your choice (each chapter includes three levels, A, B and C among which you can choose the two playable scenes) for the first six levels, after the sixth level ( i.e. chapter three, scene two) the fourth and final chapter, which also includes two scenes, becomes available. To this tree of levels, which require more than one game to be explored all given the choice required of the player, there are other secret levels that become available only by reaching particular conditions during the game or only in specific game modes. Once you have chosen the stage to deal with, you can choose the difficulty of the gameor between three choice options (which become four in Mega Black Label mode with the insane level 999). Evaluating the complete picture, one realizes how finishing a single ~lap~ on Deathsmiles does not require much time, certain that to play every single level as well as face the game at the highest but also most satisfying difficulty, it requires a large dose of commitment and patience. Then, like any self-respecting shoot 'em up, the real challenge is the score race, exacerbated by the presence of online rankings, so everything focuses on the points multiplier and on making the combo counter of the killed enemies grow inexorably. Xbox 360 goals Completing Deathsmiles in a single mode and beating all bosses, including those in extra levels, just 200 points are unlocked. For complete loot it is essential to finish the game with all the protagonists and all the various modes, as well as making particularly brilliant performances from the point of view of the score. The mega black label In addition to the peculiar bilateral orientation of the shot Deathsmiles is characterized by other specifics of the gameplay, the offensive capacity of the protagonist witches can be exploited in three different ways: a standard wide-range attack, an alternative version with a more concentrated offensive radius which inflicts a greater of damage but forces the protagonist to move more slowly and a third variant where, thanks to an automatic engagement of the enemies within an area around the witch or her animal (this changes according to the chosen character), directs the shot at 360 degrees without the need to aim but decreasing the offensive potential of one's attacks. As a last resort in the case of desperate situations, you can resort to the classic bomb that frees the screen from any hostile presence, also canceling enemy bullets. The heart of the Deathsmiles gameplay, however, lies in the power up mode, which can be activated by reaching 1000 in the counter of objects collected in normal game mode and naturally obtainable by killing enemies, in this particular status you can take advantage of an exponentially increased offensive capacity which contributes also to increase the match score more generously. To make himself competitive in the jungle of the rankings, therefore, the player must keep this status active as much as possible, benefiting from the advantages for a long time, just limiting himself to surviving and completing the scheme, in itself anything but easy at the more difficulty levels. high, it is not enough to earn a place of respect among the online rankings, as well as being a limiting approach to the gameplay offered by Cave. The mechanics that unite this heterogeneous scenario are solid and tested, the game never cheats and even in the most seemingly intractable situations there is always an escape route from the opponents' attack patterns. The game also offers variations on the theme, always based on the very solid foundations of the gameplay, the Xbox 360 version of Deathsmiles is embellished with different game modes: the arcade which faithfully reproduces the arcade cabinet version up to the last pixel (which low resolution on high definition screens), this is accompanied by a version specially redesigned in terms of graphics and optimized for the Microsoft console; finally a 1.1 version designed to enhance the double stick pad, which offers the possibility of controlling the movements of the familiar as well, as well as a slightly different management of the item cunter for the power up, of the score and of the small counter bullets released by the enemies once destroyed and assimilated in favor of the score from the familiar. These three game modes are also present in the Mega Black Label version, a further variation on the theme characterized by even more hardcore deviations, such as the addition of the difficulty level 999 and the use of darker colors for the backgrounds of the levels so that enemy bullets stand out more, guaranteeing a more precise approach to the chaos on the screen. Another playable character, Sakura, is also available in this version of the game, as well as an exclusive and challenging level called Crystal Shrine. On the technical side, the choice to use only and strictly 2D is certainly more appreciable by long-standing shoot 'em up players but still has a peculiar and perfectly recognizable style that gives personality to the entire product. You may notice some framerate drops in the most chaotic situations but these are never episodes that can undermine the gaming experience. Even the sound sector accompanies the action more than admirably, offering classic pieces arrangiati, rock melodies and even some typically jpop digressions, the soundtrack among other things is included in a separate CD in the very convenient limited edition of the game.", "date": "2011-04-13", "grade": "8.0"}
