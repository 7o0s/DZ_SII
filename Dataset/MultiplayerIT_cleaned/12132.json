{"name": "Call Of Juarez - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-juarez-recensione-2.html", "text": "Incipit Call Of Juarez recounts the deeds of two men united by a distant and sad past who, like any self-respecting distant and sad past, returns to visit them regardless of good manners. The young Billy Candle, obsessed with a treasure, is in fact overwhelmed by a new tragedy of which he is held guilty and this unleashes the good Reverend Ray, whom we meet in the role of spiritual pastor of the community and Billy's acquired uncle. It only takes a few minutes to realize that old Ray's past is a heap of horrors and that the Reverend was a fearsome gunslinger before fate led him along the ways of the Lord, horrors that unleash and take the form of revenge, of course in the name of God. Here is the most charismatic character in the game, perhaps a little too sanguine and naive for someone who has seen so many, but certainly tempting to play. Meanwhile the aforementioned Billy Candle escapes, flees from his angry uncle and flees from hordes of thugs, who seem to know more than he does about the treasure and his obsession. Call Of Juarez is structured in the alternation between the Reverend's guns blazing chase and Billy's silent escape in a plot that leads us to the discovery of a rather raw and compelling plot. The elephant and the butterfly As we said, the good reverend is not so good and carries with him the archetype of revenge, a revenge to be obtained strictly with lead. To obtain the coveted justice, and exterminate the plethora of criminals who casually stand between uncle and nephew, he can draw on his gunslinging skills among which a bullet time variant (akimbo) stands out overwhelmingly where it is possible to aim with each pistol at a different target. This mode is the only one that clearly benefits from the transition from mouse to pad, allowing us to conduct the two sights independently using the controller sticks. In addition, guided by divine fury, the reverend is also able to break down doors that are not too resistant to the sound of kicks, a fundamental element for a good entrance on the scene which often leads to a mortal duel, complete with a countdown at the end of which it is Desirable to be rather quick with the right stick when drawing the gun and checking the aim. his trusty bible which can be wielded in place of either pistol and used to terrify and distract enemies The elephant and the butterfly Finally Ray has his trusty bible with him which can be wielded instead of one of the two pistols and used to terrify and distract enemies. And while the old gunslinger makes his way reciting relentless verses that are the backdrop for roars and carnage, Billy flees, trying, without too much success, not to attract too much attention to himself. The sessions dedicated to the boy are therefore more often than not classically stealth where the key words are to hide and not make noise and above all to fight with the bow, which is silent and can also be used in bullet time mode. But the boy is also able to climb and use his whip to dangle across cliffs of all shapes and sizes and this ability gives life to situations that, even if with an infinitely lower rate of dynamism, rather closely resemble Tomb Raider Legend . The good In Call Of Juarez there are turbocharged horses, there are pistols and rifles of all sorts that are damaged with use, there is no shortage of dynamite, a hint of physics, a micro jog on the classic miner's cart and from time to time the Indians also appear to hinder our path. In short, there is everything on paper, including a cross-plot that reveals itself masterfully. The graphic system is more than good, the transposition from PC to 360 impeccable and during the shootings the excellent management of the visual depth stands out, seasoned with explosions, flames and noteworthy details such as the smoke produced by an enemy's rifle that is moved by the windage of the next shot. Excellent visual distance and environmental details, such as the clouds that change shape and cross one of the most realistic skies seen to date, complete the picture of Call Of Juarez which unfortunately, even in this incarnation, continues to suffer from poor animations and modeling some enemies not exactly exceptional, but which on the other hand offers absolutely breathtaking visuals. Even the sound aspect is quite accurate and offers convincing sampling, perhaps apart from the shot of the sniper rifle, and the well-made dubbing (English) manages to recall the atmospheres of the old west. The soundtrack is absolutely on topic, but sadly lacking in power and epic feel. Obviouslythere is also the multiplayer mode via xbox live, an element that is no longer a side dish but essential for a 360 title to be considered complete, and there is also a good dose of extras which includes the replayability of the duels faced during the story mode. Although the modes via XBox Live are the classic ones and although weapons such as the double barreled shotgun are not exactly the ideal balance, the possibility of riding a horse makes some modes quite fun, at least for some time. The ugly Call Of Juarez is all of this but unfortunately it is also one of the clearest examples of how bad level design can affect an excellent gaming system. Stealth missions are too simple and flat, Billy's climbs result in noticing the right platform to hang from and offer zero degree of challenge. Among other things, in one mission we were forced to walk for several minutes in splendid vegetation, but so devoid of life, variety and usefulness that we were led to look at the clouds in case they had taken on some funny shape. extra missions which qualitatively are decidedly superior to what was seen in the story mode The ugly The towns are almost completely devoid of non-hostile life forms, so much so that the sensation is that of being in an American shooting range, one of those where cardboard shapes suddenly appear in the midst of the reconstruction of some environment. And the incredible thing is represented by the fact that these elements are instead present in the extra missions which are qualitatively much higher than what was seen in the story mode. The impossibility of hitting the innocents and of ravaging the bodies in a title that, legitimately if we consider the genre to which it belongs, allows the massacre of Indians, rabbits, the exploitation of prostitution and guarantees the possibility of playing lippa with skulls. humans. Goals 360 The objectives, one per mission plus some multiplayer tasks plus some secrets, are pretty easy to complete. Almost all of them consist of an action to be repeated a few times and do not present a real degree of difficulty even when it comes to hitting opponents on the head or with some particular weapon. Comment Despite the fluctuating level design and the almost superfluous stealth component, Call Of Juarez remains a solid shooter, technically satisfying and enriched by an excellent plot. Added value comes from multiplayer support and developer statements regarding future distribution of additional content through Live. Pros: excellent aesthetic impact solid game mechanics excellent storyline Cons: poor and fluctuating level design animations and enemy models are not up to the surrounding environment The western is a tangential genre to the video game that has never really been integrated into the cyclical flow of genres despite its ability to arouse interest. Probably one of the triggering causes of this phenomenon is represented by the drop in genre film productions but fortunately, in recent years, the genre has reappeared through titles such as Desperados, Red Dead Revolver and Gun, which have tried to interpret various elements of the old west by tying into genres particularly in vogue at the time they were conceived and released. Unfortunately, when the goal is to follow the wave of market trends, even by developing excellent game mechanics as in the case of Desperados, the emotional side suffers. On balance it is still necessary to go back to Outlaws to find a title capable of recalling the powerful atmospheres of a genre that has been the absolute heir of epic culture, starting from the damned hero up to the absolute figure of revenge of the Eastern imagination.", "date": "2007-07-06", "grade": null}
