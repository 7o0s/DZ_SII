Almost 5 years have passed, portable hardware has evolved exponentially and the gaming landscape for smartphones and tablets has expanded dramatically, intersecting with the console one and blurring the line between the two areas and yet that golden rule seems to have remained intact: the best experiences on mobile platforms derive from concepts elaborated starting from their specific interface. And this is why Eliss Infinity confirms the excellent results obtained from the first chapter, presenting itself as a game based on few rules, practically absent narrative substrate, immediate gameplay based on gestures and a fast pace. The structure has remained fundamentally the same as the original, with a modest graphic reworking and some content additions, in particular in the form of a couple of additional modes that complement the main and progressive one. In practice, it is a question of moving ~planets~ over a portion of space, dragging them with the fingers in order to make them disappear as soon as possible and leave as much room for maneuver as possible. The planets are suddenly born as supernovae in various points of the screen and are characterized by different colors and sizes, the aim is to move them over ~black holes~ to make them disappear, following two very simple rules: the planets must match in color and size to such holes for the disappearance to take place. It is possible to drag planets of the same color on top of each other, thus making them merge into one of larger dimensions, or on the contrary, split a planet into two smaller ones (and so on up to a minimum size) with a diverging movement of the fingers. The important thing is not to make planets of different colors collide with each other, because this causes the energy bar to drop quickly towards Game Over, and it is something to keep constantly under control since the appearance of new planets occurs in a completely random on the screen. Eliss Infinity is ideal for letting some time slip through your fingers Space at your fingertips In the main mode, each level requires you to make a certain number of planets disappear before you can move on to the next and progressively complicates things by adding new obstacles and variations such as gravitational vortexes that attract orbs, wandering stars and increasing the number of different colors to manage . The difficulty obviously arises from the need to have to manage space strategically, while this decreases more and more as the number of planets on the screen increases, which leads to acting quickly and with extreme precision. It becomes essential to use more fingers simultaneously and in this sense Eliss Infinity represents one of the best applications of multi-touch in videogame form, maintaining a practically constant movement of the fingers on the screen. Perhaps this potential is fully expressed on the iPad, with greater maneuvering space and the possibility of wider movement and the possibility of placing the device on a flat surface, but the game remains perfectly enjoyable even on the iPhone. The additional modes of this new chapter, which are unlocked by progressing in the main ~Campaign~, extend the longevity by providing different interpretations of the same basic structure: Infinity allows you to continue without a scan in levels in infinite mode, trying to score the most points and challenge other users in the rankings, while Spacebox represents a relaxing alternative, based on the same structure but without the hassle of the energy bar and with the possibility of creating planets and experimenting with movements and game situations, probably the weakest mode among those offers. The solidity of the design carried out by Steph Thirion on this title is evident in the coherence with which it is presented, with its minimal and clean appearance that is perfectly associated with a dry and elementary, yet irresistible gameplay. This starting from the menus, actually so simple as to be too cryptic, being completely devoid of writing, but certainly impactful and well integrated into the general look of the game. Also noteworthy is the electro-melodic soundtrack in chiptune style but harmonious and catchy, which perfectly integrates the contextual sound effects in the backing track.", "date": "2014-02-14", "grade": "8.0"}
