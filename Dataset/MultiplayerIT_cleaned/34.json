{"name": "Darwinia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darwinia-recensione.html", "text": "Introversion Software Born in England from the passion of three friends for videogames, Introversion Software has distinguished itself over the last few years for a not very high number of projects, all however able to have a strong impact on users, thanks to the union of elements from the great classics of the past to other very innovative ones. Their first project, Uplink, was released in 2001, which puts the player in the role of a hacker, but global success only came at the end of 2005, when Darwinia achieved incredible results, both in terms of public and critics. Not even a year later, last September, Defcon imposed itself as an absolute masterpiece, the Risk of the twenty-first century. Currently, Introversion Software is working on Subversion, a project still wrapped in the strictest confidentiality. For those who haven't done it yet, the advice is to get the entire software library of this incredible developer as soon as possible. A bit of everything' The first characteristic that Darwinia shows of itself is the one that draws liberally from real-time strategy, given that in order to defeat the formidable intruders who are devastating the hard disk  um, the world  which is the backdrop to the events, it is necessary create a maximum of three units, useful both for attacking, the squadrons, and for carrying out research and interfacing with the many devices scattered around the maps, the engineers. From these limited starting choices many others will unfold, obtainable through the discovery of some artifacts, which will increase arsenal, technology and much more. Any unit, ability or equipment you want to use, you will have to invoke it through a special drawing, to be traced with the mouse inside the main menu; in a similar way to what was seen in Black & White. At the time of the battle, the gameplay takes a first radical turn. Troop attacks must be carried out manually, so it is not possible to ~link~ to enemies and wait for your subordinates to do their job. If we add to this the enormous presence of viruses to be eradicated simultaneously and their speed in moving, we understand how much the RTS nature of the title stands aside, in favor of an almost action-based challenge. The creation and attack phases will be followed by others in which to conquer some control points through the appropriate units, useful for opening passages that allow the use of teleporters, necessary to move our squadrons through otherwise impassable areas, or to activate the gates end of level. Resource management is almost non-existent, just as it is not possible to build buildings from scratch; in fact, you can only use those already originally present for your own purposes. This extreme simplification of the management aspects, however, does not affect the overall depth of the gameplay at all, simply helping to increase its pace. The controls are quite intuitive, even if unfortunately the mouse alone is not enough and you are forced to move the camera using the keyboard. The difficulty of the proposed challenge is never excessive and the learning curve is rather soft, so that even less savvy users will be able to enjoy a satisfying experience. Longevity, on the other hand, represents the major sore point, given that it won't take more than ten hours to complete the proposed missions and, once this is done, the incentives to load Darwinia again will be minimal, given the absence of secondary modes and above all a any form of multiplayer. However, modding enthusiasts will be happy to know that once the game has been completed, a map editor will be available and the possibility of using those already created by other users. Retro taste The graphic style chosen for Darwinia is simply perfect. The setting ~internal~ to a computer is rendered thanks to the representation of characters and objects in a stylized way and with iridescent colors, for a final effect that cannot fail to bring to mind the 80s and, specifically, a film like Tron . Having said that, it is not reasonable to expect anything really shocking. The effects are made rather roughly, as are almost all the animations, while the textures offer a very minimal level of detail; all, however, for the benefit of those who do not have a PC with a particularly advanced configuration. The sound is good, the music accompanies the action without ever being intrusive and offers a decent quality. Little varied effects and an excellent dubbing, even if it is always and only Sepulveda who speaks, close an averagely convincing picture. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 3 800 Mhz RAM: 128 Mb Video Card: 3D 32 Mb Disk Space: 50 Mb ConfTest iguration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 Ghz HT RAM: 1 Gb Video Card: NVIDIA 7900 Conclusions Darwinia is the game you don't expect. It offers an extremely varied gameplay, which combines elements from RTS to other action and, in some cases, even from puzzle games. Variety is therefore guaranteed, as well as immediacy and fun. If anything, the problem is the duration, too limited and undermined by a non-existent replay value. Sound and graphics have a lot of charm, even if the latter is a bit limited by a pleasant but improvable realization. Recommended unreservedly, however, even just to play something different, between one blockbuster and the next. Pros Original and very entertaining Unique style and atmosphere Does not require a latest generation PC Cons Technically out of step with the latest productions Hybrid gameplay may annoy some Poor longevity Darwinia is a particular game, not incredibly innovative as it would seem, but unique and full of interesting ideas. The story is as simple as it is bizarre and puts the player in the role of an unspecified entity, who inside a computer will have to try to save the Darwinians, mysterious little creatures as well as the latest invention in the field of artificial intelligence by a curious genius of the world. computer science, Sepulveda, constantly endangered by fearsome viruses with not too original features of worms, spiders and other horrible creatures. If the premises are at least atypical, the whole setting chosen for the 10 missions that make up this product, initially distributed on the Steam platform and today in Italian stores thanks to DDE, form an interesting picture, a mixture of genres that is difficult to repeat, with constant reminders to other titles.", "date": "2007-03-13", "grade": null}
