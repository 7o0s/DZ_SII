{"name": "Loki - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/loki-recensione.html", "text": "Ascension Day Loki puts the player in the role of a mortal who, through his wanderings, will challenge the gods until they reach their same immortal status. At the beginning of each game you have to choose the type of hero to lead through the adventure and the range of choices is pretty standard: there's the Nordic warrior, a classic fighter with close-quarters weapons, there's the Greek fighter, more skilled with ranged weapons, then we find the Aztec shaman, who is halfway between a necromancer and a shapeshifter, and finally there is the Egyptian wizard who, as the name suggests, is an expert in the art of casting spells . There are three difficulty levels, each unlockable only after beating the previous one: Human, Heroic, and Divine. Naturally, each hero has its own stats and skills. Finally, some levels are randomly generated. Attention, not all are but only some, contrary to what is written on the packaging which suggests that all levels are! not all levels are randomly generated, contrary to what is written on the packaging Ascension Day But what do the Egyptian, Aztec, Nordic and Greek deities have in common? The story is ambitious and takes its cue from the moment in which a servant of Seth, god of the desert and, in this case, of chaos, awakens his master from eternal sleep, freeing him from his captivity. Naturally, after millennia segregated in a sarcophagus, Seth decides that it is time to see the world and therefore begins to visit those places he has never seen before, leaving a tangible sign of his passage in each of them. And so, before the hero's eyes, a conspiracy of incredible dimensions is revealed, since it involves the gods themselves and which will be able to change the fate of all the worlds involved. Questionable is Cyanide's choice to show the true ending only after completing the game on Divine difficulty. Ascension Day The narration and, jointly, the progress of the game are not linear. Once the hero has been chosen, the player finds himself in the latter's native world and will have to complete all the quests present before being able to access the Time Threshold. The Thresholds of Time are nothing more than a point of union between the different worlds. Once gained access to the Thresholds, the player will be able to freely move between the various realms, aided by a transport stone with which to directly reach any previously visited level. During his epic journey, the hero will be able to experience important moments in history and mythology, taking part in the siege of Troy or thwarting Ragnarok for example. [C] Under the roots of the largest tree largest in the world we find the largest worm; big in the world. Logical, right? A legendary item! In all of the Nordic world we have found only one! With the latest patch they have become very rare A fiery dungeon. Finding your way in these places is a challenge. almost impossible, also because it is can not see anything [/C] Heroes and Gods As per tradition, the hero has a handful of attributes to be modified by leveling up. It's all about the usual stuff: strength, dexterity, intelligence, vitality, and energy. In this, the developers have decided to maintain a classic scheme, without distorting anything. Skills, on the other hand, are closely linked to the deities worshiped by the hero. Using an altar, the hero can decide to worship only one of these deities at a time, or none at all. Depending on the choice made, part of the experience gained in battle will be donated to faith points or not. In the same way as experience, when faith reaches a certain value, a skill point is gained to be spent in the tree relating to the chosen god. At any moment you can decide to go back to the altar and change the deity, so that the points earned from that moment on can be spent on the skills of the new god. In addition, it is always possible to reset the points spent in a certain tree and reassign them differently. An alternative way to earn the favors of the gods, that is to increase faith points, is to offer the collected objects on the altar. Of course the gods will reject any normal items, preferring magical ones. The more powerful an item is, the more faith points will be credited to the hero. the first thing that catches the eye is inventory management... The visual characterization is lost in favor of a more orderly and aseptic list Heroes and Gods With the objects collected, whose generation is strictly random, the hero can decide what to do: he can keep them, sell them to merchants, or take them to the blacksmith. The blacksmith allows you to disassemble objects, reassemble them, make them more powerful or recycle them to obtain matsraw materials from which they are composed. Be careful though, because you can only recombine objects of the same type: you can't mount an ax on the hilt of a sword, for example. The blacksmith, then, allows you to set runes and reforge objects, for example by covering a miserable leather tunic with a layer of iron, finally making it more resistant. The first thing that catches the eye is inventory management. The classic panel with the hero figure, the slots for the equipment and the grid full of objects disappears, replaced by a list sorted by categories, which can be expanded or contracted, and from which it is possible to see the selected object by highlighting it with the mouse. The visual characterization of the inventory is therefore lost in favor of a more orderly and aseptic list. Heroes and Gods As we have already seen, Loki is full of quests and it will often happen that you complete one or part of them during a particularly hectic moment, perhaps in an area populated by hostile creatures. Unfortunately, the Cyanide guys didn't think of blocking enemy attacks during the quest update message, so we'll often find ourselves beating blows when we wish we could know what the hell is written in that box and , in certain situations, it is really annoying. Unfortunately there is also another big flaw, as the bonuses of some attributes are wrong. Is already. If you find a shield that gives you +2 Strength and +3 Strength it doesn't mean that you will have +5 Strength, but that you will have +2 Strength and +3 Dexterity. Other times Dexterity will be confused with Intelligence and again Strength with Dexterity. We're at patch 1.0.5.0, which isn't exactly the first, so there's already enough of a chance to fix this bug, but we remain hopeful that sooner or later the developers will get to the bottom of this nasty business. Meanwhile, this is an error that negatively affects the final evaluation. Worlds at our feet The world of Loki is particularly large and guarantees many hours of gameplay before seeing the end of it. It consists of the four realms, Nordic, Aztec, Egyptian and Greek, plus the Time Thresholds, which is a kind of central connecting hub. Each realm has a village where the hero can go to his god's altar, trade, seek quests and request the blacksmith's services. From the village, then, one or more exit routes unravel to reach the outside. Loki transports us to compartmentalized areas and, between one area and another, there is a long loading interval Worlds at our feet As already mentioned, some levels are randomly generated, while others are not. These are areas of connection between areas of particular importance and are distinguished by the fact that they are built in blocks. It is, in essence, a progression of mini-areas joined and connected so as to form a mostly linear path, albeit with some detours every now and then. For the most part, the areas visited can be reached via the stone again, effectively eliminating any backtracking problems. One of the most obvious defects of this map system, however, is the fact that it is made up of areas that are disconnected from each other. Forget the single, seamless, load-free world of Diablo 2, as Loki transports us to compartmentalized areas, where there are entry points and exit points, and between one area and another, there is a long loading interval. Worlds at our feet In fact, it is precisely in the scenarios that Loki loses many of its potential, starting from the fact that Cyanide seems to have done its utmost to build vast worlds, or rather made up of many areas, but at the expense of variety, since in the end the realms seem to re-propose the same theme over and over again. It's true that a desert is a desert or that a glacier is a glacier, but there are so many things you can put in it to revive the environment that this lack seems almost unjustified, especially when there are so many areas like this. The differentiation of the areas is very limited and to this is also added a generation of calustrophobic levels, where moving is sometimes just as difficult as surviving, especially for a hero who strikes from afar. To make matters worse, there's a camera that for some obscure reason never positions itself satisfactorily. This means that it is either too close, or too high, or too low, but it is almost never possible to find a shot that allows you to have a clear view of the surrounding environment and enemies, without some obstacle ending up in us. half. Fortunately, walls, columns, rocks and everything else become transparent when they end up in front of thethe camera, but it is not sufficient to eliminate the sense of imprecision provided, indeed the sense of claustrophobia increases even more. The sharp side of the axe At least, the welcome committee offered by the inhabitants of these areas will revive the situation, who will not hesitate for a minute to come and shake our hand, possibly to take it away. The enemies are present in large quantities and varieties and, fortunately, since they are closed maps, they do not attack all together but have a visual range within which they become alert and come towards us. This means great racket and profusion of blood, but also many objects scattered on the ground to be collected at the end of the fight. Unfortunately, however, a key to highlight the fallen objects is missing, just as a key is missing to highlight the objects with which you can interact, say chests, hiding places and containers in general. Collecting the well-deserved reward, on the battlefield, therefore becomes decidedly frustrating. And then there are no objects to break. Do you remember those beautiful barrels that in other games you just need to touch and they will shatter, revealing their contents of gold, magical objects and some fish bones? Well, in Loki I lack the shadow. The game's bestiary is very varied, presenting all kinds of creatures, human and otherwise, and, to the delight of the little slaughterer inside each of us, Loki does not skimp on the size of the various enemies we will meet. Dragons, spiders, giants, wolves, we will find very large ones and they will be among the most impressive bosses to defeat. In that sense, Loki fares admirably. The sharp side of the axe Comment Loki is a product of great ambition, offering a well-crafted story, high longevity (rare these days), meticulous hero development, and a huge and widely varied enemy pool, but failing where it would like to excel. . The vastness of the world comes at a high price, as the areas lack variety and lead the player to get bored quickly. Randomly generated maps provide greater replayability, but at the cost of low mobility within them; which becomes more serious for those who fight from a distance. In an area that would like to be open but which is actually twisted and delimited like a corridor, it becomes very difficult to carry your hero forward between obstacles, bottlenecks and dead ends. A good RPG which, certainly thanks to the budget price at which it is sold, we would like to recommend to the most passionate, with the due reservations we have just talked about.
