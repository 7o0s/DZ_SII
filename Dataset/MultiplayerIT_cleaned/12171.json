{"name": "Rush for Berlin: Rush for the Bomb - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rush-for-berlin-rush-for-the-bomb-recensione.html", "text": "Everyone wants the bomb The story told in the expansion (as already happened for the original title) lays its foundations on a fictionalized version of the events that actually developed around the deployments of the Second World War in Europe. Rush for the Bomb (the title is already quite eloquent) assumes that the Germans have somehow managed to steal very important plans for the construction of the atomic bomb from American laboratories, unleashing absolute alarm among the ranks of the Allies. The exciting story takes place over 12 missions in which the player can choose whether to take on the role of the fierce and dangerous Nazis, in an attempt to bring the construction plans back within the walls of the Reich, or those of the Russians, British and Americans intent on blocking the countermove by German espionage. The scenario for the events narrated in the expansion will be evocative places scattered in the four corners of Europe, from Norway to the Iberian Peninsula. Features As with any self-respecting expansion, there are many new features, beyond the additional missions. In fact, new units will be available to be deployed in the field to face increasingly demanding missions. Among the new mechanized units appear the NKL-26 propelled aeroslitta, useful for its ability to move dexterously on icy surfaces, the Horten Ho-229 aircraft, forerunner of modern stealth, the only aircraft of the Reich to have the characteristics necessary to a possible dropping of atomic bombs on the United Statesn the Messerschmitt Bf-109, the backbone fighter of the Luftwaffe, the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, dive bomber, the M4 Sherman tank, scourge of the Axis in Allied hands. In addition to the team of new units made available there are three officers, one for each front. The mobile infantry officer (Allied), with triangulation abilities (all allied artillery units on the map hit their targets automatically), mobile medicine (all allied repair tanks on the map also contain infantry units), guide commanding (increases armor, damage dealt, and speed of vehicles in line of sight). Standing out on the Russian front is the military intelligence officer with the skills Fireproof armor (officer's vehicle becomes highly resistant to incendiary weapons), Bolshevik motivation (increases the maximum level of your units), fleet upgrade (increases the level of allied units within visual range for a short period of time). Finally, the Feldkommandandt appears on the German front with armor-piercing shells (increases the effectiveness of the officer's vehicle's armor-piercing weapons), German efficiency (damaged factories, which are within the officer's visual range, work at full capacity) , Abwehr espionage (shows enemy officer locations on the map for a short time). Comment After all, there are not many innovations introduced, but it is the final product that makes the difference with the predecessor. For a rather moderate expense it is in fact possible to obtain a robust game like Rush for Berlin with the addition of an expansion aimed at improving its longevity and balance between the factions. After all, the difference is appreciated well beyond the 12 additional missions, continuing to play on the official servers made available online. Strengthened also by the Geopard graphics engine, renewed for the occasion, RftB will be able to give lovers of the world conflict the thrill of experiencing ~alternative~ and revisited moments of some of the most agitated phases of the clashes on European soil. All that remains is to take up arms and run for cover before the Fuhrer obtains the ultimate weapon.
