{"name": "Need for Speed: Underground", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-underground-3.html", "text": "I want respect! The main mode of the game is underground mode, where your night runner career will start. From the menu you will have the possibility to choose the type of race, modify your racing car, observe the statistics and the magazine covers (yes, if you win certain races your car will end up in the most important magazines in the sector!). In addition to this mode there are the classic fast races with practice laps, elimination races and two new types of challenge: Drag and Drift. The first consists of an acceleration test along more or less impervious straight lines: the fundamental thing is to change gear at the right time to stay in the lead, paying attention to the traffic and obstacles on the route, which if bumped lead to elimination from the race. Drift, on the other hand, provides a series of closed circuits in which you have to drift the car continuously to get more points than your opponents. In fact, in the game there are ~Style Points~ which are obtained by making particular evolutions (jumps, deparate, slipstreams, brushing against other cars) along the lines of the Kudos of Project Ghotam. The tracks are quite varied, even if they tend to recycle certain sections because they are all taken from the same city divided into zones. This is sometimes misleading due to the similarity of the roads, which can lead you to follow certain trajectories with the risk of hitting some unexpected wall. Always stare at the map! Proceeding in the Underground mode you will face all the types of race listed (for a total of 111 tests) whose victories will be necessary to unlock new tracks, more performing cars and above all pieces to be mounted on your vehicle until it becomes a caricature of the basic model. The amount of modifications that can be performed is incredible: from the simple paint of the bodywork, to the installation of nitro systems, passing through side skirts, spoilers, mufflers, wheels, electronic control units, change of trim, headlights and any part that is on a car . The availability of parts and vehicles increases as the race progresses following a well-calibrated difficulty curve, when you encounter problems you can always add modifications or change the racing car with a more powerful one. These are not many, about twenty, and some of which stand out Japanese cars, similar to each other. Of course they can be customized but some other model could be inserted. However, the races can be tackled in easy, medium, difficult mode, a factor that drastically determines the computer's ability: the opponents may be suckers chasing obstacles or carrion who will try to ram you in order to win. Ultimately, the addition of improvements (especially aesthetic) will also serve to increase your reputation, indicated by a series of stars in the menus, which it will be important to raise as the game progresses. Nice car! But are you capable of driving it? As far as graphics are concerned, we are on excellent levels: well-detailed cars full of reflections, tracks full of buildings and other finely crafted and sufficiently varied structures. As a drawback, however, we have the blurring effect that increases with speed, beautiful to look at but compromising for visibility. When the odometer exceeds 200 it becomes difficult to see in the distance, making the risk of an accident very high. However, it is possible to deactivate the effect from the graphics menu which allows you to customize all the parameters. The fact of running only at night is perplexing, putting at least one sky at sunset would have varied the situations a little more. The game engine that manages everything without excessive slowdowns is not bad, even if it must be said that it shows some uncertainty even on the most powerful machines, evidently due to imperfect optimization (the playability of the xbox version is undermined by this problem). Another disconcerting factor is the total absence of even a visual damage model, it's okay that it's not Destruction Derby but hearing the crashes of the cars (really realistic and noisy) without the bodywork being dented at least a little leaves a bad taste in mouth. We are very far from the physics of Project Ghotam 2. It also leaves the realization of the traffic cars to be desired, all similar to each other and graphically much inferior to the cars in the race. THX CERTIFIED GAME The sound sector is of an excellent level, with the rumbles of the cars very powerful and diversified from each other. The audio in general is very accurate with a particular praise to the trail effect: when you pass close toof a high-speed object you can feel it hurtling past you. The game is also one of the first to have Lucas' new THX certification, which guarantees that the developers will put a lot of effort into the sound. The list of musical pieces is also stupendous with rock, hip-hop, techno and metal pieces, which will satisfy all tastes even if it is unfortunately not possible to change them in the race (a car radio would not have hurt since the audio systems are also given weight in the scene initial). THX CERTIFIED GAME Play Online at EA.com! (No fast, No furious) The multiplayer mode of Underground requires, as for all EA games, the creation of an account on the official servers, otherwise it will be impossible to play any game with other virtual pilots. At the first connection, the internal online management program will search for any patches. Once the update procedures have been carried out, it is possible to obtain information on other users, on current tenders, etc. Next to each player we find a bar that indicates the speed of the connection, red if slow, green if at maximum: some games (using a 256kb ADSL) have proved to fluctuate, with opposing cars disappearing and reappearing all the time for the the rest of the playability is always high, and winning is a priority (for some even too much because as usual we find those who try free ramming). The different types of races then make the challenge more varied than simple head-to-head. During the session it is possible to create the preferred type of competition by adjusting the various parameters and wait for the other users to launch themselves onto the track by you. Ultimately fun and captivating, with the effect, in case of defeat, of wanting to compete again with the winners until winning! All this, however, provided you have a fast connection. Comment To conclude Need For Speed: Underground is a good arcade game, which makes car tuning its strong point. When you get to assemble improbable pulsating neon and nitro systems you will feel able to ridicule Vin Diesel's car in ~The Fast & the Furious~. The atmosphere is beautiful, the package in general is beautiful and varied enough to keep you glued to the monitor for several hours in singleplayer. The types of challenges and the many competitions with relative prizes will push you to get to the end to have it all. If you add a good multiplayer mode, in which you can't wait to compare yourself with other virtual tamarri to see who has the most exaggerated and powerful machine, longevity is guaranteed. Pros: Excellent graphics Unique car customization Fun and immediate arcade driving Cons: No damage model Few cars Requires powerful PCs Finally, after several months of waiting, Need For Speed: Underground is out, the last title of the arcade series born years ago on the now defunct 3DO. Let's dispel any doubts immediately: Underground is a purely arcade game, which bases its existence on the very high-speed night races seen in the two ~Fast and Furious~ films. Then unbelievable fake cars, illegal races in the middle of traffic and interlude films starring more or less braggart tamarri and beautiful women. The driving model follows the Electronic Arts custom: accelerator almost always flat, curves at the limits of adherence and no maneuver that requires excessive prudence, for a system that in any case manages to be immediate and fun.", "date": "2004-02-20", "grade": null}
