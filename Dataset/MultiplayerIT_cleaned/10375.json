In this panorama, a scrolling beat'em up worthy of the name is still missing, and this Tap-Fu now tries to fill this gap. Wax on, wax off Tap-Fu deliberately makes fun of itself in terms of storyline: the plot revolves around the sweets that evil ninjas have stolen from an elderly kung-fu master, and that it will be up to a young disciple to recover, obviously with blows. The candies are also used as a discriminant for the completion of the various levels, as it is possible to pass to the following phases only after having collected the required number; finally, they also serve as a tool to recover portions of vital energy. Structurally speaking, Tap-Fu is a shockingly simple game: the levels are made up of simple two-dimensional planes in which the protagonist moves, beating up all the enemies that appear on the screen, until the set target of sweets is reached. The user can count on various moves, which can be unlocked as the adventure progresses: you start with simple punch combos, but soon you find yourself performing powerful roundhouse kicks and even devastating fireballs. All using a control system that tolerates two different settings: one, more classic, offers the by now well-known on-screen virtual keys with which to control the character, while the second is completely based on touches and swipes with the fingers, freeing the screen from indicators. However, the best solution is the first, given the action nature of the game and the lively rhythm that it is able to reach in the more advanced levels. Tap-Fu also proves to be a complete product in other respects, first of all the modalities: in addition to a rather long-lived Story Mode, the title offers the Training, Survival and 100 Rounds sections, as well as online scoreboards and achievements to unlock. It must be said that a fundamentally repetitive play structure can undermine the appeal of the product in the long run, but the effort is still appreciable. Tap-Fu is therefore a simple and fun scrolling fighting game, also capable of giving some great satisfaction from a graphic point of view. The super deformed style of the characters and the use of cel shading wink at a style champion such as Viewtiful Joe, and the result can only be translated into a well-finished and extremely pleasant cosmetics.
