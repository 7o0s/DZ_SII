{"name": "Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disgaea-2-cursed-memories.html", "text": "For some time now, ~made in Japan~ RPG-strategics have no longer been taboo for us European users, or at least not for those who have never turned to the import market from the USA. Of course, there is still a long way to go and titles of the genre in the PAL version are not many, especially when compared to the American or Japanese markets. However something seems to move. A little over a year after the local publication of Disgaea - Hour of Darkness, Nippon Ichi Software (creators of the excellent La Pucelle: Tactics and Phantom Brave among others) returns to our shores with the second episode (it is not a sequel) of a game that has conquered the hearts of many fans: Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories. Disgaea 2 starts practically from scratch at the plot level since the plot line has nothing to do with the previous episode. It's a story in itself, in short, like the various chapters of FF. The only ~link~ between the two games could be found in the figure of Etna, present in Cursed Memories, however, with a different role. In a world dominated by Lord Zenon, an evil, very powerful Overlord, a strange curse he cast affects the inhabitants who are slowly transformed into horrendous monsters, with the consequent and gradual loss of memory of their past life. The only one to save himself from this authentic apocalypse is a red-haired boy named Adell. With the help of the ~trick-eyed~ summoning mother, the young man decides to face the fearsome Lord Zenon to stop his devastating madness, and save friends and family before the transformation ends (for example, his father has a demon embedded in his chest, and he will soon take over him in terms of personality) by summoning him directly to his home through an arcane rite. The strange couple Unfortunately things don't go the right way, and instead of the Overlord the young man finds himself in front of his own eyes the spoiled daughter of the latter, Rozalin, who had never set foot outside his luxurious home before. Desperate by the girl's unsympathetic attitudes, and to exploit her as a ~Trojan horse~, Adell decides to bring her back to her father... Thus begins a fairly long adventure in which humor, fights and twists (although few tell the truth) will follow one another in a whirlwind of feelings that will often contrast the two protagonists and the various characters who will join the party, on which stands out the hilarious figure of Tink, Rozalin's childhood friend with a French accent, transformed by an unknown enemy in a flying frog with a dual personality, one grumpy, the other lascivious. From a structural point of view, this Disgaea 2 does not differ much from its predecessor, which if on the one hand could make those who are constantly looking for novelty in a sequel turn up their noses, on the other hand it could make the more ~traditionalists~ happy i.e. those who, having already found the playability of the first to be perfect, feared changes that would have partially distorted the ~series~. In fact, the gameplay provides the usual continuation through a series of episodes divided in turn on average into four or five dungeons in which to fight (structured in a chessboard, where we will have to advance our characters). Upon completion of an episode, a boss is almost always faced which, depending on the case, may also have a certain relevance for the purposes of the storyline. The battle takes place in turns, first a party starts and then it's the enemy's turn. Both groups can move or launch attacks in this phase, and obviously the physical and technical characteristics of the character and the terrain will greatly influence these actions: a flying creature will cover a wider space of movement than another terrestrial one, as well as a launched attack from the top of a certain position or from the side, they will cause more damage to the opponent than the equivalents launched from the front or from the same line in which it is positioned. Cursed Memories The primary objective is to defeat all the enemies present in the playing area and collect as many bonuses as possible before proceeding to the next level. These bonuses can vary in number and quality in relation to the level reached by a special indicator bar: the latter increases according to the damage inflicted on enemies, and therefore with the use of combos it is easier to raise it. Obviously, by advancing in level, it will be possible to acquire new special attack skills or weapons suitable mainly for the damage of entire areas (and therefore collective) rather than individual ones. Furthermore, thanks to the so-called Geo Panels it will be possible to unleash further ~disasters~ on the enemies. What are? These are panels in the colors pThe most varied that make up the flooring of a given area: they indicate the presence in the area of Geo Crystals, particular pyramidal magic crystals which are also coloured, which give bonuses (negative or positive) to all the boxes of the color they are on. The color of these crystals is not always the same as that of the underlying panel, so if the ~pyramid~ is destroyed in this case all the Geo Panels will acquire its color, causing damage to anyone on a square about to change color . Also interesting is the fact that sometimes some monsters are disguised as Geo Crystals and can move where they want, catching the gamer by surprise or sending certain chain reactions upstream resulting from the destruction of the crystal above. The system called Lift and Throw is present again in this Disgaea. With it our characters can position themselves one above the other in a maximum of ten and thus form human towers capable of reaching elevated ledges or attacking the same target en masse (all the characters participating in the attack receive experience points). Considering the difficulty of some levels and the impossibility of saving the game during battles, it is advisable to do so before entering a dungeon. The only place enabled as a ~save-point~ is present in the town of Holt, a place designated to be the base for our party. In fact, here it is also possible to treat one's wounded PCs in the hospital (for a fee), buy items from local merchants or move comfortably to any location one wishes through the work of the guardian of the Dimensional Door. Item World... different As in the previous episode, also in this Disgaea 2 we will find the interesting Item World. It is none other than a real world inside each object! Anything, a weapon, a tool, can be enhanced dozens of times by physically entering it. Once we arrive in the Item World of a particular object, in fact, we will find ourselves in a series of randomly created dungeons, where, to advance, all we have to do is reach the portal or kill all the enemies as usual. But compared to Hour of Darkness this session has been revised: in the various levels, in fact, there are now various types of ~gates~. The normal one makes you advance, as mentioned, to the next level, the new ones, the special ones, yellow in color, will lead you to particular random rooms called Mystery Rooms, where you can find a hospital to heal yourself rather than a treasure or forced combat. When the area is passed, a point will be obtained which will increase a certain parameter of the weapon or tool within which we are. Every ten levels you arrive in the Innocent Town, similar to Holt, where it will be possible to save the game, heal yourself, talk to the inhabitants and present yourself in front of a Dark Assembly, here called Item Assembly, to obtain power ups for the appropriate object or give it a name. Another special portal, blue in colour, however, is manifested by entering a subpoena, considered to all intents and purposes as objects. Each character can be accused of having committed various crimes, such as having killed too many enemies or being too powerful in a certain parameter, so by presenting himself to the appropriate officer in the city he can accept the aforementioned. By accessing the Item World from the subpoenas and finding the aforementioned portal, it will be possible to come before a court that will judge the PCs. The first to enter, even if ~innocent~, will bear the blame. The more crimes a character accumulates, the greater the benefits that will derive from them, as once judged, experience points, HL, etc. will be obtained. The number of crimes also plays a determining role in some of the eight available endings. The Dark Assembly and the Dark World Also in the Item World there are crews of pirates, which appear randomly and are diversified from each other in terms of power and difficulty. If you manage to defeat them after a fight (the alternative is to flee) they will drop part of a map which, once completed, will open the doors to a new world. These, like extra levels or other aspects of the game must be approved by the Dark Assembly to unlock (not to be confused with the similar Item Assembly which is only found inside items). In fact, once they arrive in front of this assembly made up of demons, videogamers will be able to make their proposals (request to create new characters, to make rarer goods appear or to have more experience attributed, etc.) by offering in exchange for the mana accumulated by killing enemies. But getting these councils to approve your proposals is not always easy, on the contrary.Often the judges, even if bribed by members of our party, will betray our expectations by rejecting the request. In this case you can resort to brute force, unleashing a brawl with those who did not vote in favour, but you have to be careful, as some demons are very powerful and you risk pecking them, or in case of defeat and their beating they will remember it for future votes... Going back to the topic of the ~new worlds~, as if what has been described up to now weren't enough, the presence of parallel dimensions (as in La Pucelle) should be noted at each level of the regular game, ie the main adventure. These are none other than ~the dark side~ of the map that you are going through and are unlocked only under certain conditions, i.e. by reaching undisclosed objectives, such as for example that of not taking damage in the normal level 1-2 to obtain the map of the namesake in the Dark World. The additional feature present in this phase is beautiful: the Dark Sun. As the name suggests, it is a dark sun that has the ability to give particular powers and different effects from turn to turn to the map you are on, to your party , to the enemy, etc. These effects can be consulted in a special list in order to allow the user to plan his actions with caution. Using the Ascend command it is possible to destroy this sun by throwing a party member at it. In short, another small addition that can only please the enthusiast. As far as the purely aesthetic aspect is concerned, however, Disgaea 2 maintains the excellent character design and anime style of the other titles of the producing software house, almost a trademark. Some may not like it, but generally it is a style that makes others prefer it in the genre. Ditto for the audio sector, which however appears slightly higher than the previous episode in the dubbing, good, and in the music, even if in fact many are recycled and reworked from the first. Comment Technically similar to the first Disgaea, Cursed Memories is probably the best strategic J-RPG available on Ps2 today. By improving here and there what little could be done in an already excellent gameplay, the adventure of Adell and associates earns the palm of number one, thanks also to a remarkable longevity and to an always satisfying fighting system. It's just a shame that the plot isn't as fascinating as that of its predecessor, but in the end it's just trifles in the face of the general quality of the title. Pros: Funny, with a humor of its own. Excellent longevity. Technically well done. Cons: Less captivating plot than the first. The few changes may not please some.", "date": "2006-11-30", "grade": null}
