Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since the days of Rampage, the famous coin-op that saw us control huge monsters intent on destroying entire cities with their fists and devouring their inhabitants. A title, the one created by Midway, which was indeed devoted to pure action but which at the same time hid small surprising facets, in this case a bit of petty strategy to allow users to bring down the biggest skyscrapers, compromising their stability on both sides. Tower Boxing starts more or less from the same assumption, even if this time we won't see a giant monster moving on the screen, but characters belonging to the cinematic imagination of the 80s: a clone of Rocky Balboa and two of his most famous opponents, Ivan Drago and ~Clubber~ Lang, a mini version of Godzilla, a goat (which is very fashionable), the equivalent of Conan the barbarian, a parody of Tiger Woods and even a wizard very similar to good old Galdalf, as well as many other variations again, all unlockable using the gold coins earned with each game or purchased using real money thanks to in-app purchases. Controlling one or the other character does not produce differences in terms of gameplay, therefore obtaining new ones is simply part of the perspective of a progression that does not go beyond the high score. In what sense? We'll explain it to you right away. Tower Boxing is a kind of ~vertical~ Flappy Bird clone, simple to play but with a lot of challenge Falcon Punch! Scrolling is vertical and the context appears different, however in the end Tower Boxing is just a new clone of Flappy Bird. In fact, the game shares the basic mechanics with Dong Nguyen's blockbuster: in that case we had to tap on the screen to produce small leaps and avoid pipes, in this case taps on the right and left of the screen translate into as many punches devastating, capable of destroying entire floors of a building of infinite height. As the building ~comes down~ towards the character, scaffolding comes with it which, once touched, incurs a ruthless game over. For this you need to instantly understand where to hit, whether to the right or to the left, and how many punches to throw exactly to get the better of more resistant sections than usual. To make the action more frenetic and to confirm the distinctly ~survival~ nature of the experience, we find a bar at the top of the screen, which is filled (very little) by collecting gold tokens. Tokens extremely similar (especially in the sound they produce when they are taken) to those of Super Mario Bros., which closes a circle of similarities that hardly ended up there by chance. The game is difficult, just like Flappy Bird, but in the same way it is natural to play a game every now and then, perhaps catching the proverbial state of grace that allows us to overcome a previously established record of shots. Unfortunately the controls do not meet the needs of absolute precision required by this type of gameplay, intrinsically limited and therefore easily destined for a rapid decline in interest, while the ~pixel art~ style graphics and the ~vintage~ sound manage to play a discreet work, accompanying our jabs adequately.", "date": "2014-09-13", "grade": "6.5"}
