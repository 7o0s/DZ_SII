{"name": "Cold Fear: poca paura su PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cold-fear-poca-paura-su-pc.html", "text": "One hand to the railing and the other to the rifle Around us there is only the boundless stormy ocean and it must not have pleased Tom Hansen, protagonist of this murky story of mutant sailors, to know that the special team sent before his coastguard patrol was annihilated in a few seconds (it's all documented in the opening presentation). You will therefore immediately find yourself alone, anxious about the companions you already imagine devoured by illicit itinerant experiments and with a ship under your feet that won't stand still. This is the most controversial point of the game, because all the gameplay of Cold Fear should have been played on the instability of the boat but unfortunately, let's face it right away, the result is very far from the expectations of recent months. There is indeed a storm, in particular on the deck of the ship the instability is considerable and the effect of rain that whips the monitor as if it were glass only makes the environment more hostile, but for practical game purposes it is influenced in a very marginal way and the structure of the clashes does not deviate from the best-known tracks of the genre. Perhaps the courage on the part of the developers was lacking or perhaps the challenge proved to be too tough to be proposed in a functional way but the disappointment remains. The premises are very intriguing, since the whole adventure is set on a mysterious Russian whaler, which is dark and silent, no longer has human voices capable of responding to calls via radio One hand to the railing and the other to the rifle What has been said becomes clear in the scenes that take place below deck, where the storm is a memory and the game setting could make us think of the Capcom saga, if it weren't for the possibility of choosing between two views, one in third person and one from above the shoulders. Here instead this is the second most controversial point of the game because neither of the two available views are free from defects that could be overcome. The third-person view does little to suit the siege climate which brings Cold Fear closer to a shooter than an adventure, making at this point the question as to why a first-person view was not included, which would also have amplified beyond that the sense of fear for the unknown just waiting to attack us from behind. Fortunately, the view placed behind the shoulders partially compensates for this need and makes the aiming action much more precise and faster, in particular due to the presence of the laser pointer, but the unfortunate camera will force you into a forced alternation. Dead of boredom What has been said about the controls has a great influence on the gaming experience, because this forgotten whaler is a den of crazy experiments by the fanatic Yusupov, which will engage you in fights between corridors and cabins more than they push you to long reflections on what happened. The puzzles are in fact very simple and mostly involve serene walks retracing your steps, entrusting the usual crew logs with the burden of shedding some light on the meager story that justifies your presence on board. Despite the flaws listed, the clashes remain the most stable element of Cold Fear, especially when they take place outdoors at the mercy of the oceanic fury, but this doesn't save them from a general monotony that suffers from the biggest deficiency attributable to this game. a widespread lack of tone. The essential scenes are missing to be able to captivate you with a story that smacks of already seen from the first moment and apart from the need to hit the enemies on the head, there are no relevant factors to break the general flatness of the action. As if that weren't enough, Cold Fear isn't scary, it doesn't transmit that palpable tension in the air, when you know evil exists but you would never be able to tell from which side it could attack you. There are many, too many elements that do not convince this title, including the absurd saving system that feeds only avoidable frustrations. At least on one point, however, Cold Fear comes out with its head held high or at least with honor and that is the graphic aspect. Although the interiors are bare and dull like the berth of a submarine, at least they manage to play on the contrast of lights and shadows which makes it difficult to see what is happening in the darkest corners, with a palette of dark and metallic colors beautifully dosed and in tune with the cold scenery of a forgotten whaler. The models of the enemies are not a riot of textures and do not even have the right appeal that befits a biological horror, but they remain on more than fair levels, as well as the certainly not very lively but average Italian dubbing. As is normal, the scene is dominated by the effects of the storm and by the extremely accurate reproduction of theand oscillations of the boat, so natural and believable as to deserve another chance, in a sequel perhaps more successful than this first attempt. Comment Cold Fear is a failed game and to say that the recipe was the right one, with lots of new and exotic ingredients, but the traditional ones were badly, very badly dosed. The story is weak and supported by fragments of notes with one-dimensional protagonists, but above all it fails to scare the player. It is true that the rough sea and the boat at the mercy of the waves is a superfine idea created with great class, but precisely for this reason the lack of courage that perhaps prevented the developers from linking this element to the gameplay is even more stinging , which suffers from some even silly shortcomings. Too dull and lifeless, Cold Fear remains a good idea that can, indeed must be developed again in a sequel this time necessary and not redundant, provided that the long-awaited step is taken and what is left only in potential is realized. For now we have a game for collectors of this kind who still run the risk of getting bored. Pros: Stormy seas are worth seeing Ship at the mercy of the waves is a superb idea Quality effects and lighting Cons: Story without personality Boring mechanics There is nothing that really scares Numerous flaws in the game system No escape route The search for emotions is the spark that drives the consumption of stories, whether they are narrated through images or thanks to an insatiable pen, and if there is a strong emotion that makes us vibrate in our seat, it is undoubtedly fear. From this point of view Ubisoft moves on a double-edged terrain, because if on the one hand horror never goes out of style, on the other hand it boasts illustrious ancestors and numerous cousins who proliferate in shops month after month, from evil that becomes living flesh of Silent Hill to the morbid campaigns of Red Siren. The most difficult challenge is therefore that of succeeding not only in terrorizing the user, now ready to see zombies entering the house sent by the software house, but also in proposing an innovative and original concept (actually in recent years is a challenge for the market in general, but that's another matter). The premises are very intriguing, since the whole adventure is set on a mysterious Russian whaler, which is dark and silent, no longer has human voices capable of responding to radio calls...", "date": "2005-05-05", "grade": null}
