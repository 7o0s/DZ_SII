There's always more to download, the offer continues to increase, but it's only partially good news because making your way through a flood of insignificant products makes it difficult to find the title that would make the difference: the pearl. We arrived at the review of Kayak VR: Mirage after hearing about it in the depths of the net, but we must admit that what definitively convinced us to try it was the news that the game was for PC and not for the very popular Meta portable viewer, by now standard de facto of VR games. It's beautiful out here! Kayak VR: Mirage: The game also features various atmospheric situations, some very exciting, not to mention scary! We love the Quest, don't misunderstand, but it's been a long time now that we haven't seen a virtual reality game capable of surprising even technically. Here, Kayak VR: Mirage, despite being a VR product and developed by only three people, is probably the one with the best graphics since the deadly Half-Life Alyx and Asgard's Wrath. It's not so much a question of polygons, which exist, but of light. Kayak VR is truly masterfully lit: a detail that is anything but marginal and which, together with the immersive effects of the technology used, returns flashes of absolute credibility. Photorealism some would say. The illusion intensifies thanks to the physics of the water and consequently through the reactions of the small boat. For those who suffer from seasickness, Kayak VR: Mirage offers a function practically made on purpose; Needless to say, the best comes when you get rid of any help, and throw your paddle in hand in one of the four proposed settings. The lapping of the waves, the slow rolling of the kayak, the dull noise in contact with unexpected shallows, are just details of an experience that convinces from the very first moment. As with the best VR games, Kayak VR: Mirage doesn't expect much waiting and the first time you launch it, you're in the action within seconds. Action so to speak, given that we will have the first contact with the boat inside a quiet and modest swimming pool. This is the Kayak VR: Mirage tutorial, not that it's really needed but in VR it's always better to have a little anticipation of what you'll experience in the real game, especially if this involves a continuous sense of floating. More than just teaching you how to paddle - is there a need for it? - the introductory pool of the game is used to give you an idea of which aids to activate, thus avoiding ending up a few meters from the shoreline. The first excursion is breath-taking, and we're not exaggerating. The graphics are beautiful, the DLSS support helps the GPUs that need it and the kayak is a pleasure to drive. As you explore, however, the first flaws begin to surface. The first disappointment occurs when you realize that the four different settings, an already small number, will also turn out to be rather small in size. The maps have different hidden paths, animals to discover and interact with, but in two sessions you will get to know them inside out. Also, the stroke lacks precision at times and doesn't interact with the water in all the ways you'd expect, even if you turn on simulation mode. Two controllers and one stick Kayak VR: Mirage: One of the settings will send us between ice and penguins... be careful not to paddle them by mistake! Also, aside from free-roaming and the really fun online race mode, Kayak VR doesn't offer any kind of side content. Small environmental puzzles or more classic collectibles certainly wouldn't have hurt, even if it should be remembered that Kayak VR is a small project, developed by a small team. But it is also true that for years now we have been satisfied with small independent gems, and it is becoming a bit frustrating to never see their potential materialize. Kayak VR: Mirage certainly doesn't have to pay for something that concerns it only marginally: for what it lasts, it is absolutely worth it. The race mode is hilarious because the checkpoints must be forged well, otherwise you will not earn the time bonus, a factor which will then affect the final positioning. The game also features the ability to attach the two controllers to the end of a stick, providing an extra layer of realism.", "date": "2022-08-19", "grade": "7.2"}
