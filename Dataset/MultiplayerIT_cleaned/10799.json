{"name": "Ninja Blade - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-blade-recensione.html", "text": "The ninja is a natural protagonist and anti-hero for video games, there's little you can do about it: the dark image of the fighter par excellence, at least as it has been defined over the centuries and in relatively recent times, makes the ninja an infallible character as strong as it is enigmatic. Dark clothes, assassin techniques and secret identity hardly place him at the center of complex stories, or with overdeveloped personal backgrounds, but the typical characteristics perfectly fulfill the function of representing a relentless war machine, therefore an ideal protagonist on which to build an action video game. The typical figure that has developed in recent years then, devoid of particular characteristics that can be placed exclusively in past times, allows the ninja to be placed within a modern context, thus making him a sort of ideal connection point between the immortal martial techniques of the Japanese antiquity, and the modern setting, with its new, possible threats. Let's face it right away, the bulk of the conceptual work on this type of game is the work of Tecmo with his Ninja Gaiden, with which this From Software title shares more than one feature: from the gameplay, apart from the setting, to the figure of the protagonist himself , Ninja Blade resembles the cousin previously released on Xbox 360 in a rather constant. However, there are also substantial differences between the two titles, starting from the plot up to some characteristics of the play structure. The story narrates the exploits of Ken Ogawa, a taciturn member of the G.U.I.D.E fighting ninja team, a group led by the same father and martial arts master of the protagonist, committed to fighting the spread of a mysterious parasite called ~alpha worm~ among the Japanese population, capable of transforming living beings into deformed and bloodthirsty monsters. The plot mixes horror elements and stylistic elements typical of Japanese B-series sci-fi with genetic apocalypse conspiracy theories, in a trashy meatloaf which, although certainly not memorable, perfectly fulfills its function: to justify an enormous amount of repugnant beings to be killed right among the skyscrapers of downtown Tokyo. There is also a serialized comic that can be consulted online, which provides a sort of background for the story of the game, although the slightly more facetious cut with which the ninja is outlined here tends to clash with the shady characterization of the From Software title and of its protagonist. I flex my muscles and I'm in a vacuum Ninja Blade shows what he's made of already in the first minutes of the game: two short introductory chats to stage the invasion of alpha worms, and immediately we find ourselves launching ourselves from a helicopter flying over Tokyo, falling free-body and at the same time eliminating several waves of monsters in the air through the typical structure of the quick time event, present in large quantities within the game. The description coined ad hoc for this title, ~Cinematic action game~, effectively summarizes what is proposed to us on the screen: the traditional hack and slash-style action phases blend effectively with the large amount of events in quick time, which, according to the God of War school, they allow an interactive approach to what are in effect cutscenes, which thus become an integral part of the gameplay. Pressing the button at the right time, it should be remembered, does not in itself represent a too creative choice in terms of game design, nor exactly fun from a gameplay point of view, rather configuring itself as a necessary filler for those titles that want to bet on cinematic spectacularity, making what happens on the screen interactive in some way, with a basic solution as old as Dragon's Lair. Nonetheless, in Ninja Blade these phases manage to be enjoyable: From Software has managed to artfully implement the simple pressing of keys (or movement of the analog sticks) in time, thanks to a certain logic in the arrangement of the commands within the quick moments time, although much of the merit in the positive experience must be attributed to the great work done by Production I.G. (Patlabor, Ghost in the shell, Xenogears) in the elaboration and direction of the absolutely spectacular cutscenes. Let's be clear, this is an action driven to paroxysm, almost bordering on the ridiculous in some cases, but this is a game that must necessarily be played with a little irony and enjoying the show without being too much criticizing its excesses, otherwise it is impossible to tune into. The use of quick time events allows you to develop fights in ways that would otherwise be impossiblethe normal game dynamics, and propose clashes with enemies of impressive scale: the bosses in particular, although they do not stand out for their design or structural qualities out of the ordinary, are sometimes so huge and destructive as to make the fights against them epic experiences , with memorable peaks, in some cases. Like Ryu, more than Ryu The basic game structure recalls Ninja Gaiden, but is enriched with characteristic additions: between the particular events (free flight sections, boss fights, quick time events), the action is configured in a way not unlike that which characterizes the Tecmo game, but some level design solutions distinguish this title from others. We therefore find ourselves exploring various areas trying to free them from the presence of mutant monsters and at the same time to achieve the objectives that the team's command center submits to us, obviously keeping an eye on the health and Chi levels (the self-energy rechargeable that allows the use of special powers) of the protagonist. The weapons Ken can count on to complete the job, all of which can be improved by investing the blood crystals collected in battle, are three different types of swords (classic katana, twin swords and heavy broadsword) and shurikens, which three different elemental powers can be applied. The arsenal finds particular application not only in combat, where, moreover, the protagonist can do his utmost in the classic combos present here in great abundance, combining heavy, light and jumping attacks, but also in the particular structure of the levels. In fact, although the differences between swords and between the various powers of the shurikens have different effects even in clashes, their specificity is useful in many other cases: the heavy sword, for example, is capable of destroying walls, while the twin swords ( with built-in grappling hook), can be thrown against ledges or particular sections of wall to project the protagonist towards distant points of the scenario. The shuriken can instead be used to put out fires, if charged with the power of the wind, or to cause them if used in conjunction with the fire element, while the lightning reacts destructively on the sections of the scenario invaded by water. Hawk eye The classic ninja moves are added to the whole repertoire of attacks, dodges, parries and combos, which make Ken capable of running up walls, vaulting between protruding holds and moving at great speed, in order to provide different possibilities of approach and interaction with the surrounding environments, through exploration phases that manage to keep concentration high between one devastating combo and another. Guiding the player in the use of Ken's various abilities is ~ninja vision~, which at the cost of an expensive use of Chi, highlights the interactable elements of the scenario, as well as slowing down time for a short time, allowing the protagonist to gain a large advantage in certain sections. The rather constant commitment to which the level design subjects us, given the variety of possible actions and the consequent micro-puzzles in the application of the various skills, although they are always easily solved with the use of the ninja view, help to vary the action and keep a good pace of play, also in light of the poor consistency of the fights, which apart from the sporadic need to vary the weapon according to the type of enemy, hardly put the player to the test too much, mostly requiring the frantic pressure of attack keys without too much strategic depth. In this sense, we are far from the tactics that characterize the fights of the ~cousin~ Ryu Hayabusa. Mysteriously inserted between the levels there are also shooter sections in which we find ourselves strafing (or shelling) enemies while aboard an armored vehicle, strange diversions a bit without rhyme or reason, which frankly are not very convincing. A ninja show The cinematic spectacularity of the game is clearly based on the graphic structure, supported by a respectable polygonal calculation and covered with decidedly appreciable special effects and textures, and above all by excellent animations which, resulting in the ultra-spectacular interactive cutscenes (right in excessive but positive sense of the term) support the game almost by themselves. Making the protagonist move and launching deadly combos and triggering quick time events become a compact whole that manages to make up for the lack of thickness of normal fights, up to the culmination of the action concentrated in the clashes with the giganticboss. Too bad that all this is not supported by an equally brilliant artistic direction: the variety of enemies is extremely small, as well as that of the settings. In various situations there is a real recycling of structures and elements of the scenario, so much so that the 9 levels of which the game consists practically contain only two or three main variants as regards the environments, which are not too suggestive, apart from some impressive glimpses of the Japanese metropolis. It is the charisma that is largely lacking in this Ninja Blade, based as it is entirely on an extremely trashy horror characterization which in some cases is even too grotesque and in bad taste, in an alternation of valuable things (the bosses and the first levels) to other decidedly botched ones (the shooter-style parts, for example). Nonetheless, as mentioned, the excellent construction and direction of Production IG's cutscenes and the enormous scale of some enemies - of which the final battle represents the apotheosis - are imprinted well in the memory, and the party of blows and explosions pleasantly stuns, and constantly, the player. Good music and functional effects, interspersed with cheesy dialogues to say the least, but on the other hand in line with the context, make up the audio sector. Comment Excessive and arrogant, Ken Ogawa presents himself in the videogame panorama as a sort of ignorantly ~badass~ cousin of Ryu Hayabusa, and surprisingly manages to constitute an alternative to Ninja Gaiden. The low technical depth of the fights favors a confusing approach to enemies, but the alternative application of weapons as active elements for level design purposes represents a good accompaniment to the action. It is in the fight with the bosses that Ninja Blade demonstrates all its spectacularity, assisted by the quick time events which, while remaining solutions of little playful value, here rise to a particular homogeneity with the gameplay. Despite the admirable attempt to deepen the interaction with the scenarios, there is more form than substance in this From Software product, and the questionable characterization of environments and enemies does not play in its favor, as does the relative simplicity and somewhat longevity scarce. Still, the game is fun, and it's easy to find satisfaction in executing spectacular combos and challenges posed by some of the most impressive bosses seen in recent times.Pro Enjoyable fights The boss fights are spectacular Appreciable the different application of weapons Against The constant use of quick time events may not please Very simplistic ~normal~ fights Unconvincing scenario and enemy design Xbox 360 goals Ninja Blade contains 50 unlockable achievements for the usual 1000 points. The completion of the game at the normal level, including those achievements that are necessarily unlocked by reaching certain performances and the simple progression between levels, allows the collection of around 500 points, which are not a few. To go beyond these, a little more effort is required, selecting higher difficulty levels, obtaining maximum ratings and making particular performances for each of the 9 levels, among other things.", "date": "2009-03-23", "grade": null}
