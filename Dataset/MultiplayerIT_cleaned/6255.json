The fact is that Natsume, developer and publisher of this Lost Valley, until yesterday did nothing but locate and produce a series for western territories that was Marvelous Entertainment's bag of flour in the Japanese homeland. However, the latter has created its own division in charge of localizations, Xseed Games. Twist: Western rights to the name ~Harvest Moon~, for a number of legal issues that we are unaware of and would not understand in any case, remain with Natsume. What would you do then in their shoes? Would you receive these rights to the parent company with big bucks? Never be! You would put your heart and soul into developing a new game, calling it Harvest Moon, whereas the ~true~ latest Harvest Moon in the West is known as Story of Seasons. Isn't everything beautifully clear and straightforward? No? How much will we want to bring the Lost Valley back to life? Here is the review of the new Harvest Moon! It can't snow forever This intricate premise is not only to provide historical background and fill in some space, but is a must in trying to understand a whole host of features of Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley. A team that as a developer is relatively novice, which is particularly linked to western territories and which is faced with the need to operate a sort of reboot of a series that is not very well known, but strongly loved by a large hard core of fans, constitutes a valid explanation for all the aspects we are about to dissect. Starting from the fact that here there is a plot to justify our agricultural prowess: after choosing the gender and name of the avatar, we will see him wandering apparently aimlessly through a desolate land oppressed by a heavy snowstorm. Not the most suitable place to stop, but the meeting with a Harvest Sprite who tells him the story of that land, pushes him not only to make a stop, but to settle down in a small mountain refuge nearby. In fact, it seems that that region was once rich and prosperous, but the recent disappearance of the Goddess of the Harvest who normally resided there has condemned it to a perpetual winter. Only by challenging the elements and giving new life to the ground lying under the snow through the most varied crops will the other Sprites and the Goddess regain their strength, and spring will return to the Lost Valley. In reality, rather than a plot, one should speak of a narrative premise, since, before a long series of a sort of ~I wish but I can't~ or, if you prefer, of broken promises, the story never breaks down into something more of a series of trivial requests from the various NPCs, and the albeit interesting beginning in pure jRPG style will not give rise to events of any complexity. Another difference with the classic formula of the Harvest Moons is that here you are immediately immersed in the heart of the action, and that is in cultivation. The steps are more or less the same as always, with the exception of the first which consists in shoveling the accumulated snow, i.e. plowing, sowing, watering, optionally using a fertilizer and so on for several days until the harvest of the plant is ready to be preserved, cooked or sold to the shopkeeper, an often preferable option given that to get the raw materials you will need to have money available, of which you are completely lacking at the beginning. The interface, which automatically recognizes the action to be performed on a square avoiding all the rigmarole of the various menus to scroll typical of the saga, makes the action fluid, intuitive and fast, and is without a doubt one of the most successful aspects. but on the other hand the animations of all these actions are long and slow, they waste precious time which flows inexorably, and in the long run - consider that theoretically your goal is to have a very large part of the territory devoted to various crops - make this phase, where you will spend most of the experience, really boring and, pardon the pun, sterile. The 3D effect Except for very few moments during the game, stereoscopy is completely absent. We frankly ignore why - one of the few strengths of the whole is precisely the frame rate and even if 3D had affected it, it wouldn't have been a very serious problem - but the lack fits well in the context of a title that it cannot be defined as poorly cared for, but which certainly does not go all the way in any of the paths taken. harvestcraft All other activities (fishing, farming, mineral extraction) also seemThey were decidedly less attractive than in the past, simple and intuitive yes, but limited, repetitive. Then a doubt arises: could it be that all the typical characteristics of a Harvest Moon have been deliberately made milder by Natsume to distinguish themselves from the Marvelous games and at the same time give prominence to the big news? Oh yes, because the Lost Valley is a place that can be modified at will: right from the start you can act on the terrain, which has various altitude jumps, dig or raise the ground level, create channels in order to bring water to your crops, cut down trees, and further on you can build bridges and various buildings and structures. This too happens in a very intuitive way, in a clear attempt to bring the dynamics of Minecraft into the series. It is a pity however that, with the exception of a few things, all these actions have a purely aesthetic value and nothing more: it is certainly fun to spend a few minutes ~terraforming~ the surroundings at will, but then when you don't see the meaning, also seen as the internal clock ticks, soon you stop and you focus only on what you actually need, such as bridges or some channels that will undoubtedly improve production. A sort of curse that affects the entire production: highlights dear to the fans, such as the relationships with the NPCs, have remained, but very much in rose water. The interaction with the characters is limited to exchanging a chat and occasionally responding to requests, over time an affinity is built and in the end you choose your life partner, that's all. And the characteristic village/hub has also disappeared: now everyone will be stationed in front of the refuge at certain times in a completely unnatural way, removing any incentive to explore, also because there is practically nothing that can be explored. In short, The Lost Valley leaves an unpleasant feeling of emptiness, of little sense, which is something different from a certain slowness and repetitiveness that was found in the classic saga and which, however, seen in context, had their own meaning. And we can do the same for the aesthetic/technical department as well. The style used does nothing to distinguish itself from myriads of other jRPGs, the graphics have no particular point, except for a certain cleanliness and an always remarkable fluidity. The music is exactly what one might expect and moreover they are very few, becoming repetitive very soon, and, to finish with the good news, localization in Italian not even talking about it.", "date": "2015-06-19", "grade": "4.5"}
