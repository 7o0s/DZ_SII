However, this has not yet happened: in fact, tower defense still comes out galore and if many are in reality simple sequels to famous titles that have little or nothing innovative, others, such as Kingdom Rush, despite being part of the traditional Fantasy genre, manage to bring into tested game mechanics a breath of novelty and freshness, naturally without revolutions of any kind. In fact, nothing that underlies a similar game has essentially ever changed over time: the towers remain, the various waves of enemies and the upgrades remain; where there is still room for action is, fortunately, the more tactical aspect of the game. A handful of fighters Sinking with both hands from the Fantasy genre, Kingdom Rush offers all the typical sampling of defenses available: archers in the first place but then barracks for soldiers, heavy artillery and the inevitable wizards. In support of ordinary units, it is possible to call on local farmers, armed with pitchforks, as temporary reinforcement, and a storm of burning meteorites, really useful in the most demanding circumstances. If so far nothing new appears on the horizon, the different approach chosen in facing battles is immediately noticeable once you enter the action. In fact, the troops supplied have the particularity of not having an exceptional rate of fire, on the contrary: at least initially, the damage of the archers and soldiers will in fact be really mild also because the number of single units that make up the turrets is very low (respectively only two and three men). These numerical limitations force us to face the hordes of invaders in a new way for a tower defense: no longer the fight in the open field, based on quantity, but a sort of strategic guerrilla structured to create gorges and traps in which to close the enemies , also with the help of the particular conformation of the maps. A simple squad of three men (albeit replaced a few seconds after their death) certainly cannot compete with dozens and dozens of opponents of the same or even higher level; however, if properly equipped and positioned correctly, they can slow down their maneuver and allow archers, mages or artillery to hit them with a deadly barrage of arrows, spells or projectiles. As you progress through the campaign, your enemies will also become more and more resistant: orcs, goblins, demons, black wolves, polar bears and even terrible Cave trolls will equip themselves with ever thicker armor, less vulnerable to normal attacks; in that case the wizard, with his specific powers aimed at destroying the armor, proves to be a very important weapon. Unit upgrades are also fundamental in Kingdom Rush: wasting resources (which are obtained automatically after each enemy death) to upgrade useless or ineffective towers with that specific attack could compromise the success of the game. Soldier upgrades include various levels of armor, down to the last rank that transforms them into Paladins; archers, on the other hand, increase accuracy and range, as do the mage and bombard. Once fully upgraded, all troops can take advantage of some skills of their choice (for example, archers have the ability to launch poisoned arrows at a shorter range or flaming arrows but reducing the frequency), all in any case always very well balanced. In fact, there is no unit that is much stronger than the others: everything appears in balance and most of the credit in the event of victory goes to the correct original positioning chosen by the player, given that with the strength of the troops alone it is practically impossible to recover a strategy. In this regard, there should be a commendation to the brave infantry soldiers: as mentioned, their presence is limited to acting as a slowdown to the various hordes of enemies, which almost always happens by sacrificing the entire team and thus behaving like a sort of heroic kamikaze. All fighter skills, including farmers and support meteors, take advantage of a dedicated permanent upgrade menu, a grid of upgrades unlockable through points earned at the end of a winning session. A better performance therefore corresponds to more experience points, to be spent as desired in the grid. The cartoon-style graphic impact is also very positive, with animations that offer some fun treats (in a lifleece with tunnels you will notice for example the walls of the cave shine in the light of the torches just before seeing the enemies appear) but in general the level design and the interface are pleasant and intuitive. However, the general longevity of the Armor Games title deserves a few words: 53 Game Center objectives and the possibility of tackling the missions by increasing the difficulty level or inserting handicaps, such as the reduction of tolerance to surviving enemies or the type of troops to be used, make the theoretically very long adventure, provided you have a huge passion for the genre.
