With Mass Transit, the major DLCs published for Colossal Order's city management system have reached four, without counting the countless aesthetic packages published as a side dish. As the title makes clear, one of the most critical points of the entire game has finally been addressed, that of mass transport, which in the basic version offers insufficient options compared to the needs that arise when a city has grown in size. It must be said that there are several highly valuable amateur mods that have tried to patch up the entire system, mostly succeeding, but finally seeing an official solution, albeit for a fee, is in more than a comforting sense. Of course, surely for some it will be a late intervention, but a detail of no small importance must be added to understand the goodness of the whole operation: the guys from Colossal Order have never lacked support and updates for Cities: Skylines, despite the production of supplemental content. They even made sure that Mass Transit is as mod friendly as possible, i.e. that installing it does not conflict with the additions downloaded from the Steam Workshop. Which then, on closer inspection, the previous expansions still offered very valid supplementary contents (only After Dark was a bit subdued) capable of greatly enriching the gaming experience. In short, it is really difficult to find something to complain about the behavior of developers in relation to product management. Odds Is Mass Transit the definitive DLC for Cities: Skylines? Can we finally take the bus? Traveling around the city Unlike what happened with Afer Dark, Snowfall and Natural Disaster, Mass Transit is a purely structural DLC. Of course, it also adds various buildings and infrastructure, but its core lies in the innovations it introduces in the interface and management of the transport system. As a result, don't expect anything spectacular like a meteor shower or a snowstorm. At most you will find a fantastic monorail to run along the whole city, or ferries with which to exploit the waterways to lighten the road traffic. Nothing too pushy from an aesthetic point of view, however. It matters little, because the beauty of Mass Transit is in adding a further level of complexity to the management part, with a simultaneous lightening of the cumbersomeness of the construction interface, much improved even in the functions that do not directly concern the design of railway routes and similar. The objective, perfectly achieved, is to equip virtual mayors with the necessary tools to grow their cities in harmony with public transport. The key buildings introduced by the DLC are the hub terminals, i.e. the large junction stations that allow you to connect the entire transport network, making it organic to the city fabric in a certain sense. The system is so well done that it makes you want to rebuild a city from scratch just to make the most of the hubs (there are scenarios set up too, but as usual it's best to do it yourself). But what are they for, you might be wondering? Well, if you've ever traveled, you'll know that there are some stations where, once you get off a vehicle, such as a train, you find other types of vehicles to take to reach your destination, such as buses. Mass Transit hubs allow you to connect all kinds of means of transport: imagine your virtual citizens getting off the monorail train at the station and from there they can take a ferry that takes them to another hub, where they will finally find the bus that will take them will take home. The more you practice with the system, the more you understand its versatility and power, as well as the benefits for the entire city. In fact, a good transport network significantly reduces traffic, improving pollution and increasing the quality of life of citizens... as well as the income in the town hall deriving from the sale of tickets. Of course, it is still possible to place individual stops for each transport system. Indeed, it is virtuous to do it by studying the best routes to try to cover all areas. From this point of view, the innovations introduced in the interface, which we mentioned above, come in handy, making it easier to design the entire city thanks to an integrated guide system (if you've ever opened any program for making graphics, you know what let's talk), which avoids mistakes and clarifies by eye what you are doing, removing some obstacles in the waywhen necessary. Other contents and conclusions The result of so much work is that now dealing with transport is no longer a sacrifice, but fun, because finally you feel that the system rewards your commitment in the right way, clearly showing the positive effects of our work. Seeing substantial reductions in traffic, with crossroads finally breathing again and with citizens going disciplined to take the public transport that we have made available to them, is really pleasant and makes the city in a certain sense more alive and responsive to our solicitations (then you can always destroy it with the additions of Natural Diasters... but that, as they say, is another story). Creating a good transport network still takes time and a lot of funds, but in this case both are well spent. Then, if you like, there is also the entirely aesthetic satisfaction of seeing the spectacular monorail running silently between the buildings... not bad glimpses come out of it. Among the other additions of Mass Transit stand out the new roads, such as the asymmetrical one with two lanes going in one direction, and a third in the other; new policies, such as that of educational messages; the possibility of renaming the streets as you wish and of modifying the road markings, in order to be able to work in more detail on specific traffic problems, without having to revolutionize entire neighbourhoods. To conclude, in our opinion Mass Transit is an essential DLC if you love Cities: Skylines, much more than the others already published, because it acts directly on the concept of the game, namely that of being mayors, giving us new, powerful tools to realize our vision. Perhaps it has a less disruptive initial impact than that of Natural Disasters, and certainly the additions are less spectacular than those of After Dark and Snowfall, but in the long run it is the DLC that makes the most and the only one that you would really miss in the event you came back to try the ~vanilla~ game.", "date": "2017-05-23", "grade": null}
