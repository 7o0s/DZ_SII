Lo Scrittore, or The Writer, if you prefer, closes the narrative circle opened with The Signal, and does so in about ninety minutes, at a cost of 560 Microsoft Points, a figure that is not very high (about 7 euros), but which could annoy many for the /minutes of game ratio. The new adventure begins precisely where it ended in the previous extra chapter, with Alan Wake now locked up in the Dark Place, a sort of mental prison that he himself created, and which he shapes as the game progresses. We don't want to go further in describing the plot, the hour and a half (or a little more if you want to look for all the collectibles scattered around the map) is full of suggestions and great moments, but it is enough simply to say that the whole world of Alan comes brought into play, the line between friend and foe blurs, as does the line between real and unreal. Xbox 360 goals The Writer rewards the player with 250 points related to 9 objectives. They are all related to the progression in the game of course, but some are quite demanding, in fact they ask us to overcome some sections without firing a shot or without being injured or finish the DLC without ever dying. the Creator I The best part of the game, going beyond the narrative closure, is the setting. Remedy has done a great job of staging a distorted and shaky setting, which is the perfect materialization of Alan's mind teetering on the precipice of madness (or renunciation). It is no coincidence that verticality, the abyss, the absence of a fixed point where to put one's feet in relative tranquility is the leit motif of this expansion. The bridges, the real iron ones, are destroyed and fall apart, others are built over black abysses only thanks to our imagination, the hills crumble, or are so steep that we slip, even the prison of the mind is synthesized in an enormous spinning hamster wheel, in short everything is played on the binomial fall/rise, on how our desire to leave the dark place changes the environment. In fact, the Writer often makes use of the possibility, by illuminating some words, of interacting with the world, which translates both into small environmental puzzles, such as the already mentioned bridge over the abyss, or, as it frequently happens, of making objects explode or burn to help us on our way to the cottage. We will be able to get busy with the explosive barrels which roll realistically if the surface is not flat, to make the fight with the enemies a little more lively, or have fun with the fireworks. More generally Remedy in this hour and a half has done a truly exceptional job in trying to vary the pace as much as possible, nailing one after the other the various parts of Alan's mind, gradually more and more twisted and bizarre, almost disturbing we could to say. Speaking of action, The Writer is certainly not a difficult game, rifle and pistol ammunition abound, only a couple of times it risked a premature demise, more for camera reasons than anything else. However, it must be said that in the game economy the fights are certainly not the most important aspect of this second DLC, even if to be honest there are a couple of good moments, the breakneck race in the final stages is a good example. The lion's share in The Writer is the atmosphere, our desire to get lost in Alan's mind, and be surprised at each new setting, nothing new as the Dark Place lives on the mixture of memories of the protagonist, but the whole it is so painstakingly spun and reconstructed that it is breathtaking. The atmosphere is therefore the real strength of the game, also corroborated by a pace of events which, given the duration, does not give way to any moment of tiredness. Ultimately The Writer is undoubtedly worth the ticket price despite its short duration. What matters is that the quality of these ninety minutes is very high, a sort of hyper-compressed Bignami (and without unnecessary delays) of what we played in the full title.", "date": "2010-10-22", "grade": "8.0"}
