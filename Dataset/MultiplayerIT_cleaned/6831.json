The video of Lyner inserting the Life Extending Agent into Aurica's body is the first one found by searching for an innocent ~Ar tonelico scene~ on YouTube, which says a lot: not the ending, not the introduction, but a crucial sequence for its ambiguity. And it's a shame, because among the Japanese RPG clichs and the aforementioned allusions there was a really valid title that in Japan - but also in the West - has carved out a small niche of admirers. The series continued in 2007 and 2010 with two sequels, both localized in English, but at that point the intentions of Gust, the developer, became more difficult to interpret: the next Ciel nosurge, a visual novel for PlayStation Vita never released outside Japan, it turned out to be a prequel set in the same universe as Ar tonelico, and this Ar nosurge is, in turn, a sequel to Ciel nosurge and a prequel to Ar tonelico. Confused? Well, we're just getting started. Ar nosurge is certainly not a masterpiece, but it is a decidedly original and alluring jRPG The power of songs Anyone who has played at least one of the three Ar tonelicos will know that music and songs play a decisive role in the mythology of this bizarre universe that mixes fantasy and sci-fi in a very rich mosaic. It is a pity, therefore, that without having played Ciel nosurge - or having syruped a summary on some fansite - you understand very little of the plot, especially in the first hours of the game. Ar nosurge is in fact a direct sequel to the visual novel for PlayStation Vita, and the script makes no secret of it: in certain moments it really seems that pieces of the plot have been lost along the way, and in fact it is true, especially as regards some characters which, having been presented and developed in the portable title, are taken for granted in Ar nosurge. From this point of view, Koei Tecmo's choice to localize a game like this seems quite questionable, but once you get past the game's long introduction and familiarize yourself with the characters, you begin to get an idea of their roles and what's at stake. game. Ar nosurge, among other things, proposes a rather particular setting: the plot follows the vicissitudes of two pairs of characters, alternating their points of view. The first couple is made up of Delta and Casty, who will be busy finding a software (or rather, a song) that is causing a lot of headaches to the upper echelons of the organization for which Delta works. The second couple, however, is formed by the protagonist of Ciel nosurge, Ion, and his bodyguard, the robotic Earthes. The paths of these characters will cross several times and they will question the mythology, religion and politics of the planet Ra Ciela. There will be twists and turns, especially towards the end of the adventure, but we will have to deal with three problems in particular. The first concerns the localization of the game, in a barely passable school English, which makes some passages of the plot rather obscure. The second problem is the absurdity of certain situations. Fans of Japanese cartoons could easily think of anime like Gurren Lagann on more than one occasion, too bad Arnosurge takes itself too seriously and the writers resort to ~songs~ as a real deus ex machina with annoying frequency. Finally, the third problem concerns precisely the ambiguities and allusions, which in certain moments elicit a smile but, at the same time, excessively ridicule a story that is already struggling to take off on its own. Fortunately, Ar nosurge has an enormous advantage that somehow manages to reverse the negativity of some passages of the screenplay or the poverty of the graphics, excellent as regards the models of the characters and poor for everything else: let's talk about the soundtrack by Daisuke Achiwa and Kazuki Yanagawa which, in a game so focused on music, is indeed portentous, full of epic and orchestral pieces of great impact. Playstation 3 trophies It's not very difficult to collect the twenty-six Arnosurge trophies, but you have to be careful because you risk missing a bronze and a silver trophy that can only be unlocked in another game. It's the usual jRPG story: complete the story, fight well and discover every secret to get the coveted platinum trophy. The sound of slaps Ar nosurge does not miss anything from traditional jRPGs, starting with a system of manufacturing objects that is very reminiscent of that of the three Artonelicos, but introduces a method  lavisual novel already proposed in the original trilogy and a really fun and ingenious, but also quite complicated combat system. As far as the latter is concerned, Ar nosurge stands out from many other jRPGs with random encounters already in the way they are proposed during exploration: an indicator, in fact, will suggest how soon we will be attacked by the enemy, allowing us to prepare properly . Once combat is triggered, the scenario becomes that of a typical battlefield with the heroes (Delta and Casty or Earthes and Ion) on one side and the enemies on the other. The clash takes place a bit in turns and a bit in real time: when it's the player's turn, you act on the controller keys to attack the enemies with real combos as long as the appropriate resources allow; when it's the enemy's turn, however, you have to press the keys at the right time to mitigate the damage inflicted by the attacks that will always and only focus on Ion or Casty. Their ~guardian~, in fact, cannot be hit and his role will be to defend his partner so that she can concentrate on preparing the song chosen at the beginning of the battle. It all may seem simple enough, but there is an avalanche of parameters to take into account and which makes the battles extremely strategic. To begin with, the player has a limit of turns to defeat the enemy, after which the battle ends and you return to the map: this happens because the enemies will attack the heroes all together and in a single fight, with a little skills, it is possible to wipe them all out in order to freely explore the setting without fear of being interrupted. Strategy possible, however, only if you use the right combos and skills, saving or extending the shifts, and if you manage to channel the song of Casty or Ion so that it can tear apart as many enemies as possible in one go. Ar nosurge's combat system is actually quite intricate, and requires some practice to fully enjoy, but it's one of the most ingenious we've played in recent times. Thanks to it, therefore, the explorations and the long cutscenes find a raison d'etre, but we also have to deal with the integrated ~visual novel~, which cannot be avoided both for script reasons and for practical issues , as it's one of the ways characters are upgraded and new skills are unlocked. In practice, it is possible to dive into the psyche of some characters and come to terms with their secrets by reading countless lines of text and possibly selecting an answer or reaction. The ~Genometry~ will remind Artonelico fans of the Dive system, and in fact it is a revised and corrected version of it, but no less boring: although it is optional in part, the need to deal with this mini visual novel breaks the rhythm of the adventure and it will especially appeal to lovers of psychological and character insights. And there wouldn't be anything wrong if most of Ar nosurge's characters weren't real stereotypical specks...", "date": "2014-10-16", "grade": "7.0"}
