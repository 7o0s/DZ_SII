This time however, unlike what happened with Generations, it is a real main episode, which continues with the narration and above all brings back to the screen some of the innovations implemented with the second title of the saga, not without several novelties of undoubted value . And also in this case the same recommendation that the writer felt compelled to make on the occasion of past reviews is valid. If you are a true fan of Naruto it is practically useless to spend time reading our evaluation article: the game will fully satisfy you and you will not regret the purchase even for a moment. If, on the other hand, you remained doubtful in front of the latest works of the Japanese developer based on the manga, then go ahead because there is no shortage of news and perhaps some new game element could stimulate your curiosity and transform it into a propensity to buy. Where were we? Before going into the heart of the evaluation, it is necessary to start from the story narrated in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. In this case the developer was particularly precise by picking up the threads of the speech exactly where they were left at the end of the second chapter. The fight with Pain is now history, the leaf village is being reconstructed and in the prologue of the game we witness the memory of the historic attack by the nine-tailed fox, with the consequent revelation of the involvement of Minato, in the dual role of Fourth Hokage and father of Naruto, and Madara Uchiha still hidden behind the mask of Tobi. From here on it will be a succession of long cinematic sequences, at times endless, which will make us relive all the events of the manga (or anime to be even more precise) up to much of the Fourth Ninja War. Not being completed yet even in the paper publication edited by Masashi Kishimoto in the first person, it is natural that the developer had to stop before his epilogue and, while avoiding falling into spoilers, it seems obligatory to point out that, once the campaign is completed , you will feel anything but satisfied, missing some of the key moments of the great war. At the same time, however, it is not possible in any way to complain about the longevity of the gaming experience, given that to complete the ten chapters that make up Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 plus the prologue and the epilogue, it took us a little less of 18 hours, witnessing all the dialogues and repeating the most difficult battles on very few occasions, without however engaging in the spasmodic search for all the available collectibles. CyberConnect2 worked heavily on the narrative, telling this portion of Naruto's story in a variety of ways. The vast majority of the interlude scenes are in fact completely non-interactive, they are made with the game engine and literally retrace what was seen in the anime. Then there are small ~historical~ clips from the series, recreated for the occasion with an astute sepia filter and which tend to synthesize iconic moments from the comics through an often unedited direction. Sometimes these ~secret~ fragments are revealed in the course of a fight, when certain requirements are met or by eliminating the opponent with an ultimate technique. As if this weren't enough, there are also the narrative phases directly interconnected with the exploratory moments. In fact, completely leaving aside what we saw in Generations, the ~free~ exploration sequences return in this third Ultimate Ninja Storm where we will be able to control the main protagonists of the manga, but above all the triptych composed of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke, to advance through fixed screens, conversing with on-screen characters and making small buying and selling actions with available vendors. Once again, however, these sections are the most sparse, absolutely useless in their purpose of entertaining the player and above all devoid of a variety that could justify their succession during the plot. Sometimes they last a few screens and almost seem to be radio-controlled by events, in other moments they seem like a mere pretext to give the player the opportunity to stock up on items and bento before facing another series of clashes but they continue in all cases to remain the component of the less successful and certainly more marginal series. If we want to be picky, we also feel like criticizingthe developer's choice of make the individual dialogues that make up the cutscenes unskipable. In fact, outside of the adventure phases, where it is possible to speed up the texts of the characters who speak, on all other occasions we will be forced to put up with every single question and answer between the characters with all the pauses relating to acting and the inevitable dead moments that seek to create pathos and which are characteristic of all anime of Japanese origin. The only possibility that is offered to the player is to skip the entire cutscene en bloc, a drastic option that distorts the quality of Naruto's narrative plot. But the consequence is that sometimes you will find yourself watching very long films made perhaps of sighs and moans of pain. And then it comes to beating hands Obviously the central part of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is always and in any case represented by the fights: one-on-one fights, with sometimes a small team to act as support, inside closed arenas where the technique and the skill with the pads leave room for choreographed combos and astonishing special attacks that can be activated with the press of a single key or so. Those who have played the previous UNS know what we are talking about and for this reason we prefer to focus on the innovations brought to the gameplay by CyberConnect2. Let's start right from the support team: as per the tradition of the series, the main fighter can be joined by two other characters who can enter the battlefield for a few seconds by pressing the two back buttons. Based on the type of ninja (of attack, defense or support) the type of intervention will change but compared to the past this time the fighters will have their own energy, divided into small notches and which, once finished as a result of attacks suffered during their brief entry into the field will make them no longer usable for the rest of the round. Furthermore, by holding down the attack button for a few seconds, it will be possible to recall the team to perform manual and synchronized combos and therefore no longer limit themselves only to their unmanageable descent into the field for a few seconds. Finally, support-type ninjas can also be summoned to become the victim of supreme and simple techniques instead of the main character and also to avoid being thrown out of the ring. In fact, in this Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 the ring out has been introduced, or the possibility in some arenas (very few to be honest) of being launched outside the combat perimeter with consequent immediate defeat. Even the substitution technique has received a tweak requested on several occasions by fans: now it will be possible to activate it by pressing the left backbone (while the right one is reserved for the classic parry) but its use is limited in quantity given that based on the fight it will be possible to use it 4-6 times in a row, so you will have to wait for the on-screen indicator to reload before being able to do it again. The last change sensitive to the gameplay of the fights concerns the state of awakening now no longer linked to specific moments of the plot and above all no longer usable only when the energy is running out but can be activated at any time, simply by prolonging the recharge of the chakra beyond the limit highlighted by the indicator. However, there is a downside: once its effect is over, you will find yourself with a maximum amount of available chakra reduced to the bone and practically at the mercy of your opponent's attacks. We also appreciated the return of the choreographic and engaging quick time event sequences that populated the first chapters of the series and which are now back in all their glory, thanks to the further increase in experience that CyberConnect2 has been able to accumulate thanks to the work done with Asura's Wrath. Too bad instead for the sparse combat sequences against the Nine-Tails and against another couple of enemies of considerable power: even if they manage to represent a nice variation on the theme, they end up in an even more extreme button mashing and with maniacal timing resulting soon cloying. Unfortunately, we feel like saying the same of the short musou sequences where in the role of a certain character we find ourselves facing a series of enemies of minimal power during some adventure sequences. Also in this case we can appreciate the developer's effort to give variety to a gameplay structure that has been static for too long but we must necessarily criticize its implementation. Xbox 360 goals The game offers the usual 50 goals for a total of mthe points. The more substantial ones allow you to pocket 100 gpoints by obtaining the S rank, the maximum, in all boss battles, looking at all the secret factors and carrying out all the hidden actions. Then there are various 60-point objectives related to collectibles scattered throughout the game world and there are numerous prizes that are unlocked simply by continuing with the story by obtaining good results. After completing the game it will be easy enough to have collected at least 60% of the achievements. But that is not all... ...because the developer, always pursuing the ideal of variety and with the specific aim of increasing replayability, has also seen fit to implement a sort of choice path for the player. In fact, on the occasion of topical moments in the Naruto plot, we will be given the opportunity to make a final decision between two possible approaches to the battle. In practice it is a question of choosing between two paths called Legend and Hero and which determine on the one hand the degree of difficulty of the following battle and on the other hand also real additional sections such as for example the musou phases or combat alterations as possible available allies or attack and defense bonuses. Also in this case we can appreciate CyberConnect2's ability to implement new elements on a game structure that has been fossilized for too long; it is a pity, however, that the initial promises of different epilogues and real changes to Naruto's narrative plot have actually been disregarded. In fact, these final decisions are limited to raising the player's Legend and Hero levels which give access to two different customizable inventories before each battle and which can then be recalled in battle with the digital cross. The player is only left with the choice of which inventory to bring into battle and consequently how to act on the degree of difficulty since if you select the Legend one you will be forced to take advantage of only the classic ninja tools represented by kunai, bomb cards and so on. while opting for the Hero inventory it will also be possible to bring into battle the ointments capable of restoring energy and chakra during a battle. We close the disquisition on the gameplay with some information regarding the other game modes present in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. Alongside the single player campaign, unquestionably the highlight of the entire offer, we find free clashes and online battles, as well as a collection hub for all the collectibles scattered around the game world or purchasable in the Bandai emporium in the leaf village. The two modes just mentioned share the same huge roster of characters who, fortunately, can be fully unlocked even without facing the single player adventure but simply by continuing to challenge other players. It's about 80 characters but unfortunately all that glitters is not gold. First of all, many slots are occupied by the same ninja in different versions as in the case of Tobi / Madara or Naruto in its evolutions, others can only be used as team support members, and above all there are very heavy absences such as the Kage or the Seven Swordsmen. In short, Namco Bandai's willingness to push hard on the DLCs that will probably invade the market in the coming weeks is clearly evident. The selection of arenas, on the other hand, is very good: there are 40 in total and they offer a variety of situations that are certainly above average. As for the online modes, we find the classic ranked and non-ranked matches, and the tournament between multiple challengers. In short, nothing new under the sun, but if nothing else, a further improvement of the netcode can be noticed which, during our review with open and averagely populated servers, was impeccable and practically lag-free. Obviously we cannot say the same about the balancing problems that have always plagued the series but it is now quite easy to identify the most unbalanced fighters who, as usual, always have one or two challengers able to stand up to them. It's just a matter of practicing and discovering the Chinese paper system that binds the fighters together. But is it a cartoon or a game? It's hard not to risk repeating yourself when it comes to the technical aspect of this new Ultimate Ninja Storm. The work done by CyberConnect2 in terms of cel shading rendering and ability to bring the choreographic power of Naruto's fights and their intensity back to the screen is absolutely perfect. The colors are vivid, the direction seems to be handled by Masashi Kishimoto himself and more generally it is hard to understand which pieces are taken from the whole anime and which are", "date": "2013-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
