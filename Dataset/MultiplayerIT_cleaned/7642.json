The first episode, reviewed not even a year ago, had covered a good chunk of Luffy's seafaring adventures in a more than decent way, leaving for a possible sequel the crumbs of a narrative that Eiichiro Ora has recently paused, thanks to a slight illness that forced him into the hospital. When tie-ins based on works in progress are proposed, the spectrum of parallel tracks runs mercilessly, making it difficult to manage the decidedly bland release rhythms of the ~tankobons~ and merge them with the ravenous trend of churning out videogame chapters after chapters that quickly reach author's pencil. If all this is combined with the use of a gameplay model such as Musou, visibly archaic but expertly refreshed in the first chapter of the saga at the end of 2012, the result of a sequel risks disappointing, given the brand mentioned, the rightly calibrated expectations upward. Omega Force chooses a new, unexplored, curious but courageous path as it is completely unrelated to the manga narrative. The fearful supervision of Oda in the relationships between characters promises a basic coherence in the management of relationships, dialogues and alliances; to be created is a watershed between purists and lovers of experimentation, which inevitably places One Piece Pirate Warriors 2 in its own niche that is difficult to catalog. But what is the final result? The story that doesn't exist It's called Dream Story: the plot of One Piece Pirate Warriors 2 is created ad hoc for this Namco title and is completely untied from the timeline, events and characters that rage in the comic. Mind you, the cast is always the same, an endless and fabulous list of pirates and marines made famous by the pages of Oda; simply, here they are mixed in an anomalous way, with a pretext that fearlessly abstracts from what fans have come to appreciate and love over the years. It all revolves around a deadly weapon that turns almost all of Luffy's crew into enemies, with alliances on opposite sides between pirates and marines as a backdrop to the story. We have to say it openly: if Namco plans to give life to its brand by continuing to offer stories that are totally invented and difficult for manga readers to digest, Pirate Warriors' legs now appear shorter than ever. The invented plot is not to be completely discarded, mind you: there are interesting ideas, it intrigues to learn more and discover the steps that lead to the epilogue. What can hardly break through the heart of a fan is knowing that the entirety of what is played is completely non-existent in the Oda universe. It is not a little jarring to be aware that the narrative, combat and advancement bases on which the narrative is based begin and end with the video game and have nothing to do with the One Piece published on Shonen Jump. It is a principle for purists, yet it is precisely that principle that puts the limits on a possible, and dangerous, opening to boundless invented stories that have little of One Piece if not the characters and settings and which, given the forcing, leads primarily wondering why propose them. The first episode of Pirate Warriors had the advantage of starting the saga and carrying it forward without too many upheavals which, although obviously present as dictated by the play structure, did not appear forced but consistent with the manga storyline. This time Omega Force takes up the experiments so dear to the ~What if...~ principle already adopted in Kenshiro's tie-in and bases the whole episode on it. The pretext for visibly increasing the cast of playable characters is ambitious, but the result is a continuous succession of clashes and situations that appear to be ends in themselves, governed only by the incredible charisma and affection that the characters involved arouse in fans of the pirate brand . Namco Bandai has chosen to play the card of the spin-off episode a little too soon, perhaps in the optimistic hope that the material coming out within a year will justify a new episode that falls within the canons of traditional manga narration. Maybe a little too optimistic. Through ups and downs, One Piece returns to PlayStation 3 with lots of action but few ideas Playstation 3 trophies The title provides 40 trophies, divided into 23 Bronze, 13 Silver, 3 Gold and the ubiquitous Platinum. Collecting is balanced between progress, combat, and collecting collectibles. There are many objectives related to coins, scattered throughout the levels, as well as those related to the execution of particular moves in a short time. The discovery of new scenarios, the use of the characters available and thecollecting coins to unlock the in-game arcade completes the list. Pirates, armed, colored Knowing the annual development mechanisms, it is not surprising to see how the engine that drives this episode is the same as the first. Instead, what makes you turn up your nose is to note how the aliasing has remained unchanged and free to draw annoying ladders, almost anachronistic when compared with a technical aspect that is anything but sumptuous. The models of the main characters are excellent, detailed, animated in a realistic way and faithful to the manga and anime, but everything else is a sad son of that Musou genre that does not evolve at all from the first chapter; the supporting actors have very few characterizations, which are repeated incessantly in the chaos of the action, with levels with a poor design in content and glances that appear more than ever forgettable and uninspired in the realization. The impression is of navigating in containers of enemy armies and not in settings designed to provide different stimuli, with the result that traveling from one part of the area to another is consumed in a mere movement of the stick, without giving d environment or particular stylistic attractions that break up the repetitive gameplay. The frame rate remains a dancer, with phases of fluidity alternating with others in which the convulsive action brings down the number of frames. A year ago we applauded Omega Force's choice to refresh its genre by adding nice platforming gimmicks, ~Quick Time Events~ and varied action ideas that opened glimmers of a successful revitalization. Unfortunately, in Pirate Warriors 2 the team has inexplicably gone back into that all too well-known repetitive fence, forcing the player to go from one part of the map to another just to slash, eliminating what was good he had proposed in the first episode and making the game action much more direct and basic. The result, lacking playful differentiation filters, tires the team's decision in a short time and is of little use, often faced with the moral choice of whether to help an ally or fight an enemy, as the consequences on the final result, in addition to being circumventable once once you understand the mechanism, they are of little influence. A lot of quantity on screen, but too little variety. A long journey The greatest value of the second episode is unquestionably the richness of the roster, which has thirty-six playable characters, and the good amount of play included among the game modes. The main story has an enviable longevity, but the flagship is the ability to use each unlocked character to complete the episodes or try your luck in the challenges that will gradually unlock as you progress. You will hardly need it, but if the moment dictates it, you can call a friend via PlayStation Network who will intervene to help you in online co-op. Too bad that to do so your companion will have to have completed that mission in his story, which makes this gimmick of Omega Force a bit limiting. The beauty of unlocking the secondary characters is precisely being able to access the individual challenges of each one, which guarantees more hours of gameplay for the package. The Gallery makes its welcome return, a section in which purchasable materials reside for the delight of collectors of voices, films and game music, which alternate between compositions inspired by other forgettable ones. However, the large amount of material inserted must deal with a simplification of the inventory management system, no longer customizable in unlocking combinations of coins but managed by lines established by Omega Force. This aspect makes completion much less appealing, a similar fate for the combo moves, made available automatically by leveling up. In line with the goal of making each character easily playable in each area, the possibility of investing money in recovering experience makes it stimulating to always experiment with a different character to discover and test the moves available by hand, consequently choosing the ideal protagonist for every situation. Omega Force has preferred a content maximization approach, made available precisely by narrative inventions which, on the one hand, lend themselves to a potential forcing of events, on the other, add a substantial dose of substance to the title, guaranteeing good replayability.", "date": "2013-09-04", "grade": "7.0"}
