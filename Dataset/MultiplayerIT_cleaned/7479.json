Being a game with extremely simple mechanics, it was undoubtedly difficult to make a sequel that didn't seem like a mere carbon copy of the original or that - on the contrary - distorted the ideas that had led it to success. Confirming its now acclaimed ability, the US team has succeeded in this arduous undertaking with the present here Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous. Red dot you won't have my scalp The basic play structure has remained unchanged compared to the previous one, as has the control system, intuitive as always: the device is therefore tilted to move the protagonist's cursor, trying to keep it away from fatal contacts with the red dots that move on the screen. These terrible enemies can fortunately be eradicated by the user through the same procedure of the first chapter: it is therefore necessary to collect the power-ups that appear randomly on the game plan, which allow you to free weapons with the most disparate effects which however do not last more than a handful of seconds. It is at this juncture that the first novelties of Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous come out, in the form of some unpublished offensive tools that are added to others recycled from the prequel: so here you can find yourself managing a double blade of energy that reminiscent of Darth Maul's lightsaber (also thanks to the music clearly inspired by Star Wars that accompanies its use), as well as a meteorite that bounces off the walls of the scenario destroying everything in its path. Inventiveness in this sense is certainly not lacking in One Man Left, but the developers have not limited themselves to refreshing the arsenal made available to the player, also substantially modifying the procedure that allows access to new weapons, now unlockable at completing a certain set of objectives. Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous manages to improve on the prequel formula without altering its nature A feature that adds depth and a sense of progression to the game, and which stimulates the user to adopt diversified behaviors based on the goals assigned to him: this is an aspect that is anything but secondary for a title by its very nature it cannot be properly considered varied, helping to make a playful action that is really based on a few elements less repetitive. The other initiatives of One Man Left with Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous are heading in the same direction: to revive the situation, therefore, clashes with bosses and the arrival of time bombs on the scene that must be defused before the end of the countdown . In both cases, a certain precision in the movements is required which the control system proves to be able to handle very well, confirming the goodness of the work done by the developers in this area. While remaining a product with a decidedly high level of challenge, Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous proves to be slightly more forgiving than its predecessor: in fact, when you are hit by an enemy, you have the possibility of returning to the game if you manage to make ~ to land~ the damaged cursor in the center of a target that appears on the screen. On the other side of the barricade, the game offers a special mode characterized by an extreme level of challenge, suitable for all those who do not consider the pitfalls of normal playful action sufficient. If all that has been listed so far is also taken into account a slightly improved technical sector as regards the graphic aspect and the sound accompaniment, it is easy to affirm how Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous is a superior product in all respects. throughout the first chapter.", "date": "2013-11-18", "grade": "8.5"}
