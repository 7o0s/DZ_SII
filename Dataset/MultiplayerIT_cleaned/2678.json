{"name": "Street fighter 3 Third Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-fighter-3-third-strike.html", "text": "The nineties Street Fighter 3, still characterized by the best animations ever seen in a fighting game (at the expense of backdrops bordering on scarcity) was released in 1997 on the Cps-3 card, generating very mixed reactions among fans: Ryu and Ken, the two legends of the saga , remain in their place but myths such as Zangief, Guile (according to many the coolest of the saga, among other things always improved much less than the others from episode to episode being already very balanced in itself), Dhalsim give way to some new entry with certainly not irresistible quality and charisma: if Elena, Ibuki and Sean can also be liked, Necro and Oro have been highly contested while Gill, the new superboss who retires Vega after 6 years (M.Bison in the West), was at the more impossible or nearly impossible to beat. A year later, the first update, SF3 double impact, appeared in arcades, which added 2 characters, Urien (fearfully similar in character design to Gill, are they related??) and Hugo (Andore from Final Fight, it can't be otherwise! !!), as usual not even comparable to the old glories gone. While these 2 episodes are collected in a single Gd for Dreamcast (SF3 World Impact, available, among other things, also in the pal version), details of the third update, SF3 Third Strike, are starting to leak, now available in the Japanese and American versions on 128 bit Saw. Let's immediately make it clear that the game, as well as the 2 prequels, has been converted perfectly, without having loading times greater than one (1!) poor jailer! The hand-drawn intro shows in one fell swoop the 2 most marked differences compared to the immediate Double Impact (and a long-awaited return): 4 characters that add up to the previous 12 (and the ~secrets~ Gouki/ Akuma and Gill) and a soundtrack composed of House / Garage / Dance / Hip hop songs that supplants all the most recent compositions by Capcom musicians (including Capcom vs Snk, and ... wait a minute, but ... I know that Chinese girl ... ... it's Chun Li!!!Yes, in addition to Remy (excellent character who is very aesthetically reminiscent of Iori Yagami and Guile in terms of fighting style, certainly the best new entry of this edition), Makoto (karateka who is very reminiscent of Ranma Nibunnoichi's Akane), Q (a robot with a face similar to that of the never too appreciated Giant Robot, unfortunately) and Twelve (a shape-shifting alien who clamorously recalls Glacius from the Killer Instinct bilogy by Rare), we will be able to play the role of the darling of the Capcom house, returned with renewed vigor. Until the last chapter. Beyond the changes to the soundtrack, the new characters and the new backdrops (which are not proportional to the number of characters), the game remains similar to the prequel, maintaining a very technical game setting, with little space for combos, without air guard, with only one super art per fight, to be chosen at the beginning of the game among 3 available and the reconfirmation of the ex moves, i.e. slightly more powerful versions of the special shots, which can be activated by sacrificing a small part of the super arts bar and the pressing an extra key with a kick or punch; to close the picture there are obviously some filings to the characters, from the point of view of speed and the execution of certain moves. Although Sf3 Third Strike is clearly superior to the prequels, thanks also to the increase in the number of characters, the purchase can hardly be recommended to those who already own Sf3 World Impact, to those who do not consider 40% of the characters worthy of being used or more simply to those who own Capcom vs Snk or prefer only the fighting games of the other great Osaka software house. For those who are a fan of Street fighter or of excellent fighting games in general and can also buy this title.well..you know..SHINKUUU HADOUKEEEEN!!! Until the last chapter. PROS: Excellent Animations Gameplay always at the top 4 new entries including Chun Li Great sound CONS: Bare backdrops almost useless (fans, otaku and rich people excluded) for those who already have the prequel From the beginning Street fighter 2, mounted on the Cps-1 card, then presented the impressive number of 8 selectable characters to which 4 bosses were added, made playable in the Champion edition update, up to the latest update, the beautiful Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, considered by many to be the best Street fighter of any saga. The word saga is not accidental, given the presence of 3 spin-offs: Street Fighter: The movie (transposition of the bad film with Van-Damme, practically defined as a hiccup), the Street Fighter Zero trilogy (fromus SF Alpha) on Cps-2 card, whose third episode was perfectly converted (and with many more features) on Dreamcast and Playstation and finally the Street Fighter ex bilogy (plus special editions), distinguished by the use of polygonal graphics thanks to the System 11 and System 12 motherboards, with potential respectively equal to and slightly higher than the Sony 32-bit. Saga precisely, since none of these represented a real sequel!", "date": "2000-10-13", "grade": null}
