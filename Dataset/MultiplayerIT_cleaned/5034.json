As per tradition for sports titles, the The first question that arises is what are the novelties and changes made to the experience. Well, the answer comes as soon as you take a look at the game's main screen, which features some new modes. What exactly is it about? We explain it to you in the NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition review. Structure NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition, a team tries to break through Let's start precisely with the contents of NBA 2K23 and its modalities. By selecting the Play Now item on the start screen it is possible to access the inevitable quick game, a tutorial, the Blacktop urban mode (which we already appreciated in the last edition) and online multiplayer, this too an essential appointment for every sportsman who respect, mobile or not. After that there are three other main options, starting with MyCareer, the full-bodied career that fans of the 2K Games series know very well and which allows you to create your own player and then face a calendar of events that becomes gradually more dense and demanding, thus trying to gradually introduce us to the mechanics and philosophy behind the experience. We therefore have The Greatest mode, which involves the biggest basketball stars in a sort of tournament complete with bonuses and direct challenges: excellent for long-time fans; and The Association mode, which is presented as a sort of managerial career in which we will have the task of creating a team and managing its players to improve from game to game, imposing themselves within the championship. In short, on the offer front, NBA 2K23 appears perhaps reduced compared to the console version but remains a distinctly premium, full-bodied production, far from a generic mobile approach designed for quick and impromptu use: we are talking about a game that aims to entertain for long sessions, to be devoted to a reasonable amount of time. Gameplay NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition, free throws Like the vast majority of titles in the Apple Arcade catalog, the new edition of basketball produced by 2K Games supports Bluetooth controllers and it goes without saying that using this type of device allows you to enjoy the solid and multifaceted gameplay developed by Visual Concepts, once again well balanced between realism and immediacy. However, if you are around and have to opt for touch controls, another novelty of this edition lies in the double layout that can be selected from the options: the first has five buttons located on the right side of the screen, which allow you to perform all kinds of actions and control the game completely, while the second uses a total of three keys, one of which is ~universal~, which changes function depending on the context. NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition, an athlete framed during a replay Fortunately, the responsiveness of the players has been improved and there is no longer the feeling that the inputs are not promptly received by the system, but we imagine that this speed may also depend on the terminal used for the review, an iPhone 14 Pro which allows set all the values relating to the graphics to maximum. In short, the system is very solid and also in this case there is no shadow of microtransactions: another difference, undoubtedly positive, compared to the console edition of NBA 2K23, linked to the conditions established by Apple for its subscription platform. Technical realization NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition, attack and defense actions near the basket On the technical front it is not easy to identify specific improvements compared to last year's edition. Let's be clear: the graphics of NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition are excellent and really close to that of the ~major~ edition, both in terms of the complexity of the polygonal models and the set of animations available to them. Perhaps the effects betray the mobile nature of the experience, but the glance remains remarkable. A similar speech can be made for the sound, which includes a fairly complete commentary that we can further enrich by downloading a separate package, as well as a set of sounds and music that are functional to the action.", "date": "2022-11-05", "grade": "8.0"}
