La-Mulana EX responds precisely to this type of need and does it in the best way, bringing a complex scrolling platform to the Sony laptop that pays homage to the 8-bit tradition. For the uninitiated, La-Mulana is an independent project - created by the Nigoro studio - which saw the light for the first time in 2005, exclusively for the Japanese PC market. In 2011 the title returned to the limelight thanks to a remake, first intended for the Japanese market only and later also cleared for the western public, both on WiiWare and on PC. In the meantime, another four years passed before Rising Star Games (the software house of Deadly Premonition and Half Minute Hero) dealt with a portable conversion. Moreover, at present the game is part of the offer for PlayStation Plus subscribers for the month of September. The protagonist of this adventure is Lemeza Kosugi, a young archaeologist and university teacher who has obvious points in common with Indiana Jones, not least the fact that he is the son of an artist. After receiving a letter in which his father informs him that he has finally found what he has been looking for for a lifetime, Lemeza arms himself with his trusty whip and sets off for La-Mulana, a legendary land that is associated with the very origins of humanity. . La-Mulana EX is full of secrets to discover and challenges to overcome PSVita trophies The Trophies of La-Mulana EX are 55 and it will not be easy to be able to collect them all. The majority concern events to be experienced during the adventure or tasks to be carried out, while a limited number is reserved for hard mode. There is even a trophy that requires you to complete the game within up to 20 hours. If you don't like the challenge, stay home La-Mulana EX faithfully follows the contents of the version that appeared on PC and WiiWare, therefore you will have limited resources and very approximate ideas on the direction to take, as well as on the activities to be carried out in a world which, despite the division into individual screens, appears immediately very stratified and interconnected. The difficulties to be faced are numerous, but the main one is related to orientation. In the early stages it is in fact essential to remember where you have gone, memorize the various rooms and have some basic points of reference. Beyond the other characters who will meet during the exploration, Lemeza will be supported by a wise old man, who will dispense him with help and some fundamental advice to learn more about the game mechanics. In the acclimatization phase, all you have to do is be very patient and try to survive the constant respawn of the enemies, which occurs every time you go to the previous or next screen of the map. Some objects must necessarily be recovered in order to make the continuation of the adventure less difficult: for example the Holy Grail, which allows you to return to the village at any time, or the decryption tool of the stone tombstones scattered a bit ' everywhere, not to mention the equipment that reveals the maps and avoids having to do a purely mnemonic job. Even the collection of coins, to be obtained through the destruction of some objects or the killing of hostile creatures, is essential to upgrade the character and allow him to purchase new useful resources, such as a shield, a gun or a bag to preserve the data contained in the laptop, where, among other things, information on the creatures and bosses encountered can also be archived. With due attention it is possible to make the experience less difficult than it appears if the due precautions are not taken, nevertheless the frustration risks making its way several times and it is precisely one of the main reasons why this title cannot be considered appealing to a large audience. The presence of enigmas and treasures within the maps is very frequent but must be discovered with patience and dedication, leaving nothing to chance, paying attention to what is happening, to any hidden factors, to mechanisms that can be found in a room but unlock new material at a specific point on the screen alongside, and so on. The depth of the gameplay and the variety in the composition of the levels are probably the two best qualities of the game and bring back many memories of the past sessions in the company of old 2D classics of yesteryear. He wantsWhen looking for some old-fashioned parallels, La-Mulana EX brought to mind historical titles such as Metroid or Rick Dangerous, but in this case the gameplay is also supported by an in-depth mythology, which can be carefully explored by reading the documents and inscriptions present almost everywhere. In this sense, a deductive work is required which is not very different from that proposed with great success in From Software titles such as Dark Souls. Another point in favor is also longevity, in fact there are many hours of pure entertainment that this product can offer, provided you have the right time to dedicate to it and the correct mentality. A negative note can instead be moved to the control system, which on several occasions lends itself to weaknesses and not exactly excellent fluidity. Even in terms of graphics, the work done did not particularly impress us, in our opinion there are in fact many other titles belonging to the so-called pixel-art trend which, in this respect, prove to be superior. In any case, despite being a niche project, there was no shortage of admirers: this was demonstrated by last year's campaign launched through the Kickstarter platform, which made it possible to raise over $ 250,000 for the construction of a sequel. Obviously the formula will remain faithful to tradition and, although it will not be necessary to have played the previous adventure in any way, there will be reasons for connection from the point of view of mythology.", "date": "2015-09-07", "grade": "8.5"}
