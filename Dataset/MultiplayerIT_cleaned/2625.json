{"name": "Persona 5 Strikers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/persona-5-strikers-recensione.html", "text": "After spending some time together with the Phantom Thieves of Persona 5 Strikers, we have come to the conclusion that defining the title developed by Omega Force a ~musou~, in the usually derogatory meaning that most people now attach to the genre, would be unfair and misleading. With musou, but we had already mentioned it in our previous test, it almost only shares the fights against a large number of enemies, but otherwise the sequel to the splendid Persona 5 - and not to Persona 5 Royal, mind you - is much more closer to an action RPG than a Dynasty Warriors. However, this does not mean that Atlus' experiment has succeeded perfectly, as you will discover by reading our review of Persona 5 Strikers. The story of tourists by chance As we said, but it bears repeating, Persona 5 Strikers takes place six months after the conclusion of Persona 5: this means that the additional storyline of the Royal version is as if it never happened, which could certainly annoy who approached the franchise with that edition, perhaps because it was completely translated into Italian. Persona 5 Strikers is also in Italian, in fact, and make no mistake: the action drift hasn't changed the visual novel-style approach. The title developed by Omega Force abounds, perhaps too much, with dialogues, cinematics and narrative segments of considerable length that could even lead action lovers astray. In this sense, Persona 5 Strikers is Persona 5, there is no arguing. You'll spend a lot of time reading the sizzling exchanges between the protagonists, complicated brainstorming about the absurd situation they've gotten themselves into and Machiavellian confessions when it comes to shaming the bad guy. We liked the new story, but this was because we knew the protagonists well and were delighted to accompany them on their well-deserved summer holidays. In fact, the Joker returns to Tokyo to spend a few days with his friends, but the Phantom Thieves end up in an intricate conspiracy that again involves the cognitive plane. This time it's about infiltrating the Prisons, constructs in the Metaverse very similar to the Palaces, presided over by the Monarchs. Together with a mysterious Artificial Intelligence, which ~lives~ in the form of apps on mobile phones, and a policeman who has discovered their identity, the Phantom Thieves will all in all have their vacation, which will lead them around Japan on the trail of the Monarchs who lurk in our society, ruining the lives of their fans. There is not such a veiled social criticism of the influencer system that serves as a subtext to what we could almost consider a road-movie: our people will visit some of the most famous and popular tourist destinations in the country, for example Osaka or Kyoto, teaching us maybe something new about the wonderful but controversial Rising Sun. We appreciated the two new characters joining the cast as the hours wore on: Sophia, ultimately, is a real clich, but she's lovable and gives the gang an extra touch of whimsy, if a talking cat wasn't enough for you; much more convincing, however, Zenkichi who, being an adult and a family man, disrupts the dynamics of the Phantom Thieves in a very natural and fun way, offering an unprecedented perspective. Obviously the ~slice of life~ aspect remains of great importance, but it is important to point out that the game, while giving renewed space to characters like Ann or Futaba, assumes that you already know them all and are used to their idiosyncrasies. In short, for those who have never played Persona 5, the story and narrative dynamics of Persona 5 Strikers could be incomprehensible, even boring: they would find themselves wondering what on earth they could care about seeing a gang of teenagers chatting while eating dumplings in Sendai , while for the fans it is a very tasty curtain - in every sense - which reinforces the beauty of an unforgettable cast. The gameplay between dialogues and action The gameplay of Persona 5 Strikers is structured in a quite similar way to the original, but at the same time it shakes off the management, social simulator and role-playing dynamics that have characterized the last few episodes of the series to meet the action nature of this sequel. Away with the calendar, therefore, which now exists only to mark the time of the narrative: the days no longer have to be managed and the player has all the time he wants to explore the cities or prisons. Via the Social Links, replaced by a generic Bond indicator that increases arbitrarily, giving the points needed to buy bonuses and upgrades in the order you prefer. Even the Velvet Room has changed significantly, mostly to copeand a smaller number of Personae than in the original title: the fusion system is necessarily simplified and much fewer parameters must be taken into account. Of course, it may seem like a debasement of the RPG component of Persona 5, and in a certain sense it is, but in fact this is where the short circuit of Strikers lies: it winks at the action part, then slows it down inexorably with dialogues and interludes. Following the story, especially in the early hours, dialogue sessions can happen that last more than half an hour between one moment of pure gameplay and another: a rock that not everyone looking for an action game will be willing to face. When you finally enter a prison, the ~dungeon~ in and of itself can last even a few hours. They are intricate affairs, which often require multiple comings and goings from the real world, in which you have to solve puzzles and overcome platform or stealth phases: in short, they are varied and well designed, albeit a little long. Fortunately, the presence of numerous checkpoints, which allow you to return to the real world or to quickly move from one point to another in the Prison, lightens the load in the most demanding moments. Persona 5 Strikers is completed in about 40 hours at the default difficulty level, but in addition to some side missions it does not offer much in terms of extra content, which translates above all into the possibility of replaying the adventure from scratch with two additional difficulty levels . Lights and shadows of the fights The turn-based combat system of the Persona series, especially with the introduction of the so-called Press Turn, is considered one of the most intuitive but also strategic and refined in the Japanese RPG scene. That of Persona 5 Strikers, which converts the same dynamics into the action approach, cannot boast the same consideration. Mind you, Omega Force has succeeded in the extraordinary feat of offering an action combat system without falling into the stereotypes that have plagued the musou genre for years: Persona 5 Strikers is much more strategic and complicated in this respect. Each character is characterized by different specialties and combos, which often end with the projection of the Persona that inflicts the damage of the element it belongs to. By using each character often, new abilities are unlocked, which are combined with a whole series of dynamics in the gameplay: the exchange, the bonuses from the Relay, the spectacular super moves, the interactive elements of the scenario and so on. There is really a lot of irons in the fire that promises, from the very first minutes, a good variety of situations and fights, especially once you learn to take enemies by surprise or use firearms effectively. However, it is enough to get to the first minibosses to realize that the Japanese developer has done a very questionable balancing job. The interface, too loaded with visual elements, weighs down the gameplay a lot, which between onomatopoeias, graphic effects, portraits, on-screen indications and so on, is far too chaotic, especially when the strongest enemies are accompanied by groups of minor monsters. These are easily defeated, but while we are looking for the ideal target to attack, the minibosses are usually already tormenting us with quick blows that take away too many life points already at the default difficulty level. Considering the need to keep an eye on the enemies and their animations to dodge any attacks, the confusion that is created on the screen is really annoying. The game runs smoothly, even if on Nintendo Switch it does not exceed 30 frames per second and sacrifices the cleanliness of the image especially in portable mode, but this does not make the fights more readable which in a short time become almost a distraction. although we are talking about a game that has renounced role-playing aspects in favor of action. The only way to keep the battlefield under control, especially at higher difficulty levels, is to abuse the Personae, calling them up with the back button: this input puts the action on standby while we choose magic from a menu. It is an effective technique that allows you to trigger various consecutive attacks, such as the Assault which inflicts a lot of area damage and makes us get rid of minor enemies in a few moments. It will also be a boorish strategy - no one prevents you from playing combos and dodges - but it questions the game design of some encounters, such as those with bosses, which normally ~experienced~ would also be fun, if only they weren't frustrating. The problem is that Persona 5 Strikers allows for this difficulty scam, which by itself is not an intelligence-enhancing artofficial of the enemies: it only makes them tougher, prolonging the fights and raising the frustration index. Persona 5 tested the player's resistance and meticulousness sipping the expensive consumables that regenerated the SP needed to cast spells, and if you decided to leave the Palace to rest, you lost half a day's time. Since this limitation does not exist, in Persona 5 Strikers the widespread checkpoints can be used to restore HP and HP and immediately return to the Prison to fight, perhaps to accumulate the money with which to buy the consumables or the ingredients necessary to cook them. It is clear that the drift action works, on paper, but in practice Omega Force has failed to find the right balance capable of convincing both lovers of action games and fans of Persona as a JRPG. And it's a shame, because everything else is practically perfect, starting with the music, both the new ones and the rearrangements of the old ones, and the visual style used, faithful to the original, sharp and beautiful to look at, especially if you play with the console Nintendo in the Dock.", "date": "2021-02-09", "grade": "7.5"}
