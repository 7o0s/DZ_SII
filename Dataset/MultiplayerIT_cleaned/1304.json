{"name": "Mojo!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mojo.html", "text": "Rounds of spheres and destruction of boxes The mission in Mojo is simple, and pleasantly plotless: you have to control a sphere within three-dimensional environments full of gradients, curves and platforms to eliminate, through contact, all the colored blocks from each level. To eliminate the blocks on which we roll we make use of color infusers, given that that of our sphere will have to correspond to that of the blocks with which we come into contact: every time we roll on an infuser, the color of the sphere changes and with it the kind of blocks that we can destroy. Hence the need to go back and forth to systematically eliminate blocks of all colors. The control of the ball is analog and greatly affected by the physics of the game, which represents an equally important challenge as the logical structure of the puzzles to complete. Indeed Mojo! it is not a ~pure~ puzzle, in which each level constitutes a unique world, closed and solvable in only one way. Instead, it works in an ~imperfect~ way, since there is no single way to eliminate all the blocks from each level: the component of controlling the ball in the environments and the consequent challenge against time to cope with the logical structure to be solved are essential components of the gameplay. Avoid falling into the void losing precious Mojo! (ie the time available, after which the level must be restarted and which can be raised occasionally with some bonuses) is as important as studying the fastest way to deal with the various back and forth necessary to eliminate the blocks. By managing to eliminate all the blocks within a pre-established time-target, it is possible to have bonuses available, to be used in subsequent paintings, with which to change the color of the sphere without necessarily having to go to an infuser within the level. This would seem to violate the concept of a pure and closed system of each level: actually, Mojo! makes use of the possibility of addressing the same in different ways as a value. The bonuses in question can be very useful. In fact, if in the first levels we will have only four types of color to eliminate comfortably, changing color with easy-to-reach infusers and just a few flash drives to use here and there, the situation will soon get considerably complicated. In fact, we will have special blocks, keys to carry with difficulty towards padlocks that make part of the blocks inaccessible, progressively more dangerous and treacherous game environments (spirals, ravines, descents, pinball machine situations), complex comings and goings for. Before we expect it we'll find ourselves holding back from kicking the console and throwing the joypad against the wall. Which wouldn't be a bad thing if it only came from a difficulty factor of the more advanced levels. Unfortunately, however, Mojo! seems to ~harm~ the player involuntarily. Struggle against time or against control? The Mojo concept is simple but captivating and immediately pushes the player towards the challenge, improvement and, above all, towards that mechanism of interaction with the almost compulsive game, but essential for a good puzzle, which irreparably pushes us to always want to do ~ another game~ before turning off. The puzzles are very well thought out and the possibility of completing them in a different way seems like an advantage over other types of puzzles. Mojo! however, it has several flaws, some of which are able to undermine the gameplay in a decisive way. Since it is a low-budget title, sold at a lower than average price, the poor set of options and the poverty of the save system (autosave ~with scam~, faulty taking into account the accumulated bonuses) cannot necessarily be considered defects. The same goes for the audiovisual presentation. The graphics of the game are clean and essential as befits a puzzle. Maybe a little too much. There is no trace of a shadow from objects on the environment, and polygons often become 'immaterial' in problematic edge situations such as when we slide off the edge of a platform. The audio is uninspired, and is limited to some environmental effects and a handful of ambient music. The main problem with Mojo! it is another, namely the fact that the control system quickly becomes frustrating, almost replacing reasoning and also spoiling itself with a bad camera system. The physics of the game appears unjustifiably adverse, the ball very heavy and with a disproportionate effect of inertia, the environments immersed in disturbing factors such as repulsors in the most critical points. While this may seem legitimate in a game that does the control componentmain purpose, in a puzzle it only contributes to garnishing with frustration the solution of a picture perhaps conceptually solved, but impossible to overcome due to an unheard-of spiral descent and a camera system which only helps to confuse and vitiate the control and visual. The more advanced levels of Mojo!, therefore, suffer from this contradiction in terms and risk not even pleasing puzzle lovers who challenge us logically, and certainly not on the level of competition with the camera. With these structural flaws, the extra modes are unlikely to add much to the experience. The battle mode for up to four players works fairly well, adding a series of disturbing items to the arena for the opponents and based on the principle of who breaks the most blocks. A little less the golf mode, which can be unlocked with single player successes. Together with the interesting level editor (difficult, however, to have fun alone on a level conceived by ourselves), these are good variations on the gameplay, which however do not make up for the structural defects of the control system. <g>Comment</g> The concept of Mojo! it is simple and additive and would have what it takes to establish a great puzzle capable of doing without any accessories, and not caring about ultra-simplistic graphics and sound clearly taken from any repertoire of sampled effects. The fact that we are reduced more to fighting physics and the camera than to thinking, however, undermines the gameplay and risks making the low price even disliked by the public: worse than a magnifying glass on the filler label- rushed-for-the-lack-of-a-PS2-Monkey-Ball that Mojo carries around. Puzzle enthusiasts, provided that the rotation of the spheres is what they are looking for, will probably be able to turn a blind eye to the repetitiveness of the game and the resulting frustration due to the control system, and can add even more than one vote to the total. However, for the soft library, it is better to first get a much more deserving puzzle like Bombastic. For all other players, who might find Mojo nothing but frustration, proof of purchase is highly recommended, despite the low price. Simple and addictive pro concept good amount of levels multiplayer mode and level editor Counter game physics that undermines the gameplay bad camera handling repetitive for anyone who doesn't like the genre The puzzle game category is considered by some as one of the paradigms for considering the game, understood as a challenge to the system and to oneself. And it is certainly no coincidence that, if some of the best games of all time are just puzzles, the category is certainly not the easiest of missions for a game designer, putting a strain on the possibility that a title can challenge itself eternally renewable. Marble Madness came close. Mojo, which in the PS2 and Xbox soft library is a kind of gap filler due to the absence of a Super Mokey Ball, is one of those cases in which we are still far from this mission: the interaction between puzzles, game physics and control system is more problematic than happy. On balance, however, we still have a decent puzzle, capable of greatly involving anyone who loves the category. The most important thing is that Mojo!, despite its shortcomings, often manages to push the player towards that type of reasoning that requires, almost against the will, to play ~one last game~.", "date": "2004-05-19", "grade": null}
