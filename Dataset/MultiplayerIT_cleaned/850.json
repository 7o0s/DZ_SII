By increasing the range of the weapons and reducing the effects of the wind, Team 17 gave Worms Mayhem a feeling extremely similar to that of its two-dimensional counterparts, who lived on immediacy and spectacular shots, unthinkable to achieve with the cumbersome and limiting structure of Worms: Forts Under Siege. By increasing the range of the weapons and reducing the effects of the wind, Team 17 has given Worms Mayhem a feeling extremely similar to that of its two-dimensional counterparts Worms Mayhem A well-studied single player returns, which follows the mission and puzzle structure typical of the saga and also in this case the well-crafted destructibility of the terrain reopens a number of situations that were previously the monopoly of the first Worms. In addition to the 25 missions built for the new single player, there are 20 exclusively multiplayer maps, some of which are decidedly large and conspicuously dedicated to the wildest destruction imaginable. Some doubts remain, especially regarding the aim which in the three dimensions, and without references, still makes it too cumbersome to use the basic weapons compared to those equipped with a viewfinder. The magic of editing The weapon editor is also back, a true masterpiece of the series, which allows players to build a personalized arsenal that adapts both to their skills and to their tastes. This time, however, the editor is not a simple quirk that allows you to create star cannons capable of devastating entire maps. The boys of Team 17 have in fact decided to determine a ceiling of points with which we can buy the characteristics of each weapon, which will never be unbalanced compared to other weapons made by the player. Starting from the simple choice between a throwing, shooting or bombardment weapon, and then considering secondary effects and damage, it is possible to create effective and spectacular strategic combinations capable of radically changing one's style of play. In terms of editing, in addition to the everlasting voice editor with which to give our or other voices to the beloved invertebrates, there is also the possibility of putting your hand to the look of the worms by transforming soft tubes into unique characters, members of unique teams. Also from a gameplay point of view, the editor offers a wide selection of parameters that decide the timing of the appearance of bonuses, equipment limits and special modes, with the possibility of generating random configurations before each match. Simple but colourful The three-dimensional engine remains quite spartan and certainly does not aim to amaze from a technical point of view, yet the changes are there, starting with the destructibility of the terrain to get to the visual effects of the weapons, which are successfully aimed at increasing the spectacularity of the our actions on the ground. There are five settings, Jurassic, Camelot, Arab, Construction and Wild West, complete with objects and paths in style with the surrounding world, which allows you to reach a specific place thanks to the tracks of an old mine or to hide between the vertebrae of a giant dinosaur. The customization of the wormy look further increases the cartoon feeling that has always permeated this title Simple but colourful The customization of the wormy look, which crosses trends of today, genre and era, further increases the cartoon feeling that has always permeated this title, but it is less easy to achieve when dealing with polygons, textures and edges. The number of voices and sound effects is as always vast and perfectly aligned with the parodic and absurd style of Worms. Comment Worms Mayhem is a title that doesn't really offer anything new outside the possibility of giving a specific look to your team, an element that helps characterize multiplayer matches but offers very little to the gameplay in practical terms. Yet, despite all the elements of Worms Mayhem having already appeared during the saga, Team 17 has performed a new small miracle by managing to transport the worms feeling of the first beloved chapters even in three dimensions. Although perfection is far away and innovation is practically absent, Worms Mayhem is an extremely enjoyable game, with solid multiplayer and which rests on excellent foundations for the future of the series. Pro: finally the real Worms aarrives at 3 dimensions excellent implementation of the weapon editor Cons: practically absent innovation characterization and graphic quality can be improved When the video game was born, simplicity was a necessity. Direct impulses that linked two subjects to an object were the only things that fell within the processing capabilities of the first electronic devices. What game but ping pong fell perfectly within these limits? Well, shortly, with the growth of technology, it was discovered that the possibilities of manipulating electronic impulses were many and that the object in question could transform itself, and move differently, not just in a straight line. In the short term, by similarity of concept, one of the first fields explored later was that of duels. Two cowboys, two cannons or two gorillas, as anyone who remembers gorilla.bas knows, helped developers discover the potential of physics and multiplayer in the world of videogames. It is a curious fact that the problems and primal urgencies of the videogame field are, still today, or rather more today, the hottest and most important points of our beloved passion. Well, Tam 17, with its saga, has focused exclusively on this primogenic concept to spread its idea of a video game, demonstrating that even an ancient idea, older than even the platform and Nintendo dictates, still has a lot to say if explored with the right key. It is undeniable that the impact with the 3 dimensions, for team 17 as for many other teams accustomed to working on pixels even in the modern era, has not been the best. Worms Mayhem comes to stem doubts and suspicions regarding the lack of effort employed by Team 17 during this delicate passage, an element of concern for the Worms community above all due to the disappointing Forts Under Siege and tries to do it simply by correcting the shot, because when talk about Worms details are everything.", "date": "2005-09-06", "grade": null}
