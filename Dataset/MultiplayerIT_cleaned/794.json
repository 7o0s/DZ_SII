{"name": "Madden NFL 2006", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-2006_a.html", "text": "In Europe, American football certainly does not enjoy the popularity that this sport knows in the United States. Often, in the European market, not all annual episodes are released on all consoles. Proof of this is Madden 2005 for Nintendo DS, never released for DS. Madden 2006 is therefore the first NFL-licensed American football title to see the light on Nintendo's double/touch-screen laptop. Starting with the 2005 version of John Madden NFL Football, which introduced the series to Nintendo's dual screen, Electronic Arts has produced a Madden 2006 that makes little effort to overcome the already existing interaction limits. In comparison, from 2005 to 2006 Madden for DS gained only in terms of official data updates, a management mode and some graphic improvements: a sign that demonstrates that the strength of the official franchise and the aesthetic appeal of the game and of player and team fame prevailed over a game design effort that made the experience playable better than before. Madden 2006 certainly cannot be reproached for anything in terms of the completeness of the football simulation, the game modes and the whole apparatus of extras: undoubtedly central characteristics for a player who is passionate about electronic simulations of his favorite sports. The whole repertoire of American football plays and techniques is widely applicable, with a large amount of game patterns and detailed explanations (also in Italian, with the manual specifically downloadable from the EA site) on how to transpose the play strategically timed as you find them most impulsive. Fair Catches, Touchbacks, Audibles, shoulder thrusts, dives and shots, passes and actions before and after the Snap are part of a very accurate simulation repertoire, to which precise choices on offensive and defensive strategies to follow are added. Nor is there a lack of game modes, which offer the Official League, customizable tournaments, wireless challenges for up to four players (with four game cards), a practice mode and a Situation mode to face, a two-minute high-voltage mode, the My Madden, which allows the collection of Madden Cards, and even a history mode entitled ~great games~ associated with a book of records. Finally, the franchise mode presents itself as the real novelty in the portable incarnations of the series, allowing total control and observation of the team on and off the pitch, with a vast set of extras and contents which include the management and players, league news and more. All of this content is admirable, and a good reason for a fan to strongly consider Madden 2006. But the game suffers from a bad control system, made worse by a less than exciting camera system and a graphical representation that hasn't been well thought out for the screens, two but necessarily smaller than a TV, a portable console like the DS. As for the control system, the problem derives from the fatal alternation that the game requires between the nib and directional control. Instead of building a wide and versatile set of control options, such as to satisfy the traditionalist player and exalt the more progressive one with a set of original and more ~manual~ stylus movements, Electronic Arts has opted for the assignment of different functions of the game to different interface components. Electronic Arts has opted to assign different game functions to different interface components. Moving the player is a directional pad, deciding the power of a kick comes from the movement of the stylus, and so on... Moving the player is a directional pad, while deciding the power of a kick comes from the movement of the stylus, and so on. This choice generates constant inconvenience and confusion, and is compounded by the kind of confusing scene that the player will try to control visually. Even if one of the two screens, the lower one, is used among other things as a radar, this is not enough to control the action, while the camera views fail to provide the player with a complete view of what is happening. Furthermore, the game's graphics don't seem to have been redesigned for a laptop screen: they look more like a simplified version taken from those of the most powerful home consoles: but on the smaller screen, what were once details become clusters of pixels and that that was strategy becomes approximation. And indeed it seems that the common denominator among Madden 2006's shortcomings is the fact that it attempted, on the one hand, to superficially construct an original control for the DS without, however, adequately taking into account the real effects on the interface: while, on the other hand, we limited ourselves to producing a graphically ~reduced~ version which, however, turned out to be confusing and not very exciting, and barely better than Madden 2005. On balance, it is one thing to think of innovating interaction with new means with the stylus, another thing to work on it. In any case, this version would have needed more attention. Madden 2006 for the Nintendo DS would be an excellent game, if it didn't seem to suffer from the down-conversion syndrome: the game looks like a scaled-down version put together quickly to cover the strong market demand, starting with the versions for home consoles. The graphical representation does not try to optimize laptop screens and is impoverished, resulting in confusion. Furthermore, in an attempt to create a new type of interaction with the stylus, the programmers have done the gameplay a disservice: the use of half-nib is poorly merged with that of the traditional pad, and the interactive result is uncomfortable and frustrating. Given the amount of gameplay features, options, modes and extras in Madden 2006, it's definitely a shame that the quality of interaction condemns the game to appearing, in part, as a showcase of rich merchandise content that reveals itself on balance. made too little playable. In the meantime, enthusiasts will still be able to find options for their teeth, even if on the other hand Madden 2007 will not be long in coming, and with it, hopefully, substantial improvements alongside the usual update of official data. Accurate Pro Football-sim Tournament, History, Practice, Management Modes Officially licensed extras and data Cons Poor visual control of the action Awkward control system, needs to be reviewed Touch screen could use better Madden NFL 2006 The John Madden series is certainly the most famous and successful American football franchise. Its revised, updated and corrected versions, year after year, colonize every existing gaming platform. A large part of the success of the series, decidedly more established than its rival Sega on a commercial level, lies in the ability of Electronic Arts to associate everything that revolves around it with the sports simulation: official licenses, all real players and teams, rankings and statistics detailed. In short, all the atmosphere that can possibly pervade a sports title, giving it that surplus of charm that a fan of the genre and of the sport in question will tend to adore. Madden 2006, like its predecessors and the versions for home consoles, does not escape this form of representation of sport which is both simulation and narrative / official statistics, but the game is not entirely successful. The main problem of John Madden 2006 is the same as its predecessor, which had introduced the series to stylus control possible on the Nintendo DS: that of not being able to build a solid interaction, due to the somewhat hasty attempt to develop a method original control designed for the touch screen. In this way the playful substance present in the series, built for continuous refinements, is found to fall. And everything that surrounds it - statistics, modes, licenses and characters - risks looking like just a lot of smoke around very little roast.", "date": "2005-10-21", "grade": null}
