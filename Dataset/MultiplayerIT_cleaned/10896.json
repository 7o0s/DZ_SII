{"name": "Demolition Derby", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/demolition-derby.html", "text": "In the eyes of nostalgic and elderly players, the Demolition Derby title can only bring to mind that Destruction Derby which on PSone, more than ten years ago, reaffirmed the quality of Psygnosis products. It was a fundamentally simple game, but very fun and technically advanced for the times, with cars that were damaged as they were hit and gameplay with an unexpected depth. The purpose of each game was clear: within a more or less large arena, you had to collide with all the other cars until you were the only ones still able to move. So down to reverse gear and crazy accelerations to literally destroy the other competitors. Demolition Derby basically offers us the same things, but using 2D graphics with a top view: driving a racing car with reinforced bumpers, we'll have to eliminate all the other vehicles to win the races. The game basically has two modes: the first is the classic ~quick game~, in which we can try our hand at single events within ~eight~ arenas or circuits, with the objective moving from indiscriminate destruction to cutting the finish line first; the second, characterized by night races, is a sort of ~career~ made up of a large number of mixed challenges that must be completed in sequence and which allow us to collect cash prizes. Between one race and another we will be able to spend our money on improving the car, adding power or resistance depending on our approach to the derbies. We will also have the (free) possibility to customize the car through a simple paint editor: the results are not spectacular, but they are still nice. The game controls are relative to the car and not to the screen, so we'll have to act on the d-pad by pressing it left or right to steer, down to brake and forward to use the nitro. The standard acceleration is in fact automatic, so we will be able to concentrate on the trajectories without having to come to terms with the commands, especially if our terminal does not shine from the point of view of ergonomics. To win, it is essential to hit the right trajectories, making long laps to acquire the necessary speed to inflict a certain amount of damage on the unfortunate person who will find himself in our way. Within the tracks we will be able to collect bonuses of various kinds: energy recovery kit (which is represented by a bar on the screen), additional nitro, boosts for collisions, etc. The technical implementation of the game is decent, with a fairly smooth track scrolling and a good visual representation of damage. The graphics are completely bitmap, so all the work has been done on simple sprites, which unfortunately don't shine particularly for their design. The use of colours, in particular, sometimes appears unhappy, with tones that are too bright and tend towards a comic style rather than oriented towards realism. The sound is composed of MIDI music without infamy or praise, while the controls respond to inputs promptly and precisely. The fact of having automated acceleration makes the game usable on any mobile phone, so it will be easy to become familiar with your car. PRO A good number of races Decent upgrade system AGAINST Functional graphics, but nothing more Very unrealistic behavior of the car A bit repetitive", "date": "2009-02-04", "grade": "S.V."}
