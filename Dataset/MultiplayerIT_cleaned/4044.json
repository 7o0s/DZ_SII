The operation began even before the game was released two years ago, when the Japanese developer created a dense imaginary universe made up of feature films, animated series, mobile titles and so on: this Final belongs to the last category mentioned Fantasy XV Pocket Edition, since it was released several months ago for PC and mobile systems. Aware that the Nintendo console would not be able to faithfully reproduce the original assets without making significant compromises, Square Enix therefore decided to convert the mobile edition for Switch, addressing a certainly more restricted audience. In the next few lines we will try to answer the most obvious question: who might be interested in Final Fantasy XV in chibi format? The journey of little Noctis While more or less faithfully tracing the original plot, Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition HD is proposed in a somewhat different way both in form and in content. The most striking difference, the one that inevitably catches the eye first, is undoubtedly in the aspect of the game. Having to shrink the ambitions of Tetsuya Nomura and Hajime Tabata's work to fit in your pocket, Square Enix has renounced the open world and photorealistic graphics to adopt a ~chibi~ style, albeit more streamlined and graceful than the traditional super deformed. The design is reminiscent of titles such as Bravely Default and somehow manages to remain faithful to Nomura's sinuous and graceful features, returning drastically different but at the same time instantly recognizable characters. In this sense, if you appreciate the ~chibi~ style mentioned above, Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition HD is a successful adaptation, even if the almost total inexpressiveness of the characters, during the cinematics that tell the story, significantly weakens the impact emotional. Think of the introduction, for example, which without the cover of Stand by me by Florence + the Machine loses its characteristic uniqueness, or the dramatic moment in which Noctis and his friends discover what has happened to their city. The plot is in fact the same, albeit heavily summarized in certain situations: Prince Noctis of Insomnia leaves with his best friends on a road trip that will lead him to marry the oracle Lunafreya. During their outing, however, the irreparable happens, and the army of Niflheim invades the capital, assassinating the ruler and forcing Noctis to another type of journey in which he will have to find himself and the strength to reconquer his homeland. Despite being afflicted by some uncertainties, the story of Final Fantasy XV is touching and full of memorable sequences that have been streamlined in this pocket version: free of detours and secondary objectives that act as fillers, the game goes straight to the point and tells us the salient facts in ten rather terse chapters that are completed in a few hours. Small problems It is obvious that Square Enix had to intervene heavily on the structure of the game and on the gameplay in general: as we have said, there is no longer an open world, and the missions take place in detailed but basically linear and restricted scenarios, in which the team Noctis and his three friends take on various enemies. Sometimes it is possible to undertake a secondary assignment that guarantees experience points and skills to be spent to level up our heroes and make them learn new skills or fighting techniques: in this sense, the growth of the characters follows quite faithfully that of the title original, but virtually every other gameplay feature or dynamic has been streamlined or directly automated. The fights, for example, have kept the setting in real time, and just hold down the attack key to make Noctis perform various chains of shots with equipped weapons. The projections are assigned to another key or to a possible combination of keys, but of course it is no longer possible to project Noctis vertically and take advantage of raised ledges or handholds. Similarly, dodging and counterattacking have become simple Quick Time Events to be resolved by pressing the indicated key at the right time, perhaps even to trigger some cross-attack with Gladio, Ignis and Prompto. In short, everything is super simplified, and so also the level of difficulty remains rather low throughout the adventure: in practice, you win by holding down a key and occasionally pressing a fewlter, without even the bosses being able to hinder us in a particular way, being mostly sponges that absorb a much greater amount of damage than normal enemies, before inevitably falling too. Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition HD has never claimed to be a challenging title, however, but only a carefree bignami, and in this sense it succeeds without major problems... except for the technical ones. Beyond the style which, as we said before, may or may not like it, it must be admitted that the Square Enix title lends itself to some too many inadequacies on the purely technical front, especially if played in TV mode. In portable mode, in fact, Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition HD is absolutely pleasant, colorful and well-finished, but once the Switch is housed in the Dock, various problems emerge: the image gets noticeably dirty, the sixty frames per second go down the drain and for moreover, the game unjustifiably tends to slow down in the most agitated situations, such as fights. The code is also subject to grueling loading in both modes, as well as some instability that sometimes forces you to directly restart the software. The latter, in particular, are problems that can be solved with a few small patches, but still betray a rather superficial workmanship.", "date": "2018-09-28", "grade": "6.5"}
