Kaldheim was not a revolution, but a consolidation of what was done with Zendikar Rising. The future is now a road towards novelty and the first step is called Strixhaven, or the set that has already made its debut on the Arena and that will also see the light on paper on April 23rd. We have had the opportunity to strip the flesh off the Set and we are therefore ready to offer you our opinion in the review of Magic: The Gathering - Strixhaven. An academy for all wizards Magic: The Gathering - Strixhaven: One of the beautiful art of the game Strixhaven plunges you into a plane, Arcavios, featuring the largest magic academy in the entire Magic universe. Five schools that characterize it, each with well-defined distinctive traits and with diametrically opposed ideas on the use of magic. We have Archaoroccas, Silverpens, Darksprouts, Prisms, and Quandrixes. Within the game this is transformed into different combinations of mana that distinguish the various cards representing the schools: red and white mana for Rock Archae, black and white for Silverpens, black and green for Darksprout, red and blue for Prisms and blue and green for the Quandrix. Mana is therefore the center of everything, in terms of card types, the set focuses on particular spells and creatures. Just as Strixhaven and its schools revolve around the ancient founding dragons (each school is named after its dragon's name) the set also revolves around these four cards. Magic: The Gathering - Strixhaven: the school of Archeorocca However, going into the specifics of the technical innovations proposed by Strixhaven, we are faced with three new keywords: Artemagica, Learn and Aegis, in addition to the continuous presence of new Modal Double-Faced Cards. As for the latter, it's no longer surprising: as we anticipated in our review of Zendikar Rising, their introduction has now been assimilated by the community and now more than ever the whole meta inserts several of these cards in the most competitive decks. As far as keywords are concerned, however, we are faced with new keywords contextualized in all respects within what Strixhaven is. Artemagica allows you to activate a specific bonus (which differs from card to card) every time you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell. Some of these cards, such as Elite Dice Keeper, get a very strong bonus (the green card mentioned as a bonus has the addition of +1/+1 counters). Therefore Artemagica should not be underestimated, and indeed, in these first few days we have seen how it has been inserted very well in numerous decks. As for Learn and Aegis, the use is much more situational. Learn, which allows you to choose a Lesson card outside of the game (in the sideboard then) reveal it and add it to your hand, is definitely linked to decks that take advantage of cards with Learn that in this moment only find play in a few specific decks. Egida, on the other hand, is an addition to the evergreen keywords, i.e. those keywords that are not specific to a set but considered universal. Aegis allows the possessing creature to make the player who targets said creature with spells or abilities pay an additional cost. Also in this case it is certainly an excellent keyword, but extremely situational, in fact linked to certain cards. The highest artistic level Magic: The Gathering - Strixhaven: One of the new Planeswalkers As we have repeatedly found ourselves telling you, however, Magic is not just a game, but also collecting. For this reason, an element that we increasingly take into consideration is the quality of the art, of the variants and of the special versions. Strixhaven in this area is a set that perfectly combines both the quality of the cards in playful and artistic terms. Take for example Shadrix Silverpen, one of the four Elder dragons. 2/5 Mythic legendary creature card with Flying and double strike that causes each start of combat on their turn to choose two between Target player creates a 2/1 Scribble creature with flying, target player draws a card and loses a life, and Target player puts a +1/+1 counter on each creature they control. Beyond the immeasurable power of this card, especially in some decks that have now entered the meta, the artistic level of both the base card and the borderless variant far exceeds many of the art seen so far. Strixhaven demonstrates a decidedly high level in this. Almost all the cards in the set have a very strong artistic contextualization with the lore of the Arcavios planeand they often add a strong utility into play as well. Magic: The Gathering - Strixhaven: the Mystical Archive Another example is the cards from the Mystical Archive that repurpose the variant art of certain cards into an incredibly beautiful version to look at. Of these 63 cards then there are some that have undergone a further variant entirely dedicated to Japanese art. These special cards in the oriental version, which in the physical version can only be found outside the Japanese market in the Collector Boosters, are the icing on the cake of a set that has really been able to stimulate every element of the fans. The most avid players have found new cards to insert in their decks and even the collectors have had bread for their teeth with superlative art.", "date": "2021-04-20", "grade": "9.0"}
