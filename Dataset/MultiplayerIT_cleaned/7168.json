{"name": "Rimandato a settembre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130974-the-elder-scrolls-online-rimandato-a-settembre.html", "text": "It took us a Beta phase and at least a couple of hours into release to figure out how to actually play The Elder Scrolls Online, which means either we're very stupid - hey, it's likely - or that ZeniMax Online doesn't know how to explain itself very well. Considering the amount of much more complicated MMOs that we have played in past years, we are inclined towards the second hypothesis, and this already says a lot about the capabilities of the American software house. In fact, despite some important names, ZeniMax Online is a newbie in the MMO field and the choice to entrust it with a very important brand such as The Elder Scrolls has certainly not been frowned upon. On these pages we have never made a secret of our skepticism regarding Bethesda's decision to bring the saga online in a form that does not lend itself well to the sensations it has always wanted to convey to players, but on the other hand we have not even hidden that we were there quite amused during the last Beta, seeing in The Elder Scrolls Online some potential that, exploited with wisdom and skill, would have allowed it to emerge in a complicated panorama and to justify the initial expense, not exactly contained, and the much talked about monthly subscription . We've spoken out about the latter several times in the past, for example in our review of Final Fantasy XIV, and you know how we feel about it: it's perfectly acceptable when the game is worth the candle. And is The Elder Scrolls Online worth it? For now definitely not. The Elder Scrolls Online is neither a good TES nor a good MMO but a disappointing middle ground Racing simulator Whether or not to spend those thirteen euros a month or so is an absolutely subjective decision based on many factors: not only the fun, but also company, curiosity, one's bank account and so on. The problem is that The Elder Scrolls Online fails to leverage many of them, and this became surprisingly clear to us after completing the first zone of our chosen faction and realizing that we had already spent several hours without acute details , annoyed by several problems in various fields, only to start over a process that tries to be original to simply become redundant. We were saying that The Elder Scrolls Online doesn't play like any other theme park MMO, precisely because it also tries to be a bit sandbox with frankly questionable results. There are no hubs in which to collect quests, you are not taken by the hand and led from one point to another on the gigantic maps, there are no precise routes to follow: which we really liked, mind you, because it reminded us of the meaning of freedom of The Elder Scrolls, the charm of adventure in uncharted lands. The map of each area (oh, by the way, Tamriel is by no means entirely available as previously advertised) indicates some points of interest that are worth reaching: as you explore, other points of interest closer to you appear on our map , forming a network of locations where we will find various contents whether they are quests, public dungeons, particular events or city hubs. On paper the idea is excellent, in practice we found ourselves running from one point to another crossing splendid and incomprehensibly empty areas, only to find the various NPCs and hostile creatures concentrated in the places of interest in which to solve the missions entrusted to us by various characters. However, nothing indicates their difficulty before having undertaken them, perhaps implying treks that end in nothing because we have discovered ourselves too weak and inexperienced for the mission on duty: and then we start again in search of that corner of the map where, perhaps, a quest is hidden within our reach that has escaped our radar. An annoying time sink when it comes to game time that we are paying monthly and on which ZeniMax has subliminally pressured with its questionable choices. You all know the story of the horse by now, don't you? We summarize it for you, because it is worth going back to it: we said that there is a lot to traipse, but luckily there are some horses that can be purchased from the beginning of the game by paying an exorbitant amount ... or by buying the Collector's Edition of the game or its extra digital content sold separately in the official shop, which allow you to buy the aforementioned horse for a measly piece of gold, where more than seventeen thousand would be needed. And the economy isn't exactly doing very well: beyond the constantly broke enemies who reward us with a few gold coins when we're lucky, there is a whole series of social problems related to money that have made us turn up our noses and on which torwe will finish shortly. But is it in Italian? We know how important it is to our readers, so we have dedicated an entire box to it. The Elder Scrolls Online is in Italian, then? Absolutely not: it is completely in English, and given the narrative nature of the missions, and the amount of text to read or listen to, keep this in mind if you are interested in the game but are unfamiliar with Shakespeare's language. There is no daedra for cats The missions of the enemies pay much better, and it is not that the player can skip them because, quite simply, it is not possible to progress and grow the character without completing the many quests offered in each area. Even PvE in and of itself has a dark side that has not been slow to reveal itself. Initial impressions were, well, great - long, well-written, fully voiced, sometimes multi-execution quests in true Elder Scrolls fashion. Yes, it's true, you can't slay everyone and you can't complete quests in too many different ways, but once you come to terms with the MMO nature of The Elder Scrolls Online, you realize that ZeniMax, somehow, has managed to breach what could be the future of theme park MMOs. Too bad she wasn't far-sighted enough to realize that. After about twenty hours of play, the quests simply got boring, and the main reason is that their quality - like everything else in the game, on the other hand - is absolutely fluctuating. Some are damn well written, others start in fourth place to resolve themselves into nothing, most are reduced to micro-stories related to the hub of the moment that tend to all look a bit alike. We've lost count of the times we've entered the realm of Oblivion (even if it's just for a handful of seconds, like the loading of the area there and back took three times as long) or we've interacted with a ghost: pretty soon some features of the narrative become real clichs and the fact that the storylines are substantially mirrored from one faction to another doesn't help. The common thread is represented by a main quest scattered among the various areas and which is probably the best part of the PvE experience. Between poisoned Argonians and Khajit allied with the Bosmer we feared that ZeniMax was making fun of the beloved mythology of The Elder Scrolls Online, however we discovered a certain respect for the franchise that could easily motivate the most die-hard fans. The evil Molag Bal intends to invade our world by merging his realm with the material plane and his project is hand-in-hand with some very important events in the history of Tamriel: our search for a way to stop him will intertwine with some cornerstones of the Bethesda narrative, leading us to confront more or less famous characters who have been repeatedly mentioned - if not even met - in the five offline chapters. Between Dragonborn and Daedra princes, the story of The Elder Scrolls Online often resembles a very well written fanfiction. It's just a shame that the highlights are embarrassingly anticlimactic, interspersed with long dead moments and unimportant filler questlines. The sense of immersion in the game world, a fundamental characteristic for which The Elder Scrolls has made so many converts in the past years, has then been completely destroyed by the community of players. It was to be expected, after all, but the memory of public dungeons full of jumping players or bots ready to hook the miniboss on duty to leave yet another corpse above that of its previous incarnations still haunts us. The fact that ZeniMax wanted to recreate some situations from the Bethesda series, such as the presence of numerous dungeons and caves, underlines how the developer did not understand what was the border not to cross in the transposition of the brand. Phasing could have been managed infinitely better, and not only to protect player involvement, but also to solve all the enormous problems that afflict company matches: the shared quest system is absolutely insane and forces players to constantly control and frustrating of individual progress, since each member of the group is bound to the individual steps of his mission and this, very often, leads to annoying incompatibilities and endless bugs. Playing in a group is not only frustrating, but also counterproductive: and considering that we are talking about a Massive Multiplayer Online RPG, it is obvious that something is not right. Jack of all trades The situation improves a bit in the various instanced dungeons, but even there quite a few ariseproblems as soon as you set foot in it. Beyond the purely action combat system, targeted and without cooldowns, which you may or may not like - as long as you don't play in first person: in that case it's objectively tremendous - we appreciated the turn that ZeniMax has given to the gameplay, allowing each player the freedom to wield any weapon or wear any type of armor. Ultimately, the classes are distinguished primarily by three distinctive skill sets that in each case guarantee each player the opportunity to undertake each of the three roles that define the so-called ~trinity~ of MMOs. In short, each class can defend the group, heal companions or inflict damage on the enemy, and the great variety of skills allows the creation of very different and often effective builds as much as the others. Of course, there are still combos of weapons and ideal and flawless skills, but the effective freedom granted by the combat system is there and it shows. Too bad, therefore, that ZeniMax hasn't done anything to solve the problems we encountered in Beta and that every fight continues to have something immaterial because of the uncoordinated animations, the asynchronous sound effects and, above all, the lag that affects the two American megaservers. Fairly funny, The Elder Scrolls Online's combat system would like to be technical but ends up being simply caciarone, between telegraphed attacks for which it is practically useless to dodge and shots that it is not clear whether they hit the mark or not. If in PvE all in all you get used to it, in PvP the problem is felt in all respects especially when facing mass battles in the immense region of Cyrodiil, another mostly empty map where the action is concentrated in the many points of interest where, possibly, some clash is taking place. Cyrodiil briefly transported us back to the days of Dark Age of Camelot or the early sieges of Guild Wars 2, and is undoubtedly the best part of the package, vain as it is. Between interactive siege weapons, resources to capture, Elder Scrolls to steal (don't ask), and the longed-for Emperor position that unlocks his handsome set of abilities, ZeniMax's mass PvP is downright fun, but it depends entirely from the community and this means that there can be tremendously boring moments in which nothing happens or defeats so blatant that, due to the questionable temporal lockout of the campaigns, they can effectively make any recovery attempt useless. In short, there is a lot to balance in this sector too, but it is clear that in terms of PvP the developer has the clearest ideas. In case you want to take a break from PvE and Cyrodiil isn't the right place to spend your time, there's always crafting: it doesn't reach the very high level of the one proposed in Final Fantasy XIV, but it defends itself very well and it is complex and intuitive at the same time. Players can easily recover the materials scattered around the maps or decompose the old equipment to produce new ones, setting a few but simple parameters whose combinations guarantee various different results. Again, ZeniMax had the ability to screw up a great feature in the stupidest way possible, and that is by not implementing an auction house. Since the first version of Final Fantasy XIV taught us nothing, ZeniMax has well thought of delegating the exchange and commerce to the guilds themselves, encouraging players to create chat channels and forums on the Internet to exchange materials and sell their products . Because, rightly so, if we want to sell a two-handed sword, we'll have to waste time looking for a buyer in chat or even on the web... seems legit! Go where the Khajiit takes you Paradoxically, the aspect of The Elder Scrolls Online that initially seemed less convincing to us was the one that left us most satisfied, and that is the technical framework. Let's forget the character design, which you may or may not like but which is still very faithful in style and artistic direction to the Bethesda brand: ZeniMax's online Tamriel is one of the most beautiful virtual worlds we have had the opportunity to set foot in. The already implemented regions are immense and full of details and details that leave you speechless, thanks also to a wise choice of colors and excellent taste in the modeling of structures, mountains, valleys and terrains. It is precisely the variety of the exteriors and the beauty of the landscapes that makes the excessive emphasis placed on exploration less heavy, but there are also some slip-ups in the form of very low resolution textures which we sincerely hope are only temporary like the colored cubes ~placeho", "date": "2014-04-24", "grade": "7.0"}
