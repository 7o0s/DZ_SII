{"name": "Darkwood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darkwood-recensione.html", "text": "Darkwood is a title that manages to really scare gamers. This seems like the perfect formula to begin the review of Darkwood on PlayStation 4. Very often unknown developers offer horror-themed indie titles, leveraging the most famous stereotypes of the genre: they are productions that almost always hit the mark, that is, they intrigue the players and they bring home a few copies sold, beyond the quality of the product itself. Instead, it is more difficult to find a really valuable independent horror production, a Layers of Fear or any Outlast, so to speak. The arrival of Darkwood on consoles is the demonstration that there is always the exception capable of confirming the rule, that quality and originality can continue without problems to guide these specific productions. The very fact that Darkwood also arrives on current generation consoles years later is significant: we are talking about a title that was offered in Early Access on Steam in July 2014, to then be released on PC in 2017. These days, in May 2019, that is, after two years, there are still those who are waiting to be able to play it on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, or who are ready to buy it again even on consoles. If the development team made up of complete strangers (Acid Wizard Studio) has managed to obtain sufficient funds both for publication and for conversion, if it has managed to create an audience of loyal players, it will mean something. PLOT: Hidden in the forest World fiction, whether oral, written or cinematographic, has always taught that one must be very careful in woods and forests when the sun sets: wild beasts live in the woods, one can easily get lost in the woods, perhaps without ever finding the way home. Type ~forest~ + ~horror~ on Google and you will understand how many horror stories owe these poor trees (but only after sunset) a large part of their fortune. Darkwood starts from this stereotype, and then reworks it in an extremely original way, drawing from ideas that now recall the production of Edgar Allan Poe now that of H. P. Lovecraft and Stephen King (especially for the unmentionable horror). Little information is provided to the player by the plot, specifically to allow him to better identify himself in a sick, alienating, corrupt world: he is inside a forest of the Soviet bloc of the 80s, lost somewhere in the north-eastern area of present-day Europe. However, it is immediately clear that the forest protagonist of Darkwood has almost nothing normal, nor that it is a peaceful place. The developers warn the player with a precise sentence, which precedes the start of a new game: ~You are playing a demanding and ruthless game. You will not be helped in any way. Respect the wood. Be patient. Concentrate~. And here we already begin to understand that playing Darkwood in the evening it will not be so easy to sleep peacefully. Yet an evening managed in an optimal way (certainly not with the first game) would be enough to get to the end credits of the production, which is not particularly long-lived: part of its effectiveness, moreover, lies in a well-balanced rhythm, which marks the moments of a particularly reticent story. Darkwood doesn't say much about events that have concerned and concern its game world: it is understood that something terrible has happened in the forest, because it is obviously not a normal forest. Unmentionable monsters and dark creatures inhabit it, and they emerge from the vegetation especially at night, a time of day when they are not even afraid to venture inside the buildings in search of any desperate survivors; during the day, however, you still have to be careful of another myriad of dangers, including rabid dogs, traps and strange hooded figures who go about in peace. The Stranger (the protagonist of the adventure) will have to be able to get out of the woods, preferably unharmed: depending on the choices made by the player in the various chapters (and above all during the nights in the forest) he will be able to succeed or not. Atmosphere and context alone are enough to justify even more than half of the overall positive judgment that we have assigned to the title: it is an immersive and intense experience, which enjoyed with a nice pair of headphones really manages to disturb the player, in treacherous and subtle way rather than with the usual and stereotyped jumping from the chair (reduced to a minimum). Playstation 4 trophies Darkwood represents a particularly interesting title for trophy hunters, since on PlayStation 4 it has not only a shiny Platinum, but exclusively silver and gold trophiesro. Among other things, the developers were particularly good: they didn't necessarily require you to complete the game on hard or nightmare mode. However, it will be necessary to make very specific choices during the main adventure, and then complete it: our advice is to play the first time without thoughts, and in the second game keep an eye on a special guide. Gameplay: explore, build, survive Darkwood belongs to the survival game genre: the basic objective is to stay alive as long as possible, night after night, chapter after chapter, until the epilogue. Depending on your skills, the player can choose between three different levels of difficulty (and no, there is no easy mode): normal, where in case of death you will lose some of your equipment, but somehow you can still put it back together the useful tools in a short time; difficult, with a limited number of lives; nightmare, where there is only one life and therefore death is permanent. Our advice is to start playing in normal mode, complete the adventure, then restart the title by also exploring the areas ignored during the previous game, learning all the secrets and finding the various collectibles. On this second occasion, if you want, you can also raise the bar a little and switch to difficult. We clearly advise against the nightmare mode, for reasons of sanity and common sense, unless you are lovers of the genre and also master the roguelike mechanics a little. Given the fundamental survival component, the heart of Darkwood is divided between exploration and crafting; one could also mention and discuss a rudimentary combat system, which is present but also uncomfortable, exhausting, cumbersome, clumsy and frustrating. In short, combat in Darkwood is almost always useless, rely on its rudimentary control systems only if you really have no other arrows to your bow and you are about to die in a bloody way. Much more important and much better managed is instead exploration, which offers enormous advantages in terms of identification thanks to the perspective from above. The protagonist's field of vision therefore coincides with that of the player: it is not possible to look much further than it would actually be possible to do by being in a wood, at sunset, armed with a torch. This means that one can never really be sure what is hidden in an abandoned and ruined house, or what awaits us beyond the tree at the end of the clearing: a sense of terrible and perpetual anguish ensues, the same which guarantees constant anxiety for the duration of the adventure. The management of the game map is also very interesting, which provides the player with a generic idea of where he is and where he can go, without actually giving him precise reference points (which would guarantee too much stability, even from a psychological point of view). Exploring, in Darwkood, is essential because the protagonist has practically nothing at his disposal that can allow him to survive more than two nights in a row. From the very beginning there is an urgent need to collect as many objects and materials as possible: wood, mushrooms to cook, nails, but also defused bear traps and petrol with which to feed the generators, thus having a minimum of light available in the house. A fairly full-bodied crafting system allows you to create various types of objects, which in turn are essential for interacting with the game world (small but subtle, it is a semi-open world) of production: lock picks, hatchets, wooden axes, and so on towards more complex mechanisms. Towards sunset it is necessary to barricade yourself in the house, because that's where the good things come (or rather, where the bad comes): the monsters attack the house and try to enter to kill us. A well welded window, a trap placed in the right place, a bait in a dead corner of the house can make the difference between survival and defeat; with each new night the attacks become more and more aggressive. Don't even think about staying out after the sun goes down because well, because you could face a fate worse than death.", "date": "2019-05-21", "grade": "8.2"}
