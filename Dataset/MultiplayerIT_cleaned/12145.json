{"name": "I Fantastici 4 e Silver Surfer - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-fantastici-4-e-silver-surfer-recensione_a.html", "text": "From great licenses come bad video games. The Fantastic 4 and Silver Surfer, although starting from the license from the film currently in Italian cinemas, does not follow the story slavishly, rather taking a cue to allow the developers to create a more complex plot, more suitable for a video game and above all with many more Villains ( comic book supervillains). The adventures of the four Marvel superheroes begin in a cave in the middle of the Amazon forest, initially investigating a mysterious form of energy and then discovering the hand of the Skrulls, the archenemy race of the Fantastic. To bring the Fantastic 4 and Silver Surfer film to Nintendo Ds, 7 Studios (the game developer) decided to opt for a game structure very similar to that of the typical platformers of the supernintendo / megadrive era: short levels of 2D side-scrolling game, platforms to overcome, enemies with very low AI and highly repetitive routines, one button to hit opponents and another to jump. The game levels, like the repetitive behavior of the opponents, are divided into three macro-groups: the first is the one relating to the stages to be tackled like a real platform game, the second is the one dedicated to the shooter sections with the human torch and thefantasy, while the third and last is represented by the clashes with the bosses at the end of the level (real mini-games that use the touch screen). The first group of levels, the platformers, are associated with the Invisible Woman, Mr. Fantastic and the Thing: the three Fantastic will travel through levels that are in all respects similar to each other by ~exploiting~ what are the powers of each one. If on paper the intentions may seem quite good, what results is a trivial section of scrolling platform where the characters - who even seem not to be part of the setting due to an unspecified problem of graphic definition - jump between a platform and the other by beating every enemy that stands in front of us with the only attack move available for the three, and relying on their -individual- powers to make their way: the Invisible Woman is given the possibility of hovering above a sphere of energy (you can finish the whole level by flying and dodging enemies, avoiding any contact with the ground), the Thing can charge a lethal shoulder and Mr. Fantastic is capable of interacting with terminals to operate mobile platforms (this element, linked to the lack of precision of the controls is deleterious and frustrating). Within these settings, it is the player's task to recover some energy spheres capable of healing him and some crystals useful for unlocking the only extra offered by the game: the original covers of the American Fantastic 4 albums. The energy spheres a moment ago described can be activated by pressing the corresponding icon on the touch screen, used solely for this function and ~embellished~ by the blow-up of the character in use (probably inserted if this is undetectable in the sprite used during the game). By overcoming one after the other the internships proposed to guide one character at a time, it is also the turn of the human torch which - flying like superman - has the task of completing its sections of level in what to all effects it can be thought of as a vertical scrolling shooter, avoiding the shots of enemies scattered around the screen and shooting fireballs at full blast. In the same way, the sections aboard the Incredibicar - a vehicle used by the Fantastic Four to move from location to location - take advantage of the same mechanism, with shooting enemies and all. If the platform sections had the defect of lacking depth and originality, it is in those of scrolling shooters that the game probably hits rock bottom: making a non-trivial and fun shooter is probably one of the most difficult things in the gaming industry, and the flight sections of the Fantastic 4 are the obvious demonstrations resulting weak, not at all fun, too simple and with a game structure that is closer to a Galaga than to a Gradius (that is, with only elements of the caliber of: enemies shooting and shooting player). Every time the section dedicated to each Fantastico is completed, it is the end-of-level boss who brings new elements to the game structure: since these enemies are stronger than all the others previously faced, it is necessary for the whole team to take he takes part in the fight and does it in the most bizarre way possible: using the touch screen. The powers of the four heroes are in fact ~summarized~ in 4 moves useful for repelling the attacks of the enemies: the playerhe can draw lines to repel small balls of energy, circle bombs to neutralize them, and touch fireballs to send them back. This particular event in the course of the game, while representing something actually new, is at the same time too simple, trivial and ~guided~ to be able to represent a real challenge. Graphically, the game doesn't live up to many GBA productions, least of all those for DS, the settings are anonymous and repetitive, the characters seem to come out of Clayfighter (a fantastic Interplay game more than 10 years ago) and - icing on the cake - absurdly it is in various parts of the levels the game action slows down and snaps. Comment It is unfortunately an unwritten rule of the market, the one that arises from the equation whereby the bigger the license acquired for a video game and often the bigger the thud. Fantastic 4 and Silver Surfer developed on Nintendo Ds by 7 Studios fails to wriggle out of this cosmic balance, representing a video game poor in content and ideas, old in form and substance, where probably the only elements that manage to save themselves are the sector sound and story sequences between levels. Pros: Original boss battles Satisfying soundtrack Cons: Game structure poor in content Graphically inadequate Too simple and repetitive The Fantastic 4's yet another demonstration that they actually are ~awesome~ is proof that they seemingly possess the gift of ubiquity. While they pine on home consoles in an attempt to save the world from the alien menace posed by the Silver Surfer, they even manage to appear on handheld consoles to fight the same battle. Ubiquity: ability to be in two places at the same time, in the same form. However, the most attentive will have noticed the word ~apparent~ next to that of ~ubiquity~ just a few lines higher up, this is because the fantastic four, despite finding themselves in different places at the same time, lose along the way that form that on other gaming platforms it had undoubtedly helped.", "date": "2007-07-04", "grade": null}
