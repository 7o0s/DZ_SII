{"name": "Red Dead Redemption 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-dead-redemption-2-recensione-rockstar-games.html", "text": "Not even a month has passed since we had the opportunity to play Red Dead Redemption 2 for the first time and we have come to the moment of the awaited review: a mammoth project that, it is rumored, has required Rockstar Games between six and the eight years of development, something more than the time that has passed since GTA V, the last project in chronological order of the American software house. In all these years, however, the developer has not remained idle and, in addition to having brought various re-editions of the fifth chapter of Grand Theft Auto to the market, has actively supported the multiplayer component of its most famous franchise: that GTA Online which turned out to be a real goose that lays the golden egg. A sort of game within the game which, in fact, has allowed GTA V to reach almost 100 million copies sold, breaking through the ceiling of 6 billion dollars in turnover if we also take into account the value of the microtransactions linked to the multiplayer component. A dizzying figure that is unrivaled in any other field of entertainment and which allows us to place the scope and value of Red Dead Redemption 2 even before launching into its review. In fact, it is no coincidence that everyone was waiting for this new open world from Rockstar to see and understand how far the evolution of the genre could be pushed: in fact, no other software house has the budget, the time and the skills to be able to launch into a similar project. And we lucky players can now reap the fruits of this work. The story and characters of Red Dead Redemption 2 It is useless to get around it: while wanting to avoid any risk of spoilers, it is essential to underline right away that Red Dead Redemption 2 is, first of all, a splendid story to be experienced, read, observed and listened to. This huge single player experience revolves around an articulated, dense plot, perhaps not particularly full of twists or completely unexpected situations, but without a shadow of a doubt masterfully narrated and able to entertain any player for dozens of hours of gameplay. It is a story of brotherhood and loyalty but also and above all of degradation. Social degradation linked to a historical period of great change in American society: we are in 1899 and the Wild West linked to the cinematographic and book imagery that we all know is about to become extinct under the blows of a now unstoppable technological and scientific progress. The first modern cities are born, electricity illuminates the streets, we begin to hear the chatter concerning a wheeled vehicle capable of replacing the horse, pristine nature must give way to urbanization and the concept of freedom is changing rapidly meaning. But it is also a story of physical and moral degradation: that of Red Dead Redemption 2 in fact revolves entirely around Arthur Morgan, our avatar, and his interactions with the gang who adopted him as a boy and with whom he spends every minute of his life. A criminal gang led by a ruthless but consistent outlaw in his moral ideals, Dutch Van Der Linde, whose charisma has undergone a strong downsizing due to a heist gone bad and is leading him to loosen his grip on that group otherwise destined for destruction. anarchy and self-destruction. John Marston, Hosea Matthews, Micah Bell, Sadie Adler, are just some of the figures you will bond with (we refer you to our special on the characters to learn more about them) and who will accompany you on this long journey where, to mark the passage of time, an engaging video game representation of illness and physical deterioration will also arrive. Specifically, to anticipate a question that we already know will recur in the comments, Red Dead Redemption 2 is configured for mere chronological issues, like a prequel to the first chapter. It is in fact set about a dozen years earlier and, while putting us in the shoes of a new protagonist, it will lead us to interface over and over again with John Marston, the hero of the first episode. This means that those who have played the original title will appreciate the inevitable references, but even those approaching the saga for the first time with this chapter will not struggle to follow the story and, indeed, could even be stimulated to play the first Red Dead later Redemption to know the closure of the narrative circle. Before moving on to the gameplay in detail, it is essential to write some information on how, in practice, this story is told. Basically, the game does not deviate from the sown of the previous chapter, but more generally from the interpretation of free roaming signed by Rockstar. The missions will beyear indicated directly on the map with the classic circle with the initials of the character with whom we will have to interact. A note of color distinguishes between the main and the optional, many of which are entrusted to us by characters initially identified with a question mark: strangers. The directorial and narrative style is perfectly in keeping with the Rockstar Games tradition, with cutscenes that anticipate and conclude the mission and very long dialogues during the course of the same, as we ride to reach the mission's goal. Added to this is an impressive number of random and contextual missions that suddenly appear as we find ourselves wandering around the game world: passersby asking for help, camps attacked, shootings that take place on the side of the road, kidnappings, executions, strange rituals . We have really seen all the colors and after more than 60 hours of play we happen to be still surprised. Yes, you read correctly, the estimates on the duration of Red Dead Redemption 2 hypothesized by Rockstar are realistic: you will hardly be able to finish the main story in less than 50 hours, especially on the first run, and it is very likely that by investing time in any of the side activities offered by the incredible game world, you will put at least 20 more with the possibility of doubling that number in case you want to complete this adventure 100%. For information, before writing this review, we invested just under 70 hours in the game without being able to complete it but stopping at 68% of the main story as reported by the internal meters. The new frontier of the open world genre Let's face it right away: Red Dead Redemption 2 is absolutely not a revolutionary game but it is the perfect evolution of that open world free roaming genre which in the last two generations has tended to remain anchored to the stakes and rules imposed by GTA IV and Assassin's Creed. There is no doubt that some recent titles have been able to show signs of important renewal, but basically the progress has been marked exclusively by the graphic improvements and the constant enlargement of the game areas or at most by the number of non-player characters present on the screen at the same time. On this front, RDR2 marks an important change of direction: while achieving a graphic and artistic quality that has no rivals on today's market, it tries in every way to clean up, refine and perfect well-tested mechanics, offering some interesting original ideas and above all pushing hard, finally, on environmental interactions and artificial intelligence. Already starting from the commands, we notice an important change of course in Red Dead Redemption 2 with some atypical choices that will force you to adapt to the game, some of which have not fully convinced us. While on the one hand we appreciated the choice of linking the reload to the right trigger, the same button also used to shoot, we found it rather cumbersome to use a front button for horse acceleration with all that it entails in terms of contemporary use of the right analog and the other buttons. Among other things, the commands are very many and it will take several hours to fully master them. Also because at our disposal we will have a sea of objects, gadgets and weapons to find and manage: throwing knives, tomahawks, binoculars, lantern, dynamite and a splendid lasso useful for chasing and hobbling people and animals. To underline the desire for realism and coherence that pervades the gaming experience of Red Dead Redemption 2, we will only be able to bring with us a selection of all this good things, given that the space in Morgan's saddlebag will be limited and we will have to constantly interact with the bags loaded on the saddle of our horse to access the bulkier weapons: once we have chosen the two pistols to insert in the holsters and the two long-barreled guns to load on our shoulders (or the bow) we will be full when we move standing. But we finally get to the three key elements on which the experience of Red Dead Redemption 2 revolves and which move the bar of interactions and immersion in the open world upwards. First of all there is the management of the steed which becomes in all respects the third protagonist of the game immediately after Arthur and the world in which the events take place. The horse is a natural appendage of our avatar as it really happened in the era of the Far West: a man without his horse was lost and its management goes far beyond simply feeding it. In fact, we will be able to develop the bond between us and our faithful travel companion on four levelsthis will involve changes not only in the ~special~ moves that we can make him perform but also and above all in his resistance and vitality, in his docility and in the ability to respond to our call at gradually greater distances (there is a limit beyond which the horse will no longer hear us and we will find ourselves alone in the game environment). We'll have to pet him, pay attention to his needs, tie him up every time we go ashore to visit a shop or go hunting, on pain of seeing him leave to get food or perform other actions according to the breed. In fact, there will be more tame and resistant horses and others more agile and hyperactive, and seeing them succumb during a shootout or a clumsy escape will make you feel your heart leap with the desperate, consequent search for a rescue to be reloaded to avoid the dramatic epilogue that say, among other things, the loss of numerous hours spent to bring it to the maximum level. Secondly, there is the new interaction system with the environment and above all with the characters that literally pervades and radiates the entire gameplay of Red Dead Redemption 2: holding down the left trigger while not holding a weapon and you are observing someone, a context menu will appear with a number of choices that will determine Arthur's behavior. This will be dependent on a huge number of factors, primarily the type of bond that exists between Morgan and the other person. We will be able to greet passersby, threaten them, rob them, try to ease the tension of a situation, pretend to surrender, hit and grab an enemy before beating or strangling him. But also start missions, access all the trading menus, study the fauna and flora and even give basic commands during some quests. Do not neglect these few lines because we can guarantee you that this aspect, which may appear secondary in our trivial description, heavily modifies the way you approach the game and immerse yourself in the world. No more multiple dialogues to choose from or predetermined interactions but a fluid system that exponentially increases the degree of freedom offered to the player. And then there is Arthur Morgan, a protagonist full of facets not only as regards his personality but also and above all as regards his management which, from many points of view, has brought to mind the astounding depth of the never forgotten GTA San Andreas. Basically we will have the three ~cores~ concerning energy, stamina and dead eye, which will decrease over time and which will require constant care to be kept at their best, feeding and resting Arthur. But then there are a whole series of conditions that alter the speed of decrease of these indicators: Arthur can be under or overweight, he can be poisoned, suffer from heat or cold, be under the influence of nicotine or alcohol. Eating, covering up adequately according to the weather, doing constant physical activity, will have concrete repercussions on his physique up to leading to a permanent increase in his statistics represented by the bar surrounding the three cores. This is what is actually consumed when we are hit, when we get tired in the race and use the dead eye. The new frontier of free roaming Red Dead Redemption 2 doesn't just push open worlds forward, it shows with incredible muscle power what it's really like to free roam. Because outside of the story and missions, there is that incredible amount of absolutely optional content that makes Rockstar's new work shine. And we are not talking about simply wandering around the different ecosystems of the nations into which the West recreated on the screen is divided, much less about the hunting and fishing component which also represents a predominant element of the free game experience. There are nearly 200 different animal species, each with its own specific behavior and reaction to the presence of Morgan and other characters and animals along a realistic food chain. We will be able and we will have to hunt them to recover meat, feathers, carcasses, skulls, fangs, bones and skins, essential to access all the upgrades related to Morgan's equipment and the Van Der Linde gang camp. The latter which assumes the value of hub for the management of the most important missions and for maintaining relationships with the members of the criminal gang through a cloud of activities that we can carry out at our discretion and with the times we prefer. We will be able to create baits for carnivores and herbivores and tonics to neutralize the smell of Morgan because yes, its smell can be perceived", "date": "2018-10-25", "grade": "9.6"}
