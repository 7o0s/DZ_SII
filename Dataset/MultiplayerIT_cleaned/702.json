{"name": "Psychonauts - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/psychonauts-recensione.html", "text": "Big head and big brain Starting the game for the first time, one of those latest generation cartoons comes to mind whose only common element is cynicism. Small characters with huge heads who live in an environment where hallucination and reality mix continuously (and not only on a metaphorical level, given that the different levels are set inside the heads of the various characters, including that of the protagonist), this is the fauna that populates the training camp of the Psychonauts. Where the run-in schemes seem more evident, it is possible to perceive a compositional ability that is difficult to find in other titles Big head and big brain Structurally, the game looks like a normal platform game, which tries to propose more adult themes than the competition, however placing them in a light frame suitable for everyone. The control system is quite classic with one key to jump, one to attack with psychic fists and three to use the powers that Raz will acquire along his adventure (there are also other keys to use, but the ones described are the fundamental ones). The game structure is divided between a section set in the various areas of the training camp (the area with the student dormitories, the parking lot, the picnic area, the pier, the secret laboratory and various others) and the levels with a more classic scheme set in the minds of the characters (as already mentioned above). Above all, the latter present various and rather crazy settings determined by the experiences of the protagonists and are the best made part of the game. Thus we will find ourselves traveling through a psychic world that looks like a battlefield or over a rotating cube from which some childhood memories emerge (just to give two examples). The oddities will be wasted throughout the adventure. Visions But it's not only with eccentricity that Psychonauts manage to captivate the player. It has already been said that this is basically a rather classic 3D platformer. However, it is precisely from this classicism that its greatest qualities manage to emerge. Where the run-in schemes seem more evident, it is possible to perceive a compositional ability that is difficult to find in other titles. Rayman 3 itself, the greatest representative of the platform genre on PC, does not reach certain peaks of visionary and excellence in combining individual distinct parts in such a casual and accurate way. Going around the training camp and the various levels we will have to be careful to collect some objects. First the arrowheads that will act as a bargaining chip. These are of two types: those that are found more on the surface (easily identifiable thanks to the purple shimmer they emit) and those that are found deeper (they are worth much more than the others but can only be traced using a tool that can be purchased at the camp shop when used it activates a kind of subgame). Secondly, you will be able to collect cards which, combined with cores that can always be purchased in the shop, will allow you to level up. Inside the psychic worlds you can instead collect crystallized memories that float around the map. These are also used to raise your level. Themes and problems Leveling up is used to be able to use some otherwise blocked objects and to obtain more powerful psychic powers. The latter range from a psychic attack to the possibility of becoming completely invisible. The powers will not be used only in combat but will be a rather active part of the gameplay, allowing you to reach previously inaccessible locations or to collect special objects otherwise unattainable. The control system is very precise and no particular defects have been noticed. The shots do their job optimally and never cause confusion as often happens in titles of this kind, despite the fact that you are sometimes in rather narrow or so strange places that they require a few moments of perceptive adjustment to be addressed. Plot-wise, we're doing incredibly well. The narration is conducted in a perfect way thanks to frequent but non-invasive films and dialogues with the characters who manage to snatch more than a few grins. The main themes range from introspection to the relationships that are established in a community, passing through a rather marked criticism of mind control systems (could television be missing?). The narration is conducted in a perfect way thanks to frequent but non-invasive films What you see and hear From a technical point of view Psychonauts gets along very well with its colorful and stylish graphics (ifalbeit not very rich in terms of polygonal ... but frankly it is not a big problem given the rest). The textures are very good as well as the character models are well done and well characterized (just look at some screenshots to realize this). Moreover, some levels ooze charm from every pore while not presenting particular special effects (moreover demonstrating that putting colored lights everywhere only serves to demonstrate one's inability to design game levels ... but let's leave this controversy flowing) but aiming to create original and unprecedented situations which are not, however, totally out of context. Also from the sound point of view we can only applaud the work done by the Double Fine guys: the music is excellent as are the effects. Too bad there are a few too many bugs that, every now and then, make themselves heard with arrogance croaking in our coffers. Venial sins There are some flaws, unfortunately. In the first place, the duration of the game is not very long (we are talking about just over 12 hours) also by virtue of the general difficulty which settles on rather low levels. If you want to collect everything that can be collected, the situation changes, but obviously we are talking about an extreme case. Another big flaw is the practically zero replayability factor. During the adventure it will happen to take part in some subgames but that's all. Finishing it won't unlock any extra modes or some other secret feature that might make you want to play again. Something more, from this point of view, could certainly have been done. Hardware boxes Psychonauts isn't very demanding in terms of hardware requirements to run properly. With a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM, and a 64MB graphics card, you should be able to run it. We advise you to bring the processor to at least 2 GHz, the RAM to 512 MB and buy a latest or penultimate generation graphics card. The game was tested on a 3.4GHz P4 with 2GB RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT graphics card showing no issues whatsoever. For the record, the following graphics cards are not supported by the game (this list was taken from the official site of the game): NVIDIA Geforce4 MX/MX420/MX440/MX460/MX4000, NVIDIA Geforce4 Go, NVIDIA Quadro2 Go, NVIDIA Quadro4 500 Go , NVIDIA Quadro, NVIDIA Quadro2 Pro, NVIDIA Quadro NVS, NVIDIA Quadro4 280XGL/380XGL/550XGL, Intel 82865G Graphics Controller, Intel 82852/82855 Graphics Controller, Intel 82845G Graphics Controller, Intel 82830M Graphics Controller, Intel 82815 Graphics Controller, Intel 82815 Graphics Controllers, Intel 82810 Graphics Controller, Matrox G450, Matrox G550, Matrox Parhelia. Final comment Psychonauts is a fresh game that doesn't go unnoticed. The search for realism at all costs is leading video games towards a visual and stylistic aridity (especially on PC) which is frankly worrying. Style is the only antidote to flattening and the latest effort by Schafer and partners has plenty to spare. It is also very fun and rewarding. Summing up, we can say that we are facing the best platformer (along with Rayman 3 which has a greater length on its side) existing on PC. Don't let him get away! Pros Stylistically excellent A balanced platformer in all its components Fun and exciting also thanks to a well-told story Cons Not very long Some sound bugs No extra modes It had been years now that the PC could not enjoy an excellent platform game. The use of the past is a must since Psychonauts has arrived. Tim Schafer, ex LucasArts for whom he created masterpieces of the caliber of Grim Fandango, Full Throttle and half Sam & Max Hit the Road, has managed to give this production an over the top visual style that manages to deviate markedly from stale productions semi-realistic averages that haunt the market. The story takes place in a training camp for kids with psychic powers. In the role of Raz (short for Razputin), a big-headed boy who has recently escaped from the circus in which he lived, we will initially have to try to become a Psychonauts (a kind of secret agent) and then unravel an intricate mystery that will involve the entire field.", "date": "2005-12-13", "grade": null}
