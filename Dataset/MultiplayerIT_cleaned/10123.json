Pressing too many buttons on the control panel may not be the best idea in some cases, however, and so the spacecraft on which they are located begins to give the numbers, forcing them to abandon it aboard two separate emergency capsules. Brother and sister therefore end up separating, landing on different planets; but they are immediately greeted warmly by the locals, enthusiastic about the idea of entrusting the management of their fields to a distinguished member of the Farming Federation. In short, after choosing to play Max or Sindy, we find ourselves having a chat with the mayor of the village we landed on. He explains to us that the land is fertile, that we can grow different types of vegetables and that their resale will earn us an interesting nest egg. With the right amount of money, maybe we can buy a new ship and go home? Better to get certain ideas out of your head, at least for the moment. Rather, it's time to roll up your sleeves and devote yourself to agriculture... How many eyes does Uncle Tobia have... Apart from the alien setting, Astro Ranch looks like a classic ~farming game~, in which our objective is the enrichment of the fields through the various stages of work: sowing, watering, any disinfestation and collection. With the money initially available to us, we can go to the local dealer and buy, for example, corn seeds, the cheapest ones, with the aim of obtaining nice cobs to sell. Once we have bought the seeds, let's go back to the field and use the spade to move the ground: just select the tool in question from the inventory for its icon to appear in the upper right part of the screen, then drag this icon onto the area of land we intend to work . With a few squares of loose soil, we select the seeds and in the same way we drag them towards the area where we want to plant them. The rest depends on time and water: the former unfortunately flows very slowly and it is not possible to accelerate it in any way, the latter must be collected at the well and poured using our trusty watering can. Once they have reached their final shape, the cobs can be harvested using the scythe and then deposited at some sort of shipping facility which puts them on the market and pays us back a sum of money. By reinvesting this money we will be able to buy seeds for plants of various kinds, more or less simple to grow and characterized by a different market value. In the event that parasites threaten our plantations, we will have to purchase pesticides and apply them to the affected area before the plant is compromised. During the early stages of the game, this eventuality will have a considerable weight on the results, because pesticides have a certain cost and can only be used once. The standard game action is enriched by the presence of a couple of simple minigames (fishing, above all) which have the task of making us spend the time that divides one ~watered~ from the other as quickly as possible. The only alternative to this solution would in fact be to go to one's ~home~ and sleep for a few hours, then waking up just in time to water the plants and repeating the operation until harvesting. This is not a small limitation, which weighs on the gameplay like a boulder also and above all given the portable nature of the game: it is not really feasible to hold the iPhone in your hand waiting for the minutes to pass, without the possibility of speeding up the time, and in the same way managing increasingly large and needing attention plantations results in a demanding experience, which requires a lot of time and patience. The technical sector is made up of a fairly good graphics, functional to the game but without overdoing it, and a rather repetitive musical accompaniment. The controls are based solely on the touch screen, with the character promptly moving towards the point on the screen that we touch.
