{"name": "In Other Waters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/in-other-waters-recensione.html", "text": "Before diving into the review of In Other Waters for Nintendo Switch, developed by Jump Over the Age (it is also available on PC), two small warnings to clarify, immediately and clearly, who this game is not suitable for. First of all, and without the possibility of contradiction, to those who don't know English well: we are not referring to the ability to read a few posts in online forums, or to write simple sentences with complete meaning. In Other Waters uses a rather complex, highly specific language and, above all, puts words at the heart of the experience: without perfectly understanding the text you will have difficulty continuing, and you will not enjoy the depth offered by the work. Imagine having to go through a text adventure without knowing the language it's written in, and you'll have a clear idea of what might be holding you back in this game. Unfortunately, as we hope is obvious after this premise, In Other Waters is only available in English. Secondly, it is not suitable for action lovers: there is no moment in the adventure where your reflexes are tested, none where the dexterity with the pad is tested in the least. It is a title that is convinced that there are no enemies, no creatures to defeat or kill: as its creator, Gareth Damian Martin, told Vice, In Other Waters consciously shuns the aggressive rats of video games, which, in order to feed their own mechanics, lead the antagonists to hate the hero, sometimes even committing suicide (takes the example of Dark Souls) in order to oppose and stop him. Naturally the speech, it seems trivial to underline it, is not limited to the horrific From Software skeletons: the same role is played by the stunned goombas in Super Mario, or the nice DinDin in Kirby. Enemies that generate conflict, which in turn sets the action in motion. Game Designer and Story The game, initially funded via crowdfunding on Kickstarter, was published by Fellow Traveler, and developed by the newly formed Jump Over the Age, which basically coincides with the aforementioned Gareth Damian Martin, an exceptionally multifaceted person residing in London. Although still young - based on the photos, we have not found the date of birth - he has a long series of activities behind him, which include graphic composition (even for large companies), textual narrative experiences, video art works and a rich production as a video game critic: he collaborated with Edge and Eurogamer, and founded Heterotopias, a magazine focused on spatial architecture in video games. In Other Waters represents his debut as game director, for which he has already received recognition at IndieCade, the prestigious independent video game fair: his expertise emerges clearly in this project which, like it or not, is coherent in every aspect. A little while ago we talked about the absence of enemies, which is important, but represented only one of the elements that make In Other Waters unique. It is a relatively short adventure (about ten hours), whose incipit is rather traditional: Ellery Vas, a xenobiologist, lands on a distant exoplanet, Gliese 667 Cc (actually existing, in the constellation Scorpius), to look for the his missing partner and colleague, Minae Nomura. In both cases we use the feminine, despite the opposite being read in some sites, and in still others the two are alternately reported as male: errors that probably have little to do with a questionable knowledge of English. Storytelling The player does not control Ellery, but the artificial intelligence placed in his blond diving suit. This has many particular consequences. First of all, it justifies the atypical graphical interface: the entire exploration of the seabed takes place through a radar/navigator. In addition to being visually appreciable, it is very satisfying from a tactile point of view: navigation with the mouse is faster and more intuitive, but even with the Switch buttons it is decidedly satisfying (if desired, the touch screen is also supported, which to us seemed a cumbersome compromise between mouse and keys). With the right stick you control the radar, to be placed above flora and fauna, so as to examine it; with arrows and backbones you manage the other functions, such as returning to the base, but above all the collection of marine creatures (animals and plants). As an artificial intelligence, one can only answer ~yes~ or ~no~ to Ellery, who therefore must above all be listened to in his numerous utterances. The most distinctive element of the adventure is precisely this: the xenobiologist, in addition to being our only companion, also represents most of our senses. Through his words we see the microorganisms, we imagine the strong corrents, the abyssal differences in height, the mucous rocky protrusions. Only once collected and analyzed in the laboratory, can we see the sketches of the flora and fauna of Gliese 667 Cc: the only concrete look granted to us at its ecosystem, otherwise limited to an abstract representation including circles, triangles and sinuous lines on a background (initially ) cyan. An appreciable narrative device, which as we said assumes an adequate knowledge of English: the descriptions are not communicated by a science communicator, but by a biologist who processes information for an artificial intelligence, therefore the linguistic register is very specific. In this area, Martin's work has been painstaking: despite being invented organisms, the study they involved is evident. They don't exist but, as far as we know, they could exist: and this, in works of fiction, is what matters most. We wrote earlier that Ellery translates the abstract shapes of the map into sensory sensations: it is true, but there is an important exception. We are referring to the sounds of the marine universe, great protagonists of exploration. The sound designer is Amos Roddy, and his work is valuable and engaging, declined on the basis of the impetus of the currents, and the depth of the abyss. The game From a narrative point of view, In Other Waters is a mature work in every aspect. Without any pedantry, or hint of didacticism, she seriously tackles the relationship between man and the environment, elaborates - especially with remote messages - a complex relationship between two biologists, recreates in a credible way the dynamics of a possible alien exploration, very different from heroic acts , or warfare, to which other science fiction video games have accustomed us. Marine biology itself is treated with particular care and love, both in the creation of alien organisms and - above all, in our opinion - in the academic language used to describe them. The absence of enemies constitutes a strong stance, both structural and ideological. Unfortunately, in terms of level design, In Other Waters does not prove to be up to the other components. We're not referring to the fact that it's not particularly funny, in the most trivial sense of the term: that's a prerogative we accept, consistent with a work of this kind. It is the very architecture of the game that is more banal than the narrative content (textual, visual and audio) it hosts. We try to explain it to you as simply as possible. Think Metroid: you are alone in an unexplored alien planet. Add the colleague you are looking for: your goal, while analyzing the surrounding flora and fauna, is to locate it and, possibly, find it again. Remove all enemies. Expand the importance of scanning. Change shot, and limit it to that of a radar. Now view everything from a map, as if you were consulting a navigator, and imagine being able to move only in the points pre-established by the developer, in a linear way. The microorganisms you have removed reappear almost immediately. To advance in the game, all you have to do is understand how to face the trivial environmental challenges: in practice, you have to figure out how to reach the next ~dot on the map~, which is temporarily forbidden due to some strong current, the presence of some strange plant, etc... Every time you have to find, collect and finally use the right element in order to continue. The phases in which the player gets stuck are decontextualizing: Ellery stops talking, and the movements are confined to the linear path drawn by the developer, waiting to figure out how to expand it. In these situations it is difficult to see with the eyes of the protagonist, to perceive the finely evoked depths of the sea, and often we find ourselves staring at a simple, limited radar with essential geometric shapes.", "date": "2020-04-13", "grade": "7.0"}
