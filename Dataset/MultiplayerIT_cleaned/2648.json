{"name": "X-squad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-squad.html", "text": "Ash, Maja, Melinda? But what names are they? You start playing as Ash , then gradually meet the other members of the team, Maja , Melinda and the rocky Judd. And here we immediately encounter the first peculiarity of the EA title: these are not simple supporting actors, but will have a decisive weight in the evolution of history. In fact, it is possible to dialogue with them, give them simple orders and use their equipment. The setting exemplifies the idea behind games such as Rainbow Six and Swat: through a menu that can be accessed quickly using the square button, we can order and therefore coordinate the movements of the group: there is no possibility of assigning so-called rally points , but at least the friends of the group will do exactly what they are told: once the order has been received, a window appears at the top left in which our companion can be seen accepting and willingly carrying out the task assigned to him Follow me home! Baby! The main commands are: follow, i.e. the order is given to follow the leader, recon, patrolling, stay, firm and good everyone!!, attack and spread, which means to spread out and keep a safe distance from each other when attacks. You can also establish the strategy, the attitude to take towards the mission: assault and stealth. Clearly the first involves a head-on collision with the enemy, the second instead favors the element of surprise, hitting from behind and then running away. Another very important cooperative element is, as previously mentioned, the sharing of the inventory: various weapons, bullets, objects and medkits can be assigned to any member of the team. Consequently, choosing whether and what to take from one's own or others' inventory assumes enormous strategic importance: do I take care of myself or do I take care of my dying partner? Am I impractical with the sniper rifle? So let's give it to someone more capable than me!! More or less the choices are of this type, and combining them with the commands and strategies to be assigned, will heavily influence the solution of certain passages. As a result, the replayability of the title is encouraged. To briefly define the setting of X Squad we can say that the arcade component, if you'll pass me the term, prevails over the more purely simulation one. Ultimately, the action prevails over the strategy, we rely more on weapons than on gray matter, but the right mix of the two components is very spot on. We are not facing the new Metal Gear, the basics are the same, but the development is extremely different. After this long preamble, which I thought was right to do, given the not very easy placement of the title in a single genre, let's talk about X Squad from a more technical point of view, the graphics. Some things are very nice, some are not. Exhaustive as ever, I would say! 4 I have a new job! I infiltrate enemy bases... The fact is that we go from values of excellence to shocking mediocrity. The team members are in fact built, textured and animated to perfection. The models of team X are exceptional: Ash, our man, is incredible: Not content to amaze us with levels of detail that are nothing short of paroxysmal, such as the tight-fitting gray Juventus model shirt that reflects as if it were a shiny mirror, in addition to the face and The hairline, also gray, intoxicates us with scary animations. Seeing Ash as he warily wanders around the base and even sees his pupils rolling is an absolutely incredible experience. The light effects are normal, but various mists and vapors are beautiful. The same goes for teammates, while the enemies inside the base pay the price for a lower level of detail. The realization of the backdrops is unfortunately quite mediocre: they are poor in detail, the textures seem squashed on the polygons, and not delicately supported. In addition, the construction of the various locations is not very varied: it seems to wander around in endless Quake maps waiting for someone to catch us from behind. It lacks that something that gives an extra touch of likelihood to a clearly artificial world. The control method can give the impression of being terribly complicated, in fact using all the keys on the pad, backbones and analog sticks included. Instead after a few minutes you can master everything perfectly. Moving the viewfinder and camera using the 2 sticks is simultaneously easy to do but terribly inaccurate. You almost never manage to be precise in aiming, and even enabling the autoaim option will do you goodlittle. 5 Dangerous for my life? No! I have the memory card! Camera management forces us to change the shooting angle of the action on the run, and when you have a lot of people on you, this usually leads to premature death. As is now customary in any self-respecting stealth game we will be offered the opportunity to look out from behind the walls, the so-called lean, which allows us to avoid costly head-on collisions. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is good overall, even if they sometimes prove to be unresponsive. It often happens that after hearing something they absolutely do not go to check what it is. However, they too will concert group actions, without however giving the impression of being really involved in what they do. Another peculiarity that makes X Squad lean more towards action and arcade than pure strategy and simulation is the variety of movements that we can perform. In fact, if it weren't for the third person view, it would seem like playing any FPS. All the main movements are borrowed from titles like Quake and company. The end-of-level bosses are overcome with an infinite series of circular strafes that are very fun and satisfying to perform, but which give the impression of being out of tune in a title built as a ~group stealth intrusion simulator~. 6 A great idea! Indeed a trivial game! In summary, the EA title is full of contradictions: it wants to be a ~serious~ title, but in the end it's more of a third-person Quake than a simplified Rainbow Six. It should therefore be fun and compulsive, but in the long run the levels are very similar to each other, boredom comes and we go on more for the honor of signing than anything else. Taken as an outlier shooter that does its job, it's more suited to newbies than those who have finished Half Life, Thief and Metal Gear. In short, a product ruined by an excess of simplification, which wastes nothing short of brilliant solutions, such as the evolution of rpg model characters, to try to satisfy even those who had never heard of titles of this genre. Excellent starting ideas, but trivialized by a realization and a global setting that is absolutely not up to par. 7 X-Squad! X Squad is the first in a long line of action-stealth games that will surely invade the PS2 in the months to come. The plot is the same: what happened to the staff of the super secret base? We send a nice team experienced in unofficial missions and clean everything properly, that's it! 1", "date": "2001-01-11", "grade": null}
