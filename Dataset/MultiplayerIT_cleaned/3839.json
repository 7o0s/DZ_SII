In those parts the boundaries between standard use on PC and game on mobile platforms have gradually blurred and the conversions of well-known titles on smartphones are even more successful than the original versions, as demonstrated by shooters like PUBG Mobile and MMOs like Lineage 2. In this review of Aion: Legions of War we see how NCsoft has chosen a slightly different path, taking advantage of the name now known also in the West to launch a game that is substantially different from the one we have known on PC. The story and the setting relate directly to the MMORPG, but Legions of War presents itself as an RPG with turn-based combat with an extremely linear structure and focused on storytelling and character management. In short, as easily predictable, it is another role-playing game that fits into what has become a real sub-genre on mobile platforms: also in this case we find ourselves undertaking quests that are preset and do not allow a free exploration of the game world, making us follow a pre-established path composed of progressive PvE fights, culminating with bosses and subsequent narrative moments that carry the story forward. The spirit is decidedly different from that typical of the MMORPG, with practically zero exploration and total concentration on strategic combat and party building and management, but the connection with Aion is still firmly established by an excellent treatment of the reference lore and a story that fits well into the original world, as fans of the PC game especially will appreciate. Strategy and gacha The party is based, as per tradition, on a central nucleus made up of the main characters who carry on the story, but the choice of fighters to be deployed in battle is destined to expand dramatically with the classic gacha dynamic, in this case with crystals to summon containing new characters with different rarity levels. This, in addition to the energy that is consumed in the game rounds, introduces the usual element related to monetization, since it is a free-to-play. The characters are well characterized, supported both by an excellent character design and by a truly remarkable modeling, as well as the entire graphic sector of Aion: Legions of War, truly a prominent element for this NCsoft production. Since party management is a central element of the gaming experience, the care in the representation of the characters and in their construction in terms of characteristics and skills is of fundamental importance and is also reflected in the depth of the evolution of the fighters, as well as in the good variety of special skills and fighting styles. Having eliminated practically all the other typical elements of the RPG, the combat remains the other element on which the interaction is based, even if this is above all indirect: apart from the use of auto-battle, recommended in the grinding phases , in fact, the game only requires you to activate the special skills at the right time, in the heat of combat. What is much more important is then the battlefield preparation phase, with the selection of the units to be deployed, their disposition and the tactical attitude to be adopted by the team among the pre-set ones. For the rest, everything is based on the evolution of the characters, which determines the appearance of new skills and also the transformation of these, in some cases, the use of equipment and the right balance of forces to be deployed on the field. The game provides several possibilities to conquer new fighters and accumulate bonuses and experience through the usual side commitments as well as story missions, between timed quests and other similar activities, but obviously all these possibilities must be well balanced based on the expenditure of energy which require. From this point of view, Aion: Legions of War has no worse mechanics than many other similar titles, but those who don't appreciate forced breaks are better off looking elsewhere.", "date": "2019-02-01", "grade": "7.0"}
