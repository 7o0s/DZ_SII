{"name": "Hero of Sparta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hero-of-sparta.html", "text": "The Java platform has its limits, and there's no arguing about that; but it is also true that sometimes limits are made to be exceeded. In this sense, the mobile video game scene is terribly similar to that of 16-bit consoles: some surprising titles at launch (Sonic for Mega Drive, for example), then the clash with the harsh reality of technical limitations, which castrates developer skills; finally, the research that leads to the birth of products that previously seemed impossible (see Donkey Kong Country for Super Nintendo). It is a more or less long process, built one step at a time, while perhaps mediocre productions are wasted all around. In short, a game like Hero of Sparta on mobile had to arrive, sooner or later ... it only remained to be seen who would make it. No wonder it was Gameloft, in the end: they are one of the busiest companies in the industry, with the resources and talent to accomplish this task. The protagonist of Hero of Sparta is clearly a Spartan soldier, who finds himself having to challenge even a god to free his people from the invasion of monsters and creatures of all kinds. The similarities with God of War abound, and the homage to the action game created by David Jaffe becomes even clearer when our character receives chains to expand his arsenal, chains that are thrown like a whip towards enemies to tear them to shreds, through combos that are as spectacular as they are devastating. However many moves you can perform (attacks vary depending on the weapon used, and the latter can be equipped by pressing the right soft key), combat always remains extremely simple, with only the 5 key used to attack and a system detection of opponents that often automatically directs our shots. To perform the special move (each weapon has one), you must always hold down the 5 key and wait for the relative bar to fill up, then launch yourself on enemies and chop them up in many different ways. We won't just have to fight, however: Hero of Sparta is organized as a high-level action game, in the sense that we will often find puzzles to solve to continue within the thirteen stages available, and in some cases between one location and another we will be able to fight in an arena, eventually conquering new weapons and objects. The most innovative element, both technically and structurally, however, concerns the hybrid nature of this product, which during the action changes its structure from the classic scrolling fighting game with a three-quarter view to an action game with purely two-dimensional platform elements. The ~switch~ also occurs several times within a single stage, and is revealed through a surprising and ingenious graphic effect, which ~distorts~ some areas of the background to make them collide with the new setting. This is not the only touch of class inserted by the developers, however: apart from the exceptional variety in opponents and situations, we will be able to see in some cases a ~blur~ effect that underlines the power of a particular combo or grip . The management of the jumps changes according to the view, and in the ~fighting~ phases it proves to be really simple: just lean over and hold down the d-pad in the desired direction, and then release it. In this way, dying accidentally becomes quite difficult, but we will still have the possibility to continue the game from the last checkpoint: also in this sense, the Gameloft product behaves like a video game for consoles, thanks to an automatic save system. The graphics of the game are extraordinary, and it stands as a yardstick for the next action games. The main character does not have extremely fluid animation, but compensates for the amount of movements: each weapon has different attack maneuvers, and we must not forget the phases in which we jump or climb. The quantity also distinguishes the sprites of the opponents we will have to face, really numerous and very varied in appearance and characteristics. The level design is exceptional, with many moving objects, interactable elements and original and spectacular solutions: in the early stages we will have to deal with a huge monster that wants to crush us, later we will even face a stone colossus... In all this splendour, the sound manages to do its job in the best possible way: the music is excellent, as are the sampled effects, a shame about the small number. Pros: Amazing graphics Addictive and varied gameplay Longevity much higher than average Against: Response to commands not always punctual Sound can cause slowdowns on some terminalsthe", "date": "2008-12-10", "grade": "S.V."}
