{"name": "NBA Street Homecourt - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-street-homecourt-recensione.html", "text": "A pitch and many stars For those who have never played NBA Street, it is fair to point out that it is a series dedicated to street basketball, 3 against 3, which draws inspiration from the famous NBA Jam, a title that has been played in arcades over the years they were always exerted a tremendous fascination and that he saw basketball players make absurd baskets with mega jumps and incredible evolutions. Things haven't changed that much, but they have been improved, refined up to this episode called Homecourt which presents the game of basketball in its ~imaginative~ variant, immediate, frenetic, with purely arcade and spectacular content. What matters in this saga, brought to the console for the first time in 2001, is not so much how many baskets we will make, it is obvious that to win it is necessary to score more points than the opponent, but above all the number of evolutions that we will be able to put into practice on the playground . Alley-hoops, behind-the-back passes and reverse dunks are almost trivial in a game like NBA Street Homecourt, where passes are also made with the foot, perhaps by bouncing the ball on the opponent's face, the basket bends and shakes after each dunk performed by athletes, for whom the force of gravity is certainly relative. After each score, the evolutions that we have accomplished with our three players will be added up and will increase our ~style~ points, when we reach a certain limit threshold we will be able to unleash the gamebreaker by going to a particular area in the center of the field and pressing the Y key, which is nothing but a sort of super move or rather it makes our basketball players able to perform even more spectacular evolutions and in practice almost unstoppable. dunks are the heart of show time on display in the most famous American playgrounds The control system is practically perfect for supporting our every decision in the field. With simplicity we will be able to pass the ball, jump to the basket, perform feints and particular evolutions and in the same way during the defensive phase block, capture a rebound or make a ~still~ by stealing the ball from the opponents. The simplified dribbling method, now performed simply with the X and Y keys, works very well allowing us to move certainly effective and always imaginative, above all if pressing the aforementioned keys we place the two back bumpers RB and LB side by side, which allow us to carry out variations of the aforementioned moves with which to ~joke~ the opponents. As already mentioned, the dunks are the heart of the show time that we showcase on the most famous American playgrounds. Without frills and by pressing the B button, we will see our champion jump into the air, often exceeding the height of the basket, and perform a devastating slam dunk. The most important variant that has been included in this Homecourt is the ~double~, i.e. the player, once he has placed the ball in the basket, takes it back to throw it back with even greater force back into the basket, giving life to surreal movements but very fluid and with a deadly impact. Consider that each dunk of this type is worth two points (we just remind you that in street basketball shots from the three-point area are worth 2 and all other baskets only 1). In practice, every time we jump to perform a slam dunk an indicator appears on the screen which rises as a result of how long we hold down the B key, holding down the pressure for too long our player will hit the iron and the ball will jump in the air, if instead we use the right timing, releasing the button right at the end of the stroke the ~double~ is guaranteed. Obviously the brace can also be performed during a gamebreaker, thus giving life to a triple dunk, a real atomic bomb and a heavy blow for any opponent. NBA Street Homecourt is available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The version used for this review is the Xbox 360 version. When the grass is cut the snake... Without neglecting all kinds of encounters, from quick games with NBA stars, to personalized encounters, with or without gamebreakers, trick competitions, or a true return to the origins without evolutions and without gamebreakers, the real heart of the game is the 'homecourt challenge. The homecourt challenge involves the creation of our basketball player, the one who will be the leader of the team and can never be replaced, with an exceptional editor that will allow us to better customize our player in his own face, putting together the characteristics of basketball stars American. After doing this, we will have to choose two other teammates and thus the series of challenges will begin, through the most famous American playgrounds, from the historic Goat to Venice Beach, from Franklin Park and Cloverdale Co.urts at Ash Park. Each location contains several challenges, which vary both according to the difficulty but also by the type of match required, not only classic competitions but also challenges with long shots, or different types such as assigning the victory to the first team that is three or five points the other. The reward for each victory will be in terms of reputation, allowing us not only to unlock precious items, such as Jordan designer shoes or fashionable uniforms, but above all to challenge increasingly stronger teams while enhancing our character. Bargnani, the Magician, has become one of ours When the grass is cut the snake... In fact, after each victory his personal characteristics, his passing ability, dexterity with the ball, physical power, dunking or shooting ability, will improve and our athlete will level up. Upon reaching the fifth level we will be able to decide to enhance only one of the characteristics to the maximum, making it our ~freak attitude~ and making us unbeatable in that specialty. At the tenth level we will earn the respect of other players and with it a damn cool nickname. During the clashes we will meet teams in which the stars and starlets of the NBA and the WNBA (the women's professional league) play, and the further possibility given is to include one of the defeated opponents in your team, we cannot hide from you that after beating Bargnani, with great pride we enlisted him and the Magician became one of ours. The challenges on the whole are always interesting and stimulating, certainly in the long run, after having strengthened our team sufficiently, the game starts to get boring, also thanks to a level of difficulty set downwards. Luckily there is Xbox Live. Technically The little gem baked by EA is really a feast for the eyes, we confess that we were really surprised by the goodness of the EA Sports Big engine. The polygonal models of the players are exceptional, not only for the extreme resemblance to the real-life counterparts, but also for the fact that they are detailed in every aspect. Playing shirtless we see the players sweat and become ~shiny~ in the sun, the official NBA uniforms have been recreated perfectly and move in a decidedly realistic way, swaying according to the movements of the athletes. Cuffs, nets, bands and elbow pads, shoes, all the accessories have been reproduced in the same way, it seems to be on the field with the athletes. Up to here in our analysis we have kept away from what is certainly the greatest value of NBA Street Homecourt and that is the animations, with all the crazy and out of the norm evolutions (one above all the breakdance during the gamebreaker) we would have could turn up their noses if the realization had been insufficient, perhaps with shots and with ~packed~ characters. None of this, the champions move with exceptional fluidity, moving from one posture to another seamlessly, in one movement as smooth as oil, that's why seeing our athlete dunk with two hands, after a super jump, hanging from the basket and at the same time recovering the ball from the basket with your feet to then take it back in your hand and crush after a half overhead kick, is priceless. In this episode of the saga the collisions have been treated very well, and it will very often happen to see two players collide and fall to the ground after a jump or it will be possible to make the rival already on the ground ~stretch out~ like a trampoline, who does not wait other than the partner to throw him to the basket. Physicality is all there in this excellent EA game, we only hide from you some sporadic, but really rare, slowdowns in the most intricate situations, as well as some little problems in the depth perception phase, with the result of losing the ball remaining stone. The online is certainly not a merely accessory part, it is instead complete by presenting all sorts of possibilities and all kinds of challenges among those available even in the single mode, the only exception, and here we can only admit its lack, there is no online career mode, a certainly relevant flaw. Goals 360 NBA Street Homecourt offers all players the chance to get 1000 points for a total of 16 goals, the first 500 points can be obtained after the first 3-4 hours of play but to earn the remaining 500 we will have to suffer. Certainly the most demanding challenge is those of the ten online victories, in the same way it will require us to create two different characters and bring them both to a level above the tenth. The competitions are varied and also help in the developmentuppour of our gaming ability, making 4 gamebreakers in a single match, completing 10 tricks or completing 3 double dunks in a single match are just a few examples. Comment NBA Street Homecourt is a decidedly well-finished product from all points of view, from the gameplay to the exceptional graphic impact. Of course it is 3 against 3 arcade basketball and, if you don't like the genre, it is pointless to take it into consideration, but we can only recommend it to all sports lovers in general, both for the immediacy and for the exaltation that we ourselves we tried scoring baskets in the craziest ways. Wanting to go looking for the classic hair in the egg, we should point the finger at the rather reduced longevity, once a good level team has been built, also due to a difficulty adjusted downwards with the risk that the game loses interest after a while time. To remedy this problem there is the online front, which however of all the methods present does not offer the most demanding one, namely the career. On balance, however, we can only recommend the new EA Sports title. Pros Immediate and engaging Technically very good Offline and online alike... Cons ... online career is lacking Longevity only sufficient The Next Gen continues to flex its muscles in every sense, given the exaggerated physiques of the basketball players who are the protagonists of the game and above all given the excellent graphic level achieved with this new episode of the famous Electronic Arts house series, Nba Street. What can we expect from Nba Street Homecourt, if not the same ingredients that, taken from Nba Jam, have brought this brand to success? Obviously the improvements and tweaks are there, and they are ~heavier~ than one might think, all raised to the highest levels thanks to the power of new hardware and high definition. However, follow us in our review to fully discover the spectacular new game by EA Sports.", "date": "2007-03-23", "grade": null}
