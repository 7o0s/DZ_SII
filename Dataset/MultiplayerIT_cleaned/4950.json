{"name": "Ritorno a Faeria", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181679-faeria-ritorno-a-faeria.html", "text": "2017 is certainly the year of the explosion of trading card games and Faeria, from the Belgian team Abrakam, throws itself into the fray trying to detach itself from the crowd with a profoundly different game structure that combines board games with trading card games. After all, today there is only the embarrassment of choice: Hearthstone by Blizzard dominates all but there are also other titles that take up the basics differing only in some mechanics such as, for example, the Japanese Shadowverse by Cygames or The Elder Scrolls: Legends and Gwent which instead draw from the setting of The Elder Scrolls and The Witcher; in short, so on and so forth. So what is responsible for the niche of supporters that Faeria is carving out for itself and which has brought it more than 500,000 active players? Let's remember the basics: in the lower part there is your charming turquoise Leprechaun avatar (one of the many available) protected in his glass bubble, in the upper part there is your opponent and, to divide you, there is water and a grid made up of 31 hexagons on which it is possible, at each turn, to place a piece of land and minions on it. To win you need to get the minions from your enemy and lower his victory points from 20 to zero. Each turn the game provides faeria, the mana needed to pay the summoning cost of your cards, whether they are minions or spells, but in the four corners of the game grid there are as many fountains that produce them continuously and it will be vital to check them to have a quantity greater. As? By placing a minion in any hex adjacent to them. So here we find ourselves playing two different games that act in synergy: one of placing territories and the other, more familiar, made up of battles between creatures and support spells. It's certainly not the easiest of games of this type that we've tried but, going into specifics, let's try to see what makes Faeria such a challenging game. Faeria successfully manages to mix board game elements with trading cards The settlers of... Faeria The placement part of Faeria has a fundamental role that could initially displace players less accustomed to such a significant game complexity, just think that to the normal cost of the cards, in order to be able to launch them, you must add the necessary territory requirement which can be of different types: neutral, forest, desert, mountain and lake, all (except the neutral) identified by the colors green, yellow, red and blue respectively. It doesn't end there, a creature belonging to a certain color also has another summoning requirement and must only be placed on the territory of its own color. In summary, there are three parameters to keep under control: the cost in faeria, the cost in quantity of specific territories and the positioning of the creature on the right territory which, mind you, must be your territory and not the enemy's. The cards are the part of the game, as mentioned, in which we will immediately feel at home but, even here, their typology must be clearly specified, starting with those that remain permanently on the ground, which are of two types, creatures and structures. Creatures have an attack and defense score and can have Taunt which forces other adjacent ones to attack them, Last Words which activates on death, Gift which activates when it enters the field, Smash which allows you to move X spaces in line straight only to summoning, Charge which keeps the ability just described constant, Leap which allows the creature to move two squares by stepping over anything in front of it and Fly (so dear to old players of Magic: the Gathering) which allows you to pass over hexes where there is no territory. Structures, on the other hand, only have life points and, in addition to sharing some abilities with creatures, they have some of their own such as Production, which activates its effect at the beginning of each turn, or Activate, which instead is activated by us when we want respecting the written conditions. The other cards present are the spells for which it is enough to pay the cost in faeria and have the necessary territories to be launched and activated immediately: in addition to all the previously mentioned abilities, the specific rules of the cards are always clearly written in the box below the illustration. Matter of choices We explain the basic gameplay: it is possible to change cards at the beginning of the game (the classic ~mulligan~) and you receive 3 mana per turn, moreover, whoever goes second receives Explore, a zero-cost neutral card that provides 2 faeria and, if what has been said so far still seems little to you, Abrakam has well thought of giving the player,at each turn, a list of truly remarkable possible choices: you can add an extra mana, draw a card, place two neutral hexagons or a specific one. The decks, of up to 30 cards, can be made up of as many colors as you want and many cards have double, triple or quadruple territory requisites such as, for example, the very strong though absurd spell Tre Desideri which, in order to be cast, needs 3 mana and 2 territories of each color and which gives you 3 life, as well as receiving a copy of 3 cards from the opponent's deck, reducing their cost by 3 faeria. Without taking anything away from the crazy multicolored decks, it's easier to become familiar with the characteristics of a color only by supporting it to the maximum with neutral cards (which only cost in mana). Starting this way will help you understand the different characteristics of the various colors: green generally tends to increase the power and toughness of allied minions or to gain life points, red has many cards and minions that deal direct damage to the opposing avatar or its creatures, blue has less need to have territories built as it can summon minions with the Aquatic characteristic that can pass over lakes or water not covered by territories and finally, yellow has the classic characteristics of speed, therefore with minions with charge and smaller creatures to sacrifice to power up others. There is also no limit to the number of faeria that can be accumulated and, if you wonder what you would do with so much mana, know that there are also cards whose cost is greater than 20 and that the games are generally much longer than those of Hearthstone, on average 15 minutes, which does not make it very usable for those with little time. A fairy style As we had already highlighted in our test some time ago, the illustrations have a very particular style and sometimes it seems to be in front of the paintings in a painting exhibition. The rarity is not difficult to identify through the colored rhombus in the lower part of the card, moreover also the type of the card is easily recognizable since the upper part of the border has a different shape depending on whether it is a spell, a minion or of a structure. The graphical interface has been improved compared to the early access phase as well as the game menus and tutorials which have undergone changes useful for navigation and deck construction. The musical sector is of a good standard and the various melodies present make wise use of piano and violins without ever becoming monotonous. The single-player campaign offers challenges against artificial intelligence of increasing difficulty but the presence of puzzles in which you will have to try to figure out how to win in a certain number of rounds is very interesting. Overcoming these challenges gives you access to rewards such as in-game coins useful for the purchase of chests containing the cards (no envelopes finally!). In this regard, it is worth remembering that the game has become completely free and that purchases can be made, as well as with real money, with coins and gems at fairly average prices and, in the same way as the other games of this like, you can also destroy your own cards to get crystals that you can use to create more. Steam also offers a paid package that, for  31.99, gives you 10 chests with cards, 3 mythical chests (inside which there are the mythic cards, equivalent to the golden Hearthstone, and unique card backs) , 3250 gems, a month of Goki (a sort of assistant miner who brings you 5000 coins immediately, adding more daily for a month) and a special back. The other two game modes are the classic ranked match and the Pandora mode, a sort of Arena in which you will build the deck by choosing cards from a proposed squad. The title, completely localized in Italian, was released for PC and iPad and the development team seems intent on giving a strong competitive eSports imprint, so much so that it has organized, in the early access phase alone, tournaments with over $30,000 in prizes up for grabs . Finally, we tell you that an adventure is planned for the summer that will add cards, a cooperative mode and new battles with artificial intelligence.", "date": "2017-04-05", "grade": "8.0"}
