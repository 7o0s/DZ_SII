{"name": "Pop! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pop-recensione.html", "text": "Slightly effervescent On the screen, which continuously scrolls vertically, a large amount of bubbles of different colors scroll. By pointing the remote control at them and pressing A or B, they pop. Essentially, this is the basis of the game, a sort of shooting gallery with bubbles as targets. A classic superstructure made up of bonuses, combos and multipliers comes to life on this rig. Smaller bubbles are worth more points, bigger ones are less. By hitting multiple overlapping bubbles, their score will be added up, while by concentrating and trying to hit bubbles of the same color, we'll activate a chain, which will multiply the score progressively. To complicate things, there is an impending stopwatch that relentlessly marks a countdown: once we reach zero, of course, we are faced with a game over. To prolong the time you need to get better and better scores, therefore you should never let your concentration drop as you progress through the levels, since it is not enough to try to never hit ~empty~ (i.e. miss the bubbles), but you will have to also maintain an excellent level of performance to delay the countdown. Periodically, bubbles appear on the screen containing various symbols and causing different effects: there are those that multiply the score by the marked number, those that slow down screen scrolling, or those to avoid, which drastically reduce the time available or create potentially harmful (but also positive, if you manage to contain them) chain effects, and many others. Game modes include training, free and main mode, with progressive levels and active time limit. The ~advanced~ mode is basically a more difficult version of the latter. Note the presence of updated rankings through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the presence of which is definitely pleasing. Comment Detached from the commercial context, Pop gets along as a puzzle game without particular infamy, but clearly without even being able to boast any praise. The game mechanic actually works, in its immense simplicity. However, the incentive to continue for more than a few games is missing, given that the variations that are encountered are really small, and the graphic aspect really does the minimum to fulfill its function. Everything takes on a completely different dimension if we take into consideration the 700 Wii Points necessary for the purchase: the outlay of this figure is largely unjustified due to the lack of effort put into creating the game, and if we think that for the same price there are much more deserving Virtual Console titles. Pros Simple and functional mechanics Online leaderboards Cons Technically poor Monotonous in short Expensive, compared to what it offers Pop! is available for download on the Nintendo Wii WiiWare. The scaffolding of digital delivery at affordable prices clearly leads to the offer of small-sized games, capable of entertaining the right amount within minimal periods of time, and capable of being re-played several times. There is little space for complex stories and long, linear structures, optimizing space and resources involves studying a game that immediately hits the target, which inserts the player in medias res and immediately captures his attention, because in direct comparison with major productions, clearly, a WiiWare title is unlikely to come out on top, if it fights on its own turf. This need for containment can lead to two extreme consequences: the brilliant flash of some who manage to build a decidedly valid game even if based on a limited production, and playing on originality and characterization (as happened with LostWinds), or the general flattening of many others, who have tried to hit the target by minimizing the risk to be undertaken. The latter usually opt for the puzzle game: this genre allows the developers to be released from the long and complex study phases on the subjects to be treated, on how to present them to the public, and on how to build effective gameplay on them, jumping directly to the crux of the matter. As in this Pop, which can be summed up in three words: bursting bubbles. It's almost embarrassing to tell (on the other hand, by summarizing the structure of a puzzle game, more complex results are hardly obtained), but in essence it is all there is to say about the concept behind the game. Wii Remote in hand, we'll have to aim at the screen and hit the soap bubbles, obviously trying to maximize the score in various ways.", "date": "2008-07-28", "grade": null}
