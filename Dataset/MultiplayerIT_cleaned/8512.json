The evil Sauron, frustrated by living constantly stuffed inside a black and menacing armor, without even the possibility of taking it off to go to the bathroom (imagine that aquarium at the height of the groin), inspired by the Divine Otelma, before he left for the Isle of Famous Elves, forges a kitsch ring with which he wants to try to take control of Middle-earth. On his way he finds Frodo, a little Hobbit who spends far too much time with his gaffiere, Sam Gangee, arousing suspicions in the meddling neighbors. Actually Frodo had no intention of bothering Sauron. It was Gandalf, in cahoots with Aragorn, also called Strider for the speed with which he runs away in front of his enemies, who involved him. Wait, we're getting word that we're writing about the wrong ring. Oh well, but about a game called The Book of Unwritten Tales, can a poor editor write whatever he likes? All right, put down those machetes you risk ruining my skunk knee hairdo. The title of KING Art, masterfully translated into Italian (so we avoid someone asking in the comments... pious illusion) tells the story of the gremlin archaeologist MacGuffin and a powerful ring that can determine the fate of the world. The war has been raging menacingly for years and all the factions in the field seem to want the MacGuffin artifact for them, perhaps rarer than the underwear worn by Sara Tommasi. Obviously the forces of darkness are the most motivated and organized and send their best agents to take the ring. Will the four unlikely heroes selected at random from a telephone directory of good to prevent the circular object from falling into the wrong hands? Only the resolution of a myriad of puzzles will establish it... Where's my rubber chicken? The Book of Unwritten Tales is a very classic 2D graphic adventure that points (and clicks) all about bringing back to mind a time when we gamers were happier because video games were smarter. Actually the graphics are modeled in 3D, but the structure is essentially two-dimensional. The interface is immediate: with the mouse you move the pointer, with the two keys you interact with the objects. The inventory is located at the bottom of the screen and can be recalled at any time. Right from the start, in which some of the protagonists are introduced, the desire to refer to the classic LucasArts titles such as Monkey Island or Sam & Max is clear, but it is not difficult to see the influence of Simon The Sorcerer (fortunately not of last). The dialogues exude sympathy and irony, with dazzling jokes that accompany the resolution of the puzzles and which never appear forced. Let's take for example one of the playable protagonists, the dwarf Wilbur, an unwilling hero and cog in a story much bigger than him, who captures the user's affection with his melancholy sarcasm (vaguely reminiscent of the protagonist of The Whispered World, also if with less background pessimism). In one of the first puzzles he must be able to satisfy the requests of his slightly touchy grandfather, unfortunately the only one who listens to him concerns a fact that we do not anticipate, and to do so he will have to unleash a great ingenuity that will lead him to end up thrown into the sky in a sort of giant suppository. We stop here so as not to spoil the twists and turns with inopportune advances, but we hope you have understood the general tone of the dialogues and situations in which you find yourself entangled throughout the adventure. Light as air The puzzles are many and, on balance, we are faced with a long and articulated adventure, with levels full of hot spots (which can be underlined by pressing a button). Going forward in the story it becomes possible to use more characters (actually the resolution of the puzzles changes little or nothing, except on rare occasions), a feature that adds a certain variety. Of course, on average the difficulty of the individual puzzles is quite low, but it will still take about twenty hours to get to see the ending. Moreover, in the last two chapters things get more difficult, without exaggerating. In short, hardened adventurers will have their satisfaction, even if they will hardly be stuck for more than a few minutes on a single puzzle (for someone this can be a positive factor). From a graphic point of view, The Book of Unwritten Tales is a well-made title, especially given the genre it belongs to. The characters are well drawn, as are the scenarios, some of which are exceptionally beautiful. Unfortunately, there are some weaknesses that need to be highlighted. For example the animated cutscenes are not exactly exceptional and seem to come from the late nineties, whileand some animations aren't convincing at all. For the rest we are faced with an excellent work that does not make us regret the best titles of the genre, with the colors used very well and a great general taste for the picturesque and fantasy illustration. The songs that make up the soundtrack are very beautiful, while from the point of view of the sound effects there isn't much to report, beyond that they do their dirty work and nothing more.", "date": "2012-05-29", "grade": "8.5"}
