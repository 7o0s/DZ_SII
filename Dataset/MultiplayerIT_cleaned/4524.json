The original puzzle game was simple but ingenious: by mixing Puyo Puyo with its flagship fighting games, represented through an adorable super deformed or chibi style, Capcom had offered players a fun and spectacular pastime that quickly became a real cult . The irresistible style convinced Capcom to even churn out a themed fighting game - Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, practically a spin-off of a spin-off! - and despite this, it took twenty-one years to see the brand revived, if we exclude the HD Remix version released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 some time ago. Now Puzzle Fighter has also arrived on our tablets and mobile phones: can we be satisfied with its return or is it really true that some doors, once closed, shouldn't be reopened? May the best win? The dynamics haven't changed that much since 1996: the aim of the game is still to destroy as many gems as possible by making them come into contact with spheres of the same color, possibly triggering multiple chain reactions. The substantial difference lies in the fact that now the vital energy of the players is actually represented by a bar as in fighting games and by destroying the gems following certain screens the wrestler we have chosen to impersonate us will perform various special moves. For example, by destroying a square made up of four gems, Ryu will throw his usual Hadoken at the opponent, inflicting an amount of damage that depends on the power of the special move in question. The game, in fact, rewards our victories with the usual chests that can contain fighters or extra costumes, new special moves or copies of the ones we already own that we can consume to upgrade them, simultaneously increasing the fighter's level and therefore his maximum vital energy and the damage it will inflict every time we destroy a certain amount of gems. To chisel this interesting strategic drift even better, there are also two interesting innovations: first of all, each wrestler is associated with a color and by destroying those gems he will inflict more damage than usual; moreover, after completing the tutorial and winning the first few games, we will be able to choose two support wrestlers who will guarantee us some bonuses. Composing the team is quite important, also because the roster - which includes Capcom characters from brands such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry and Mega Man - is initially very limited and you have to make your way with what you have available in the hope to find our favorite wrestlers. And here falls the donkey. Puzzle Fighter is a free to play title and this means that the in-app purchases, however seemingly negligible, will creep annoyingly into your thoughts every time the Honda club closes and no longer rewards your victories for a whole day, or after you have completed the few daily missions and you will discover that you can only face other ones by paying with the game currency, given free of charge in small quantities or on sale for real money in the appropriate cash shop. Unfortunately Puzzle Fighter clumsily slips on this very point. We have never felt the need to buy anything, mind you, but unfortunately the game is stingy with content and once the daily single player missions are exhausted, in any case accessible only via the Internet, you can only try your hand at ranked matches against other players : the various ranks also unlock some fighters, but advancing is very hard. Every now and then the netcode fails, making us lose the challenges without even starting them, and the matchmaking, which often makes us face opponents of much higher level and rank, definitely leaves something to be desired. Even the control system didn't fully convince us: we can rotate the falling gems with a simple tap, then drag them along the screen to put them into position faster. This last action is essential because it allows us to save precious time, but unfortunately the game sometimes confuses the tap with the slide and at the last moment rotates the gems in an unwanted position, screwing up the schemes we had planned. It's a real shame, because the gameplay lends itself perfectly to mobile use and the way in which Capcom has managed the ~role~ elements is ingenious and captivating, while everything else should have been done better, starting with an artistic direction that can be liked or not like it, for heaven's sake, but reallydon't tie your shoes to the rounded character design of 1996.", "date": "2017-11-28", "grade": "6.0"}
