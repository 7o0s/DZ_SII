Already starting from the name we begin to understand what the here present fifth episode of the made in Capcom lawyer series tries to take a different path, and that is to completely abandon the court setting by focusing on the purely investigative section; secondly, after three games spent in the company of Phoenix Wright and one of Apollo Justice, both defense attorneys, this time we are in the role of the shady Miles Edgeworth, district attorney, practically the prosecution in every trial, already appeared in previous titles as a friend/rival of Wright. But what do these effectively new premises translate into in practice? Miles P.I. Fans of the series mainly love two things about the Ace Attorney formula: the adventurous/investigative gameplay, made up of scrupulous searches for clues and tight interrogations, and the plots and characters always above any scheme, characterized in an exaggerated and amiably Japanese way . As for the first aspect, that of the gameplay, Capcom has tried to give new life to the game mechanics, which actually began to need some innovations, without however disorienting the aficiodanos. The first noticeable difference, as big as a house, is that now on the upper screen the usual static screens that served both as a background and as an interactive element on which to go and investigate no longer appear, except in certain points of the game. the view has become lateral, close to those of the 2D graphic adventures of the 90s, so to speak, so much so that the control via the stylus is clearly preferable to that via the directional cross: our agent moves freely around the game screen going to interact with the elements of the background or with the characters in the order in which the player prefers, within a certain limit which remains under close observation by the programmers. This, if in the end it doesn't give this great freedom to a game that has always been profoundly linear, at least, of freedom, it gives an impression, helping the user to identify himself. In secondly, during the five episodes we will never find ourselves crossing the threshold of the court, which explains the ~Investigations~ of the title: all the plots unfold at the crime scene or in any case in the places where Edgeworth will go to investigate. The disappearance of that clear separation between the investigative phase and the process greatly helps the flow of the game and the unraveling of the plot, also making the mental processes necessary to move forward more pleasant, because they are more immediate. New mechanics are then the ~Logic~, which consists in putting together two pieces of information to obtain a third more decisive one, and the ~Deduction~, which appears when an element of what we are currently investigating contradicts one of the evidence in our possession : for us, of course, to understand what the element, the proof and why the two things are in contradiction... Capcom's Leopard But be careful: if on paper all these elements seem to configure an experience that is actually new, by playing it is immediately clear that things are not quite like that. It is true that, for example, there is no longer a separation between investigation and trial, but the interrogations that were the backbone of the trial are there, perhaps even more than before, with the possibility of pressing the interlocutor to push him to reveal more than he wants, and of necessity to present, at the right time, evidence that contradicts his testimony. And if it is true, again, that Miles is freer in his movements than Phoenix and Apollo ever were, it is in any case a fictitious freedom, as the game only opens up to exploration a few areas at a time, and in any case no exists that events may occur in an order other than that established by the developers. And again, the ~Deduction~ is certainly not a novelty in the game system, but it is simply giving a name to an element that has always been there; only the ~Logic~ is an actually new feature, but on closer inspection it doesn't affect the formula that much, limiting itself to adding an interactive step to a process that the protagonist previously carried out in a completely independent way. Capcom was therefore clever and skilful in giving Ace Attorney an apparently completely new dress, which however in reality has very little again: we do not hide our disappointment in verifying how much, in practice, the new Ace Attorney looks reveals similar to its predecessors, however it must be said that all this helps fans to immediately project themselves into the game world, making the task easier even for new players, asor, if the substance of things does not change, the new gaming system at least makes the experience more fluent, compact and immediate. Objection, Your Hon... Objection and that's it! Not touching the game system in substance has also allowed, which is the most important thing, to keep intact the qualitative levels of the series and all those elements that in other games would be side dishes, but which are part of Ace Attorney's essence. Miles Edgeworth is a very interesting character: far from the extravagance of Wright and Justice, our Prosecutor is serious, shady, very attentive to detail, not inclined to flights of fancy. It constitutes almost the only element of rationality in a world made up as always of improbable, illogical protagonists, with behaviors that are too over the top not to be immediately loved by the player; and yet in the course of the five episodes, these as always apparently unrelated to each other but which in reality constitute a single plot with elements drawn both from anime and from detective fiction, Edgeworth undergoes an evolution that makes us discover the human and delicate sides, already mentioned moreover in the previous episodes, and which takes him, perhaps, to the Olympus of the best characterized characters of the current videogame panorama. The plots also remain on the same levels as in the past, both in terms of quality and level of intricacy, and unraveling them is, as usual, a real intellectual pleasure, although, here too as in the past, sometimes we come across in the classic ~trial and error~ rather than a logical and rational conclusion. The five different cases then ensure a certain longevity, having reached the bottom of which, however, the game has to be put on the shelf lacking any element of replayability. The new visual has allowed the graphic designers of the series to renew their repertoire a bit, with the classic animations of the characters that this time also find space in the side view with the full-length characters, excellently made animations in even more detailed settings than usual; the sound, on the other hand, recycles several elements from past iterations, but always in an effective manner and aimed at creating the right atmosphere at all times, which can range from dramatic to urgent to simply comical. A last note, of demerit, goes to the Italian edition which, contrary to what has been seen so far, presents text on the screen completely in English: it is an important fact in a game heavily based on texts, which cuts legs a bit, at least in our country, to the product, and even if the level of complexity is not excessive and a school knowledge of the Albion language is enough to move forward calmly, many subtleties, jokes, puns characteristic of the humor of the series that have always made it one of the best written in the videogame field, can only be appreciated by those who know a little more than scholastic English.
