With these very little comforting words, Don't Knock Twice, a film that arrived in Italy in the middle of summer with the title Don't Knock on That Door, presented itself to the world. Interpreted by Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica, the film belongs as you may have guessed to the horror genre, even before Resident Evil 7 among the most popular for the use of virtual reality in the videogame field. The guys from Wales Interactive, the Soul Axiom development team, have had the task of bringing us firsthand into the nightmare of an urban legend linked to a demonic witch, available today for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Even if you don't have a headset, you can still play Don't Knock Twice: but is it worth it? Knock Knock! The plot of Don't Knock Twice revolves around a mother's search for her own daughter, devoured by guilt for having been the cause of the forced removal of the young woman which took place some time ago. If you have seen the film you will certainly know more than we do on the subject, given that in the video game there are not too many preambles before putting us where the whole story takes place. In possession of very few elements that prompt us to do so, let's therefore begin to explore the house in which Don't Knock Twice is set, as per the tradition of the horror genre enclosed within the sinister walls of an old house, this time located in Wales. If in the film the director Caradog W. James tried to place the conflicting relationship between mother and daughter at the center of the story, in the videogame Don't Knock Twice this element remains only mentioned, leaving it up to the player to possibly deepen the story a little question. Going around the witch's house, it is in fact possible to find documents of various types that tell us something more about both the personal history of Jess and Chloe, and about the entity they are dealing with. The goal is naturally to make us feel involved in the adventure experienced by the two women, always one step after the other while the monster of the moment enjoys playing with both of them. With such a classic setting, something more should undoubtedly have been done in terms of narrative elements: as it stands, the game prevents us from successfully stepping into the part, asking us to have faith in the very phoned ~mother and daughter against supernatural creature ~ to have a scary experience in virtual reality. As we are about to see, unfortunately, Don't Knock Twice also fails from this point of view. Playstation 4 trophies Trophy hunters can get their money's worth with Don't Knock Twice. In fact, the game offers a total of twenty-nine objectives, one of which is Platinum, five Gold, fourteen Silver and nine Bronze. Their nature naturally starts from the completion of the various ~chapters~ that make up the story, to move on to some collectibles and other types of hidden elements. To get all the Trophies, you have to complete the game at least a couple of times. I'm the big bad wolf! The demonic creature that haunts the protagonists of Don't Knock Twice only manages to be a bogeyman in the initial phase, mainly because the player still has no idea what to expect. The game soon sets the record straight by serving the first of the so-called ~jump scare~, i.e. the unexpected events that the horror genre has always been full of. A device to scare not necessarily bad, but which should not be abused: it is what Wales Interactive unfortunately does, thus trying to put fear on those who find themselves with a helmet on their heads. There is no doubt that in an immersive environment such as that of virtual reality, the classic jump takes on a completely different effect, but to be credible it needs to be supported by other dynamics that make the experience truly terrifying. Unfortunately, this does not happen in Don't Knock Twice, where after the first few minutes of the game everything becomes telephoned: the presence that we constantly feel behind our backs no longer frightens us, just as we know very well where the next door will be waiting for us banging or lightning coming through the window. The absence of noteworthy puzzles also makes Don't Knock Twice a merely exploratory experience, as does the fact that the witch never actually tries to make an attempt on our lives - except by blowing up the coronaries. Depending on the time dedicated to dwelling on the elements that are gradually found, the duration is around two hours and a little bit. Virtual freedom Although Don't Knock Twice is a game designed for virtual reality, Wales Interactive has dedicated part of the syour efforts even for use without viewers. In the latter case, the control system is quite classic, while when you experience the story in the first person, things change depending on the game platform. On PC, Oculus and HTC Vive controllers are supported, while on PlayStation 4, almost total freedom is offered for choosing the game system. If you have only the DualShock 4, the interface is in fact linked to the latter, also adapting to the use of a single Move or a pair if you have two. The movement takes place via teleportation, a choice that allows the most delicate stomachs to feel a little more serene, even if at the expense of the involvement guaranteed by the linear movement. On PlayStation 4 the graphics appear without infamy and without praise, losing something as usual if PlayStation VR is used. We don't know whether or not there are differences in support between the base PlayStation 4 and the Pro model, however Don't Knock Twice was run on for this review.", "date": "2017-09-05", "grade": "4.5"}
