The debut of the helicopters should be seen in this sense, for the first time ever, as well as the original interpretation of dog fights based on an unprecedented lock-on system. The plot of the game sees us play the role of different characters engaged in a war campaign conducted by NATO forces that starts from Africa: Lieutenant Colonel William Bishop, head of the Warwolf Squadron; Captain Doug Robinson, member of the helicopter team; and Janice Rehl, a smart AC-130U fighter-bomber pilot. Enemy troops seem to have at hand a weapon of extraordinary power, capable of causing tremendous explosions, but it is not clear who supplied them. The situation, however, becomes more tangled when the Russian allies begin to behave in a strange way ... that they are involved? Available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 since October 2011 - here is our original review - the title developed by Project Aces arrives on PC with an Enhanced Edition that includes eight new planes, two new maps, almost thirty skins and nine extra abilities for the multiplayer, all at a budget price (29.90 euros) and with the possibility, of course, of playing with a resolution of up to 1920 x 1200 pixels, thus appreciating the photorealistic scenarios with even greater detail. Matter of choices If you already know Ace Combat: Assault Horizon and maybe you were anxiously awaiting the release of the game in the PC version, let's see immediately what the differences are compared to the original edition. Beyond the extra content just mentioned, Namco Bandai has chosen to once again use Games for Windows LIVE for profile and online management, and this can only make those hoping for support of the Steamworks platform turn up their noses. It is too early to know if we will encounter problems such as those that have afflicted Dark Souls owners, however it was not pleasant to finish the installation and immediately run into an error due to an outdated version of the Microsoft client, which therefore had to be uninstalled and reinstalled. Beyond this, the options screen unfortunately lacks advanced adjustments: it is possible to choose the screen resolution, activate or not vertical sync and antialiasing, the latter without further settings. We didn't expect support for DirectX 11, but being able to choose the smoothing method would have been at least appreciable, also because as we know there are proprietary technologies that allow even substantial improvements in performance (see NVIDIA video card features). We have not investigated the even probable presence of configuration files that can be edited to go deeper into the settings, however once in the middle of the action it certainly cannot be said that the engine is heavy or that it suffers from an evident lack of optimizations. The frame rate with the test configuration (not at the top, especially on the CPU front) in fact holds up to sixty frames per second quite well with all the effects activated (therefore AA and vsync) at the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, dropping to a minimum of forty frames when the situation is really crowded. No obvious collapse, therefore, and a level of detail clearly higher than that of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. Too bad that the textures have remained the same and that, above all, the scenarios do not always have three-dimensionality: fly over the one that from above it looked like a city and which instead turns out to be a sort of ~wallpaper~, it's never pleasant. The multiplayer modes Ace Combat: Assault Horizon boasts four different online multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players, even if at the moment the situation is not very crowded, on the contrary. ~Conquer the capital~ is a mode in which two teams face each other within one of the seven available maps with the aim of destroying their respective headquarters, while in ~Domination~ you have to conquer and control an area for as long as possible of the scenario. Finally, there is the traditional team deathmatch, ~Mortal Clash~, and the possibility of playing missions in co-op with the ~Cooperative Mission~ mode. Control your destiny As highlighted in the review of the console version, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon allows us to choose an ~arcade~ or ~simulation~ style for the controls, even ifin the end, the difference between the two options is far from abysmal. Instead, what undoubtedly represents a novelty are the controls of the helicopter, clearly different from the usual: a button to go up in altitude and one to go down, the movement of the vehicle delegated to the left analog stick while the right one controls the aiming reticle and finally a mix of main and shoulder buttons for activating weapons. The helicopter missions are fun and are a welcome variation on the theme compared to the traditional levels, also because the structure of the latter often appears ~stretched~, with new teams of enemies that regularly appear when we think it's all over, all at detriment of involvement. The action aboard the Apache is less dynamic, as is normal, but it is interesting to wander among the buildings of a city in search of hostile units, frame them with the zoom and eliminate them, also resorting to spectacular evasive maneuvers in case of incoming missiles. The bombing sessions aboard the AC-130U, on the other hand, did not excite us or shine for their originality, given that almost all war titles now offer similar moments. We mentioned buttons and analog sticks because, as expected, the PC edition of the game natively supports the Xbox 360 controller and the layout of the controls is exactly that seen on the Microsoft platform. However, it is also possible to control your aircraft with the keyboard, using the traditional WASD and the arrow keys to control the aircraft. We have done some experiments on this and honestly it does not seem like a viable solution, so keep in mind that to fully enjoy the experience you will need a gamepad. Finally, a few words for the sound sector, which boasts an excellent dubbing in Italian, made up of solid and convinced interpretations, directed as it should be. The music and effects are also beautiful.", "date": "2013-01-29", "grade": "8.0"}
