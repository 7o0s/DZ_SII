How is it possible that a video game considered practically a flop at launch and massacred by a large part of the critics, today is considered by Square Enix an intellectual property with rich potential, boasts a successful sequel, and has even managed to return to homes with a remake ? It's not exactly easy to explain, and indeed the fact that today so many people know what we're talking about is a small miracle, but it certainly isn't a coincidence. In fact, Yoko Taro's work deserved more than many others to be rediscovered, and to this day it is the clearest demonstration of how the love of enthusiasts can restore prestige to names that seemed by now to have sunk into the mud of the market. But maybe it's better to start from the beginning. Nier was immediately a singular experiment to say the least: a work created to dismantle the canons of the video game, and calculated to be both a parody and a tribute. Too bad that, despite all the good will in the world, its creators actually had limitations weaknesses that negatively affected the overall quality of the project, making it one of the most difficult titles to analyze out there, due to the need to dig really thoroughly to fully appreciate its qualities. Predictably, this did not happen in the vast majority of cases: released in conjunction with games accompanied by a very different media tam tam, the strange creature of Cavia and Yoko Taro was largely ignored - when not treated with absolute superficiality - and managed to only find solace in a small niche of fans. Furthermore, the division into two different editions called Replicant and Gestalt was of little use, where the protagonist went from being a graceful little boy to a wiry family man, with the second choice designed specifically for the western market. It took years for it to be rediscovered, thanks also to the efforts of translators who have followed all its derivatives (and there are many, due to the director's habit of inserting important narrative elements into things often unrelated to videogames), and they managed to a bit of order in the chaos that is now referred to as ~Taroverse~: a terrifyingly layered narrative universe, which links the game we are talking about today to the Drakengard series and a host of other works (seriously, ranging from manga to plays) . Yet, the main impetus for a recovery was given by the fact that among the enthusiasts there were various Japanese developers - some of them part of PlatinumGames - whose passion for Nier prompted Square to give life to that Automata that is today acclaimed almost everywhere. However, it is not to the team at the reins of that game that we owe its return today, but to a little-known software house called Toylogic (which in its history has mostly minor projects and support work for some more significant titles), with the predictable support of Yoko Taro and the supervision of Takahisa Taura (always part of PlatinumGames, in fact). Their Remake is called Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139, and beyond the obvious ability to confuse right from the name, it has the difficult mission of letting an audience used to structurally and narratively much more welcoming products discover the original. After playing it to exhaustion, we are ready to tell you in the review of Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139 if the work done was enough to make Nier a modern masterpiece for everyone, or even just for those who can tolerate its flaws. Death in the heart Right from the start Nier has the merit of dismantling the canonical ~hero's journey~ around which the vast majority of RPG epics are modeled. It all begins in the rubble of a modern Tokyo, where two brothers, Nier and Yonah, fight for survival threatened by mysterious shadow creatures. From this short prologue we move almost immediately to 1400 years in the future, with apparently the same protagonists, a placid village, and the young Nier busy finding a cure for the Black Scrawl (translated Necrography in Italian), a terrible disease that it hit his sister and is killing countless people. Nothing that happened before is explained with particular clarity, and the stories advance mostly due to Nier's need to complete scattered chores in order to support himself and Yonah in their new home. We stop here, because there is absolutely no need to give spoilers to those who have not already experienced the original Nier campaign on their skin, which has remained almost unchanged in this remake. Just know that there is a reason why it was the good Yoko Taro who came out with his head held high since Cavia's fall: he is an author with often brilliant ideas, very affectionateborn to the ~shock factor~ and far from fearful when it comes to writing stories of rare violence and drama. Nier, to date, is perhaps his most successful work in this, boasting remarkable twists and memorable characters - the trio of Kain, Emil, and Weiss, are nothing short of fantastic - and it is not advisable to take it lightly. Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139: the new face of Kain That said, the fact that the narrative of the game is largely a stroke of genius does not mean that everything is handled beautifully, especially if you make direct comparisons to the structure of Automata (inspired by Replicant and Gestalt, but significantly more evolved). Where the repetition in the sequel developed by Platinum was lightened by large variations in gameplay in the first two runs and the opening of new paths, the first Nier instead requires multiple playthroughs almost identical to obtain all endings. And if on the one hand all this in the second run is not particularly difficult due to interesting additions and a specific extra factor (which, also in this case, we do not dare to spoil), the same cannot be said of the third, which with certain conditions could easily have been avoided. For heaven's sake, it's not a huge waste of time - the subsequent games start from an advanced point in the plot and can be concluded in a short time - but it is still an easily modifiable design solution, which has not been taken into consideration in any way. consideration in the new version of the game. Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139: perspective changes If nothing else, when we spoke of the ~almost~ unchanged campaign, it was not a casual statement: Toylogic have apparently reinstated some cut scenes in the game, immediately evident to those who remember the original. A couple of extras are particularly important, and even if we don't want to reveal them to you, we assure you that they are a very welcome surprise. The additions also include the DLC The World of Recycled Vessel, unfortunately the only way to take on the role of Nier father of Gestalt in this new incarnation. It's a trio of levels designed to offer some advanced challenge to players (with very little to add to the story), but it's a good thing that it's kept, complete with additional weapons and costumes. The dance of the blade Thus told Replicant ver.1.22474487139 might seem like a simple graphic remake, with some welcome additions to content and little else, but in truth Toylogic have not been idle, and indeed have chosen to intervene markedly on the mechanics. Winning choice, because the game's combat system boasted many interesting elements to say the least that then heavily influenced Automata and lent themselves well to its many gameplay variations, however it was neither among the most responsive out there nor among the most fun. This remake brings back all the primary elements by rejuvenating everything beautifully, and gives much more impact to the clashes. Let's go into more detail: Nier is particularly interesting among action jrpg because it mixes combinations from 3D hack 'n' slash to a more or less functional magic system, with some of these directional as in a shooter. It is a particularly successful idea, since the title - as we said at the beginning - is structured to be a deconstruction of gaming as a whole, and offers sections built as a parody of other genres, with variations in perspective and gameplay that are sometimes rather sudden. The original presence of basic combinations combined with aiming and manual control spells allowed the developers to mix classic fights with scenes closer to a bullet hell or a twin stick shooter, with even bosses that represent a strange hybridization between the structures (for put it simply, many enemies have the ability to fire a frightening number of projectiles that must be dodged or eliminated with your magic). This wacky solution has aged so well that the game's curious boss battles have remained practically intact (they literally have identical patterns with very little variation), yet the developers have still decided to strengthen the weakest links of the original combat system: body combat body and movement. Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139: One of the powerful spells in the game Dodges in this new Nier, for example, are extremely fast, and performing them head-on at a short distance from the enemy leads to an instant dash behind the opponent, reminiscent of the movement options seen in Automata. The combos for their part have undergone a similar treatment: they are more varied and faster,with charged moves that are particularly effective against specific enemies, and a general spectacularization of all three types of weapons available (two of these are only unlocked in the advanced campaign). The only problem? More responsive controls and a greater variety of combinations have made the game easier. There is no mention of a huge lowering of the difficulty (the original Nier was certainly not a hardcore title), but if in the past you have faced everything without problems of any kind, perhaps this is the right opportunity to start the campaign at the highest level of challenge. Shadows and shadows The work of the Toylogics can also be seen in less evident factors, such as a general increase in the shooting speed of the protagonist, which makes moving around less tedious. It may seem negligible stuff, but it is still worthy of praise in a title like this, because as mentioned it is not a perfect production, but a work plagued by various design errors that are almost entirely re-proposed here. Let me be clear, our intention is not to further beat the work done in the past by Cavia: they have already received enough criticisms for the Drakengard gameplay (mainly for the first one), and in our opinion Nier is just the clearest proof of how the team wasn't all that bad when put in charge of an interesting project. However, the flaws begin to appear when you go deeper into the structural analysis of the game, which, as specified, tends to upset the classic formulas of gaming, and in particular of JRPGs. In its desire to be a sort of mad splinter of the panorama, in fact, Nier fields sections borrowed from diablolikes, inspired by survival horror, and even transforms itself into a text adventure at times. None of these parts of the game is particularly irritating, indeed the variety offered allows you to easily ignore the superficiality of some elements; but then we return to the JRPG skeleton, and there the game comes to ruin its very foundations in order to make irony on the most absurd canons of Japanese titles. Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139: a very special boss fight And no, this is not a far-fetched theory: Nier is full of almost useless repetitive fetch quests and deliberately irritating secondary activities (atrocious fishing quests, a small cultivable field where every action takes away too many precious seconds of time, and so on). The game itself makes fun of this type of gimmick through the always amusing Grimore Weiss, who does not fail to constantly criticize the protagonist for his clear tendency to accept even the most menial tasks in order to help others or make some extra money. yet he persists in putting them in the field anyway without realizing that most of the players - completionists in primis - could easily be dazed by the numerous object recovery quests that offer only extra money as a reward (however very easy to recover just by exploiting the crops) . Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139: the Nest It is a serious misjudgment, reinforced by the presence among the secondary tasks that cannot be avoided to obtain all the endings, and by some rather narratively significant missions that are in no way distinct from the others. Automata, to say, managed to apply similar ironic solutions without excessively affecting its general quality, simply because it was designed with greater cunning (starting from the question of repeated playthroughs that we have already dealt with). The Toylogics could have reworked things to make the experience more enjoyable. Instead, they have opted for an almost reverential form of respect for the original Nier, even rehashing its missteps. For our part, we would have liked to see something more elaborate at least in the forest phase, but so be it. The voice of angels The work done on the technical sector of the game is more sensitive, which as mentioned has been largely retouched from a graphic point of view. Here too, however, we are faced with a partial remake: the main characters and some NPCs have been redone from scratch, with new models and extremely accurate animations, but most of the Shades (the opponents of the game) are practically identical, as well as the polygonal count of the settings, apparently unchanged. To give everything an infinitely more acceptable look, renewed textures and effects take care of it, which modernize the appearance without placing it on a par with more modern productions. Even the color palette has remained the discreetly dull one of the original, even if the stylistic choice it's perfectly understandable when yes", "date": "2021-04-22", "grade": "8.2"}
