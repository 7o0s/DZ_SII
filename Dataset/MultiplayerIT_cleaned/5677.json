It is therefore not surprising that the concept behind _PRISM, Clint Siu's ~zen~ puzzle game, takes up precisely these mechanisms, elaborating them to pass from apparently trivial situations to decidedly more complex ones; all within thirteen different levels which, if desired, can be completed in about an hour. Too little? It is certainly an original and intense experience, full of a peculiar atmosphere that is made possible by an essential and elegant sound accompaniment, as well as by a visual sector capable of putting surprising and effective special effects on the plate. There are no introductory phases or tutorials in _PRISM, it's immediately us and the first puzzle to solve, but it only takes a few seconds to understand how the game works. Acting on the touch screen to move the sliders it is in fact possible to ~open~ the geometric shapes that appear before our eyes and thus disclose small puzzles that act as ~switches~ with respect to the opening of the mysterious object that we are virtually handling. When its core is finally exposed, we will be able to grab it and move on to the next area, until the end of the campaign. _PRISM is a fascinating and original puzzle game, with a zen atmosphere, that won't fail to win you over Use your fingers The progression of _PRISM is rather slow and reasoned, there are no sudden peaks of difficulty nor do you get stuck for more than a few minutes in front of the more complex puzzles, yet the uniqueness of certain solutions is definitely worth the price of the ticket, in this case 2.99 euros for a product that obviously does not contain in-app purchases or limitations of any kind. Some puzzles are solved by moving or rotating small ~constellations~ and placing them in the corresponding area of the main object; others, more elaborate, provide for the activation of switches or slides so that the shape accords with the configuration indicated on another side of the prism. Certainly the experience manages to give its best on larger screens, therefore on iPads, whereas even on the latest generation iPhones (in our case a 6s model) we sometimes find ourselves having to resort to zoom-out in order to interact correctly with the terminals on duty. In addition to the traditional operations of dragging the shapes, in fact it happens that you also have to keep your fingers fixed on the screen to keep switches activated, intelligently exploiting the multitouch but also opening up to some uncomfortable situations from the point of view of the controls. In any case, these are uncertainties that do not tarnish the goodness of a classy, elegant and refined production, one of a kind and therefore worthy of a try, whatever your preferences in the field of mobile gaming.", "date": "2016-03-01", "grade": "8.0"}
