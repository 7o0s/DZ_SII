{"name": "L'intramontabile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137276-minecraft-lintramontabile.html", "text": "Minecraft is one of the heralds of modern indie, a title that has taken up and enhanced the sandbox formula with almost no regard for aesthetics. Many are those who have stoically avoided every incarnation of the Mojang title calling it too bad to be played, but there are also millions who have been captivated by the magic of a truly open game, a title that allows you to shape the terrain of ever-changing worlds and that sports a crafting system that has been able to condition the entire evolution of the sandbox. With modding it has ensnared millions of PC gamers. With its potentially infinite formula it has conquered console users. With the magic of having a world in a palm it has even attracted mobile gamers, even those who usually spend their time between puzzles and social gaming. And with nearly 54 million copies sold and a film in the works, it's no wonder that Minecraft has also arrived on next-generation consoles with an edition designed to take advantage of the most powerful hardware. Of course, it cannot be said that in the case of Minecraft the 1080p resolution radically changes the experience. But the cleaner image is undoubtedly pleasant to see, the visual distance is finally adequate for the breadth of the maps and the 60 frames per second are perceived clearly. Finally, in essence, the console version of the title can no longer be said to be inferior to the PC one from a technical point of view. Unfortunately we cannot say the same talking about the features of the title considering the limitations in relation to modding and multiplayer with the maximum number of players remaining at 8. But the next-gen version of the highly successful sandbox Mojang refines the multiplayer support that in the future it should be further enhanced with the introduction of PC-style servers and, more importantly, allows the creation of worlds 36 times larger than those seen on the so-called old-gen. Not a small improvement with the next-gen version of Minecraft which gives us plenty of room to let our imaginations run wild online, alone or all sitting together on the sofa thanks to the four-player split-screen. The infinite worlds of Minecraft arrive on next-gen with an almost uncompromising edition Xbox One goals The transition to Microsoft's next-gen also involves an increase in achievements which overall bestow the now canonical thousand points. Many goals are predictably cumulative in nature and require a fair amount of time to achieve. Numerous others can be reached simply by performing an action but it could take a long time given the large number of possible actions in the Mojang title. A mine of creativity The experience is the classic one of the Mojang title with tons of materials to be found or extracted from the ground by digging with the hands, with a shovel, with an ice ax or with a whole other series of more or less effective tools depending on the material, the context and the conformation of the land. The console interface is well structured and the agile tutorial allows you to get to the heart of the game in a matter of minutes, immediately ready to face the classic survival mode. Initially things might seem too difficult yet a small shelter and a few pieces of equipment are enough to transform the night hours, when the world is filled with ravenous creatures, into a health walk. At that point everything becomes a continuous discovery that even reaches the cultivation and animal breeding, however, passing through the inevitable need to dig deeper and deeper. And in the search for ever more precious minerals it is easy to end up like the dwarves of Moria, too busy drilling the rock in search of treasures to be able to realize the danger. In the depths of the earth, when there is only darkness all around, it happens that even a Creeper, an easily manageable creature in optimal conditions, can be a thorn in the side. It therefore becomes essential to plan your own mining adventure by widening the tunnels, preventing dangers, providing our mine with adequate lighting. And here a real underground journey takes shape through which Minecraft succeeds in the difficult task of making what has been one of the most ominous professions of humanity exciting. And it's not a bad result for an indie that started from nothing but it's not just in the survival mode that the enormous success of the title created by the now more than famous Markus Persson is hidden. The creative dimension is the master in the Mojang sandbox with huge projects that have led, on PC, to the creation of entire worlds, often inspired by the settings of films or popular series. On consoles, unfortunately, quethese creative possibilities are limited and to remedy the problem 4J Studios, the software house that deals with the console versions of Minecraft, has created several texture packs, three of which are already available on Xbox One. We are talking about the thematic worlds of Halo, Mass Effect and Skyrim which bring with them a large number of assets and, more importantly, a very important soundtrack. However, these are contents that, to be fully enjoyed, must be purchased and in any case do not bridge the gap compared to the PC version of Minecraft enriched by a practically infinite database of free creations. But it would be unwise to underestimate the creative potential of the smooth version of Minecraft that allows you to build underground networks, castles, bridges, buildings of all sorts, villages and cities. The possibilities are countless even without the need for DLC, modifications or particular assets and creating something complex with a group of friends gives incredible satisfaction regardless of the textures used. And the creative mode further frees the imagination by eliminating enemies, allowing you to fly and giving the player an infinite supply of materials with which to build whatever he wants. Furthermore, a good samaritan, which is not uncommon in the world of modding, has managed to create a converter to bring the saves of the PC version to the Xbox 360 and the Minecraft: Xbox One Edition allows you to import the saves from the Xbox 360 version. Basically, by concatenating the conversions, it should be possible to use the PC data also on Xbox One except for compatibility problems that can probably be solved with an update of the PC to Xbox Converter. Unfortunately, the same does not seem to be possible on PlayStation 4 due to the lack of both a PC converter and the possibility of bringing files from PlayStation 3 to the new Sony console. The latter feature, however, should be implemented shortly allowing all PlayStation users to bring their creations with them in the transition to the next-gen. Passage that for those who already have the old-gen version should cost only 4.99 euros and should include the free transfer of some of the DLC already purchased.", "date": "2014-09-12", "grade": "9.0"}
