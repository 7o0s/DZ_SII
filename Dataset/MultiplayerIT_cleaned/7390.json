However, the humble origins of the product should not mislead the extent of its ambition: with particular attention to the setting and the plot, an uncommon care reserved for the design and the visual aspect and a cinematographic attitude also highlighted by a cast of dubbers of a certain level (including David Hayter, famous for having donated the voice of Solid Snake before being replaced by Kiefer Sutherland), Rpublique wants to be anything but the ~usual~ mobile game. An intention underlined by the founder of Camouflaj himself, Ryan Payton, who claims that he wanted to create such a title precisely so as not to hear more complaints about the absence of real games on the App Store. In short, a big load of responsibility for an absolute debut like this: let's find out if Rpublique was able to withstand the pressure... Dystopian fresco The episodic structure that distinguishes Rpublique (five chapters in total that can be purchased individually or in bulk through a more convenient Season Pass) does not allow for an analysis of the narrative quality as a whole, but it can certainly be said that the title Camouflaj starts with the right foot, setting up a fascinating scenario openly inspired by 1984 by George Orwell. The game takes place in a structure called Metamorphosis, managed with totalitarian fervor by a mysterious military force: the protagonist is Hope, a girl who is accused of being part of a group of dissidents of the regime and who is therefore destined for an intervention aimed at erase its memory and erase its personality. Desperate, the young woman finds a cell phone with which she addresses the player directly, begging him to help her escape: through this successful meta-referential passage, the user takes control of the situation in a decidedly original way. In fact, you find yourself invested with the power to switch from one security camera to another at will to observe the situation and plan Hope's escape. Everything is managed using a very intuitive system: by pressing a virtual key located in the upper right corner of the display, you switch to the so-called OMNIView mode, during which time stops and the image switches to a negative filter which allows you to highlight all the elements with which it is possible to interact with icons. In addition to the cameras that can be taken over, the OMNIView highlights doors to unlock, documents to examine, computers to hack, containers to open and so on, all accessible with simple taps on the touch screen. By deactivating this mode, the solicitations on the screen are used to indicate to Hope what to do through context-sensitive touches and which therefore serve to make her move, to indicate her to hide or to order her to interact with enemies and objects. Brilliant on paper, the system concocted by Camouflaj in practice does not however work entirely satisfactorily, for two main reasons: on the one hand, the act of constantly switching from OMNIView to the normal view soon becomes a cumbersome process which forces to sensitive delays even in completing the most trivial actions; on the other hand, the artificial intelligence routines that regulate Hope's movements leave much to be desired, forcing the user to literally accompany her step by step to avoid that she faces too long stretches by choosing a path destined to make her discover by the guards patrolling the rooms . Rpublique offers gameplay that doesn't always live up to its exceptional setting I see you and take you away Then there are other elements that reveal a rather fluctuating trend in some developers' choices regarding the play structure of Rpublique. Therefore, the right intuition of being able to enrich the OMNIView with new functions through a special shop is debased by a design that does not allow to fully exploit these potentials; again, the drive towards truly stimulating backtracking collides with the absence of a map that allows you to extricate yourself in the authentic maze of corridors and rooms of Metamorphosis. Instead of opting for the classic game over, then, Camouflaj has adopted a particular stratagem to punish the player who lets himself be captured by the enemies: in this case, Hope is in fact stripped of the objects she had collected and taken to the nearest detention center, by the which one must start the escape again. Also in this area the impression is that the form wins over the substance, dator that such a stylistically elegant mechanic ends up weighing down the pleasantness of the experience, especially when you are forced to repeat large sections of the game due to the aforementioned deficiencies in the movement of the protagonist. As if to make up for the lightness with which she tackles certain basic mechanics of the gameplay, Rpublique shows off a simply impressive attention to detail, capable of presenting the game world as one of the most interesting of recent times. The visual sector amazes both for its technical quality - from the level of detail of the settings to the excellent animations of the characters - and for the innumerable preciousness on a stylistic level, while the excellent English dubbing proves that the money invested to hire the cast has been well spent. Finally, the way in which Camouflaj has inserted elements taken from the real world into his fictional work is very classy: Hope can therefore come across copies of authentic books that have been banned by the regime (Lolita, Naked Lunch, Fahrenheit 451 and many others) and even in video game cartridges aesthetically very similar to the specimens for Atari 2600 which however refer to very current titles for iOS, complete with links to buy them on the App Store.", "date": "2013-12-23", "grade": "7.8"}
