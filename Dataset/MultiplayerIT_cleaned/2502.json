{"name": "NBA Hoopz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-hoopz_a.html", "text": "Playability: single is not his forte Now let's look at the graphics and sound. The title is not beautiful to look at: the players are very angular, and the applied textures are certainly not the state of the art: the black players sometimes gave me the impression of being spotted, while the level of detail fluctuates. The faces are very beautiful, faithful to their real counterparts, however the construction of the stadium and the public is frankly poor. On the other hand, the animations are positive, fluid and convincing, very varied (there are in fact many types of dunks to be made), and also fun to watch. The sound is very pleasant and appropriate, and in addition to the typical, normal effects, there are a whole series of sounds that accompany the most incredible actions, such as when you hear the rumble of a jet during a smash. The gameplay is undoubtedly positive. The title can be used from the beginning without particular key combinations to learn, also because it retains the control method adopted by almost all basketball titles. We are given the opportunity, in addition to the simple fundamentals, to run, make decidedly male fouls and perform exciting feints. The addition of the extra man spurs the player to carry out more complex actions, also because the defensive phase by the opponents seems to be very accurate. I didn't really like the choice of player to play in the base trio: sometimes you are prey to lightning fast counter-attacks, because you linger too much under the opponent's basket, and when the action is very messy you risk not seeing well where the ball is. ball. The companions are also definitely goats (defensively speaking), so very often one is forced to make sudden retreats that are almost never really effective. In the singleplayer all these defects are found more, and the too arcade system is decidedly limiting and in the long run not very satisfying (almost boring). The multiplayer, on the other hand, is a whole other story, you have much more fun, as it stands to reason, but clearly it is too little, to lift the Midway title from general mediocrity. The alternative minigames are nothing more than a very small diversion, nothing more. Okay, ultimately? Summing up NBA Hoopz is a title that gives rise to different evaluations: those who expect a deluxe version of the old classic NBA Jam are partially disappointed, those who prefer to play with something more complete and simulative are better off changing the scenery. Consequently, the desire to mix both trends has not borne fruit, on the contrary it has given birth to a sort of hybrid that does not satisfy anyone. Certainly the multiplayer saves an opaque general picture, but it is really too little. We are like this as usual: a license is not enough to make an excellent product; pity because given the solid foundations of the predecessor, it would have been enough to embrace the philosophy of VirtuaStriker, all graphics and little substance. Here there is little substance and even less graphics. In other words, the faults of the fathers fall on the children Arcade or simulator, that's the question NBA Hoopz despite several changes, remains a revised and corrected version of the old classic NBA JAM, which had so much depopulated in the 16-bit era. Now compared to the extreme arcade experience of its predecessor, this new title seems to focus on a more prominent simulation component, always within the limits of a system devoted to the most shameless arcade game. Now you lead a team of 3 players, so you have a greater variety of possible attacks, schemes and actions. At the same time this approaching the ~reality~ of basketball in small steps distorts the basic philosophy of the product. Clearly this is not the Winning 11 of basketball. Those who appreciated the total madness of the old title may remain perplexed, those who instead saw limits in 2vs2 can be satisfied. Another ~simulation~ component concerns the choice of players to deploy: a series of parameters distinguishes each player, three points, two points, dunks, blocks .... . These are then really verifiable in the field. And so we are faced with another problem of the title: the choice is all too conditioning, players with parameters of three low, will not hit a shot even if an invisible hand guides the ball. Therefore a careful choice of one's men is required, or much more prosaically to win it is better to have people play with percentages of three high. In the end, the biggest problem with the title is not really knowing where to go: we make it an arcade title, and then we go with dunks that defy gravity and basketson fire, or do we give it a more simulative setting? Thus a hybrid came out that is neither one nor the other, pleasant to play in multiplayer, but limiting in single player", "date": "2001-05-26", "grade": null}
