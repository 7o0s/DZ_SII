Process of Elimination is yet another recent example of Japanese graphic adventures trying the road to success, in the wake of a decidedly animated movement under the surface. If there is one publisher to thank for making this genre almost popular, it is Nippon Ichi Software: it will be due to its global network and a very rich schedule of publications, but the NIS structure is solid, branched, aware that it can otherwise very shy titles that would have been video game ghosts from the top hat a few years ago. satisfying, enrich it with twists and gameplay investigations. Will it go like this? Let's find out together in the Process of Elimination review if the arrival in Europe gives new life to this game. Murderer among us Some scenic gimmicks of Process of Elimination will appeal to fans of Japanese storytelling If you finally dreamed of entering the genre of investigative novels by controlling a detective, NIS has prepared fourteen for you, all characterized and quite profound: our heroes will have to investigate a series of rather brutal murders committed by a serial killer. We are in the Isle of Morgue and our protagonist is the youngest member to join the alliance of detectives that is formed to discover the killer. Process of Elimination tries to go in a different direction than usual, throwing into the fray huge moments of dialogue between supporting characters and a good dose of investigation, deduction and inquiry. Each detective has been thought out with criteria, both in terms of aesthetics and character, thanks to code names that immediately convey to the player the nature of each one: it will be through the enormous amount of dialogues that we will be able to direct the story towards one of the endings. What you won't have to worry about is the simplicity with which the game fails and you are brought to the last decision made: in its going to direct some plot elements towards multiple epilogues, the narrative of Process of Elimination lengthens and shortens as an accordion, alternating moments of concrete decisions with others that are less marked and palpable, in any case easily manageable by the ubiquitous saving function. Although not incredible for those who chew Japanese visual novels, the story is well packaged above all thanks to the cast which, as per the Japanese tradition, pushes us to become attached to this or that character without however crossing the cloying line of an extremely over-the-top narrative. The Process of Elimination team of detectives Process of Elimination's gameplay sections add color to the experience, but without adding bite If there is an element that emerges imperiously from the investigative gameplay of Process of Elimination it is certainly the team concept: the collaboration between the detectives will be the key to exploring every investigation opportunity, getting help from certain characters to solve specific puzzles, move them to the map to explore different areas simultaneously or by activating special abilities, based on each one's peculiarities. If this mechanism seems distracting to you, don't be alarmed: the game provides indications both to clarify the complexity of the investigation of a specific point, and to underline evidence that is more important than others. Overall, the gameplay logic pushes forward sufficiently, making the investigation and use of human resources is a strategic element not to be lost, inviting you to understand, advancing, the characteristics and strengths of the characters, who, as already mentioned, will be able to conquer and delight you with their characterization. The wheel of investigations moves well and the rhythm, the diversity of the playful options, the choices and the puzzles throw flour on a dough that remains fluid and fortunately never solidifies too hard: the fact is that sometimes the resolution is simple, sometimes almost guided, perhaps to make sure that nobody gets stuck too much in some places. There is a ~but~, which becomes even greater given the amount of dialogue and text present: forget Italian. While this may not be a problem for most, even the most experienced can lose details in the rivers of writing that will populate your screens. Final note, rather quick: the technical aspect is pleasant, made so by the artwork of the supporting characters and a clearly non-priority background graphic ambition, but the real plus remains being able to play it on the go on Nintendo Switch.", "date": "2023-04-15", "grade": "7.0"}
