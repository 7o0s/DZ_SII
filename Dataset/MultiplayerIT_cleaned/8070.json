Developed by one person, who then founded the Snowbird studio, it has been available since 2009 but only on the Russian market. There he managed to carve out his own niche of passionate gamers which allowed him to land, after three years, also in western markets (it is only translated into English and is only available on GOG.com). The author's hope is that he will lead the way for the sequel, Eador. Masters of the Broken World, of which the beta testing phase has begun these days. In fact we are talking about a title that between patches and bugfixes has reached version 2.0.1, which is quite different from the first release. It only remains to be established whether it is worth investing the little money it costs in the purchase. Let's get rid of the worm: graphically it's really ugly. It's actually worse. Eador: Genesis is presented in a 2D pixel art anonymous and almost completely devoid of animation. The maps are not that great, just as the various drawings of the different and numerous summary or management screens are the emblem of the functionality. The frills are reduced to the bone and it is clearly seen that this is a poorly cared for aspect. We can safely say that there is much better in the indie scene. At this point you have to decide whether or not the graphics are important to evaluate the game. The first impact, indeed, is not the best, but as you enter the game, you tend to no longer pay attention to the visual paucity, such is the substance that is in front of you. And it is precisely the substance that made us love this first work, giving us high hopes for the sequel (which will be in 3D). The old school Trying to describe all the mechanics and facets of Eador: Genesis in a review is a bit like wanting to thread a camel through the eye of a needle (someone has already used this one... but who?). It is a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements that is really complex and complete, very reminiscent of old school classics such as Masters of Magic or Heroes of Might and Magic. The player is called to conquer the kingdoms of Eador placed on fragments of land floating in the Great Nothing. The ultimate goal is to unify what is divided and in the hands of the Masters, powerful creatures that the inhabitants of the individual worlds believe to be gods. To fulfill the mission it will be necessary to conquer the capitals of each kingdom while avoiding that the opponent on duty does the same with ours. The game begins with what we can consider a very long tutorial, i.e. we are guided to the conquest of the first kingdom by a mentor who will help us in various ways, showing us each time what to do and explaining the interface (not exactly friendly) and the options available. This is a fundamental phase to penetrate the complexity of Eador, partly because there are really a lot of aspects to explore and partly because the full-bodied online manual is only available in Russian. Don't worry, the tutorial will be more than enough to start taking your first steps. Phases The gameplay is divided into several phases, which we can enclose in two macro categories: the management part, in which you have to decide how to move the heroes, which buildings to build, which spells to learn and so on, and the actual combat in which you need to deploy your army and then lead it into battle (if you want you can also rely on automatic combat, especially useful when the enemies are particularly scarce). Both phases offer many variations that it is impossible for us to list in their entirety. Know that a hero (belonging to one of the four available classes) has various tasks to perform, such as attacking neutral territories or territories occupied by other factions, thoroughly exploring the individual territories to find hidden places to venture and obtain loot, or attacking an enemy capital and start a siege. Among the various options of the management phase we point out the possibility of constructing buildings to improve the capital and have more resources available and the need to prepare defenses in case of enemy siege, with the possibility of hiring more or less strong or real troops adventurers party. In total there are more than one hundred and seventy buildings to build, eighty spells to research and seventy types of units to use, albeit with precise limits. For example, in the capitals you can't build everything and you have to make choices, also based on the type of hero you have. During the first few games it is easy to end up with useless buildings that are of little use to us. To solve this problem you can only gain experience. A tough nut to crack In general we can define Eador: Genesis a vast product full of thingsto do, which is not scratched by the technical limits and which will surely thrill lovers of the genre. Among the problems that must be noted there is certainly a certain imbalance in the hero classes, with warriors growing faster than wizards and the like, who need the construction of more buildings to have everything they need. In some situations, some unpleasant situations may also occur, due in part to the random generation of the maps. For example, it may happen that you find yourself in a kingdom surrounded by territories occupied by very powerful creatures, which force you to level up like madmen in order to expand. In general then we noticed that the regular troops are cannon fodder and only serve as support to the hero, the only one who benefits effectively from the level increase. In truth, even troops can accumulate experience, but the bonuses they get are so limited that it is often better to sacrifice them, even if of a high level, to buy more powerful troops, even if of a low level. Unfortunately, it is not possible to upgrade a unit into a more advanced unit. In short, a slinger, however high level, will always be inferior to an armored crossbowman. These nuances cause a significant increase in difficulty, which could especially displace newbies. Playing you understand that these are precise choices, which you quickly get used to, and that the developer certainly didn't have the ambition to please the general public, preferring to focus on a niche of enthusiasts happy with the challenge offered. In fact Eador: Genesis is a tough nut to crack, which for this very reason is able to guarantee dozens of hours of gameplay. A single campaign, especially if played on the higher difficulty levels and if you fight all the battles, can take many hours.", "date": "2013-01-04", "grade": "7.9"}
