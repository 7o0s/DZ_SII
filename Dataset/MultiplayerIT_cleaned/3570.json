In short, a spin-off that was not born by chance, since it has the great advantage of being able to reuse the settings and assets of the new episode of the series to tell us a story parallel to that of the Blazkowicz twins, also set in Paris in 1980 alternative in which Europe is still under the domination of the Nazi army. Put on the PlayStation VR viewer, you find yourself in the shoes of an unidentified character, sitting in a control post located inside a base of the French resistance. We are made aware of the situation by Maria's voice and by her assistant's text messages: the rebels have come into possession of some of the powerful robots built by the Germans, in order to reprogram them to allow us to command them remotely and thus use the enemy's weapons against the enemy itself. Gameplay and controls In short, the incipit of Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot is not bad at all, and navigating the structure in which we find ourselves soon becomes a fascinating and immersive experience: the seat to which we are anchored can move rapidly vertically to reach four different levels, one of which he is responsible for the configuration of the three robots that we will use during the missions: the quadrupedal Panzerhund flamethrower, the Wespe flying drone and the colossal Zitadelle. The hacking operations take place like a simple mini-game based on dexterity: we are asked to rotate the unit until we locate a door with a flashing light, bring it closer to our position, use a crowbar to open the compartment, extract a chip, reprogram it, and then reinsert it. There are some variations of these mechanics that find their place during the game's short campaign, and which unfortunately get into a bit of a crisis from the point of view of the controls when we are asked to perform operations on objects that are to our right or to the our left: on these occasions the detection of the DualShock by the PlayStation Camera appears particularly problematic and you have to go a bit groping. Fortunately, once on a mission everything works well, you can opt for the traditional shifting of the view in jerks (adjusting the instantaneous inclination degrees in this sense) or make it fluid if you don't have motion sickness problems, while the inclination is of the controller to control the viewfinder. Each Nazi killing machine has different weapons: the Panzerhund literally spits fire from its mouth, the drone is equipped with an electric cannon that is only effective from a short distance and finally the Zitadelle can opt for a Gatling gun on his right arm and a missile launcher on his left . The reticle sometimes tends to get off-centre, but it is enough to use the self-repair function (small drones intervene on the fly to repair the damage to the machine) to recalibrate it. Precisely this functionality, together with the special ability (a concealment system for the drone, an energy barrier for the colossus), contributes to substantially diminish the degree of challenge of the experience: it is enough to survive a single firefight to be able to restore life energy and proceed further and this, together with a very basic artificial intelligence of the enemies, turns the campaign into a health walk. Playstation 4 trophies There are twenty-three Trophies available in Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot. Some of them are obtained simply by completing the missions that make up the campaign, others are linked to specific actions that take place both during the briefing phases and in the middle of the action: kill ten Nazis in five seconds with the Citadelle, complete a assignment with the Panzerhund without using the flamethrower, use the Breakthrough ability to eliminate five enemies, and so on. Structure and technical realization The lack of challenge is certainly one of the problems of Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, a clear sign that for virtual reality applications the right balance between accessibility and complexity is still sought, which is the case for an expert team but novice with VR ( such as Arkane Studios) unfortunately arises as a rather heavy duty to pay. Then there is the proverbial elephant in the room, the duration: the game's campaign consists of just four missions that are completed in less than two hours, and unfortunately it is impossible to find any justification here. In fact, if it was decided to create this spin-off by taking advantage of ready-made assets di Wolfenstein: Youngblood, we cannot understand what would have been the problem in inserting at least double the assignments, bringing the total duration of the experience close to those four hours which usually represent the average for this type of application and for the band price of 19.99 euros. It doesn't even make a comparison with the aforementioned Youngblood in terms of the relationship between cost and content: it would be really merciless. It's a shame, because the narrative device set up for the occasion had a certain potential (and we appreciated the final surprise), the gameplay boasts a certain degree of variety thanks to the drone's stealth approach and the lore created by MachineGames it is also confirmed in this case as very fascinating. On the technical level, however, we move between ups and downs: the decrease in resolution is perceived quite clearly and savings have been made on the quality of the assets and effects, but visually the game behaves fairly well and the Italian dubbing is well Done.", "date": "2019-07-30", "grade": "5.5"}
