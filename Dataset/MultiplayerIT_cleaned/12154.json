{"name": "English Trainer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/english-trainer.html", "text": "The genre of ~educational~ titles has always represented a niche of video games, until recently, in which it has been possible to combine learning and entertainment in an effective and creative way. On mobile phones, products of this type exert a strong attraction: technically accessible given their simplicity, they can count on an extremely heterogeneous public, also and above all made up of people who do not know video games and therefore do not demand action at all costs but know appreciate alternative experiences. And English Trainer certainly offers an ~alternative~ experience... Developed by Kitmaker, English Trainer offers two game modes: Test or Study. The second is preparatory to the first, in the sense that you have the possibility to try your hand at the various tests in a free way, choosing the one to try and without receiving a final judgment. By selecting the Test mode, on the other hand, you start in a sequence of applications of different types, which are divided into vocabulary, grammar and reading training. In the first case, there are the ~Drawing~, ~Numbers~ and ~Colors~ tests which ask us respectively to choose the right term to identify a drawing, to write a number that appears in letters in figures and to choose the color which matches the word shown from time to time. In the case of grammar, the tests are more ~playful~: in ~Baloons~ we will have to shoot balloons bearing words, in the right order to form a correct sentence; in ~Catch it~ we will have to do something similar, grabbing the missing word to form a sentence among those that move on the screen; in ~Rain words~, finally, we will have to move a wand at the bottom of the screen as words fall, and touch only those that have a relationship with the sentence that appears upstream. The last application, reading, sees us grapple with the ~True or false~, ~Choose the words~ and ~Mistakes wanted~ tests: in the first we will have to answer a question (true or false) after reading and understanding a short text; in the second we will have to ~shoot~ the words of a text that belong to a certain category; in the third, we will have to highlight the errors contained in a text. Like any educational title, English Trainer does not boast a first-level technical achievement nor does it feel the need for it. The sound sector consists of music and simple sound effects that can easily be deactivated, while the graphics focus more on textual representations and colors, without producing anything amazing. The control system is simple and intuitive, and sees the use of the joystick where there is to move a cursor, while it is possible to directly use the numeric pad of the telephone when there is to write numbers. In practice, the only defect that can be found has to do with the tests in which an arrow, a hand or a cursor must be moved: the joystick cannot be agile or fluid, making the experience difficult and cumbersome.
