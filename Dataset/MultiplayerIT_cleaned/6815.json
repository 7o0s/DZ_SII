The problem, however, is that in order to make a game ~ la Dark Souls~ it is not enough to raise the difficulty to the maximum and who has seen has seen: it's all a matter of level design, which must be almost perfect and studied in detail. Of course, Natural Doctrine is not an action RPG but a turn-based strategy, and Kadokawa Games is not From Software, but we believe that it is precisely the kind of game that expresses this complex paradox in the clearest possible way: Natural Doctrine is very difficult because it is designed with the feet. Natural Doctrine is the Dark Souls of strategy RPGs but we don't mean that as a compliment! Portable clichs The strategic RPGs of the past such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts or Tactics Ogre have taught us that the genre is perfectly capable of offering storylines of superlative quality relying only on the dialogue sequences that separate the battles and missions. In those days the silhouettes of the characters or even just their rough two-dimensional sprites were enough to give life to the magic: the bulk of the work was done by the narration, the dialogues, the pauses, the reasoned choice of words and times. Natural Doctrine, for its part, slips on the proverbial banana peel: after the first few hours, the Kadokawa Games title tries to table a series of deeper and more original themes than usual, but fails miserably due to a really insipid cast of protagonists . The protagonist is Geoff, a soldier from the city of Feste charged with carrying out a simple mission in the company of the beautiful Vasily and Anka. Needless to say, the three will remain involved in a story much bigger than them on which the fate of the world depends: between one clich and another, Geoff will gather around him a band of adventurers who will have to help him quell the rivalries between the races sentient beings that risk turning into open warfare. The approach with which Natural Doctrine deals with some interesting topics, such as the ambiguous position of the human race in the conflict, is unfortunately hampered by the banal characterization of the characters. This isn't Fire Emblem; it is not possible to become attached to the various heroes precisely because of a script full of narrative holes and a group of characters who identify themselves more in their battle cries than in the motivations that drive them to fight. Also from a technical point of view, Natural Doctrine is a disappointing title: the polygonal models are quite accurate, but their animations are woody and the environments in which they move appear dull and poor in details from the start. The sound accompaniment is discreet, but certainly not unforgettable, while the voices chosen to dub the various characters in English range from unbearable to barely sufficient: the impression, in some cases, is that the lines have been recited without even knowing the tone of the character in question. PSVita trophies The 45 trophies (33 bronze, 9 silver and 3 gold) add some spice to the already difficult Natural Doctrine campaign because unlocking some of them will be a real feat. In fact, it will be necessary to face some missions in a particular way, risking big on more than one occasion, and play the multiplayer mode assiduously. Heachache Natural Doctrine is a fairly traditional strategy game, at first glance: there's a map that allows you to choose a location where you can stock up on supplies, continue the story or face yet another mission or battle. The battles, in the end, are the heart of the game, and it's a real shame that Kadokawa Games hasn't been able to better express what, all in all, is a very interesting and original combat system. Unfortunately, the tutorial is already a gloomy warning: the fact that it cannot clearly explain the mechanics portends the worst for the future, and in fact we realize all too soon that Natural Doctrine's gameplay essentially relies on a repeated ~trial and error~. The matter is rather convulsive, but in essence the player controls the individual units of his group in the third person, a bit like in the Valkyria Chronicles. The combat area is not a grid, as occurs in the vast majority of turn-based strategic RPGs: instead, it is divided into micro areas that can be occupied by a certain number of characters and/or enemies depending on their size. Each area has its advantages and disadvantages, and understanding the terrain is one of the keys to successor: the enemies, moreover, can literally slaughter our most defenseless characters with one blow, and it is enough for even just one to die to go to Game Over. It therefore becomes very important to place our weakest units nearby together with the strongest ones, which will protect them as much as possible. The most interesting thing, however, is that the units will be linked by colored lines that indicate additional conditions and bonuses based on positions and possible reciprocal interactions: by satisfying certain requirements, in fact, it is possible to anticipate the turn of one of our allies, so that it can move and attack or defend itself sooner than expected. It goes without saying that by correctly coordinating the movements of our team it is possible to act continuously without leaving a chance for the enemy; on the other hand, however, the same rule applies to our opponents, and rest assured that they will take advantage of it in every clash. Natural Doctrine's problem, in fact, is just that. Kadokawa Games has not well balanced the statistics of characters and enemies, and the latter appear from the beginning too tough and harmful, able to easily eliminate our heroes with their chains of turns. To win a battle, in Natural Doctrine, you need to develop strategies that border on precognition, anticipating the enemy's moves based on rules or movements that rarely have to do with common sense, especially when artificial intelligence monitors our allies at our place, not caring if they risk involving us in their own spells. In this regard, Natural Doctrine also manages magic in a rather peculiar way: instead of the MP we have the Pluton, which however must be found and accumulated during the missions, often forcing us to risk everything to prevent our magicians from remaining dry and become almost useless. These particular inventions give Natural Doctrine a somewhat particular flavor, but unfortunately they clash with its biggest flaw: the interface. Defining it chaotic is a compliment: you don't understand anything, full of colored lines, icons, texts, balloons and indicators. During the most elaborate fights, it becomes practically incomprehensible, a jumble in which even a ~combat log~ gets stuck which only manages to inflate the screen without adding anything really useful to the gameplay. Therefore, it almost makes you smile that the multiplayer mode has nothing to do with the actual combat system: it is, in fact, a kind of trading card game that allows players to face each other by building decks of cards in Magic. It would seem a superficial addition, but instead it is clearer and more fun than the single player campaign, which is saying something.", "date": "2014-10-24", "grade": "5.0"}
