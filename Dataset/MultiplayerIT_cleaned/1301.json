{"name": "R-Type Final", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/r-type-final.html", "text": "Final with barrels The previous R-Type Delta dated 1998 received at the time of its release on Playstation a very good reception from critics, with more than a few reviews praising the masterpiece: needless to say that in the light of these facts, the expectation of R- Type Final on the part of fans was certainly remarkable, even despite the lack of hype around the Irem title. Well, after several game sessions with the shoot'em up subject of this review, the feeling is that of being faced with a product that is certainly well made, but which lacks the personality and stylistic quality of the various prequels. What is certain is that R-Type Final can count on some elements of sure impact, starting with the graphic aspect: as tradition dictates, the screen is constantly filled by enemy spaceships of the most varied shapes, as well as by a plethora of bullets, explosions and special effects, all done in a highly choreographed and spectacular way. The care taken in the construction of the backdrops is also noteworthy, despite the fact that more than one setting is the result of the use of some clichs of the genre. The price to pay for the visual orgy of R-Type Final manifests itself clearly in the frequent (and often very heavy) slowdowns of the action, probably second in size only to the historical ones of G-Darius; however it must also be emphasized that the presence of slowdowns, although certainly not pleasant, does not constitute such a serious limitation to the normal course of the game. Can 100 spaceships be enough for me? The graphic majesty of R-Type Final goes hand in hand with that relating to the spacecraft fleet made available to the player. In fact, there are over 100 spaceships that can be unlocked during the game and that it is later possible to select and customize as desired: although many look too similar, the vastness of choice granted to the user is certainly appreciable, as is the design of the various models and the different possibilities of personalization of the same, relating to both the aesthetic aspect and the rigging. Wanting to be mischievous, however, after playing R-Type Final one thinks that the monstrous amount of ships available is almost a useful expedient to somehow mask the certainly not unforgettable gameplay of the Irem title. In fact, although R-Type Final undoubtedly constitutes a highly enjoyable experience for all lovers of the genre, however it lacks that personality and that quality in level design that made its predecessors unique. To begin with, R-Type Final does not include practically any novelty in terms of game structure useful for differentiating it from the previous R-Type Delta: as in the prequel released on Playstation, in fact, the weapons do not go beyond the three different lasers, the Charge Shot, the Force Pods and the Delta Weapon. In short, all things already seen, with the aggravating circumstance that the levels in R-Type Final do not always prove to be up to par, often lacking the frenzy useful for loading the user with adrenaline: there are a total of 7 stages, some of which present even bifurcations, which can be tackled through 5 difficulty stages. In short, R-Type Final lets itself be played, and how, but precisely because of the name it bears, it was reasonable to expect something more in terms of playful qualities. Even the sound accompaniment seems to have been affected by the general torpor that seems to pervade the entire Irem production: the music is in fact catchy but absolutely not very incisive and often even unsuitable for providing an adequate complement to the game action. Comment R-Type Final is a pleasant and fun shooter, which will certainly be able to satisfy all fans of the genre eager to try their hand at a new challenge. On the other hand, however, the last born in the Irem house is also distinguished by a chronic lack of originality and personality that clashes quite a bit with the image that the saga has built over the years. Faced with a respectable graphic design and the 100 ships available, in fact, R-Type Final struggles to amaze both from the point of view of pure and simple gameplay, and in terms of level design, not very incisive for settings and structures . In short, considering the excellent precedents provided by R-Type Delta, the latter R-Type Final cannot help but leave the player a little dumbfounded, who is faced with a product that is so enjoyable but which seems to have really done well little to say. Pros: Good graphics 100 different ships available Gameplay always fun Cons: Level design disappointing Music that can be improved Frequent slowdowns Ever since the advent of 32-bit platforms and the move to 3D, the genre of shootertto two-dimensional began to show worrying signs of slowing down: few were the ideas left to the developers to try to renew a stale genre, and fewer and fewer were the software houses willing to invest in a sector that was inexorably losing ground towards fresher genres and attractive to the general public. The decline of scrolling shoot'em ups has therefore continued up to the present day, without however ever hitting rock bottom, thanks to a few excellent products capable of awakening the shooter instinct of the players. And this is precisely the goal of the R-Type Final here.", "date": "2004-05-25", "grade": null}
