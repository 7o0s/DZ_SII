Knights of Valour, without going around too much, tries to break this rule by exploiting in its own way a genre left to rest for too long, however failing in its most essential mechanics. Scrolling beat'em ups had a heyday in the 90s between arcades and arcades and then gradually thinned out over time. Someone, every now and then, still tries to remind the new generations that even with simple and intuitive commands it is still possible to have fun and the greatest exponents of the genre have shown wonderful things. Let's think of Castle Crashers, for example, or even of Dragon's Crown, two artistically impeccable works with exceptional qualities. When we first heard of Knights of Valor we pricked up our ears since the original title, at least eighteen years old, was quite successful in the East, so much so that it prompted International Games System to even make it a series. A full price game disguised as free to play: it's impossible not to spend to fully enjoy it Musou 2D The setting is that of the Three Kingdoms, which many of you will know due to (or thanks to) the many musou released in recent years. Characters, enemies and stories therefore draw inspiration from the clashes that took place in China between the Wei, Wu and Jin dynasties, adding sorcerers, samurai and this time also demons of various kinds to the usual formula, not all particularly original but at least with an attractive design. From ours we will obviously have a handful of heroes with well-known faces but only two will be usable initially: the gigantic Guan Yu, a beast equipped with a halberd, and the agile Diao Chan equipped with a double dagger. The main problem, and which essentially immediately reveals the heavy free to play system inherent in the title, is that to get the remaining characters you will be forced to open your wallet, coming to shell out almost twenty euros for a single additional hero. Of course, you could also save something by relying on the inclusive bundle of all the heroes for over sixty euros, but frankly they seem crazy figures for a product whose quality, as we will see, is decidedly fluctuating. The thousand initial tutorials, confusing and even annoying, fill us with information on available currencies, simple game mechanics, daily missions and also tell us that, by completing the various achievements, it will be possible to unlock heroes and costumes over time. This is partially true but after spending at least ten hours of gameplay on Knights of Valor one realizes that in order to have the hope of obtaining even just one of the extra heroes, it will be necessary to throw at least twenty times as much time into the title, a compromise that can't satisfy those who don't want to spend and are not comfortable with the initial fighters. Thus we find ourselves stuck in a scrolling fighting game with essentially only two characters, a situation that makes multiplayer sessions monotonous, often reduced to clashes with four identical characters against the yellow turban army, for total screen confusion and readability of insufficient action. On the razor's edge Once the initial shock has been overcome, one realizes that, after all, the mechanics aren't even too bad, if one takes into consideration precisely that this is a remake/homage to a game released in 1999. We will find ourselves having to fight against continuous waves of enemies trying to advance through the level until you reach the final boss, occasionally choosing which path to take. You can find weapons, armor and healing tools, essential to continue the adventure and try your luck with the highest difficulties, in a continuous cycle already seen on a thousand other occasions. There's also a simplistic crafting system and a hint of fighter customization via three talent branches, but the points you spend change your character's fighting style and combos very little. Knights of Valor fails where it should have given more, proposing a combat system based on imprecise and ultimately extremely repetitive directional strikes, unsuitable for the accelerated pace of the modern market. The loaded shots and the special moves to be launched by emptying the stamina bar are of little use, the repetitiveness of the game patterns is really too accentuated and the artificial intelligence is the numb one typical of the genre, with repetitive and predictable attack patterns. A youffo in the past that we would have gladly avoided. Killing enemies, as we said, gives you money and experience, complicating things once you reach the eleventh level. After this ~soft cap~, the game becomes more punishing, removing the possibility of continuing indefinitely in the event of death and forcing the player to consume one of the three lives at his disposal to continue. Lives are shared between all characters and there are only two ways to recharge them: buy them with real money or wait 30 minutes. You understand well that as long as things are easy and permissive this structure is not particularly tedious but at the highest difficulties, with the enemies who kill you with very few shots, it even becomes frustrating to die. Fortunately, among the combat mechanics there are dodges and parries, which could make your life easier, but before arriving at a condition where you will be able to play continuously and carefree you will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts. Even the regeneration of life, totally absent, makes itself felt as the adventure progresses and it is perhaps the first time that in a fighting game of this kind health is not restored at the end of a level, a desired and sought punishment just to raise the bar of difficulty.", "date": "2017-05-15", "grade": "6.0"}
