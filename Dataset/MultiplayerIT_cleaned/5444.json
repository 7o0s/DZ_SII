Far Harbor has added a whole new area and a storyline that's in many ways better than the main campaign, Automatron has new buildable robotic companions and a hilarious adventure attached to them, and the only half misstep can be attributed to Wasteland Workshop. a DLC that significantly expanded the game's in-depth crafting system, but added very little else. But now a second round of DLC is about to arrive - the one for which the price of the pass has suddenly risen, so to speak - and we start again with an extra much closer to the less substantial one of the previous package called Contraptions Workshop. Here too we are faced with an addition focused entirely on outposts, designed for those players who have spent the vast majority of hours in the desolate Commonwealth creating wooden and sheet metal fortresses, and protecting them with all kinds of gimmicks. We therefore put on our engineer's helmet and took a close look at the new options offered by the DLC, to understand if it is a sop waiting for the main course or a serious added value. The answer will please only a fraction of you. Contraptions Workshop, a DLC for real Wasteland engineers only... and that's not a good thing Venghino siori venghino, tools for everyone As already mentioned, in Contraptions Workshop there will be no missions, new characters, or elements connected in any way to the story; once the mod is installed, you will immediately find a series of new options waiting for you in the outpost crafting menu, cheerfully signaled by a small symbol in the upper right corner to indicate its novelty. The most significant additions, at least in terms of number and complexity, are undoubtedly those related to conveyor belts and... ahem, marble runs. The latter in particular are exactly what they seem: complex and mountable gutters, which will allow you to add very complicated paths to your houses for a large iron marble. We imagine the uselessness of the thing is quite evident, it is after all a purely decorative addition, yet most of the Contraptions Workshop novelties follow this trend. The conveyor belts themselves - however functional and full of complex components that allow you to create real factories or automatic crossroads to divide objects - have very little sense within the game economy. Creating complex mechanisms takes a lot of time, all for an ultimate utility that borders on zero, unless you really enjoy creating unnecessarily complicated contraptions and paths, or you don't want to automate all the movements in the outposts. Even the new machines, which allow you to create weapons, armor, clothes and fireworks, require such an amount of time and materials to be built and used, that in 90% of cases you will prefer the usual free exploration between enemies and dangers various. Perhaps the most useful machine is the one that allows you to build ammunition, but it seemed to us that it only made sense if paired with Survival Mode, where resources are scarce (however, you will, in fact, have a lot of effort even just building it in that mode). Doodles for everyone! In short, the vast majority of objects made available by Contraptions Workshop are more for show than anything else. The only truly noteworthy new features are perhaps the logic gates and complex circuits, which allow you to manage the energy and operation of the machines in an outpost with a precision never seen before in the game. However, even these goodies are functional for a small part of the players, the one who is really sick of crafting and eager to give life to monstrosities of neon and metal. For all the others, the attractions will be very few, and mostly linked to the embellishment of one's base camp. On the other hand, as aesthetes that we are, we only found the mannequins for armor and display cases for weapons really appetizing, which can now be positioned comfortably in your own home, and a couple of connectors that greatly facilitate the complicated management of wires between buildings . Of course, don't even think for a moment that the DLC improves the basic crafting management in any way: positioning the various pieces remains an awkward and imprecise procedure, which will make you very nervous when you try to use new buildings and elements in combination with those old. This last problem will annoy you, for example, when you decide to match gyou lift them (another novelty) to any building that is not part of the additional sheds, whose height is calculated precisely around theirs. In practice it is a nice filler, a DLC designed to keep most people busy waiting for something better, which honestly we would have appreciated more with a due free release. For heaven's sake, the presence of giant mortars, fireworks that change the weather, a very stylish wooden pillory and various improvements to sheds or buildings teases us, we don't deny it, but it certainly isn't worth the ticket price if you don't have bought the season pass. Conditionally recommended only for those who spend hours in the outposts, and want to turn the Wasteland into their personal playground. Everyone else can look forward to future expansions", "date": "2016-06-27", "grade": null}
