{"name": "Polvere alla polvere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119559-dust-514-polvere-alla-polvere.html", "text": "After a rather long development period (the first announcement dates back to GDC 2009), crowned by a thorough beta phase, DUST 514 is finally available on the PlayStation Store and allows all Sony console owners to try their hand at a different experience from the usual: that of a multiplayer FPS that adopts the famous free-to-play model, that is, it can be downloaded and played for free while giving us the possibility to make purchases with real money to obtain certain items or packs faster and/or for a longer period of time. In terms of concept, the title developed by CCP Games appears highly innovative, given its links with EVE Online, the space strategy game for PC that has recently reached its nineteenth expansion. The soldier we control in DUST 514, in fact, is part of the ground troops that are sent from these large space ships to some planets to counter enemy units with a view to controlling the galaxy. This means that EVE Online players handle the big picture, setting up large-scale battles which are then fought by DUST 514 players when it comes to actually coming to blows. The idea is particularly fascinating for those who have had some experience on PC and now have the opportunity to experience the fights in first person, or know someone who plays EVE Online and who can therefore provide him with a link to what happens to ~upper floors~, while on the contrary completely ignoring the existence of this original link will not produce great sensations once in action, also and above all because of the limits we will talk about shortly. Which soldier are you? The first thing we are asked to do once DUST 514 is downloaded is to create a character using one of the three available slots. We can choose to put ourselves in the shoes of a male or female soldier and fall into the ranks of the Amarr, the Gallente, the Caldari or the Minmatar. The Amarr empire is the oldest ever and is governed by an empress who has no problem enslaving large sections of the less well-off population to allow the elite to dominate, under the guise of faith. The Amarr are undoubtedly the most powerful race from a military point of view, in contrast to the Gallente, who boast decidedly more solid moral principles and position themselves as the defenders of the oppressed. That of the Gallente is the only true democracy of New Eden and over the centuries it has developed in an extraordinary way in terms of technology, focusing above all on battle drones and automated systems. Then we have the Caldari State, founded on work and patriotism, with a dictatorial government based on ideologies, known for having no qualms about its goals. Finally, there are the Minmatar, a tribal-type race that has been slave of the Amarr for almost a thousand years to then operate a revolt to achieve freedom. Each of these four races is characterized by different equipment, which particularly affects the aesthetic aspect of our character. However, these are the only elements in this sense, given that CCP Games has not yet thought about implementing color variations, accessories and anything else in the game to allow users to clearly distinguish themselves from each other. The skill tree Once our alter ego has been created complete with name and surname (which must not coincide with an identical one present on the EVE Online servers), we will have a certain amount of ISK available, i.e. the ~virtual~ currency of the game (where the Aurum constitute the real currency, which we can only obtain by putting our hand in the wallet), to be spent to purchase certain equipment and, above all, to unlock the skills necessary to be able to use them. This is undoubtedly the best aspect of DUST 514, because the tree structure that allows us to access the objects, the market and the aforementioned skills hides a great depth and at the same time a great potential. This is not the most immediate system ever seen, therefore less patient players could certainly turn up their noses and feel disoriented, but it allows us to make our character stronger, opening up a whole series of opportunities that can go hand in hand with what is our approach to battle. If we prefer to throw ourselves headlong into firefights, we can unlock skills that involve the use of heavy weapons and armor, then buy what we need to get equipment of that type and become real war machines. Or maybe we prefer a silent approach, opting for a light but comfortable armorde faster and a sniper rifle to hit targets even from a great distance. The ISKs released during the games are quite numerous and at first allow a large room for maneuver, but at a certain point they suddenly become few as the prices of skills and items rise exponentially. The impression is therefore that the developers have created a very open system at first, but which then takes a steep curve in terms of costs to push users to buy one of the available packages, with prices up to 99 euros. In action! If the skill customization system and the original interconnections with EVE Online represent the best part of DUST 514, the one with the greatest long-term potential, unfortunately the bulk of the enthusiasm for this production is stupid as soon as you set foot on the battlefield . The work done by CCP Games on the technical implementation front is in fact mediocre, with few maps and practically only two modes: one is the traditional team deathmatch for up to forty-eight participants, the other is a territorial mode in which you have to conquer emplacements to destroy the opposing ship. Organizing with friends is fun, that's true, but it's really difficult to turn a blind eye to the game's shortcomings, both in terms of graphics, so devoid of definition and with visual effects so bad that they seem to belong to the past generation, and as regards the net code, spoiled by obvious problems since monstrous slowdowns occur from time to time. The maps available are very extensive but completely devoid of personality, it is simply a matter of contrasting some structures and some barriers with a series of hills with unwatchable textures. We didn't even like the sound: beyond the bad narrative voice in Italian, the entire sector appears too ~silent~ and essential to be able to effectively represent the chaos of such large battles. DUST 514 stands as an original experiment full of potential, but poorly implemented.", "date": "2013-06-08", "grade": "6.0"}
