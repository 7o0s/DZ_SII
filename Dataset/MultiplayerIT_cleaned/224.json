We would never, ever have thought that a videogame could, in some way, constitute a ~sensible training method~, in this case an aerobic training with strong contaminations linked to martial arts. All you need is a PS2, an EyeToy peripheral and a copy of Kinetic Combat to try your hand at a series of physical applications that combine business with pleasure and that see you as protagonists in first person, on the screen, intent on hitting targets or opponents, or following an aerobic workout. The first thing the game does is create a profile asking for your gender, age, weight, height, body type and training experience. Then you can try your hand at a quick game, choosing the type, or start with a workout that lasts sixteen weeks and which sees you supported by a virtual personal trainer with the task of instructing and motivating you. Naturally this is the main mode of Kinetic Combat, whose difficulty is adjusted according to your characteristics and which draws on five different sources: aerobic training proper, training aimed at kung fu techniques (Dragon), training for strength and endurance (Tiger), coordination (Mantis) and precision (Phoenix). [C] Hit the targets without touching the barriers ...And avoid enemy shots! Soon we will be able to behave like the models on the screen... [/C] How does it work? In order to use Kinetic Combat in the right way, it is essential to have a certain amount of free space. Don't think you can throw punches and kicks inside a ~crowded~ room, because you'll end up hitting walls and/or furniture (at best! Think of the possibility that someone suddenly enters...). The TV should be at a certain distance, and the EyeToy device should be adjusted in height so that your silhouette matches the one shown on the screen. A plus can be represented by good lighting and the presence of a background that contrasts with your figure, but in general the game performs very well in detecting movements. Once the mode has been chosen, we move on to action: objects appear around our image on the screen which must be hit in the shortest possible time and with the utmost precision; or there are opponents who must be attacked in some moments but avoided in others. Or again, if we are in training mode, we have to follow our trainer's movements just as if it were an aerobics class. It is obvious that at the beginning, sustaining a workout will be more or less difficult depending on the state of shape; but your ability to adapt will ensure that work is more sustainable every time, with more precise and coordinated movements. Each product developed for use with the EyeToy peripheral has a different order of values from regular PS2 video games. In this case, the technical side can be neglected in favor of an appeal based on interaction and little more. In the case of Kinetic Combat, however, the developers have not neglected graphics and sound, with good results in both fields. Comment This product is probably the smartest application developed for the EyeToy so far. Technically valid for the graphics and sound, but even more for the optimization of shooting and collision detection, Kinetic Combat can really get you back in shape and its only limit lies in your own determination: if you want to burn calories, increase noticeably improve coordination and aerobic fitness, this game can really help you. Highly recommended to anyone who owns the EyeToy device. Pros: Innovative and intelligent Gradual and controlled training Virtually infinite Cons: It's still training Can be difficult if you are out of shape Needs a lot of space Generally, a passion for video games is combined with a sedentary lifestyle. In reality, the matter is not that simple, and if there are many gamers who are out of shape it is simply due to a statistical question: the bulk of the Italian population (and elsewhere they are in much worse shape) does everything except train, with what follows: condition mediocre aerobics, poor muscle tone and excess fat. At the basis of any training there must be motivation, possibly not the empty one of a season (~I get in shape for the summer~), but something more solid and lasting, which undoubtedly leads to results when combined with a sensible method and a regular and correct diet.", "date": "2006-12-12", "grade": null}
