{"name": "That Dragon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/162010-that-dragon-cancer-pancake-per-joel.html", "text": "Given the particularity of the game, we have chosen not to summarize the experience by giving it a rating. We hope that, by reading, you understand our decision. Mourning is one of the strongest feelings that human beings can experience. Faced with such intense pain, the way in which everyone faces death knows no right or wrong, but belongs to the deepest soul of the person and for this reason it must be respected. The choice of the Green family was to share this personal sphere, in the excruciating pain of seeing their son faced with a diagnosis of terminal cancer. A devastating experience, which until now no one else had decided to pour into a video game like Ryan and Amy did, giving life to That Dragon, Cancer. In the same period in which he still took care of Joel, the couple founded the Nominous Games team, actually made up of a few others: the developer friend Josh Larson and some artists who were entrusted with the representation of the scenes. In times in which one wonders about the maturity of the video game as a medium that is increasingly open to dealing with topics of a certain emotional depth, That Dragon, Cancer has also assumed a certain importance for the entire industry, alongside titles such as Depression Quest. A game far from the classic definition of a game, difficult to evaluate and at times even to play, because it explores that completely intimate pain that makes its way into the awareness that the villain will win. However, the desire of the Greens is to share their experience with those like us who want to try That Dragon, Cancer. That Dragon, Cancer is the love song of the parents of little Joel Green, who died of cancer in 2014 The child knight That Dragon, Cancer tells a sad story. It does so without using filters or half measures, projecting the player into the thoughts and words of Ryan and Amy, forced to live with little Joel's incurable disease. The overall duration is more or less equal to that of a film, but it could not have been otherwise given that That Dragon, Cancer is one of those titles that focuses on the intensity of the experience rather than its length. Pain is shown to us through strong and sometimes even conflicting emotions, making That Dragon, Cancer interesting precisely because of its way of representing all the moments of such a dramatic story, made up of so much suffering but also of moments of almost stolen joy. Among the various scenes set in the hospital, there is one in which Amy transforms the lanes into a kart circuit, to try and give Joel a few minutes of fun like those lucky enough to experience many other children like him. The realization is quite surreal: the power-ups we collect are the medicines administered to Joel during the treatment of the disease, and at first glance the scene seems completely out of place. We have already read some criticism about it on the Internet, but we believe that it actually proves to be perfect in the context of That Dragon, Cancer, whose intention is not to hide the pain or vice versa tear away tears easily, but also to tell the apparently strangest moments that reality brings to those who find themselves in such a situation. This does not mean that suffering is not represented through particularly dramatic moments, such as the one in which we find ourselves in Joel's shoes with a toy in hand, while parents and doctors talk about the terminal diagnosis. A scene with a very strong emotional impact especially for the way in which it plunges us into the depths of the human soul, while Ryan wonders about his role as a father in such a desperate situation and the doctor suffers for the umpteenth time when he has to give such awful news to a pair of parents. There are moments that weigh like real boulders, in which more than a tear ends up streaking the player's face, sometimes forced to stop before being able to move forward, other times to hope that everything ends quickly. They are all normal reactions, reactions that also belong to those who experience pain like the one told in That Dragon, Cancer: there is no way to deal with things, there is no order, you are simply in the midst of the chaos of a sea stormy. Seagull wings The scenes in That Dragon, Cancer last between ten and fifteen minutes each. The crude reality of the story being told contrasts with the dreamlike style adopted to represent characters and things on video, halfway between a dream and a fairy tale where the protagonists are made of polygonal models without eyes or mouth. A fantasy world in which Joel fights against his dragon, in which, however, evil still finds its way, in the form ofbare trees, black and pulsating. The journey opens by putting us in the shoes of a duck busy eating the breadcrumbs that the child throws at it, while in one of the most touching moments from an emotional point of view we are a seagull flying between the words of Ryan and Amy, busy in a discussion with very animated tones: on the one hand his doubts and uncertainties, on the other her unshakable faith, who until the very end hopes in the divine miracle to continue holding her Joel. One minute we're part of the Green family's grief, the next we almost feel like intruders. One moment we're smiling to see Joel happy at his dad's prank, the next our eyes are puffy as we hear him cry inconsolably, despite Ryan trying to ease his suffering until his strength is exhausted. Returning to the ~video game~ moments, we find another one in which the video scene represents what Ryan and Amy tell their other children in the audio, transforming Joel into a small knight engaged in fighting against an invincible dragon in a sort of scrolling platformers with an already decided outcome. With the sad epilogue approaching, in That Dragon, Cancer the strong religious beliefs of the two parents make their way, to a point that we imagine could annoy those who do not believe in any divinity. In case you decide to let this story tell you, the advice we give you is to do it without judging Ryan and Amy, even in the moments when their reaction to pain seems far from what you would have. We are all simple human beings, with our ideas, our emotions and our reactions.", "date": "2016-01-15", "grade": "S.V."}
