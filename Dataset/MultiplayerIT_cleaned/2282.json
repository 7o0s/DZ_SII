{"name": "Luigi's Mansion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/luigis-mansion_a.html", "text": "Everything revolves around the figure of Luigi... And Luigi isn't Mario... Luigi isn't a hero... He's the anti-hero! Mario is afraid of nothing, Luigi of everything! The setting is reversed, our digital counterpart as well and we suddenly find ourselves in a haunted mansion, looking for Mario (whom we will only see on two occasions)... It's not the very first time to tell the truth: some of you remember Mario Is Missing for Super Nintendo? Well, the atypical 16-bit title, released a few centuries ago under the Mindscape label, has little or nothing in common with our Luigi's Mansion... Basically because Miyamoto's latest idea is a continuous pearl... Luigi trembling enters the spectral abode and everything seems to wink more than one eye at the upcoming BioHazard/Resident Evil; sometimes the feeling of ~parody~ is felt with a certain arrogance, as if to greet the newfound partnership with Capcom. Let's move on to something else and immediately come across the first gem: try pressing the front button A of your pad! Luigi will call Mario with an almost infinite range of intonations: ~Mario?!~, ~Maaario!~, ~Maariio?~... I swear that you will spend the first two minutes like this too! And our Luigi, the true soul of the entire play package, will go much further: during your exploration you will be accompanied by a single soundtrack, artfully orchestrated as always by the usual Koji Kondo... Luigi (simply brilliant) almost to gain courage during the exploration phases, he will hum on the aforementioned track, perfectly in time, except for interrupting himself to resume whistling over those same notes! In some rooms where there will be no background music, our plumber will sing or whistle the tune of the game, as if it had remained in his mind by listening to it: but do you realize?! Looks like a worker at work! And the beauty is that he will never hum with the same intonation, but his voice will be shrill and tremulous in the darkest and most tenebrous locations, more carefree in the quiet or, by now, disinfested ones! Without words... I was saying earlier that the Italian plumber looks like a real worker in the workplace... Well, let's say he looks like a worker in a cleaning company! Ours, in fact, will be armed with a sort of very powerful vacuum cleaner (L to suck, R to blow) designed to clean up the mansion from any ectoplasmic entity! Ghostbusters docet! The ghost-sucking group will be equipped with a flashlight (A key) and a GameBoy Horror (subjective X key, Y map key) thanks to which we will remain in close contact with the ~headquarters~ ... The core of the gameplay is all about puzzle solving. Each room we visit will present us with a small puzzle to solve, the difficulty of which will increase as the adventure progresses in pure Miyamoto tradition, and basically focused on having to track down the ghost of the moment! Let me explain... In order for the ghosts to be ~hooked~ by the suction of the vacuum cleaner, they must first be dazzled by the flashlight and, before that, tracked down... Solved the riddle, tracked down, dazzled, hooked and then sucked into the ectoplasmic entity on duty, the lights of the disinfected room will turn on, a key relating to the next game area to be explored will appear and the GameBoy Horror will show us the way to get there... The interaction with the background is undoubtedly one of the strengths of the product... You can interact with everything that pops up in front of your nose, both with your little hands and with the inhale-exhale-everything... Furthermore, to continue in some particular circumstances, for example near a burning door that blocks the way, we will be able to suck (R key) the water from any tap, and divert (L key) the jet of water on the obstacle... The inhale-exhale-all will be able to absorb water, fire and ice, then transform itself, if necessary, into a sort of fire hydrant, flame lance and so on... Intuitive, isn't it? Well, needless to say, since we're at it, we will also be able to suck up a disproportionate amount of coins, jewels, treasures and paper banknotes (present for the first time in a Mario-game) placed in all sorts of furniture in the gloomy abode.. The boss fights that preside over some areas are simply amazing: the final enemy, then, will be a real surprise! I don't know, folks... There's something very special about the game, something that magnetizes your desire to face one more room, one more room: while not pretending to have the impact that Super Mario 64 once had on the entire sector, the latest born of this saga has something absolutely magical, hypnotic... You won't let go of him until you've completed it, which inevitably leads us to his only sore point: the way to go to free Mario won't be that long! Not that everything can be completed in one or two days, for heaven's sake, but the titles of the Mario-saga have always pitted much more granite longevity, and this is undeniable! The broth will be lengthened by wanting to find all 50 Boos, who have escaped from a trapdoor and hidden in the most disparate places of the building, but not even this undertaking will prove to be so demanding... A real shame! Moving on to a colder analysis, if the sound front, as mentioned, is distinguished by the absolute genius of some gimmicks, the cosmetic one completes a technical picture of exceptional value! The animations of the main sprite, including the facial ones, are the best ever seen in a game of this type... Dynamic shadows that lengthen with the glare of the flashes, light sources, various & varied effects are literally wasted and underline how much the hardware be casual even in rather delicate situations, considering that all surfaces, Luigi included, are in fact incredibly ~rounded~, that is to say composed of a high number of polygons... The textures are good, although I've seen better, but undeniably inspired by the design of locations and sprites: NCL is always a guarantee! Very solid frame rate as usual, although not calibrated on 60 fps, the ending is hilarious, far from sbrodoloso! Tightening, Luigi's Mansion proves to be a must buy in its own right! There's no rain on this! It's only a pity that such a charismatic title won't be able to keep the most experienced gamers busy for months... Waiting for Mario Sunshine, out this summer... That's all... Pros: Superb characterization of sprites and background Sound front that has some genius Impossible to let go of the pad Cons: The way to go is not that long fps calibrated below 60 Mario brothers? Mario's brother! After years of oblivion, after being relegated to the last row of the iconographic imagery by Nintendo, Luigi not only returns to the videogame scene as the absolute protagonist, but he also takes on the task of pushing on his shoulders, and it is the very first time, the launch of a home hardware made in Kyoto! And if you believe that the choice was made by Mr. Miyamoto you are very wrong! The entertainment guru himself confesses it to us: ~Personally I would have bet on Mario Sunshine as a launch title, but the leaders of Nintendo of Japan wanted Luigi to return to the limelight with a game of his own, and so it was ...~. The game, in all honesty, is at least curious... Not only and not so much for the new main character, but for a backbone in terms of pure gameplay, which drastically deviates the digital experience from the canonical platform setting: let's say immediately that Luigi can't jump! Yes, people... We are facing the first ~platform~ of technoludic historiography in which one cannot happily jump from platform to platform! Original, right? Well, evidently NCL continues to break new ground, thus managing to keep its icons very fresh: think of the last three titles in the Super Mario series, excluding spin-offs (Tennis, Kart, RPG and so on)! Yoshi's Island, Super Mario 64 and Luigi's Mansion: how different are they from each other!? Think instead of the latest episodes of the wonderful Sonic The Hedgehog saga (Sega) or of the less famous Crash Bandicoot series (Universal)... And here lies the much vaunted ~Nintendo Difference~: originality, creativity! Be that as it may, splurging aside, more than exquisitely original, I can define the playful package under examination of an almost disarming refinement, although the playful experience cannot be said, in all honesty, to be too long-lived.", "date": "2002-01-10", "grade": null}
