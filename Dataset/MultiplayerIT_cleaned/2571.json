{"name": "Hired Team Trial Gold", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hired-team-trial-gold.html", "text": "What is it about? What cap is it? Well yes, this Hired Team, of the unknown Russian developers BlackStar, offers the same formula already seen in Unreal Tournament and Quake3: Arena, that is, it is a shooter designed for multiplayer but capable of being played even offline. The game features are the traditional ones of the genre: DeathMatch, Team DM, CTF, Assault, Domination, an Infiltration mode which consists of a sort of CTF but with only one flag and one team in attack and one in defense and an unprecedented tactical mode ! The project is ambitious, given that it is in direct competition with two giants of the genre, and in order to be truly competitive it needs a 3D engine written for the occasion and capable of not disfiguring next to the highly decorated engines of Epic and Id! Here, then, was the development of the Shine Engine, a brand new product of software technology in the 3D field!! Will this engine be able to rival the highly decorated rivals of Unreal Tournament and Quake3? The developers themselves answer this question indirectly on the official website (https://www.hiredteam.com). ~Quake 2, Unreal and Shine in comparison~ What does this sentence mean? Simply that the Shine has been compared to the engines of Unreal and Quake2. Of course they are not exactly two new games, I must say... in fact it leaves me a little perplexed: but how, do you develop software that has to compete with recent products and officially compare it to older products? Why didn't they compare it to the engines of UT and Q3? This way, however, it's all too easy to be a winner... But I don't want to be influenced by a bad presentation, I've never been prejudiced in my life and I won't be in the review! Let's go play, then... After launching the game, I've seen confirmed that it's a more or less shameless clone of UT and/or Q3. It starts with an introduction in computer graphics that does not make you cry out for a miracle, on the contrary it looks like a film taken directly from some 486 game, from many years ago: bad palette, very approximate and not very detailed models, music that seems to have been composed with Vic20 and video sequences that have no rhyme or reason. Once we enter the main menu, we can finally decide to jump into the action. Game mode The game modes, as we have seen, are numerous, starting from the classic and inflated DM to finish with the new TACTICAL mode. We briefly describe, for those who still don't know the terms, what these modalities consist of. The DeathMatch, or DM, is a fight in which all the players fight each other and whoever kills the most and dies the least wins. TeamDM is the same thing as DM, only now there are two teams facing each other and each player on one team has to battle against the players on the opposing team. The CTF, or Cattura La Bandiera (Capture The Flag), again pits two teams against each other, but this time the victory belongs to whoever manages to infiltrate the opposing base, steal the flag and bring it back. One point is awarded for each captured flag. The Assault mode, which is present in UT, provides a real briefing with objectives to be achieved for each team. Thus, the team going on offense will have to carry out its objectives and the team defending will have to avoid it. This is a very fun mode that goes far beyond the usual shoot and shoot. Too bad it's not in our game. That's right, Assault mode is indicated on the packaging and on the back of the CD, but it is not present in the game. Oh well... let's proceed further. In Domination there are ~control points~ scattered around the map that can be conquered by either team. For every second that passes, the points earned increase the score, at least until the other team takes them. Infiltration, like the CTF, provides for the theft of the flag, but in this case there is only one and only one team will be able to take possession of it, while the other will remain in defense. In essence, a CTF with a single flag. Now we come to the most intriguing mode of this game, the tactical mode. In reality, every game mode seen so far exists in two versions: ARCADE and TACTICAL. When we play a DM in tactical mode, for example, the game will take into account many previously overlooked parameters and will give emphasis to the realistic side of the fights. Then, the physics and ballistics will be more faithful to the real models and the power ups and medikits will be missing around the maps (dthe latter can only pick up one and use it at the right time), while the weapons will have a more or less strong recoil depending on their firepower. In addition, a damage localization system has been added that allows you to hit and be hit in distinct points on the body, i.e. head, arms, chest and legs. All this seems very interesting and makes you anticipate a game with more depth than the others, but in reality it is not. The greater fidelity to the real model does not imply greater fun or a higher degree of involvement, given that it remains an end in itself. What is the use of hurting the opponent's arm if he then continues to hold the weapon as if nothing had happened and his aim is not affected? And why is it not possible to find protections for individual body parts around? Only leg wounds, at least, affect the player's status, as a player with leg injuries staggers and walks more difficult. It is, fortunately, still possible to take headshots. The graphics engine and maps From the first approach, you immediately notice that the architecture of the levels, the textures and the lighting system closely follow those of Quake2, Quake3 and UT. Some maps have the well-known hi-tech feeling of Quake3 and are full of reflective metal surfaces, bright colors and teleports, while others offer the more classic ~ancient~ style and project us within the walls of ancient castles (ugh... what a fantasy ), dark corridors and wooden ceilings. The graphics engine does its duty well and the maps are not bad, even if it must be said that very often they show off too bright colors and are not very original. The textures are not particularly beautiful and there is often a certain lack from the point of view of the technical realization. In general, there is a feeling of already seen, exploring the maps, together with a feeling of visual weighting, due to too many light effects and badly matched colors. Game impressions We have seen what Hired Team: Trial offers, now let's see if it is also fun to play. After the first ten minutes of action, in single-player arcade mode, you can already feel that we are not dealing with a masterpiece and that something has been done a little too hastily. The AI of bots is reduced to a minimum and this is absolutely not good, given that they have to simulate credible human behavior, and it immediately catches the eye that they move along precise trajectories and always and only along the same paths, picking up the same weapons and passing through the same places. After 2 minutes spent observing them, it takes very little to take them all down, in fact, it is enough to lurk and wait for them, inevitably, to pass from there. Furthermore, the weapons are decidedly badly arranged and in fact it is not difficult to find a grenade launcher in a small map and where the other weapons are not very powerful. It is clear that whoever appropriates it dominates the game. Without forgetting that the splash damage of our own weapons, more often than not, is very low, allowing us to go around armed with rocket launchers and fragga opponents on opponents even at close range! The models of the players, then, are rather approximate and the skins decidedly mediocre, presenting a bad reinterpretation of the models already seen in Quake (2 and 3) and UT. If we add to this that the animations are 'woody' and unnatural and that the sound is rather poor, with voices bordering on decently bearable and bad effects (just listen to the Storm Rifle while it fires), then the picture of the situation becomes more complete and definitely not rosy. What finally comes out is that HT:T is a game but in reality it's little less than a mod for UT or Q3! And yes, I say a little less because, despite having created a brand new engine, there are no changes compared to the two competitors and instead of adding something, the BlackStar product takes it away. Playing, one gets the impression of moving in a limbo, where elements of UT mix (and not so well) with elements of Q3. The authors thought of introducing a metropolitan hi-tech scenario that forms the background to the actual game, but above all it seems that they wanted to mimic the UT plot and base themselves on that to justify a bad mix of styles and a lack of ideas product basis. Conclusions As you can surely imagine, I didn't like this game. In reality, the premises were there, since in theory it could have taken the best of UT and the best of Q3 and merged them together. To this we could add the presence of an unexpected tactical mode and certainly spessor and if, in the end, these premises had been maintained, then we would have had a guaranteed successful game in our hands. Instead, technical and creative incompetence and, probably, a low budget behind the project prevailed. Unfortunately, in this way the quality of the product has been irreparably compromised. Proof This game has a curious name, as well as misleading. The word TRIAL would seem to indicate a demo version rather than the full game. Instead it is really a complete title and indeed in a Gold version. What this Gold version consists of, however, we are not given to know as the accompanying documentation is nothing short of stingy information and all we can say is that it is a game released in September 2000 in Russia and now re-released in Europe, in this new version, Gold to be precise. But what is the proof of which we speak? The story tells of an unspecified future, in which technology and overcrowding have reached very high peaks and chaos has now invaded every corner of our planet. To deal with this crisis situation, the government has created special intervention teams. So, it would seem that we are about to be thrust into the middle of a cyberpunk adventure, perhaps a technological nightmare or an experiment in ~social Darwinism~ of which we ourselves are one of the guinea pigs. But that's not the case: the special teams are there, yes, the socio-technological background is there, too, but we don't have to immerse ourselves in this world and explore its most hidden recesses, chasing the changing and elusive plot. Simply, the player takes the role of a recruit who aspires to join one of these teams and the whole game ends in a sort of tournament within a certain number of arenas, in which we will have to defeat all our opponents. This is the test that completes the title of the game: the one that a recruit must pass to be enlisted in the special corps.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
