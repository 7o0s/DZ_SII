{"name": "Rise of the Third Power", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rise-of-the-third-power-recensione.html", "text": "Stegosoft Games has a very cute, tender logo, the first piece of a small bedside table that screams loudly ~Hey, we're people who grew up in the 90s~. From Ohio comes a JRPG that J is not, as Japanese has the mood, the atmospheres, the playful characteristics but not the dialogues. The curriculum of the very small team is very short but interesting, just as the chosen title is curious - Rise of the Third Power - a sort of hymn to fantasy politics between kingdoms, princesses, wars and battles. There is a series of elements that takes and hooks those Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts of other eras, today left in a corner to chew crumbs of a genre that has become something else, or that perhaps is almost dead and is kept alive by enthusiasts such as, precisely, those of Stegosoft. Who among the readers feels like embarking on a fun, nice, moderately complex quest with turn-based combat like they haven't seen in a long time? Anyone who raised their hand kindly join us in this Rise of the Third Power review. We kidnap the princess Lots of fun turn-based combat takes Rise of the Third Power right into the 90s If you're from another gaming era, the leitmotif of the kidnapping of a princess will remind you of the magical moments of Gidan and Garnet from Final Fantasy IX. Although the productions are clearly different, we could bet what you want that the team was inspired by that initial plot to set fire to the dust and immerse us in the story. Rise of the Third Power can boast a narrative that works, partly clichd, partly characterized characters and a playful flow clever enough not to make us fall asleep with the pad in hand. We come to a note of color that you could take as a pain or not, it depends a bit on you and your thirst for purism: the dialogues are inspired by JRPGs, but elements of a Western hand in writing are immediately noticeable. Humor and gags stick to a western narrative and life tradition, with a constant whisper of irony and satire, trying to tell the player that yes, there is a nice story but we are Americans trying to make a JRPG and we want give you a soft, almost goliardic narrative approach. In the end, everything also works, but sometimes it seems that that indie title halo that must necessarily be ironic about clichs is a little too marked. Quite enjoyable overall, but improvable. The story will take you, in a vein of battle and politics between kingdoms that has a good bite that fits into a fairly typical fantasy setting. There will be dungeons, sewers, caves and a constant theme of travel, just as there will be a party of characters intriguing enough and characterized by making you become attached to the team. Stegosoft Games has skilfully mixed the right ingredients and advancing along the path will be able to entertain you with absolute dignity. Enemies returning Rise of the Third Power will give you many hours of quests, dialogues and dungeon searches As a good JRPG, Rise of the Third Power will make you face several more or less angry enemies, but always with a good dose of strategy. If it is true that the combat system is designed to be fluid, dynamic but also rapid in its essence, the clashes must be known how to manage and understand. The key element, more than in other similar titles, is the use of skills, a very fundamental characteristic in order not to be swept away and be able to beat the strongest enemies before their turn. Thanks to a simple priority system based on the speed of those present and the moves that fit well between the characters, Rise of the Third Power brings into play a good request for playful sagacity, enough to make you engage not so much in the bosses, but in the clashes middle. The choice of whether or not to face the monsters (and therefore make them disappear from the dungeon) is up to the player, but we appreciated the possibility of making enemies return simply by paying the merchant at the end of the dungeon. It's a curious mix of tradition and present, which also adds post-combat fatigue management to the equation. Explore between quests Thanks to a rather clichd but interesting fantasy world, Rise of the Third Power manages to pack an absolutely captivating general mood Rise of the Third Power brings in a certain vintage exploration, with an isometric view, shortcuts, mazes, traps, enemies in sight, treasure chests and that pinch of verticality that doesn't hurt. It is a good offer in terms of medium length, a challenge to the sense of orientation typical of the more hardcore JRPGs, with dungeons that can be exhausted in medium-long but not very long times, therefore not frustrating. In prosecourse of history, the title alternates with simplicity but immediacy more complex labyrinths with others much more immediate and not necessarily with bosses at the end of the path. There are quests, items to recover, equipment to create and everything you can expect from a JRPG, but made by Western hands that manage to offer good level design and a progression that invites you to continue the adventure, which is no small thing. It must be said that the cast of characters helps: although some dialogues, as already mentioned, try to be more brilliant than they should, resulting in a tad bit cloying, the characterization of the party is well made and there are elements that can certainly remain in the mind even of who has played dozens of them.", "date": "2022-02-15", "grade": "8.0"}
