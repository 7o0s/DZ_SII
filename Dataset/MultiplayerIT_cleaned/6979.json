Fruit of the visionary genius (in that case without a doubt) of Yu Suzuki, the game put us in command of a guy who ran very fast, tirelessly, carrying a huge cannon with him which also allowed him to fly and thus face hordes of alien spacecraft. The sense of extreme speed, the frenetic gameplay and an unforgettable soundtrack have contributed to making that title a great classic, which over the years has also inspired other types of ~deep~ shooters, if we want to define them that way. Well, almost forty years later Suzuki has decided to revisit Space Harrier by creating a spiritual sequel exclusively for Apple Arcade. How did it go? We tell you about it in the Air Twister review. Setting: a suggestive and psychedelic world Air Twister, one of the more bizarre levels in the campaign The introductory sequence of Air Twister shows a sort of archipelago suspended in the air which is suddenly attacked with great ferocity by a swarm of alien spacecraft. A squad of soldiers riding huge swans comes to the rescue, but they are quickly defeated and fall one by one. In the end, the warrior princess Arch has to intervene, who after observing the massacre perpetrated by the invaders decides to face the enemy army alone. Although the references to Panzer Dragoon are evident due to the increasingly bizarre mounts available to the protagonist, who for her mission, also on the back of a swan and then jumping on a sort of dragon, on a winged carp and on an elephant, to name a few of the companions present in the Air Twister campaign, the visual of the game shows in reality is only Arch suspended in the void, just like the Space Harrier character, as he crosses particularly suggestive but at the same time twisted scenarios, which seem to be the result of a snack based on hallucinogenic mushrooms. Gameplay: Dated touch approach Air Twister, the homing bullets of Arch's crossbow Unfortunately, on the gameplay side, a big disappointment arrives: the approach of the Ys Net developers to touch controls appears inexplicably dated and so the movement of the protagonist looks like a ~tap and go~ and at the same time an awkward and cumbersome, as well as lacking the precision necessary to avoid the inevitable bullets that enemy units will fire at us. Arch is equipped with a special crossbow that can lock on to targets and release lethal bursts that reach them automatically, but drawing these blocks on the screen is equivalent , as mentioned, to move the character. Considering that intercepting opponents' shots isn't always easy, just like in the original Space Harrier, this type of setting often leads to losing energy or running into game over undeservedly. Unfortunately, the feeling is that Suzuki and his collaborators have grappled with the development of Air Twister while completely ignoring the enormous progress that mobile gaming has made over the years in terms of touch controls, because imagining this type of approach as intentional would frankly surprise us . A classic virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen and a pointer to move with the right thumb would have been a much better solution. That the game in practice turns out to be much less fun than one might expect is really a pity, all the more so considering the twelve levels of a campaign marked by the most bizarre visual devices, including the huge bosses that we will be able to face at the end of each stage and which certainly contribute to raising the level of ~madness~ of the product. Structure: arcade or roguelike? Air Twister, one of the campaign bosses Successfully completing the Air Twister campaign takes about half an hour, so Suzuki and his team have seen fit to adopt an arcade approach with some roguelike contaminations in order to prevent users from running out of experience in such a short time, for then ignore it. In a nutshell, this means that at game over you have to start all over again, but you can use the stars collected along the way to unlock permanent upgrades that will make subsequent attempts easier. Not only that: the upgrade map, if we want to call it that , also includes the unlocking of cosmetic items with which to customize Arch's appearance, extra modes and additional hearts to increase his health meter, i.e. the element that during theand games can be the difference between victory and defeat, since from one level to another it is only minimally restored, like in a sort of survival mode. It is, however, a good idea to enhance the experience and keep the engagement alive. Technical realization: what a trip! Air Twister, the entry level on the sea As mentioned, the technical and artistic sector of Air Twister is probably the result of a psychedelic trip, given the abundance of bizarre elements that can be found among scenarios, mounts and bosses, all particularly inspired. The common enemies are less brilliant, which seem thrown on the screen a bit at random, alternating alien pods, giant insects, dragons of various sizes, birds and so on and so forth. The final result undoubtedly offers some very evocative glimpses , although the actual quality of the assets leaves a bit to be desired and there are no adjustments that allow you to scale the graphics so as to avoid overheating the device (we are still experiencing a very hot summer). The optimization obviously works automatically, but on the iPhone 12 Pro it seems that the game runs at its best in terms of resolution, effects and frame rate. Air Twister, another crazy boss fight As far as audio is concerned, the matter is a bit more complicated. The original Space Harrier could count on rather lively electronic songs, able to contribute to the involvement in the gameplay, but for Air Twister we instead relied on a rock-style soundtrack signed by the Dutch artist Valensia. Define it as derivative with respect to the songs by Queen is frankly a euphemism and in our opinion it is completely unsuitable to accompany this type of experience, but we imagine that the choice of music also falls within Yu Suzuki's diabolical plan, who with this shooter of his seems intent more than anything else on surprising his historical fans, leaving them dumbfounded: mission accomplished.", "date": "2022-07-03", "grade": "7.0"}
