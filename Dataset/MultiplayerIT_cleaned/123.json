{"name": "The Sims 2 Pets", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-pets_a.html", "text": "Simulated puppy A spin-off of the product of the same name distributed as an expansion pack of The Sims 2 for PC, Pets starts from some extremely simple premises: simulating the behavior of a puppy that the user has the task of taking care of. As in every exponent of the franchise, here too the beginning of the playful experience coincides with a customization phase: in particular, the gender and the look of the face of one's alter ego must be chosen (actually among very few possibilities) and the race of the four-legged friend, initially limited to only two options. Once this is done, you can start ~playing~. The quotation marks are a must, as The Sims 2 Pets on mobile phones more than a video game is a routine to be performed preferably on a daily or at least frequent basis. But let's go in order: the main scenario is the living room of one's home, where the dog moves back and forth waiting for some stimulus from the user. At the bottom of the screen, the needs of the puppy can be viewed, respectively hunger, fresh air, sleep, play and cleaning. Each of these needs must be met by carrying out dedicated actions, in order by feeding the dog, taking him to the park, making him sleep, throwing him a ball or cleaning him with various tools. The bulk of The Sims 2 Pets gameplay is all here, in the reiteration of these simple, not exactly exciting activities. Where a product like Nintendogs compensated for its fundamental structural flatness with elaborate AI routines, pleasant cosmetics, varied objectives and wireless functionality, here there is no semblance of depth: the player is therefore forced to repeat the usual actions over and over again, without any substantial change over time. The objects that can be purchased in the appropriate shop or the tricks that can be taught to the dog (again in a questionable way, by repeating a sequence of keys several times) are of little or no use, as they do not affect the continuation of the activity except in an absolutely negligible way. playful experience. Even taken as a kind of tamagotchi to devote a few minutes a day to, The Sims 2 proves to be unsatisfactory, given the inconsistency of the objectives and the consequent rewards. Not even on a technical level the EA production manages to recover on a qualitative level. Graphically, The Sims 2 Pets is small: the two-dimensional reproduction of the puppy certainly cannot be defined as realistic, nor the jerky animations that distinguish it. Definitely poor and dramatically static then the only two settings, in particular that of the park; finally, particular mention to the terrifying faces of the masters, of the frankly incomprehensible stylistic abortions. Finally, a few words on the sound front: the music is present (with an absurdly high volume) only in the main menu, while during the game you can only hear the -few- cries of the dog and the irritating and poorly digitized voice of your own alter-ego.
