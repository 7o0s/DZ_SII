Wanting to prepare the ground for the title with a ~younger brother~ intended for iOS platforms, the Polish studio Techland turned to Shortbreak Studios who thought well of not mimicking the gameplay of the source product, risking only pale in comparison with the console version: Hellraid: The Escape is therefore a game that uses the same gloomy scenario to field a gameplay completely oriented towards puzzle solving. Let's see if it was a winning choice... Eight prisons are enough for me Immediately after the opening credits, we experience his brutal killing carried out by the evil Crell through the eyes of the unfortunate and anonymous protagonist: instead of being the end of the adventure, this macabre event actually constitutes its beginning, given that the soul of the our alter ego survives by reincarnating in another body, unfortunately segregated in the depths of a prison complex infested with monsters and deadly traps. This is where the real game starts, divided into eight floors that represent the different levels: a bit few to tell the truth, for a title that can be completed within an hour, leaving the user only the promise of future free updates that will add more scenarios. At least, it's about quality time, given that Hellraid: The Escape puts well-crafted production values on the plate, starting with a commendable technical achievement. Graphically, the title takes advantage of the Unreal Engine to show very accurate and detailed settings, embellished with valuable light effects that slightly enliven a color palette focused almost exclusively on shades of brown and gray (on the other hand we are still in a prison): the first person view, the all in all small dimensions of the rooms and the substantial absence of other characters on the screen are undoubtedly some nice advantages for Hellraid: The Escape, which in any case does its duty impeccably. The sound accompaniment is also decidedly atmospheric, with dark and disturbing music that joins the creaks, the noise of gears and the screams of pain that are constantly heard as you make your way through the halls of the prison. Hellraid: The Escape is an excellent first-person puzzler that doesn't last much too long Moving on to the playful sphere, Hellraid: The Escape does not invent anything really new, but is rather skilled in mixing many different components, making each level the bearer of a new mechanic compared to the previous one. Basically, the player is asked to move using a virtual analog stick, instead commanding the view with swipes on the right side of the screen: the elements with which it is possible to interact are highlighted by a golden dust, and a tap is sufficient to bring the perspective and act accordingly. We find ourselves activating mechanisms, combining objects, opening doors and chests, breaking vases and crates to reveal their contents and much more that we prefer not to mention in order to avoid possible spoilers. The puzzles are stimulating without ever being overly complicated, but to avoid the risk of frustration, the developers have included a hint system that is activated when you spend a few too many minutes without any progress being made. However, the puzzles are not the only activity to be performed in Hellraid: The Escape: in fact, there are sections that flow - in a very moderate way - into the field of action, requiring the user to have a certain dexterity with the touch screen or the gyroscope. Again, there is no shortage of monsters of various types, which however must be strictly avoided or eliminated with stratagems, given the chronic insipience of the protagonist in any fighting technique. Everything works well, without memorable high notes but still guaranteeing the title a pleasant flow of gameplay: a pity that, as anticipated at the beginning, the adventure is really too short, with the only (negligible) stimuli to retrace one's steps constituted by the challenges that they require you to collect all the crystals hidden in the levels and read every letter left in its path by another mysterious prisoner.", "date": "2014-07-29", "grade": "8.0"}
