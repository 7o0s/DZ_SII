After all that has happened since our September hands-on, getting to the review of The Last of Us 2 has been a long, exhausting process for all parties involved: for Naughty Dog of course, for Sony who had to adapt to a situation in constant motion and consequently for those who, like me and millions of you, couldn't wait to understand what Neil Druckmann, the main director of the awaited exclusive PS4, had done this time. You may not love the Naughty Dog style, but if you're also interested in video games behind the scenes, the creative and more strictly technical aspects, you can't pretend it doesn't exist. Naughty Dog will also be less talkative and social than many other software houses, it clearly prefers to always stay a little to one side to work on its things, but from 1985 to today it has never stood still, exploring many different genres and changing completely even several times skin. The Naughty Dog of the early days, composed essentially of Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, reaches its peak in 1991 thanks to Trip Hawkings' Electronic Arts, which produces and distributes the isometric RPG for the Sega MegaDrive called Rings of Power. The first great mutation of Naughty Dog takes place after the scorching flop of Way of The Warrior, a one-on-one beat'em up for 3DO of rare ugliness which however leads to the prototype of Crash Bandicoot, chosen by Sony as an exclusive for its PlayStation and in which Mark Cerny will also participate as a consultant. The second big change, which brings us directly to today's Naughty Dog, coincides with the last Jak and Dexter of 2005, when the acquisition by Sony will finally go live and both Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin will leave the company to have fun in other fields. Naughty Dog is thus placed in the hands of the veteran Evan Wells who will transform the software house to align it with the needs of a company, always Sony of course, looking for the trait d'union between the Computer Entertainment and Pictures divisions, in order to finally materialize the ~Hollywood~ vision behind a PlayStation 3 that was still struggling to establish itself. From this revolution comes a new Naughty Dog and with her Uncharted, depending on the point of view a male Tomb Raider or an Indiana Jones of the new millennium, a series that focuses entirely on spectacularity, however, renouncing more technical and demanding gameplay. The success of Uncharted is enormous, so much so as to push many single player games, in trouble for the growing success of the open world, to imitate its formula, but often with disastrous results at the box office, and this is precisely the case with Tomb Raider. The fact is that there's only room for an Uncharted in the current video game market: after the PS3 era, you can put all the explosions you want in your game but if there's no one who launched the trend, or rather the arrogant Nathan Drake, you will also need a gameplay to keep up the impressive scenery set up by the graphics. In fact, Uncharted is simple, immediate, its puzzles almost solve themselves and a wrong jump immediately takes you back to the previous edge; the only element that has an interesting specific weight from a playful point of view are the shootings, which however certainly don't represent the state of the art of action games. In fact, Uncharted won its bet thanks to the huge budget, the graphics, the contextual animations, its being ~just like a movie!~. And then, of course, thanks to its cast: it is here that the new Naughty Dog gives its best by proposing characters, scripts and dialogues of a quality rarely seen in a video game, where we are so badly used that we often mistake cheap fairy tales for Philip's writings Roth. Even Naughty Dog knows that the mix would not have worked indefinitely, who in fact decides to give the green light to the project The Last of Us, where the experience gained working on Uncharted is put at the service of a much more elaborate adventure , from a narrative point of view but this time also in the actual gameplay. With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog rediscovers what it means to offer a challenge to those who hold the pad in their hands: there are avoidable and inevitable shootings, stealth parts in which to sneak away, while exploration is inextricably linked to the survival of the characters. To embellish the recipe we find the perfect evolution of the cast of Uncharted: few but unforgettable characters who now have nothing left of the immortal daredevil Nathan Drake, basically so similar to the Crash Bandicoot of the early days, cogaining a humanity that will allow him to build a climax with nuances impossible for a video game before that moment, before The Last of Us. A great, great game, with a gameplay that is finally really interesting even if a bit bridled, not entirely free to express oneself properly: the stealth phases between the infected/zombies are in fact rather rigid, with an almost chess flavor, while the more action they play their supporting role perfectly but without particularly shining. Even in Uncharted it's not like shooting very well, but things change radically with Uncharted 4, the last step of an exponential growth that finally brings us to The Last of Us Part II. Sorry for the long introduction, but we thought it was essential to make even those who don't follow the world of video games understand why this game was so eagerly awaited. A different kind of fun The title we are about to tell you about is in fact the culmination of a journey that began many years ago, perfected along the way, game after game, until it was no longer a game. A bit like with Red Dead Redemption II, in fact we find it very difficult to reduce it to a pastime, because game also means this, a product like The Last of Us 2. Here we are clearly in another category, and although it is extremely compelling fighting against monsters and enemies, is never really fun as it can be chasing the next victim in Fortnite, jumping on a mushroom as Super Mario, twirling together with the silver blade of a Witcher, or just like the first The Last of Us. Ellie and Joel's first adventure touches on important themes, takes full advantage of the grays of morality, yet is still linked to a more classic game concept, whose different parts touch each other without however totally merging: there is The Last of Us game, and the narrative The Last Of Us, and together they create this beautiful but disjointed mix, typical of the third-person action adventures of recent years and born with Uncharted. The Last of Us Part II, on the contrary, is a whole that weighs on your heart from start to finish, plus equipped with an audiovisual system capable of turning up the volume of every emotion beyond the maximum allowed. The result is shocking, a level that is not touched only by some key scenes, as one would expect, but which pervades every aspect of the adventure. An interactive drama The dramatic nature of this new Naughty Dog effort is inseparable not only from its characters, but also from its gameplay, from every single encounter / clash with infected and humans. Even if, we have to admit, it is the latter that we have learned to fear the most. When you have a group of mindless creatures in front of you, like the infected in the game, you know that the interaction will be limited to escape or carnage, rather common elements in a video game and easily manageable in terms of emotions despite the crude realism adopted in this case; if, on the contrary, you are dealing with humans, in The Last Of Us 2 you also know that the encounter can lead to much deeper and more complex interactions to manage and digest, and to which gamers are very unaccustomed. The fear you feel in front of an infected is primordial, the one you feel in front of the door that separates you from friends to whom something very serious could have happened, and this is the simplest example we can use to keep zero any type of spoiler, it is instead a much more complex terror and with which you can relate. In our memory there is no other video game, because after all The Last of Us Part II falls willingly or unwillingly into the category, which has consciously aimed to disturb the player so deeply, to make him feel actually uncomfortable throughout the gaming experience . Elevator to hell That the human is more monstrous than the monster itself is a concept that dates back to the dawn of the dead, it is an integral part of the imagery sculpted by George A. Romero with his zombies. However, the elevator to hell that Naughty Dog has built above it brings us back more to the structure of Coppola's Apocalypse Now, where even the lucidity of the protagonists, as they immerse themselves in this increasingly intense vortex of violence, is sooner or later put in doubt by the spectator/player. That of The Last of Us Part II is not a plot that unfolds in a pleasant way: you will see, hear and above all you will do terrible things that could even make you struggle to press the keys necessary to proceed in the game, at least this is what happened to we. This is why the infected are almost reassuring presences, even when they will inevitably overwhelm us, ending our agony with one lastgrand guignol bite on the carotid artery. It's not the violence that has been talked about so much after the last gameplay videos that you have to worry about, unless you are the front page of Avvenire, but that in the gestures, words and choices of the characters that the cast will meet in this long, literal and figurative journey. This whirlwind of emotions, The Last of Us Part II almost always makes you experience it with the pad in hand: there are very few moments in which the narrative will rely on the classic non-interactive cut-scene, and without ever exaggerating. The 33 hours of gameplay that it took us to reach the end credits of The Last of Us 2, we spent mainly playing or at least interacting in the scene. Storytelling: how video games and cinema come together Then don't expect who knows what LGBT+ manifesto, or particularly dull situations: the sexuality of the protagonists of The Last of Us 2 is treated with surprising freedom and naturalness but beyond the scene which has already been abundantly talked about, here love and sex are not they never play an itchy or reassuring role. The narrative system set up by Naughty Dog can not only be said to be perfectly successful, but also sets new quality standards for the entire video game industry, overflowing well beyond its art of belonging. Combining video games and cinema has always been a sort of chimera, they have tried in many and a thousand different ways: Cinemaware with its adventures for the Commodore Amiga, Access and Sierra at the time of the first CD-ROMs, then in more recent times Quantic Dreams and Rockstar Games, yet only the latter has come close to that cold fusion needed to perform the miracle. But with The Last of Us Part II, Naughty Dog has managed to take a further step forward, reaching a mix that is unprecedented, thanks to a writing, acting, animations and a narrative pace that is unrivaled. The maturation of a gameplay The greatest success, however, is having kept the gameplay, the actual game played, in the palm of your hand. While Rockstar Games to achieve the result treads the hand by taking away the freedom typical of its most beloved open worlds, with The Last of Us 2 Naughty Dog crosses the finish line with what is undoubtedly its best gameplay. The credit goes first of all to the animations, because it is precisely their immense quality that makes the controls so reactive and captivating. The Motion Matching technology chosen by Naughty Dog is able to select and then adapt hundreds of different animations in real time, these created by hand by the software house, so that each movement is perfectly or almost perfectly linked to the previous one. The final result is absolutely up to the one, futuristic at the time and therefore somewhat suspicious, shown during the reveal of the game at E3 in 2018. This not only means having a spectacular adventure like few others in your hands, but it affects the controls managing to transmit that human weight necessary for realism, without however renouncing their fundamental reactivity. The quality is so high that we often wondered if what we had just done was actually a pre-established event, but every time it was enough to restart the battle from the beginning to discover that it was actually the fruit of our choices, of the absolutely insane number of contextual animations and that virtual conductor called Motion Matching. The number of weapons we will get our hands on is not very high but they are all very different from each other, moreover they can be improved during the game through workbenches and some precious resources that we will be able to find by exploring the surrounding environment. The human enemies Thanks to the extraordinary direction, the creativity of the player and the freedom with which the artificial intelligence can act, each battle is naturally different from the previous one. The human enemies, in addition to fighting in a different way according to their group of belonging, circumvent, reconnoiter, return to cover to adapt to each user's strategy. The Wolves, one of the first factions we will meet, are the most brutal: they love firearms and rely on well-trained dogs able to follow our tracks. Hyenas, on the other hand, prefer bows and arrows, always keeping in touch with their modulated whistles: if we kill a Hyena and it does not respond to the next whistle from its closest companion, you will first see it inform the others and then go in search of the 'missing friend, sometimes alone and sometimes in company. It should be noted that each non-playable character, and this is demonstrated by the images and videos, is equipped with a face of the quality that video games usually only assign to the protagonists, and this por", "date": "2020-06-12", "grade": "9.7"}
