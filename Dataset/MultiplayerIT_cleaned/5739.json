The structure taken as a reference has remained unchanged, therefore still a Once upon a time the racing and shooter genres have been merged, taking advantage of a mix that in some ways can recall the raids of the well-known Twisted Metal. In Hardware: Rivals you go down into rather large arenas and engage in a series of challenges for the territorial dominance of the map, alone or as members of a team of up to five players. The project was developed by SCE Connected Content Group - Sony's internal studio based in London - and before being published in its final version it went through a beta phase, thanks to which the stability of the servers and any balancing. Basically it would have been reasonable to expect to receive a more enjoyable and balanced experience in your hands, but in hindsight things have not gone in the desired direction at all. In fact, we are sad to note that the final result is in many ways insufficient and the problems are numerous. Hardware: Rivals is a lackluster title, plagued by flat gameplay and limited content AAA fantasy wanted If we weren't referring to a product included for free in the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection for the month of January, it would be really difficult for us to recommend a road test of this title. Hardware: In fact, Rivals does not have what it takes to achieve satisfactory results and it only takes a few games to see boredom prevail over fun. The four available modes are almost disconcertingly trivial, it is evident that the development studio limited itself to ~doing the homework~, introducing the inevitable Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, a very normal team Domination mode in which you have to control three bases up to 50 points, ending up with Team Elimination, where you have to kill all the opponents of the opposite team to win the match. There is nothing else and the complete lack of a single player component leaves further clues as to how limited the attractiveness may prove to be in the medium and long term. However, the critical issues do not end here and we also have to deal with a deliberate instability of the online structure, to the point of having to bear frequent disconnections during the game in progress without keeping track of the results achieved up to that moment. We encountered sudden and repeated signal drops during our test, especially in team-based modes. Frankly, when it comes to a title that has no other content outside of ranked matches, the frequency of these problems is completely unacceptable. Even more so if we consider that preliminary test phases have been carried out precisely to avoid this type of problem. Playstation 4 trophies The Hardware: Rivals trophies are 42 in total, of which 29 are bronze, 8 silver and 4 gold. Their completion is not particularly complex, although the problems affecting the game are unlikely to push anyone towards platinum. Energy shortages Another complication that afflicts Hardware: Rivals is inherent in the almost total absence of rhythm and adrenaline. We are talking about a game that must be experienced aboard vehicles, in which one must move without interruption, collect resources on the ground, engage in shootings, chases and escapes. Yet it's not much fun. In our opinion, the problem is only one: the lack of speed. The introduction of a boost bar, perhaps rechargeable in relation to the results obtained in real time by the player during the game, would have been a wise choice. In doing so, the action could have turned into a much more dynamic and convincing flow, especially for how the maps are organized. Each of the five currently available scenarios is spread over considerable extensions and the emptiness of these spaces is confirmed, and aggravated, by the limited amount of players that can take part in them in the space of a single game. Under these conditions it would have made more sense to double the size of the lobbies, a choice that was evidently rejected due to a dancer and unreliable netcode, which is already barely able to manage the ten players expected for each mode. After having grasped this sense of dispersion, the player cannot help but feelfrustrated, also because more often than not he will find himself in lobbies populated by only three or four individuals. It is then not so difficult to imagine how unlikely it is to have fun in completing a fight in these conditions. The power ups take care of saving what can be saved, which can be acquired by selecting the appropriate icons scattered around the map and activated by pressing the left backbone of the joypad. The right backbone is instead responsible for managing the primary rate of fire, which is entrusted to automatic turrets or cannons, depending on the vehicle selected from the four available classes. The approach is very simple, the learning curve almost non-existent and within the reach of even less experienced users. Nonetheless, the immediacy of use and the simple mastery of the game system turn out to be a significant boomerang, since a couple of hours are enough and the desire to continue goes away. Furthermore, there are no other methods, outside of online, that can somehow keep the user's interest alive. As if that weren't enough, we also found deficiencies in the driving model and in the physics of collisions, combined with a questionable functioning of the shots, which does not facilitate holding the vehicle and maintaining the view on the target to be hit, especially in changes of direction.", "date": "2016-01-30", "grade": "5.0"}
