It differs from Red Bull in the much more ~yankee~ size (the can is half a liter) and in the great variety of flavours; even if only four or five variations are commonly found in our country, the supermarket shelves of Northern Europe and the United States have a much longer list. Apart from this, the two food companies base most of their business on the sponsorship of sporting events, above all of a motor or extreme nature. Supercross, an even more extreme version of motocross, represents the best combination of these two philosophies and Milestone, an authority when it comes to two-wheeled simulations, has decided to exploit the license to create the official videogame. The first title came out just a year ago, but in Milan they thought there was some detail to fix. Let's see what they have done with Monster Energy Supercross 2. A little more choice The setting is more or less the same as the first title. From the initial menu you can decide whether to play a single event, participate in a standard championship, challenge yourself in the Time Attack or, latest news, have fun freely in the compound, along the lines of Valentino Rossi's ranch. Obviously the career mode is the most interesting because it allows climbing to the title of the premier class (where the bikes are equipped with 450cc engines) starting from the less powerful 250cc. After giving your avatar a name and appearance, you choose one of the official bikes (Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Yamaha, Husqvarna and KTM) and the championship in which to register between the Eastern and Western championships. The difference lies only in the tracks: each has seven exclusive ones while two (Indianapolis and Las Vegas) are shared; the more powerful motorbikes, on the other hand, compete in the best of seventeen trials and are not divided into regional categories. It's not just about getting the best finish, because a supercross rider's schedule can be very busy. So the developers have decided to leave the task of programming it to the player, choosing some activities to carry out in preparation for the Sunday race. For example, you can train individual skills, perfecting your landing or trying to improve cornering, or challenge a bitter rival in a timed trial, or even dedicate time to sponsors and fans through press conferences where the player is a mere spectator. In this way you can acquire experience points and money, exactly as it happened in the original title. Money and fame With dollars you can buy upgrades for the bike: from handlebars to hand guards, from exhausts to suspensions, almost every element of the motorized steed can be made more efficient. The experience, on the other hand, unlocks new outfits and celebrations (which in turn must be purchased) which obviously have no impact on the bike's performance, but can instead attract more generous sponsors. This scheme, in the first Supercross, was not very balanced, as in a short time it was possible to have a bank account large enough to allow the bike to be processed to the maximum. In this sequel it has been optimized and, although the financial supply certainly cannot be defined as impervious, it is in any case a little slower and more progressive and consequently also stimulates the activities that increase the experience. Even the sponsors are a little more varied: if before you simply chose the one who paid the most for each victory, here you might prefer those who prefer media exposure and who guarantee easy and safe money. In any case, we would have expected some more substantial innovations for what remains the queen mode of the game and the innovations introduced, although they show good potential on paper, still seemed to us to be implemented in a not very incisive way: in fact we managed to win the championship 250cc East on first attempt (in Normal mode). Sports regulation in pills The race weekend includes several stages. Initially the 10-minute qualifying sessions are held in which 40 drivers take part (in reality there would be more, and this phase would serve to obtain the TOP 40; in the Milestone game it is basically a warm-up to fine-tune the set-up of the motorcycle). Two heat races are then held (but the player takes part in only one of these), each of which is populated by 20 drivers, lasting 6 minutes + 1 lap: the first 9 per race go on to the Main Event (the real show which provides championship points), while the other 22 still have a chance to qualify through the Last Chance Qualifiers: a quick 4-minute race+ 1 lap in which the first four join the remaining 18, thus completing the starting grid which includes a maximum of 22 participants. The main event lasts 20 minutes + 1 lap (15 for the 250m). It's not child's play The difficulty rate of Monster Energy Supercross 2 is far from trivial, as the predecessor had also taught us. This discipline differs from motocross mainly in the locations: it takes place inside stadiums where, from the top of the stands, the public can follow the show without the risk of missing out on key moments. This implies that the tracks are very compressed and full of curves at 180C which make a ~racing~ approach practically harmful: the accelerator must be dosed sparingly, one must not get frustrated if at the exit of (almost) every corner you start from stationary and you have to get used to the fact that the trajectory must be changed even when the wheels don't touch the ground. The thing that matters most is the rhythm, or, to put it more correctly, the ~flow~: when tackling numerous bumps in sequence (called whop in technical jargon) it is important to land as parallel as possible, to avoid stalling or lose precious seconds. The opponents' artificial intelligence is one of the strong points of Milestone's game: the other drivers, already at the intermediate level, know how to turn very fast and winning always requires a high degree of concentration. As in the past, we found a certain discrepancy (albeit less marked) between the performances in qualifying and those in the race, where, apart from the first three, the big group seems to be slightly parameterized at the level of the player. Mastering Supercross is not an immediate thing: more often than not you find yourself off the track due to not having interpreted a jump correctly or having entered a corner incorrectly. Frustrating situations that can be limited both by working on the bike's set-up, the effects of which are immediately noticeable in riding, and by repeating the last moments before the crash thanks to the ever-present rewind. The sore point, however, is always the management of physics, with the bikes that still seem to be too little respectful of the laws dictated by Newton. It is no coincidence that the developers have concentrated their efforts on the ~scrub~, i.e. those evolutions to be performed at half height to land in the shortest possible time. Unfortunately, the results are not yet satisfactory and, at least in our case, we have almost never moved away (or approached) the analog sticks of the Xbox One joypad to perform the spectacular maneuvers. Unreal 4 engine (times) One of the aspects that had most caused a stir in the first Supercross was the use of the new Unreal engine: a choice adopted with MXGP 3 and obviously also confirmed in this Monster Energy Supercross 2. The Milanese team worked hard, reducing the time loading and eliminating some of the slowdowns that could occur especially on underpowered hardware consoles. Our test was carried out on PC and, at maximum detail, we did not find any drop in frame rate which gives a good sensation of speed. The graphics sector, which could appear to be of a good standard in the eyes of a PlayStation or Xbox user, has not undergone major changes and is pleasant. Going into specifics, we find good care in the creation of the bikes and riders, where the changes made in the garage can be appreciated right away, while we would have liked a greater characterization of the stadiums which seem to look a bit too similar. The judgment on the first person view is still negative, but it is a mole on which we do not feel like treading too much since it can hardly represent a player's choice. The collision system is always rather ~folkloric~, with opponents who don't fall even if you crash into them at 80 km/h, bouncing off the other riders' helmets and ruinous falls due to almost imperceptible (indeed, sometimes non-existent) contacts with protective barriers. Made with great care the audio sector, especially the soundtrack. Powerful and intuitive track editor to upload to the network and share with friends and strangers; currently, considering the preview phase, the multiplayer sector cannot be evaluated which in any case provides the only possibility of facing each other in a single event.", "date": "2019-02-05", "grade": "7.0"}
