It is in fact a borderline genre whose determining elements are basically the story told, the quality of the texts and the beauty of the drawings that alternate on the screen. All the other features are considered accessories, even and above all the more purely playful ones such as mini-games, puzzles and the like. What do these girls have to do with judo? This is to say that we did not start off prejudiced against Sakura Spirit, a visual novel with a comedy tone characterized by a mischievous and omnipresent eroticism. The problem is, we've had a hard time finding something good to save it from total panning. But let's go in order and don't draw hasty conclusions. The playful side of this micro production is described in very few words: pressing the space bar (or the left mouse button) advances the text, up to the only moment in which you are called to make a decision, i.e. select one of two possibilities of plot advancement. Once this is done, we quickly arrive at the ending and you can be enchanted to watch the credits. If you wish, you can play it a second time to try the other branch, so as to unlock all the artwork in the gallery that can be viewed among the extras (don't worry, because there is the possibility of advancing the text at light speed without having to read it again) and ... Enough. Don't make those Santicchia faces (really, don't!) on vacation when he gets beaten up by a drunk Russian truck driver. There is nothing else, really. No unlockable content. No secret characters. No minigames. Hidden branches needless to say... nothing at all. Sakura Spirit is consumed, it is appropriate to say, in less than an hour. And if you get tired of the silly plot, which we will talk about in the next paragraph, and you want to unlock only the drawings of the girls to make sense of the hand left free from any game peripheral, it lasts even less. Even fans of visual novels will struggle to find Sakura Spirit the least bit interesting Boobs Let's not beat around the bush: Sakura Spirit is in fact a gallery of gigantic boobs (Pianesani where are you going?) and mischievous situations (Pianesani what are you doing?). In reality it also has a kind of plot, which tells the story of a certain Gushiken Takahiro, a perverted boy (it couldn't have been otherwise) who wants to win a judo tournament to become the Japanese champion and represent his nation in this sport around the world. the world. Well, after all, she's not dressed all the worse than some teenagers who frequent via del Corso. His determination collides with the fear of not making it, so he follows the advice of friends and relatives and goes to a magical temple hidden in a magical forest where he donates all his possessions. Here he meets a busty succubus (where are the bromide syringes for Pianesani?) who sends him into a remote era, inhabited only by old men and girls with enormous boobs who share the tailor's shop with Miley Cyrus (no, Pianesani, not they still invented the time machine, you can't go there). Lost in the woods, the good Takahiro meets two warrior girls chasing two fox girls. Yes, they all have cubist avant-garde sizes. Obviously he decides to follow them to find out if there is life after the eighth G cup (Pian... Santicchia! We're amazed by you! Go back to playing CoD, come on. There's a limit to everything!). We won't tell you the rest of the plot (out of pity, not to spoil it). Just know that it is made up of situations created specifically to allow the kind ladies mentioned above to show us their breasts (let's see how many synonyms we can find by the end of the article), so that we can alternate the analog controllers without too much effort (this and end). Also be aware that Sakura Spirit is only the prequel to a bigger project and that, therefore, the continuation of the story should come out in the future (we shudder). Hi, I'm a fully naked vixen girl. #reader stay calm #readerstaisesafe, we didn't rate Sakura Spirit because of the sexual content. We are perfectly aware of how the genre works and we are not afraid of explicit references and various winks, even graphics. Four is better than two The problem, of course, is its overall quality, which is really poor: the texts are the fair of banality, there is only one crossroads in the plot and the more you read, the more you discover how little interesting what is being told is, despite the quotations and references to Japanese mythology. If you read everything you can read, you can finish it in about an hour, but it's easy to want to skip several lines of text, since many are reallymeaningless and poorly written. As already mentioned, technically the tones of Sakura Spirit are those of comedy; it is a pity that there are very few apt jokes capable of eliciting a half smile and that, in most cases, one is left stunned by the paucity of the literary devices used. So, if we remove the plot and the texts, what remains valid to glue the beautiful images of girls with balloon boobs? The answer is within you, and it is wrong either way. However, if you really can't help it and believe that without seeing them the quality of your life will inevitably deteriorate, go to the forums of the various communities specializing in visual novels, including the Sakura Spirit hub on Steam, where you will surely find them all. It's really not worth spending ten euros for such a meager offer, from any point of view you look at it (yes, Pianesani, even if you look at it from below... but the view isn't bad, come on). There is much better, trust me.", "date": "2014-07-24", "grade": "3.0"}
