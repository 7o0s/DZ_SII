At the time there was talk of anti-Warcraft 3, with some even preferring it to the Blizzard title. Spellforce was and is the perfect mix between an RPG and a real-time strategy game, with more extreme hero management than any other competitor. The following year the first expansion was released, Dragon Storm, which offered, in addition to a new campaign, also a new mode, namely the Arena Quest. It was several hours of extra gameplay (it was still the time when expansions weren't cheap DLCs) that made many happy. Almost simultaneously, talks began about the next package, Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny, even if the official announcement will come only two years later, in the now distant 2009. About six years have passed since the release of Dragon Stom. JoWood's dire financial situation had stalled production on the series. After months and years of vague news and no confirmation, the release date of the product was postponed indefinitely in March 2011, with a laconic press release, following the definitive bankruptcy of the publisher. Fans of the series feared the worst, but the rapid acquisition of JoWood's remains by Nordic Games, which is also trying to revitalize other franchises such as Painkiller and Gothic, has allowed the completion of several works, including Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny. It remains only to find out if the rescue was worth the effort and if the series has any prospect of reinvigorating itself after this new breath of life. German fantasy Faith in Destiny continues the story told in the previous chapters. The player will take on the role of a hero with exceptional powers who will have to free Eo from a new evil initially unknown. That's all. In short, you will have understood that the plot is just a good canvas to introduce the different maps that make up the main campaign, actually quite articulated to be that of a simple expansion. There are some twists here and there, but in general, from a narrative point of view, we are certainly not dealing with a memorable work. Let's start immediately with some ritual clarifications. Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny does not innovate in anything and is a simple stand alone expansion, which translated means that it does not need the original game to run, well based on the canons of the other chapters. The same can also be said from a technical point of view. The game is still in 2006 and it shows, especially in the angular models and in some now vintage textures. The few improvements made fail to hide the truth. The dragons on the other hand are more than good, but don't expect miracles for everything else. Particularly bad are the interlude sequences made with the game engine, also victims of bad writing. Not that one asks Milton for the script, but seeing these inanimate puppets saying often ridiculous phrases has its effect. However, don't worry, we didn't let the technical aspects affect the final grade that much. After all, we are perfectly aware that it was not possible to expect more from a video game that managed to find the way to digital distribution almost by a miracle. A series with great potential Faith in Destiny takes up the same mechanics of Spellforce 2: there are three resources to collect to build ever more powerful buildings and troops. There are heroes, each with its own characteristics to develop. There are more strategic maps, designed for armies, and others more focused on the use of the hero and the resolution of primary and secondary quests. The control system remains the same hodgepodge of mouse and keyboard commands you should be familiar by now. Series purists fret not, as it's still possible to directly control the heroes by placing the camera behind their back. In short, it should be clear to you by now that anyone who has played the previous chapters will not struggle much to settle in this one. The only real novelty introduced in the original formula is the possibility of riding dragons, very powerful units capable of defeating entire armies without too much difficulty. It's a decent addition, which is more good for the show than for the strategy, but which is not without problems that we will discuss later. However, the greatest added value of Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny is its proposing game mechanics almost completely abandoned by the competition. The industry's eagerness to make RTS ever simpler and more accessible to the general public makes pasome elements that seemed to belong to the gastric refluxes of the past were rarely very fresh. The spread with the present Having to indicate the defects of Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny we don't have too many doubts: the troubled development is there and it shows. It is perceived without too much difficulty that it is a heated soup, perhaps out of time. It's not just a technical issue, but also a compactness of the game. There is a lack of attention to some details, such as the artificial intelligence of the dragons themselves, which has proved clumsy on several occasions, not reacting properly to the attack of the enemies. Under normal conditions, one would not pay too much attention, but being the only significant novelty, the question changes a lot. There are also some problems that the series brings with it from the first chapter, such as the presence of not exactly exciting quests that act as filler (but this, if you like, is a problem of many modern role-playing games, including Skyrim) and some imbalances towards the RPG side that has not been able to file despite the years of development and which lead the group of heroes to become practically omnipotent on the battlefield. Among the alternative modes to the campaign, we mention the possibility of taking part in skirmishes, perhaps played on your own maps created using the game editor, and that of competing online, even if we must admit that the servers are not very popular and it is difficult to find and conclude even a single game.", "date": "2012-07-05", "grade": "7.5"}
