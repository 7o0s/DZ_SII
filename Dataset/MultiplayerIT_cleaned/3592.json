{"name": "Trainstation 2: Railway Empire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trainstation-2-railway-empire-recensione.html", "text": "There is a certain sense of control and omnipotence inherent in the spirit of the collector, which associates well with that typical of strategic and management video games. For this reason, when trains are added to a mechanic based on the control of resources and the management of communication and transport lines, the combination can be explosive, as demonstrated by the numerous games of the genre released over the years. The various railway Tycoons have long been the exclusive prerogative of the PC area but lately they have also made their way widely on mobile platforms, where they can already count on numerous alternatives even if often dangerously entangled with the various monetary mechanics related to free-to-play and possibly pay to win. Among the most interesting proposals of this period we can consider Trainstation 2: Railway Empire for iOS and Android, subject of this review. The aim of the game is the management of a vast railway network, divided into various geographical regions and mainly focused on the control of individual trains and on the logistics of travel. The structure is greatly streamlined and simplified compared to certain deep simulations that can be found on PCs, to meet the control system and the typical use of games on mobile platforms, however the elements to keep under control are different and progressively increase in quantity and stratification, making Trainstation 2 a rather deep title, even if always very clear and easy to approach. There are three main plans to keep under control: the construction of the train fleet, with the acquisition of new locomotives and wagons and their continuous improvement, the transport logistics, usually satisfying various requests from one station to another and finally the construction of the stations themselves and of the corresponding urban agglomerations, which adds an element almost of a city builder to the whole mechanism of the game. The train of wishes In most cases we find ourselves sending trains from one place to another trying to satisfy various types of requests: usually it is a matter of transporting materials previously stored by the mines and then transformed through the factories that can be built and expanded at the central station , but there can be several ~quests~, such as simple passenger transport which usually results in good amounts of coins to be earned. Each completed mission brings loot, represented by gems (the most important currency), coins and materials for upgrading trains or for trade, but also experience points that allow you to level up, an indispensable element for unlocking new slots for building factories and facilities in the station or open up new trade possibilities. There is also a kind of story that illustrates the progressive opening of the various regions where it is possible to open new routes, each characterized by different environments and slightly different situations, but each separated from the other like some sort of levels with well detached compartments between them. There is therefore no real expansion of the game world as much as the possibility of switching from one setting to another and carrying out missions on different places but without the possibility of communication between one and the other. Trainstation 2 is a management system specifically designed for mobile platforms, therefore the interface is well designed to be visible and usable optimally with the touch screen. It also follows a certain simplicity in terms of menus and sub-menus, which combine well with a graphic characterization that aims more at a good stylization in an almost cartoonish style than at a realistic representation, but everything is still presented in an excellent style and with a remarkable level of detail. Being a free-to-play, it is clear where the typical traps of the monetization system lurk on a game based essentially on transport and construction: waiting times. Each journey requires a certain amount of time to complete and the most advanced and important missions lengthen these times considerably, reaching several minutes of waiting to be completed. It follows that it becomes necessary to interrupt the game and resume it later (the game continues the missions already started in idle, fortunately) or spend the required gems to compress the times, but these are earned in very limited quantities during the game and can be more easily purchased with real money.", "date": "2019-07-17", "grade": "7.5"}
