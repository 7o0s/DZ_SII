It is essentially a card game mixed with a dungeon crawler which requires the progressive elimination of the opponent's deck, intended as a dungeon to be explored, through a simple yet ingenious ~combat~ system based on the combination of different cards. As in a classic dungeon crawler RPG, the basic elements of the action are represented by the elimination of creatures and the collection of gold, even if it all happens through the combination of cards. It's all certainly easier to play than to explain, and after a short tutorial you're able to immediately get into the mechanism, which is one of the strengths of the game, but let's try to give an idea of how it works anyway. The rules are few but strict and the mechanisms well thought out, the choices that the player must make in each single hand are limited and clear-cut, placing us in front of a very selective challenge, which does not allow for a large margin of error. Our opponent places four cards in front of us from his deck, which can represent attack weapons, defensive items, potions, gold and obviously enemy creatures. Each of these cards is symbolized by a stylized drawing and a number, which indicates the hit points of the creature, the power of the weapon or shield or the amount of gold coins bestowed or hit points returned in the case of potions. Another kind of card is that of special abilities and there are five in each deck, taken from a list that grows as the game progresses. Cards can be equipped on either hand or placed in the backpack when dealing with items, while the creatures obviously remain in the opponent's hand. Every time three slots are freed, as many cards are removed from the deck and presented to the player, who must again try to eliminate them, until the deck runs out. Card Crawl offers us a game of cards that is always closely fought in a strange tavern Houses of cards The combat system is very simple: the number associated with each creature indicates both the amount of damage it can inflict and the hit points it possesses. If you carry a creature on an equipped shield, it absorbs the amount of hit points indicated on the card, otherwise you can place an attack weapon on the creature and it will deal the indicated amount of damage. In the absence of defenses, the creature directly hits the main character but a constant careful calculation of the moves to be made is necessary because the protagonist's hit points are very few and the choices in some cases are forced, also because a certain dose of randomness is necessarily present as it is a card game. Alongside the simple but implacable mechanism of attack and defense objects, potions intervene, capable of healing the protagonist if equipped, and special abilities that have various effects, from sending cards back to the deck to the possibility of absorbing hit points from creatures and requiring a well-dosed use being present in small quantities. The written explanation is inevitably confused and not very understandable, but a few minutes of practice is really enough to master the mechanisms of Card Crawl, even if the level of challenge is always quite high. In fact, a few improperly calculated moves are enough to take us to Game Over but the push to go back to playing, at least in the first period, is very strong. The bizarre characterization studied by the TinyTouchTales team and entrusted to Mexer is then particularly apt for creating a fantasy challenge climate with a light-hearted and grotesque tone, all set on the atmosphere of a dodgy tavern and populated by strange creatures intent on drinking beer, confabulating about magical oddities and , of course, playing cards.", "date": "2015-03-24", "grade": "8.0"}
