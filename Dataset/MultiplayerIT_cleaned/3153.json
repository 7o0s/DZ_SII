Square Enix has always had a somewhat difficult relationship with the mobile market, practically going from one extreme to the other even as a very conception of the market segment, which has influenced the choice and treatment of the products to dedicate to it. We have suddenly gone from the publication of games taken from the console landscape (the old classics or Final Fantasy Tactics, to be precise), transported to mobile platforms and offered at prices that are completely out of logic compared to the standards of this sector, to an embrace a little too enthusiastic about the more paroxysmal mechanisms of free-to-play with microtransactions, without ever being able to find a real balance between the two opposing visions. To tell the truth, Brave Exvius had managed to place itself in the right middle between the gacha, the grind intended as a supporting element and a certain sustainability of the whole mechanism, and it is therefore a pity to note how War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius you seem, at least for the moment, a step backwards from this point of view. The game is a mobile turn-based strategy RPG in the classic Japanese style, which falls within the tradition of the Final Fantasy Tactics genre, also taking up its style, as narration and tone, in a more faithful way than what was done by the excellent Advance sub-series. but with obvious variations in terms of gameplay derived from the setting entirely based on the collection and evolution of the characters. Even the main theme of the story, or the rivalry that emerges and breaks a brotherly relationship, is a bit of a return to the old Tactics and is an appreciable link in this new context. The events tell of the small kingdom of Leonis, who managed to remain free thanks to the power of his fighters and above all to the use of a magical technique derived from a mysterious ring, which allows you to summon the ~Visions~, or allied fighters who give a enormous strength to the army. The rivalry between the two brother princes, however, triggers an internal war that threatens to upset the entire balance of the continent. This is the narrative basis on which the game is grafted, but as a classic mobile RPG, War of the Visions ranges over different junctures thanks to the secondary adventures offered by the periodic banners and the various game modes. Also in this case, the home screen is full of icons and various activities to be completed, all aimed above all at the continuous progression of the characters who can also take a long time (we are also talking about months) to reach the maximum levels. For those who have a phobia of super-intricate menus, this game can be really scary: there are more than twenty menus present only on the home screen, without considering all the sub-menus that each of these hides inside. Mobile Strategy Final Fantasy On the battlefield, the action unfolds much like Final Fantasy Tactics, but keep in mind that this is a fundamentally different game in its nature. The fact that it focuses on the collection and constant evolution of characters and equipment necessarily entails a lighter strategic approach and completely based on the leveling of the fighters, so much so that it is possible to face the fights simply in auto-beats. To be clear, we are far from the old days of the original Tactics, when you had to study every single move to the millimeter, spending sleepless nights trying to defeat Velius with the party in disarray and the last save too far away to be recovered. In War of the Visions it is above all about investing time in the continuous improvement of your army, because it is the overall value of the set of characters that makes the difference. In any case, the basic setting is the historical strategic one: for each turn we can move the character by a certain amount of squares, with the possibility of movement and attack depending on the class (from the ~job~) to which he belongs and decide whether to use a item, ability, or physical attack. There are characters who attack hand-to-hand (swordsmen and warriors in general) or from a distance such as archers, magicians and summoners, with a certain amount of attention to be paid also to the conformation of the terrain on which we find ourselves in order to take advantage of any advantages (attack from above, cover your back to avoid critical damage). The lightening theresible in the strategic structure is compensated by the management and evolution system of the characters, which instead is very deep and multifaceted, as befits a mobile RPG with gacha elements: from this point of view, the game is very close to the previous production of the team Gumi, or The Alchemist Code, with its pros and numerous cons derived from a somewhat wild monetization. The main element is the conquest of the new fighters, which takes place by advancing in history but above all by carrying out the summons, obviously through the expenditure of in-game currency. The mechanism is therefore the classic one, with a rather low drop rate for UR characters but which is still quite accessible at the beginning. The problem is above all linked to the growth rate of the fighters, which takes place through various mechanisms for the passage of level (enhance), for the raising of the level cap (awaken and limit break), for the specialization (job) and for the skill allocation. Already this subdivision can create a bit of chaos, but then it should be noted that every single evolution on each front requires a certain amount of objects, shards (they are obtained when you receive copies of characters and visions already in our possession) and gems that really require a lot of time and dedication to be collected in abundance and obviously push towards the purchase of assorted packs. Taking a stroll in the ~special shop~ it is clearly visible how War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius winks somewhat at the ~whale~, or rather the most spendthrift players, given the prices that come out of some in-app purchases, which, moreover, may contain elements practically unobtainable otherwise. There is no doubt that War of the Visions focuses above all on character management, at least as a long-term commitment for the player community, therefore those who expect a Final Fantasy Tactics-style game must deal with substantially different mechanisms and get ready to pass more time between menus for character development and upgrades than on the battlefield. From the point of view of the interface we are faced with the usual overload of writing and microscopic numbers on the smartphone display, which is inevitable due to the amount of windows and information they contain. As far as the graphics in the combat phases are concerned, the work done by Gumi and Square Enix is truly commendable, with a style that takes up the simple but effective polygal setting of the old Tactics but with very detailed and well-animated 3D characters, which is associated to the excellent character design of Ryoji Ohara, following the guidelines of Akihiko Yoshida.", "date": "2020-04-03", "grade": "7.0"}
