It all began with artichoke poisoning... If the plot of The Westerner doesn't shine with originality, the characters certainly do, who are beautifully characterized and, with their cartoonish look, integrate perfectly with the lively three-dimensional settings of this point-and-shoot adventure click of an overwhelmingly cinematic nature: everything inevitably refers to the tradition of the Spaghetti Western, from the shots to the amusing interlude films and the accompanying music. The dialogues that mark the evolution of the story are well written and equally delusional. The very nice characters are the strong point of the game. Fans of graphic adventures who oppose three dimensions don't get strange ideas: this is an absolutely traditional adventure, albeit disguised as an avant-garde game, and the interface is also one of the most classic. We owe this unexpected miracle to the Spanish of Revistronic, as well as to their compatriots from Pendulo Studios, recently, we recognized the merit of having resurrected the adventure in its classic two-dimensional guise with Runaway. Two-dimensional was also the predecessor of The Westerner, Three skulls of the Toltecs, the first title already dedicated to Fenimore Fillmore (for more information about it, we refer you to the preview of the game). Enough chatter and make way for puzzles! In recent times, graphic adventures have been veering towards a more complex narrative structure, cinematic techniques and effective themes, but seem to increasingly neglect the importance of puzzles in the game economy - either to bring the genre closer to a wider audience either because the developers say they are willing to sacrifice interactivity for the richness of the plot. The Westerner seems to completely ignore this trend, indeed, it moves against the tide: it renounces embroidering on the plot, to leave free rein for old-fashioned puzzles. It is up to each individual player to decide whether this is an equally happy solution or a difficult compromise to swallow, the fact is that for once the story remains blurred in the background, sometimes it is little more than a pretext for the parody of other games or cult film, while the puzzles are numerous and always in the foreground. The Westerner renounces to embroider on the plot, to give free rein to the old-fashioned puzzles. Enough chatter and make way for puzzles! We find various types, based on the inventory and on the dialogues, more or less original and borrowed from the classics of the genre, but it is above all Monkey Island that sets the standard. The level of difficulty varies and the solution is almost always logical. To increase the difficulty of some puzzles is mainly the lack of feedback from Fenimore: sometimes, our digital alter ego simply refuses to perform certain operations (however logical or close to the solution), giving a generic answer without provide further explanations. On the other hand, we enjoy almost total freedom and can access practically all settings from the start of the game. In addition, multiple puzzle solving aids are available, both in the form of directions given by the characters during dialogues and in the form of visual clues: just to name a few, it's easy to get on the right path to overcome the most elaborate puzzles in the game , buying and reading newspapers in which similar situations are described. Therefore, even novice players shouldn't get stuck on the same obstacle for too long. [C] Certain arcade stages require great precision. The dialogues are multiple choice, in the best adventure tradition. Ol&egrave;! [/C] The fact that there are various ways to solve certain puzzles is also very appreciable: the target shooting competition, for example, can be won by skill or with dirty play, resorting to a slimy subterfuge (it is up to the player to decide from time to time which way to go). Another peculiarity is the need to get money to make purchases and carrots to forage the horse: during the adventure, we will in fact have to collect a series of objects, which can be found around but also purchased, and we will not be able to move without stuffing the our carrot nag. Don't worry, however: we will hardly run out of cash or resources, we are not dealing with a management title and if necessary it will be sufficient to rummage around the settings a bit. The most fundamentalist adventurers could be scandalized by the preswithout some mini-games, but we can guarantee you that mostly they risk only being fun  fishing with your hands is perhaps the only potentially annoying arcade sequence, due to the precision and the countless attempts required. The demented humor becomes irresistible especially in the last stages of the game: the final battle is hilarious, even if a little cumbersome. A tip, while we're at it: wait for the end credits to roll and you will be rewarded with a series of nice ~off-air~ videos with the characters of the game. As far as longevity is concerned, by now we should begin to get used to increasingly cinematic experiences not only in style but also in duration: exciting gaming experiences but limited to a few hours, in short. 3D point and click adventure??? Yes please! Our two lovebirds, finally reunited. Overall, the three-dimensional and cartoony graphics are quite pleasant, although it is not exactly the non plus ultra and the caricatured appearance of the characters may not meet everyone's tastes. The PICTuRE engine implemented by Revistronic seems to do its duty very well, managing a considerable amount of polygons with a certain ease and animating the characters in a relatively natural way. Interesting light effects. Unfortunately the shots, especially the close-up ones, often turn out to be awkward: it happens to find the field of vision completely invaded by Fenimore's body or another object and to have to move away to be able to interact with the surrounding environment. Sometimes it taps to repeatedly circumnavigate an element on the screen, to find the right angle from which to approach. There are several bugs and the game is not free from crashes, which is annoying, especially when added to the problems in displaying some volumetric effects for smoke, dust and steam ... but it seems that patches are already in circulation. Finding the right item in the inventory can be a challenge. be a business... As has been said, the interface is ~point and click~ and is almost unsettlingly immediacy: a click with the left button and we get a close-up view of the selected object, a click with the right and we can interact directly. By pushing the cursor to the top of the screen, you access the inventory. This is a bit impractical to navigate, especially in light of the considerable amount of objects that Fenimore carries around: to look for the desired one, we are sometimes forced to endless lateral scrolling. The soundtrack in perfect western style is catchy, without ever being too intrusive, making it a worthy complement to the atmosphere of the game. Localization is more than good. The dubbing is not always very brilliant but dignified: some actors force the voice a little too much to differentiate the various characters and underline the comedy of some jokes, perhaps without always achieving the desired effect. The main characters, fortunately for us, are immune to this problem however, especially the protagonist. Comment The Westerner is a curious title, surprising at times, and undoubtedly deserves the attention of fans of the genre and otherwise. However it is capable of arousing sometimes contradictory reactions, alternating touches of class and moments of pure ecstasy (especially for a lover of the Lucas and Sierra tradition) with attacks of bewilderment and seemingly gratuitous falls in style! It's hard to explain, but in some cases you get the impression of being in front of the best 3D point and click adventure ever made, in others you have an unfinished product in your hands. This does not mean that the realization is still appreciable and that a smile and fun are guaranteed. The small technical flaws described above affected our final judgment but it's a real shame because, with a more engaging plot and the addition of a few more settings, The Westerner would undoubtedly have been a hit. Perhaps it will delight those who have found Runaway dated and weighed down by unstimulating puzzles, surely all lovers of old-fashioned adventure curious to experience it in an entirely three-dimensional guise should not miss it, without being intimidated by some imperfections here and there. Another advantage to keep in mind, in view of a potential purchase: the availability of the title on newsstands and the inviting price of 19.50 euros! Pros: Humor Well-defined characters Various and fun puzzles Cons: Inconsistent plot Some awkward shots Some bugs It all began with artichoke poisoning... When Fenimore draws his revolvers, you never know how it will turn out. to finish! Well yes, Fenimore Fillmore, the clumsyro gunslinger protagonist of this adventure, is afflicted by an unusual allergy to artichokes. As soon as he arrives in Starek City, he runs into the henchmen of an unscrupulous local cattle breeder, just as they are bothering a farmer: like it or not, he ends up getting noticed and miraculously putting them on the run. To thank him for the help, the farmer welcomes him into his home, unaware of the fact that the succulent artichoke soup lovingly prepared by his little wife will be almost fatal for our hero, who will in fact go KO. on the first spoonful. When he wakes up the following morning, Fenimore will find himself embroiled in the feud between the honest local farmers and the ruthless Starek, a breeder and landowner who makes the good and the bad weather in the town to which he even gave the name, threatening and robbing the farmers of their properties. To rescue them, the indomitable gunslinger will have to prevent the arrival of Starek's reinforcements from the nearby city, provide the farmers with an arsenal for the defense of their farms and find allied forces ... all while keeping away from the artichokes and perhaps winning the heart of the beauty of the country, unfortunately related to Starek himself!", "date": "2004-06-11", "grade": null}
