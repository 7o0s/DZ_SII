The game in question is developed by Nexon and to tell the truth it has a rather long history at this point, considering that the first experiments in this sense date back to the early 2000s on PC. It is a title that has been able to gather wide acclaim but its fame has remained limited mostly to the eastern area in which it originated and spread the most, as often happens to some Korean phenomena that reach us only at a later time and which often find it difficult to integrate well into a different market characterized by different tastes. It is therefore not surprising that the KartRider series has managed to attract tens of millions of players while remaining practically unknown in these parts, but with this mobile chapter there is an excellent chance that the title will become a point of reference also in the West. In fact, there aren't many well-functioning kart racing on smartphones, although the platform also seems to lend itself well to a lighter arcade genre, essentially multiplayer and which lends itself to quick and light-hearted game sessions. Many attempts have been made, but the titles that actually remain impressed are very few and even Mario Kart Tour itself has somewhat polarized users and critics since its launch. This is because the sub-genre in question actually requires a careful amalgam of ingredients, to be dosed in a precise way to achieve a formula whose stability is a decidedly complex thing, also because it must take into consideration a large number of variables to maintain a balance optimal. For this reason it is also difficult to say in short if KartRider Rush+ is a fully valid product but what we can evaluate with some certainty is how much fun it actually is, able to combine a standardized but well calibrated driving model on the touch screen and a track design which, although not reaching great qualitative peaks, still offers good solutions to run. All within the usual free-to-play equipment made up of a thousand little icons, bonuses to spend and various currencies, but which beyond the annoyance of finding it on the screen can easily be neglected as regards the basic gameplay. The crazy rides The character leaves something to be desired, but on the other hand it is not easy to create a racing kart with a strong identity from scratch, therefore we welcome the kawaii and rather anonymous world of KartRider Rush+ anyway, appreciating if nothing else the technical quality with which it was made. The style is obviously cartoony, with small characters with big heads, decidedly unconventional vehicles and also various accessories to customize the pilots, as well as obviously tracks offering different settings that have become quite classic but with good digressions on the various themes, demonstrating a study on the track design which is not easy to find in many titles of this type. A partial explanation of these stylistic choices is given by the extensive customization that characterizes characters and vehicles, whose shape is progressively enriched and distinguished based on the results in the game and the tastes of the players, obviously also resorting to micro-transactions if necessary. However, there is a notable general cleanliness, both as regards the menus, which are in any case rather complicated, and above all on the screen in the heart of the action: unfortunately, the control system offers virtual commands on the screen, a solution that is not exactly ideal for a fast and intuitive gameplay like that required for the genre, but after a few games of practice you learn to manage it properly, also because the driving mechanics re-propose the classic elements of kart racing such as turbo, drift and possible use of power-ups. In short, everything has already been widely seen, but proposed in a rather convincing way. In this sense, Mario Kart Tour has a greater innovative charge, daring much more with its ultra-simplified control system and thus trying to find a way in full Nintendo style to allow an intuitive experience on a touch screen. KartRider Rush+ responds with a much more classic and more cumbersome basic setting, but which still manages to entertain with a slightly more complex driving model, where skill emerges as a discriminating element. The game modes really offer a large number of contents and adapt to different tastes, favoring alternatively skill driving or strategy andthe cynicism in the use of power-ups, all obviously based on online multiplayer. The story is huge with its 16 chapters that unfold in different worlds and settings, each consisting of five runs, with different objectives to complete and lots of cutscenes to create a sort of narrative line (totally irrelevant, but anyhow). To learn the basics there is also a system of licenses to be obtained in Gran Turismo style, while the main subdivision, found in the arcade mode, is above all between Speed and Item mode: the first mode relies exclusively on driving skill and speed, while the second is a bit like the classic ~battle~ mode, based on the use of power-ups. Everything is dealt with above all in ranked mode alone against other players or in teams. KartRider Rush+ is a free-to-play game and micro-transactions abound within it: there are various subscription systems and a large amount of items to be purchased separately, mostly of a cosmetic nature and which can therefore be easily overlooked by those who don't intend to get too caught up in customization. In general, pay to win elements do not seem to emerge from the monetization system, even if a certain imbalance emerges from the fact that it is possible to simply buy some rewards.", "date": "2020-05-23", "grade": "8.0"}
