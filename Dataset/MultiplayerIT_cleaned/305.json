{"name": "Tetris Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tetris-mania.html", "text": "Mania grandeur The characteristic aspect of Tetris Mania is, paradoxically, the absence of the original version of the historic puzzle game. EA Mobile, with a far from wise decision, has in fact preferred to bet everything on three different variations of the formula which - honestly - absolutely do not hold the comparison with the classic mode. Not that they are bad, of course: but their presence would have been more welcome as a side dish to the ~old~ Tetris rather than as the only components of a new product. First for classification and quality is the Cascade Mode, which pushes the user to build formations in order to concatenate as many chains as possible: essentially, when a line is made, the remaining pieces fall into the spaces below, and you have to make sure that this movement generates other lines. Instead of worrying about keeping the screen clear, the player must therefore build real ~castles~ of blocks, trying to obtain the greatest domino effect. Next is the Sticky mode, in which the various pieces are often composed of units of different colors: these are more affected by gravity, and therefore tend to fall towards the bottom. The leitmotif in this case is trying to join at least 10 squares of the same shade (which literally stick together, hence the name of the mode), so as to make them disappear together with the formation of the classic lines. Mania grandeur Finally we have the Fusion Mode, definitely the weakest of the three. In this scenario, the simple Tetris pieces alternate with so-called atom blocks, which cannot be eliminated via lines and which must be arranged next to each other and then detonated thanks to small squares called fusion blocks. Even difficult to describe in words, the Fusion mode is also the most difficult to assimilate, creating an evident paradox being associated with the name of one of the most immediate video games ever. All three variants can be used in two ways: Mania, the most classic of free play, or Challenge, which sets some goals and time limits. The choice by EA Mobile to automatically save the game status every time a game is interrupted by returning to the phone menu, which allows you to resume from the exact point where you left off, is definitely apt. From a technical point of view, as it is easy to imagine, Tetris Mania certainly cannot offer sensational elements: however the EA Mobile product proves to be pleasant thanks to the use of bright colors and some tasty visual effects, while on the sound level the situation is truly reduced to the bone, with very short jingles and effects relating only to the composition of the lines. On the other hand, the loads are inexplicably long, which for the first game reach almost 30 seconds. Game tested on Nokia 6630. Comment Tetris Mania, as we said at the beginning, does not offer the original version of the game, and this is undoubtedly the biggest limitation of the EA Mobile product. The three available versions (Cascade, Sticky and Fusion) in fact, however appreciable, end up unnecessarily weighing down a playful structure made famous precisely for its immediacy and simplicity. In many ways excessively complex and bizarre, the three modes let themselves be played, but it would have been much better to combine them with the good old Tetris. Pros Colorful and functional graphics Three new challenges for fans Cons The original Tetris is missing Modes that are a bit too complex Very long initial loading Tetris is undoubtedly the quintessence of the concept of ~immortal videogame~: a game that is so simple and at the same time exciting that it can easily have continued success over the years without the need for various remakes or facelifts. And precisely for this reason, Tetris has always been a kind of curse for developers and publishers who have gone into similar revival operations, seen and considered how not even one of the new versions has ever managed to even remotely touch the qualitative peaks of the original. Despite the unfortunate tradition, EA Mobile tries again today with this Tetris Mania on mobile phones: let's see how it went...", "date": "2006-11-01", "grade": null}
