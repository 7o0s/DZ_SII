Anyone who considers it ~the Monster Hunter with Final Fantasy monsters~ is not entirely far from the truth, but it is an unfortunate comparison especially with respect to the very famous Capcom series. Developed by Racjin, the new Final Fantasy spin-off tries an almost completely new path, mixing the gameplay of the old Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles with the action/survival/RPG structure that Monster Hunter made their cornerstone. In reality, Final Fantasy Explorers resembles Monster Hunter only in the preparation stages; then it becomes more of a modern Phantasy Star Online in which Racjin has infused twenty years of Final Fantasy, drawing on a boundless pool of creatures, characters, scenarios and music. The result didn't completely convince us. Final Fantasy Explorers will especially appeal to die-hard fans of the hugely popular JRPG series What a story guys! Considering that we are talking about a Final Fantasy, it is almost a nonsense to play for hours and hours without seeing a shred of plot. No, you didn't get it wrong: the adventure begins and ends on the island of Amostra, a mysterious place where the most dangerous creatures in the world roam. Our alter ego - which we can discreetly customize in appearance - is one of the many explorers intent on scouring Amostra in search of fortune because, you know, where there is danger there is usually also treasure. In this case, however, there is not even a shadow of treasure. The characters who stop in the main hub will limit themselves to contextualizing the missions that we will be able to accept at the appropriate counter but, as we said, there is no real story to follow: our aim will simply be to explore the island, defeating monster after monster and crafting ever more powerful weapons and clothing that will allow us to face the next threats. The common thread, if anything, is the awakening of the Eidolons, the legendary deities who, as real bosses, will give us more trouble. Beyond some missions that will ask us to defeat a certain number of creatures or collect a certain quantity of objects, the battles with the Eidolons are the real protagonists of the gameplay: if the common enemies put up very little resistance, the Eidolons who fight in their specific arenas they are much tougher and have attacks and powers that Final Fantasy fans will recognize immediately. Furthermore, some of them are characterized by particular mechanics that must be learned and metabolized: Diabolos plunges the arena into darkness, Ramuh inflicts more damage the more crystals are standing during the fight, Dryad manages to hide underground and so on. That's why the game insists on replaying battles against the same Eidolons over and over again, so that the player always needs new items to survive the battles. It is a mechanism that does not differ much from the way in which Capcom proposed its monsters of different colors, but if in Monster Hunter it was necessary to learn completely new patterns, in Final Fantasy Explorers the bosses remain more or less the same and only become more harmful and resistant. Fortunately, there is no arguing about the variety of Eidolons and monsters in general: there are so many, taken from almost all Final Fantasy. Fans will instantly recognize their favorites and we're sure they'll be delighted at the chance to catch and take them for a walk. My Chocobo is prettier than yours So Final Fantasy Explorers actually plays like a Monster Hunter, without giving too much weight to plots and secondary characters: you prepare the character, choose a mission at the counter of the guild of adventurers, then leave the hub to start it. Amostra is divided into numerous scenarios that differ in terms of enemies and resources to collect: between prairies, beaches, deserts and volcanic mountains, fantasy fans will find every possible clich. Each defeated enemy drops an object to be collected which can be a material useful for making weapons and armor, or a so-called ~atmalith~, practically its essence. The ranch, in the city, allows us to recreate that monster and turn it into a faithful follower: the more powerful the creature, the fewer monsters that can follow us, for a maximum of three. Therefore, if you want to go around with a Chocobo and a Tonberry nobody forbids you, but if you prefer the attack power of a Black Knight you will have to give up two other companions. These followers, on the other hand, aren't just an added attack value, as they have special abilities and stats that place them in very specific roles. After all, in a game like Final Fantasy Explorers absolutely could not miss the traditional Job System that became famous with Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics. Initially we will be able to choose between the classic basic Jobs - Knight, Monk, Black Mage and so on - but by completing the various missions and achieving specific objectives it is possible to unlock many other Jobs, from the Dark Knight to the Dragoon via the Machinist or the Geomancer. It is a pity that the game does not define the aforementioned objectives, leaving the player groping in the dark. It is clear that the title needs a community that dissects every secret, but unfortunately there are not so many secrets. By completing the missions and unlocking the Jobs, the armory is enriched, and at that point it is only necessary to find the materials necessary to manufacture one of the new weapons or armor on the list: in the end, the gist of the game is just that, but once completed each mission and defeated each boss, there is nothing left to do but accumulate the materials to manufacture objects that we no longer need. The 3D effect Not received. One million jobs If it is true that the progression system and the endgame contents leave something to be desired, nothing can be said about the combat system which represents a very solid basis for any future developments. Final Fantasy Explorers is an absolutely action game: while not being able to jump, our alter ego can run by consuming skill points or AP, i.e. the same ones that we will spend to cast the spells and special attacks that we paid in CP or Crystal Points to the crystal in the center of the hub. Technically we can learn everything, because the skills depend on the Job we are using and the weapons we are holding: if you want to play a Machinist armed with a gun and a shield who throws Fire and Cure left and right, you can do it. Obviously some Jobs lend themselves more or less to melee combat or spell casting, but we're talking about an incredible variety of spells, skills, weapons, Jobs and clothing. We can associate the skills to the combinations of the back buttons with the front buttons of the Nintendo 3DS, thus preparing a ~loadout~ that we can also save in an intuitive personalized catalogue. One key allows you to attack in melee, another calls up the menu of consumable items, and Final Fantasy Explorers is all here: in its simplicity, it guarantees decidedly solid gameplay. The real strength of the combat system, however, lies in the Crystal Surge, an indicator that is filled by using skills and by defeating enemies: once a certain threshold is reached, by pressing the back buttons we will be able to choose from a list of temporary upgrades. The beauty is that if we use one of our compatible skills while we are under the effect of a Crystal Surge, that same skill will ~mutate~, acquiring a bonus property; later, we will be able to buy it in the city and customize it further. Considering the number of Crystal Surge abilities and effects, it goes without saying that the variants in question are almost countless. The parallel mechanics of the Trance Surge, on the other hand, allows us to temporarily assume the powers of the captured Eidolons or the appearance of the most famous Final Fantasy heroes: during the effect of the Trance Surge we will be stronger than normal and, triggering the Crystal Surge in contemporary, we will be able to use very famous special attacks such as Ifrit's Hellfire or Cloud Strife's Omnislash. In short, the combat system guarantees considerable depth, especially if you play in a group and take advantage of the synergies between the Jobs. In fact, each mission can be tackled online with three other players: the enemies become more long-lived and powerful, but the explorers can count on the group dynamics typical of RPGs, between White Mages who heal and Bards who boost stats by playing the harp. In short, it is a pity that Final Fantasy Explorers does not have a dedicated multiplayer sector. The missions to be tackled in single and multiplayer are the same, and if it is true that the loots in company are significantly richer, you still have to deal with the showy frame rate drops that make the experience decidedly frustrating even playing with the New Nintendo 3DS, especially in the presence of wizards capable of casting the flashiest spells. This would explain the reason that prompted Racjin to completely deactivate the stereoscopic effect, a choice that left us quite dumbfounded because we doubt that the code could not have been better optimized: after all, Final Fantasy Explorers does not move who knows how many polygons, and between bland textures and small-scale scenarios we can't help but question the competence of the Japanese developer. Not that the title Squarand Enix is ugly to look at, mind you, but it's certainly not sophisticated. Even the sound sector is far from memorable, and the occasional alternation of unpublished tracks and the most famous motifs of the saga leads to a decidedly merciless comparison.", "date": "2016-02-01", "grade": "7.5"}
