{"name": "Batman Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/batman-vengeance_d.html", "text": "The cube in the dark Obviously the fascinating adventures of our hero could not fail to tickle the ~appetite~ of the software houses which since the mists of videogame times have certainly not missed the appointment with tie-ins inspired by Batman's adventures: unforgettable Batman- The Movie by Ocean on Amiga 500 and C-64 (and Sunsoft's game of the same name on Nes and Megadrive), as well as Batman Returns and The Adventures Of Batman and Robin (both Konami) on Super Nintendo; instead worthy of being closed in the hell of damned (videogames) are Batman for PC Engine (8-bit console never officially distributed in the old continent ed), Batman Returns by Sega, as well as the similar racing game recently landed on Psone, perhaps the worst of the lot. Inspired by a recent cartoon series, Batman Vengeance (already released last October on Playstation 2 and, recently, Xbox), is presented on Gamecube with all it takes to be the best tie-in to the adventures of the man bat, thanks to the leap from 2 dimensions to the (now indispensable for software houses) polygonal graphics, the standard of the cosmetics of a video game, as the trend imposed by Playstation and Saturn wants. Storylines A night like many others in Gotham City, Batman is as usual in action to thwart the criminal actions of the scum of the city, especially if the Joker is the enemy par excellence of this Ubisoft production. Thanks to an anonymous phone call, Batman finds a young woman gagged and, nearby, a bomb. The time to escape from the area (with the credits peeping out, as if it were the beginning of an episode) and the terrible explosion breaks the silence of the city. Apparently, this gentlewoman's son, Mary, has been kidnapped by the grotesque Joker who wants a $5 million ransom for saving the puppet's life. As the story unfolds, Batman will understand that things are not exactly like this, indeed, perhaps not even he could understand what terrible trap his archenemy was concocting with his worthy Harley Quinn and many familiar faces (for those who know the Batman universe), such as Ivy and Mr. Freeze. Shall we CLAP our HANDS? Batman-inspired tie-ins have generally always been platform, fighting game or a mix of the 2 genres (we don't mention the aforementioned racing game for the 32-bit Sony console, because it is unworthy of the video game title). For the first appearance of the mythical masked hero in polygons and textures, a platform was chosen, mixed with very beatem'up style and, listen, stealthian phases, like the good Snake (or should we say Raiden? Ed) set the standard. Batman has, of course, an enviable agility, the possibility of gliding, like a real bat, from the highest platforms, thanks to his (very cool) cape, beating all the jumble of criminals thanks to his proberbial knowledge martial arts and take advantage of its famous gadgets, such as the bat grappling hook (very important in the economy of the game), the classic batarangs (here also electric) and so on; obviously inevitable, to the delight of all the fans, the Bat Mobile and the Bat Aereo. Shall we CLAP our HANDS? However, something went wrong and playability suffers a lot: many times it is difficult, for the camera, a little (err) drunk, to follow Batman's sudden movements, especially in the case of a sudden jump from a great height which translates, very often, in a flight of at least 30 meters. The armaments management system is, without a little initial practice (fortunately there is a decent tutorial set up by the good Alfred), a bit confusing. The enemies, all a bit too similar to each other, do not enjoy the implementation of at least satisfactory artificial intelligence wheels (which makes Halo's enemies legendary, again not many in terms of variety). In a nutshell, the gameplay of Batman Vengeance (as in the other releases) does not offer the fun that one might actually expect; what is most irritating is that with a few filings here and there and increasing the variety of situations a little, now we would not be here writing these (sad) lines but consuming our fingertips on the comfortable Nintendo pad. Cosmetics and dark soundtrack Graphically, Batman Vengeance comes with a delightful flat shading look that closely (and not a little) resembles the TV series from which this video game is based. The number of polygons on the screen is not very high but the sensation of sitting on an armchair and watching an episode is almost palpable, also thanks to an almost constant fluidity of 50 fps (double the Playstation 2 version), the motion blur that every so much peeps, the beautifullight and shadow effects that cloak backdrops and sprites, the very apt special effects (such as flames) and simply stupendous animations: Batman and all the main enemies enjoy a very high number of animations which further enhances our excellent impression on the (per se already good) cosmetics of the Ubisoft title. The only regret is that going deeper with the Ati video chipset, we could have expected an even more valid product, although the conversion was, fortunately, not 100% slavish. Cosmetics and dark soundtrack The music of Batman Vengeance goes very well with the graphics and everything that happens on the screen, also because fortunately they are the same ones that make up the original soundtrack. If any of you have ever seen the cartoon series in the original language, you will be further excited by the news that the voice actors present there are the same ones already heard on the small screen. It is possible to select subtitles in various languages, including Italian, in case you are not comfortable with the Albion language. Finally, the sound effects are excellent, not for nothing they are also recycled from the famous series. Bat conclusions Batman Vengeance is, on balance, a good video game. Graphically it is very good but a miccino inferior to what the Gamecube has shown to be able to do (Rogue Leader anyone? ndr); the music, the original dubbing and the excellent sound effects are combined with the good visual realization to immerse the player in a real cartoon, a pity that the playability, the most important thing, has not been equally cared for, given that once the twenty levels will have been consumed by the avid gamer, eager to know how the intricate storyline will evolve, the game will end up on a dusty shelf never to be resumed. A few more testing sessions would have been enough to smooth out the defects expressed a couple of paragraphs above, but even with the quality level proposed therein, Batman Vengeance will be a real wedding invitation for fans of the dark knight. Everyone else at least give it a look, not expecting a masterpiece. Pros: It seems to see and hear an episode of the cartoon Batman is so cool. Cons: ......but sometimes it frustrates a lot. Many won't even finish it. Not excellent technical realization for a Gamecube The cube in the dark Unlike many superheroes, Batman is, together with Spider Man, one of those icons that can hardly be hated or ignored: if for example many people, young or old, to name a few, still ignore who the X-men are , have never heard of Iron Man or think that Captain America is a new rival for Captain Findus, it is almost impossible to find someone who does not know the bat man, the dark character invented by Frank Miller many and many years ago. Since then, Bruce Wayne aka Batman has come a long way: thousands of comics, special issues, crossovers with other super heroes, a series of TV series (the unforgettable Robin who always exclaimed ~Gosh~!! ed), a cartoon series animation, tons of gadgets and 4 films for the big screen, directed by Tim Burton for the first 2, Joel Schumacher for the remaining 2 films and a parade of Hollywood stars such as Micheal Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney called to dress the role of the masked hero while Jack Nicholson, Danny De Vito, Uma Thurman and even Arnold Schwarzenegger have the honor of playing the sworn enemies of the bat man such as Joker, The Penguin, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze. The charm of Batman is certainly to be found in the complex psychology of the character: little Bruce, as a child, saw, before his innocent eyes, the murder of his parents by some deranged people (in the first film this stain is attributed to Joker) and since then he vowed to put an end to the crime gone mad in the (gothic for Burton, sunny for Schumacher) Gotham City, the city where the adventures of Batman (and, in hindsight, Robin and Batwoman), after dark , it takes place. Luckily for him, Batman has the best technology at his fingertips, starting from the Bat cave full of computers and indispensable tools to help our hero, passing through the very classic Bat Mobile (which has seen its look change many times) up to the little seen Bat Plane / Motorboat and so on.", "date": "2002-05-15", "grade": null}
