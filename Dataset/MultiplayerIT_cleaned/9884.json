The developer Gameloft is certainly and without a shadow of a doubt the most active software house in the field of mobile gaming, churning out dozens and dozens of games continuously for all types of platforms. And often with enviable results. This is the case of their latest production, Soul of Darkness available on the Nintendo digital store at a cost of just 500 points (5 euros), a game that is certainly not original from the point of view of the concept but certainly with great charm and playability. After the action RPG Legend of Exidia and Gangstar, clone game of Grand Theft Auto, today comes the low-cost carbon copy (or almost) of the much more infamous and historical Castlevania. Soul of Darkness draws heavily on the Konami masterpiece, and does so without fear of being judged, it seems: the points of contact between the two titles are, with a touch of embarrassment, even too many. From the initial screen and from the very first moments of the game, anyone who has had any chapter of Akumajo Dracula (the original Japanese name) in their hands will immediately feel a certain sense of deja-vu. Let's start from the concept: it is a scrolling action-rpg title with strong platform and adventure connotations; a well thought-out mix of genres made famous by the Konami series and now re-proposed with very few differences. In the Gameloft adventure we take on the role of Kale, an adventurer with the aim of defeating the Vampire and freeing the soul of his beautiful beloved, through 11 highly characterized and linear levels. If there is a difference with Castlevania it is this: the extreme complexity of the Konami level design gives way to decidedly linear and much shorter schemes, while maintaining a certain amount of secrets to discover and hidden places to explore. The 4-5 hours needed to complete Soul of Darkness obviously reflect its low cost, even if the making of the game is really good. The eleven levels are extremely accurate and all different in the settings, passing from castles, woods, underworld, caves, cathedrals and ghostly and ruined landscapes. The game action rushes just like in a platformer; there are many steps to deal with intelligently trying to avoid obstacles, dangers and enemies, perhaps trying to learn the ~patterns~ and memorize the movement of the elements on the screen and then avoid them. The sense of deja vu It's not only a Soul of Darkness action-platformer, but also a game with some strong RPG elements. Obviously, this is not an RPG, but there are still upgrades, levels to reach, power ups for the weapons necessary to unlock particular characteristics of the swords, shields, and above all spells. Our alter-ego is in fact capable of unleashing powerful spells to be used both against enemies and against the elements that hinder progression. But not only that, Kale can command water and fire, useful in various situations in which puzzle-like puzzles are envisaged to be solved now with one element, now with the other. The secret points of the map can often be reached only and exclusively through the transformations of the protagonist, who can change into various creatures (of land, air or water); by conquering experience points our character gradually acquires new weapons, combos, spells, transformations, and at the end of each of the eleven levels there is a ~boss fight~ as per tradition, quite satisfying to face because each one must be defeated in a different and intelligent way . The balance of difficulty and gameplay is almost perfect, as is the care placed in the controls, which are reactive and well thought out. The entire graphic sector is equally well-finished thanks to evocative and excellently designed backgrounds, rich in details and effects; animations and cut scenes are also above the average of DSi-Ware productions and beyond, and make Soul of Darkness one of the most valid titles from every point of view. One could obviously hope for a greater use of the particular functions of the Nintendo hardware: the camera can be activated in some levels to obtain power-ups linked to taking photographs, or to replace the protagonist's face with ours in the cutscenes. The touch screen and the microphone are largely forgotten, as is the second screen which is used almost exclusively to view the game map, of which there is little need given the linearity of the schemes and the lack of any type of backtracking (of where Castlevania lives, in essence). Congratulations to Gameloft also for the sound sector, with lots of effects and background music orchestrated and perfect for the purpose, that of darkening the atmosphere and giving the game a horror vein. A round of applause then for allthe realization, but much less for the lack of originality.", "date": "2010-07-26", "grade": "8.0"}
