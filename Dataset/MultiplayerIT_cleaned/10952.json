Since the diffusion of the first images, Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes has made its way into the hearts of fans. This is not just any ~crossover~, in fact, because it allows us to control none other than the characters created by Tatsunoko, the historic manufacturer of Japanese cartoons such as ~Yattaman~, ~Hurricane Polymar~, ~Tekkaman~, ~Kyashan~, ~Gatchaman~ etc. Video games and anime have always been hand in glove, and nostalgics know it well; therefore this fighting game stood as a real dream come true, one of those things that maybe you can fantasize about knowing that it will hardly be realized. Yet the coin-op has arrived in Japanese theaters, and the conversion for Wii (facilitated by the presence of a practically identical hardware base) was not long in coming, bringing with it a load of hidden characters and nice minigames. The splendid animated introduction tries to justify the presence in the same scenario of characters belonging to different eras and realities: a mysterious force ~infects~ the signal of a television show making its protagonists real, who find themselves colliding with each other to figure out who it is. the architect of this extraordinary event. Game mode The available modes are quite classic: Arcade Mode, Versus, Survival, Time Attack and Training, to which we must add the shop to spend the points earned, the gallery to view the unlocked elements and the minigames. The latter are quite numerous and are each based on a different character: we will find ourselves doing a speed race with Tekkaman aboard the Pegas robot, or in Ryu's role shooting hadoken at various targets, we will launch cars with Alex or we can try our hand in a sort of Duck Hunt with Ken the Eagle, and so on. These are applications that work by shaking the controllers and add a pinch of variety to the standard action, without particularly enriching the experience: a nice interlude, but nothing more than that. It is clear that the fulcrum of the game consists of the Arcade Mode: we will have to select two characters from the eighteen initially available (or only one, if it is the huge robot-lighter Gold Lightan or the equally gigantic PTX-40A from Lost Planet ) and face a series of opponents until we collide with the final boss in its three forms. The character with whom we will complete the fight will also be the one whose final sequence we will be able to see: in this sense, the developers have done things big, with short cartoons (often full of irony) in which the Capcom warriors and those Tatsunoko train in different ways to get the better of their arch-enemies. As far as the side modes are concerned, there is nothing particular to report: they are identical to those present in the various Capcom fighting games, without any substantial difference. The combat system of Tatsunoko vs Capcom is basically based on what has already been seen in Marvel vs Capcom, even if the buttons have been limited to four to meet the characteristics of the Classic Controller (which is obviously supported and represents the only way to enjoy the game in a ~correct~ way, together with the GameCube controller): strong attack , medium and light, plus a switch key. The special moves are based on the various ~crescents~, as per tradition, and the characters are well differentiated: Ryu represents a timeless classic, he can perform all the attack maneuvers that we know well and his super moves are based on the shoryuken and the hadoken, depending on whether they are performed from the ground or in the air; Polymar is the typical ~melee~ character, with excellent grapples and special moves, but only valid up close; Tekkaman does very well from any distance and his super moves are truly spectacular (fantastic when he collapses after throwing a Voltekker); Gold Lightan is huge and has the advantage of hardly being knocked down, but at the same time it is not very agile nor does it have particularly captivating maneuvers; Yattaman can use his yo-yo to hook opponents and pull them towards him, while his super move sees the sympathetic involvement of Yatta-Can. In short, each character makes a story in itself, and it is also possible to perform combined super moves that vary according to the team and are the most spectacular ever seen in a fighting game. How can I play it? Tatsunoko vs Capcom exists for the moment only in the Japanese version, and although Capcom is doing everything possible to publish the game in the West as well, for a matter of rights on the Tatsunoko series it is movery difficult for that to happen. So right now there are only two possibilities to play this fighting game in Italy: own a Japanese Nintendo Wii or install the Homebrew channel (there are several guides on the net), in which case you have to connect the console with a component cable to have correct playback of colors. Technical realization There's no doubt that this latest effort from Capcom is one of the technically best games ever seen on the Wii, with character designs and animations at the top of the genre. But first things first: the interface is completely in Japanese and some choices are questionable, but the drawings that portray the characters in the loading screens are truly splendid, made with the original style of the Tatsunoko anime. Although the context is two-dimensional, the graphics of the game are entirely polygonal and make use of rather sophisticated models: a few glances are enough to understand that the developers have concentrated on the quality of the characters and have left fewer resources for the scenarios, which in some cases appear a bit bare and devoid of particular charm. The animations, as mentioned, are excellent in variety and fluidity, and especially in the super moves they find their most spectacular and exciting dimension: seeing the arrival of the Yatta-can or Tekkaman aboard Pegas, or even rays of light that occupy the screen in full they are things that return a feeling of ~power~ still unmatched in the field of fighting games. The decision to introduce two gigantic characters (Gold Lightan and the PTX-40A) is innovative in its way and adds a certain variety to the gameplay, but visually it doesn't pay off: the size excessively penalizes the opponents, who appear too small to show off their details . There are twelve locations available: in some cases the polygon count leaves something to be desired, showing us a fairly bare and rough scenario, but in general the realization finds a good compromise between quantity and quality, with some truly beautiful solutions to see (the sunlight that colors the contenders and slowly goes from yellow to red, for example). There are no interactive elements, but they are not missed. As for the sound, an extraordinary job has been done for the voices of the Tatsunoko characters but also and above all for the music, which will really drive nostalgics crazy. Comment Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes is a product out of the norm, absolutely different from most of the titles available for the Wii and made even more exclusive by the fact that it will probably never be released outside Japan. It is a ~dream~ fighting game for any nostalgic fan of the Tatsunoko series, but which does not base its appeal exclusively on licenses: we are faced with a title of exceptional quality, made with care and passion, capable of satisfying a few ' all thanks to the solidity of the gameplay, the large number of characters available and the exclusive extras of the Wii version. An online multiplayer mode is missing, but other than that there's very little to complain about: Tatsunoko vs Capcom is a title to try at all costs, and which will probably make the lack of a certain Street Fighter 4 less bitter in the eyes of Nintendo console owners. It's just a shame that getting it to work on a PAL Wii isn't exactly a walk in the park... Pros A must for anime and fighting game fans Technically outstanding Amazing gameplay Against It exists only in Japanese version Average longevity for the genre No online multiplayer", "date": "2008-12-23", "grade": null}
