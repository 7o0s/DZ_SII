{"name": "Konami Krazy Racers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/konami-krazy-racers.html", "text": "If a good day starts in the morning... The thing that immediately impresses the player, after a few minutes spent navigating through the various menus, is the meticulousness with which everything has been studied and the care placed in the graphic creation of the same. Practically what appears on the screen is the desktop of any type of operating system, with its icons and a pointer that we will move to move between them. I was really impressed with this organization and it takes very little to love it, it is so intuitive and pleasing to the eye. At the same time, it is also clear that the Konami title has many more things to offer us than Mario Kart. First of all, there is no options menu (for what they are needed on a laptop), but there are many new features introduced, in fact we find a Notice Board where you can read suggestions and information of various usefulness, a Shop where you can buy upgrades for the typical power- up that we will collect along the tracks and (real, welcome surprise) the Driving School. This allows us to take the exams to obtain the various driving licenses necessary to unlock the most advanced Championships (Cups). To try to get a license, however, we will have to get good results in the lower leagues (and by good results I mean winning every championship, of course). The license tests vary in number and are of different nature and difficulty, such as the race against the clock or the challenge against one or more opponents; however, the goal to be achieved will be very explicit and the success of the exam will depend only on our skill. ... if they're roses they'll bloom... But let's get to the heart of the game, namely the racing. From the Racing Menu we will be able to access different game modes: Grand Prix, Time Attack, Free Run, Mini Battle and Vs. The Grand Prix mode is the most important and the most obvious. Through four circuits for each of the four Championships (plus a secret one) we will have to win the title of champion by accessing the various licenses step by step and unlocking new initially inaccessible circuits. The challenge offered by the opponents is valid and clean and careful driving will not be enough to finish first. In fact, it will be necessary to resort to the power-ups that can be collected along the tracks, to hinder the ambitions of others to win. It is also important to grab as many coins as possible, always during the races, with which to buy power-up upgrades. The various selectable characters have different characteristics, but not by much and our choice will depend, almost exclusively, on the sympathy they will be able to convey to us and which saga we prefer. Therefore, even in the form of adversaries they will be able to offer us, more or less all, the same degree of competition. Time Attack is clearly the race against time, in which once a driver and a track have been chosen, we will have to set a new record. Free Run allows you to carry out tests, constituting a good training method in view of the Grand Prix. The Mini Battle is an interesting game mode in which it is possible to choose between two types of atypical challenges and alternatives to the usual race. The Vs mode obviously allows us to compete against a human opponent, taking advantage of the connection capability of the Game Boy Advance. We wonder why the possibility of connecting up to four GBAs has not been included, given that even to play in two it is strictly necessary to have one cartridge each. This is perhaps the only minor flaw or weakness of Krazy Racers. However, what multiplayer offers us are the same game modes that you have in single player, namely the Free Trials, a Challenge Race with opponents controlled by the CPU, and the Mini Clash. ... and when the sun heats up... Krazy Racers is very pleasant to play and with the possibility of choosing between three levels of difficulty we will be able to have fun according to our experience and our driving skills. It is certainly not a simulation and the arcade setting of the game is the most obvious (and equally solid) one can expect from such a title. However, winning will not always be easy, even if the challenge for the most savvy users could prove to be short and perhaps not fully satisfying. For all the others, however, it will be a more lasting experience; however, the multiplayer option and the other collateral modes remain to slightly increase the longevity of the product. The controls are very simple and intuitive: D-pad to move, A to accelerate, B to brake, SELECT to look behind, L to use power-ups and R toto jump (a maneuver that should facilitate cornering). Mastering them is an easy and immediate undertaking, like the fun that must ensue. Another advantage of this Krazy Racers is its technical realization (of course up to now the GBA has had something to surprise us). In fact, the graphics are rich in detail and very fluid: the tracks are varied, detailed and full of charm, the backdrops are often very evocative and well-finished. Even the go-karts and the drivers are well reproduced and recognizable on the track, thanks also to an effective scaling of the sprites. There are also graphic goodies such as reflections, transparencies and simple light effects. The speed of the game during the race is not very high, precisely because the go-karts are not missiles like the F-Zero racing cars, but all this allows for greater detail than the Nintendo title. However, no slowdowns of any kind are noticeable. The sound is appropriate to the genre and light-hearted atmosphere of our competitions; effects and music are of good quality. It should be noted that in the game there is music taken from the various Konami series and each character has brought with him his typical catchphrases. ... red in the evening good weather hopefully. Ultimately, Krazy Racers is a very valid product, technically flawless and on average long-lived, which has also been able to introduce some innovations into a now saturated genre. However, let's wait for the advent of Mario Kart Advance to establish where the genre can really go, without really detracting from the intrinsic value of the new Konami production. ... red in the evening good weather hopefully. Pros: technically excellent, it brings some welcome immediate, fun and stimulating novelties to the genre Cons: not particularly long-lived multiplayer limited to two players Waiting for Mario Kart Advance When the game we are talking about here arrived at the editorial office, I was very eager to review it. Since I didn't find any obstacles in this sense, I secured my own copy of this Konami Krazy Racers. Even though I don't know Konami and most of its characters very well, I must confess that those few that I know have a certain fascination for me! My favorite is certainly Goemon from Mystical Ninja (I really love the two episodes of the saga published on N64), but I also find the placid player from the Power Pro Baseball series and Parodius' octopus very nice. As you may have understood by now, in Krazy Racers we will find all the Konami icons, who have been brought together here to give life to an ambitious and promising Mario Kart clone. The strategy is the same: put characters from your team (beloved by the public) on board go-karts, to make them race on circuits reproducing the settings of the various sagas. Each of the characters present has been retouched, obtaining a pleasant (and appropriate to the context) deformed appearance. The pretext behind which the new Konami production is hidden is the following: a certain Konami Man has invited the protagonists of the various house games to participate in a go-kart championship to decide who is the strongest mascot; obviously all those questioned did not feel like declining the invitation. 11", "date": "2001-07-12", "grade": null}
