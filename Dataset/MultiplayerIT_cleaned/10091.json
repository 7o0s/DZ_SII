And so the team led by Wraith is secretly sent to a neutral nation, with the aim of capturing a dangerous terrorist before it's too late. Should the agents end up in enemy hands, the US will deny any involvement. Better therefore to act with due caution, carrying out silent but lethal attacks and getting rid of the guards who control practically every inch of foreign soil. SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3 is just the latest episode of a series that has garnered wide acclaim on PSP and for which Slant Six Games made use of the consultancy of the American Special Forces. In the game we take on the role of Wraith, the leader of the expedition, and we can count on the support of three companions: Sandman (already seen previously), Toro and Raven. The team can be controlled via an interface (actually not very intuitive) that allows us to determine its movements, impose its ambush and coordinate its offensive maneuvers. The most classic situation, from this point of view, occurs in the presence of buildings to be cleaned: just approach a door and decide whether we will take care of the action ourselves or leave it to our colleagues. The advantages in the second case are obvious: the characters controlled by the AI can be injured, but we can put them back on track in a few moments; the same cannot be said of our alter ego, from this point of view more at risk. Something old, something new The peculiar characteristics of Fireteam Bravo are proposed again in this new episode without any alterations. We therefore have a control system that the uninitiated will certainly find cumbersome for a certain period of time, and which sees our character move and turn using only the analog stick of the PSP. The absence of a second stick has always been a major limitation for action games, and in some cases it was decided to entrust this role to the main buttons, used as a sort of large d-pad. In the product developed by Slant Six Games, however, none of this happens; and to remedy the shortcoming, an aiming system has been adopted that locks on targets automatically, leaving us only the task of pulling the trigger at the right moment. It is a solution on the one hand immediate, on the other inevitably simplistic, such as to make life really too easy. A manual aim control is possible (by activating the zoom via the left back button) and allows us to place headshots if necessary, but it proves to be completely useless during the most agitated situations. Very often the missions can be completed in silence, discreetly getting rid of the enemies until the objective of the turn is reached, but a misstep inevitably leads to open firefights. In such circumstances it is essential to find a shelter from which to lean to land your shots, but no ambush maneuver has been implemented for the occasion... and you really miss it, given that the approach ~touched and escape~ ends up making the experience very rough and lacking in depth. The arsenal at our disposal is subject to variations in the running, in the sense that we can abandon an unloaded weapon and pick up the one left by a killed enemy soldier, but in general the feeling of the weapons leaves something to be desired: the rifles end up all look a bit alike (apart from the precision ones of course), there is no such differentiation as to lead us to desire the discovery of a specific model. Fortunately, there is an upgrade system that between one mission and another allows us to improve the effectiveness of our equipment and that of team members, adding a pinch of variety to an otherwise rather flat situation. As far as artificial intelligence is concerned, our companions tend to reveal themselves too much but make up for it thanks to the effectiveness of their assaults, while the enemies generally behave in the same way, taking cover behind some objects but maintaining their position so that they can be centered smoothly as soon as they set out to shoot. Arms and baggage One of the strengths of Fireteam Bravo, since its inception, is the multiplayer mode; and the third episode is no exception, offering us an interesting cooperative mode for four players (each under the command of a team member, therefore) which literally transforms the stages by overcoming the limits of the AI, especially if you face the missions at the maximum level of difficulty. This is accompanied by five competitive modesive for sixteen players, enhanced by support for voice chat (using the appropriate headset, if your PSP model is not equipped with a microphone): ~Free for All~, or an ~all against all~; ~Suppression~, the classic team deathmatch; ~Tug of War~, capture the flag; ~Demolition~, or the classic ~find and destroy~; and finally ~Leader~, in which the objective is to eliminate the leader of the opposing team. No original mode, therefore, but you can't really complain: the games start in a few seconds and there are no particular problems due to the lag. Furthermore, the quality of the voice chat is more than fair. Also from a technical point of view, SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3 appears ~conservative~ and does not distort what has already been shown in the previous two episodes. The narration of the plot, definitely already heard but exciting, is entrusted to cutscenes of moderate quality, which also enjoy a good dubbing in Italian. The graphics of the actual game are functional to the action, without going further and indeed often arguing with the frame rate, even in situations of great tranquility. The quality of the polygonal models is average for PSP titles, even if the developers have managed to hide many ~edges~ and give the characters a good level of detail. The same can be said for the scenarios: it is not the variety that dominates, of course, but the backgrounds are quite populated and present decently made urban cross-sections, despite the usual problem of poorly defined textures. The snowy locations appear decidedly better, which at least stand out from a chromatic point of view. The sound sector contributes to the creation of a certain atmosphere thanks to certain sounds and music, but the noises of the weapons are not the best. We have already mentioned the Italian dubbing, very good.", "date": "2010-04-07", "grade": "7.9"}
