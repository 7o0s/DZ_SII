{"name": "The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-seven-deadly-sins-grand-cross-la-recensione.html", "text": "Given the distribution on Netflix all over the world, the anime series is one of the best known at the moment, for this reason many will be able to look carefully at this review of The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross for mobile platforms. It is, needless to say, a mobile RPG with gacha elements that No, wait! It's hard to believe but it's not quite the usual money-spike title built in half an hour by putting together an important license and a haphazard adaptation of the usual template of this genre of games. That is, many elements refer to that rigid canon that we know all too well by now, but it must be said that in this case the whole project has been studied in a very careful way and composed with a care that is difficult to find even in productions more high profile. Not that there is now such a clear distinction, but we are practically dealing with a ~console~ level game, so to speak, both in terms of technology and care in the presentation, which is immediately evident from the first minutes.The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross resumes the story of the first season of the animated series quite faithfully, but instead of relying exclusively on animated cutscenes taken directly from the anime (which are still present, but only in certain cases) reconstructs the fundamental moments of the series directly in the game engine, with truly excellent 3D graphics and cel-shading. This allows fans to retrace the known events with curiosity, to also notice the remix made by the developers, and also introduces even those who do not know the original to the interesting fantasy story of The Seven Deadly Sins in a very explanatory way. In essence, it is a question of helping Meliodas and his colorful companions in the fight against a corrupt regime, supported by the Holy Knights who hide their hunger for power behind apparently glorious paladin insignia. Not a small detail, the voices of the game are the original ones in Japanese but subtitles and written text are all in excellent Italian. For the rest, the general structure of the game remains the standard one of this genre: the narrative parts are interspersed with fights and the management of the characters, on which the inevitable gacha dynamics for the conquest of new fighters rests, but everything is inserted in a rather organic whole, which does not give (or at least not immediately) the impression of the classic money-grabbing trap. Then everything is surmounted by a truly high quality graphic system, which drags us into the world of The Seven Deadly Sins (already well characterized by itself) and captures us in its constant narration. Cards and knights There are exploratory phases that mainly have the function of moving the story forward, but which still allow a relative freedom of movement of the character within the settings, even if the exploration is severely limited by the path we have to follow. There is substantially a strong distinction between the narrative moments and the secondary activities and the clashes, which determine a large part of the game. The combat system is turn-based and is based on the use of cards, of different types also based on skills specifics of the characters deployed in the party. From a deck, three cards can be drawn per character, representing attacks, defensive poses, attack or defense ability modifiers, to be played one after the other. Two identical cards side by side join together to form the same card but of a higher level, which can be assimilated again to another identical one to obtain a three-star card. It is possible to drag the cards directly to carry out these evolution maneuvers, however consuming one shift of movement. Each character has two basic moves, a finisher and a combined finisher, which can be used according to the progress of the battle and it is obviously possible to set the auto-battle and speed up the action. The combat has some good strategic cues and the use of the cards, with the possibility of combining them, makes the clash quite stimulating even if we are not exactly in front of a very engaging system. The collection and management of characters represents the other main pillar of the gameplay of The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross. The summoning of the fighters takes place through the expenditure of gems, which can be obtained by advancing in the game or even by logging in daily, or obviously by purchasing them with real money. The characters are divided into the usual categories R (common), SR and SSR: with a round of 11 summons there is at least one SSR character guaranteed and in principle it does not seem tradopting an extremely expensive or somewhat fraudulent system, although obviously to climb the ranks faster and create an army of supersoldiers it is necessary to put a hand in the wallet, but this is not absolutely mandatory. The characters can be subsequently evolved, with the SSRs that can reach the maximum level UR while for each one it is possible to modify equipment and even the appearance, with a truly remarkable customization rate of the fighters. There are a good amount of secondary activities that can keep us active on several fronts: beyond the management of the party and the dialogues, Meliodas can think about the management of his inn together with Elizabeth and the Hawk piglet, there is a sort of mini-game linked to the kitchen and it is possible to take part to various timed events that are held on a regular basis, so there is a lot of activity in the game world which also goes well with the lively setting characteristic of the anime. There is also the PvP activity where the risk of running into pay to win is always very real in this kind of games, but it must be said that the balance is designed in such a way as not to make the gap between paying and free-to-pay players play so insurmountable as seen in other cases.", "date": "2020-03-11", "grade": "8.2"}
