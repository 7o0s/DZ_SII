However, the release of the second chapter of the Chair Entertainment series was awaited with particular interest, above all for the curiosity to see if the programmers had been able to strengthen an immediate, interesting but somewhat light gameplay formula. Immortal or not? It is evident how the commercial success of the first chapter suggested quite clearly that the way forward was more linked to improvement and evolution than to revolution. And in fact, already from the initial moments of Infinity Blade II, which doesn't get lost in preambles and chatter by throwing the player directly into the middle of the action, those who have had the opportunity to try the predecessor can recognize the familiarity of the game model studied by the American team ; in a nutshell, it is in fact a matter of facing a series of duels against disturbing creatures, the titans, until you reach a final boss, only to then start the process over in a cyclical way from the beginning. One, two, ten, twenty, fifty and more times. On paper a particularly repetitive system, which it actually is, but in practice transformed into a path of continuous growth, thanks to a whole series of surrounding elements that continuously stimulate the player. Components that in fact all come together fundamentally in the development of one's hero, a fearless knight without blemish who develops skills and strengthens his characteristics level after level. In fact, every battle won determines the collection of a certain number of experience points, which ultimately give the possibility to improve energy, strength, shield and magic; at the same time the accumulation of money allows you to buy better equipment, and the sum of these components outlines the management element of a bland rpg which essentially gives breath and guarantees longevity to the production of Epic Games. Yet everything just described was already present in the predecessor; the novelties lie in more or less important details, which however contribute to putting more meat on the fire. For example, now among the characteristics of the components of one's equipment there is also the possibility of setting magic stones, obviously also to be collected during the adventure, to add magical powers or attack or defense skills. A solution that favors a further level of personalization of one's character, and which stimulates the search for the rarest and most effective stones. In the same way, the combat system has also undergone a development, in this case even more marked; if in fact the basic ~Punch-Out~ formula rests on the need to dodge or block the enemies' attacks and then unleash the counterattack at the right moment via ~swipe~ on the screen, with Infinity Blade II Chair Entertainment has chosen to expand the possibilities of choice offered to the player by dividing weapons into three classes: light, heavy and double. The former work in exactly the same way as in the first chapter, therefore with the support of a shield to be used to block the opponent's blows. Those belonging to the second group instead require a two-handed grip, and favor power at the expense of mobility by preventing lateral dodges. Finally, the doubles enhance the speed and frequency of the blows, but depriving the shield which is instead replaced by the ability to duck. These are differences that affect the gameplay itself, and the possibility of always having your entire equipment available offers the user the choice between modifying his weapon based on the enemy to face, or rather perfecting fidelity to a single style of combat. More generally, the clashes with opponents are more rewarding and pleasant, in the face of the great work done in the animation side combined with the variety of both enemies and their attack techniques. The long road to victory Where Infinity Blade sinned was above all in the linearity of the path to be taken with each descendant, which in fact required repeating the same rooms of the castle with no real possibility of diverting or varying the path towards the God King. Tangible progress has been made with this continuation, and although it is still necessary to cross certain areas at each passage, the presence of crossroads at least partially alleviates thethe sense of repetitiveness; the protagonist tower of Infinity Blade II is discovered gradually offering real alternatives, different rooms and areas that even lead to different bosses. We have deliberately left the discourse related to technique at the bottom, because there is no doubt that it represents the main and most evident quality within the entire package; if Infinity Blade was already an excellent showcase of the capabilities of Apple devices, with this sequel it is evident that the bar has been raised even higher, to a level currently unattainable by any portable console. On systems based on the A5 chip then, Infinity Blade II can literally flex its muscles offering excellent textures and a whole range of graphics and lighting effects that offer a splendid testament to the incredible advances in current mobile technology. The fantasy setting then marries wonderfully with the polygonal brute force of the graphics engine, resulting in incredibly detailed characters and settings with complex architectures full of elements to admire, albeit largely static. On the iPad you notice a little aliasing which disappears on the retina display of the latest iPhones; it should also be noted that, thanks to a good optimization job, the game runs on all the devices on which the first episode ran, therefore from iPhone 3GS, iPad 1 and iPod Touch 4th generation upwards. Two words in conclusion for the plot, very light and just hinted at only with the aim of giving a minimum sense to the hero's journey.
