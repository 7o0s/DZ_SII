{"name": "Project Hospital", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-hospital-recensione.html", "text": "Is Project Hospital the new Theme Hospital? Lately the management genre has been misrepresented by the general public, who automatically connect it to the most popular casual junk for mobile systems and browsers, ending up not giving it any chance and even snubbing it. In short, many consider it a genre that is too simple and with a very low level of challenge. To increase the confusion, some major productions have also thought about it, such as Two Point Hospital and Jurassic World Evolution, which have renounced any complexity in favor of a gameplay that is all too prone to the most harmful trends of the genre. The truth is that we are faced with a major misjudgment, as Project Hospital is able to demonstrate. Video games have always tried to replicate the most diverse human activities by representing them through game mechanics. The closer a simulation gets to reality, the less it concedes to the casual player. A title like Two Point Hospital, which we mention because it has only been released for a very few months, evidently tries to hide behind the sympathy of its animations and a certain dynamism, a poor management side and not at all adhering to the real model it would claim to represent . Project Hospital behaves exactly the opposite of the SEGA title, putting the simulation first, at the risk of being difficult for newcomers to the genre. Gameplay The primary objective of Project Hospital is clear and direct: you need to found a clinic and make it grow until it becomes a real hospital. In addition to the tutorial, well done and essential for understanding the basic mechanics, it is possible to play in sandbox or campaign mode, with the latter simply requiring you to achieve certain objectives in pre-set scenarios. In both cases the player has three basic tasks to carry out: build or expand the clinic, designing the foundations, the rooms, the entrances and furnishing everything; hire specialized personnel to make the structure work and learn how to manage finances so as not to ruin everything. Unlike Two Point Hospital, Project Hospital aims at realism, ie hospital activity is simulated with greater rigor, as are the pathologies of the patients. All this translates into very different game dynamics, which allow the player to intervene on several levels. Let's go more concretely: the first rooms to be built to start a clinic are the waiting room for the sick, a doctor's office for the first diagnoses, a bathroom and some machinery, such as the X-ray one. When everything is ready, you have to hire the staff (doctors, laboratory technicians, administrative staff and cleaners) and then open the clinic. The diagnostic operations can be managed by the player, or automated, i.e. left completely to the doctors moved by artificial intelligence. Patients enter the clinic and diligently queue up for an initial interview, then, in case a doctor fails to diagnose a disease immediately, they can be sent to perform various analyzes (X-rays, MRIs, and so on). Only when the clinical picture is clear can adequate therapies be assigned. Everything is managed within a card which becomes the patient's virtual medical record. The more patients are successfully treated, the more the clinic's fame grows, the more it can build new diagnostic equipment and hire high-level doctors, thus attracting new patients eager for the best treatments. Every worker, whether doctor or janitor, has an overall value expressed in stars, determined by the average of his skills and his professional successes. Obviously each activity must be assigned to someone who has the right characteristics, otherwise it could become counterproductive for the clinic. Game interface and glitches Such complexity is also reflected in a functional but rather difficult interface, especially when you are still a virgin of Project Hospital. It is probably inevitable that this is the case, given the level of complexity it has to manage but, also thanks to an anonymous and very conventional graphic side, the first impact with the game can be traumatic. Fortunately, a few hours of practice are enough to master everything and thus be able to dedicate oneself without problems to building the hospital of one's dreams (so to speak). Note the high level of customization of every aspect with the editor, based on a tile system, which allows you to quickly create rooms of all types and furnish them according to need and taste (to do faster, you can use prefabricated rooms by developersori). For the rest it is really difficult to enclose the entire Project Hospital in these few lines, given the large number of systems that compose it. Unfortunately, in addition to the interface, there are other flaws that plague it that cannot be kept silent and that distance it from excellence. The two most obvious and annoying are the impossibility of rotating the maps, which in some cases creates problems with selecting objects in the rooms, and the font size, which is not exactly generous. Fortunately, the developers are very present and have already let the community know that they are working to resolve the reported problems. Let's hope they add some disease and some more machinery, so as to improve the simulation itself, and the masterpiece will be served. After all, we are certainly not talking about a multi-billion dollar production, so small imperfections are more than tolerable.", "date": "2018-11-22", "grade": "8.7"}
