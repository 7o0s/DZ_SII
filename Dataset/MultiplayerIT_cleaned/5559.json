{"name": "Speedrunners", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/166955-speedrunners-corse-a-perdifiato.html", "text": "Exactly twelve months have passed since we published our tried and tested Speedrunners, however the story of the highly acclaimed indie signed by DoubleDutch Games and tinyBuild has much more extensive roots, given that it began its Early Access journey on Steam in 2013 and its origins are related to a browser game of the same name (Speedrunner) released several years ago, also successfully converted to Xbox 360. During this long and constant process of maturation, blossomed into the conquest of international recognition such as the promotion to ~official eSport~ in the Electronic Sports League (2015), the award for best competitive multiplayer video game from Indie DB (2014) and the Gamer's Voice Award at the SXSW Gaming Award (2015), the title has continued to reap enthusiastic opinions especially among gamers, who have supported it with excellent sales - over a million copies placed - and an anthology of positive reviews on the Valve platform. The exciting ride towards build 1.0 is finally over, and Speedrunners is now purchasable on Steam in its definitive form for around 15 Euros. As you may have guessed from the premises, it is an absolutely unmissable work for all those who love to play in company. Competitive and hilarious, Speedrunners is one of the most successful multiplayer indies of recent years Burn the stages Kotaku colleague Alex Jones defined Speedrunners' competitive multiplayer as what ~Nintendo's Mario games should have had,~ a sibylline phrase that not only praises the DoubleDutch Games title, but underscores its gameplay excellence combining it with that of products whose refinement is the spearhead in the industry. Before analyzing its intrinsic characteristics, let's take a step back and briefly explain what Speedrunners is. As we wrote in our previous article, it is a rather peculiar game that is difficult to place in a classic genre, so much so that on Steam you find it linked to antithetical entries such as ~racing~, ~sport~, ~action~ and not to that platform, an important component of the play infrastructure anyway. In simple words, in the Dutch title you have to run inside closed courses dotted with obstacles, where the main purpose of the competition is to make your opponents bite the dust at least three times, perhaps with the help of various gadgets and bonuses. Easier said than done, especially when comparing players of equal cunning and skill. It is a fast-paced experience that offers maximum fun by competing online or against other friends sitting on the same sofa, up to a maximum of four opponents simultaneously (bots included). The game modes present are the inevitable Practice, which includes the Tutorial, the Solo Run and the VS. bots; Ranked Match with leagues to climb; the Quick Game, the Custom Game and the hilarious Local Party. With the update to the final version, a simple story mode was also added, which along the lines of the Mario Kart cups allows you to challenge your opponents in four different tournaments, with comics and drawn sequences to unlock. They are joined by the so-called Workshop, in which you can create your own custom levels to share with other players on Steam. To this complete but a little cumbersome editor, which brings the number of tracks on which it is possible to compare practically to infinity, another one has been added dedicated to the customization of the ~Turbo trails~, released by the characters when they activate the relative bonus with the right pad trigger. It is a nice feature that is enjoying great success, also because it even allows you to sell your own creations. At the time of writing there are over ten thousand levels created by players, which add up to the sixteen official ones created by the development team; after years of testing and the numerous refinement processes they have undergone, the latter are distinguished by a superb level design, perfectly balanced for the challenges of eSports at the highest level. Exceptional cast Among the peculiar characteristics of Speedrunners there is the bizarre roster of runners, a selection of improbable and bizarre superheroes capable of snatching profusion of smiles for the grotesque design but above all for the very successful animations. Among others we find the classic runner, or the ~Speedrunner~ translated from the homonymous flash game, a man with the head of a deer, a cat, a raptor woman, guys with chicken costumes, shark costumes and so on; a ~team~ that can be replenished by climbing with experience -there are several characters and costumes to unlock - or by purchasing the inevitable DLCs, for the occasion two packages dedicated to successful youtubers including the famous Pewdiepie. Once you have selected your alter ego, you move on to voting on the map and customizing active objects and modifiers, complete with presets related to ranked matches, tournaments and so on. For example, sharp spikes, instant death or some of the gadgets that characterize the sparkling gameplay of the title can be implemented or disabled. The grappling hook, to be used on specific walls, is the most important tool in the game and knowing how to master it makes a huge difference in the economy of the games, as well as expertly managing the jump (A), the slide (Y), the climbing on walls and the aforementioned turbo racing. The joypad, even if it is possible to enjoy the title with the keyboard, is particularly recommended. Among the various usable gadgets, which are collected in the same way as Mario Kart bonuses, there are fireballs, rockets, crates, shock waves, hooks and more, objects that can guarantee a significant tactical advantage when used at the right moment. Given the randomness of the bonuses, even luck can make its (small) contribution to victory. In addition to the opponents and the intrinsic dangers of the level such as chasms, laser beams and the aforementioned spikes, the player must also pay attention to the time, given that after a certain amount the stage begins to inexorably shrink, further complicating life for latecomers but also for players head, who must anticipate the appearance of objects and obstacles. The final result, as underlined several times and as you can see from the video of the arcade, is a real hoot that will keep you glued to the joypad for many hours. Even on the toaster The delicious gameplay and the incredibly successful competitive recipe are accompanied by a simple and clean technical sector, where the work done on the two-dimensional (stylized) graphics is especially appreciable in the animations, specific to each runner and extremely fluid. Each official stage also has its own theme, and levels such as Zoo, Theme Park, Swift Peaks, Nightclub and Library, not to mention the timeless initial stage called Metro, are rich in details and sometimes embellished with animated elements. The graphic options are practically absent, and the only adjustable items are the global quality (normal or low), the resolution and the vertical sync; after all, as DoubleDutch Games ironized in the minimum system requirements on Steam, the title could also run on a toaster. The sound effects and the soundtrack are also very pleasant, which over time has been enriched with new songs to accompany the eclectic - and for some time unique - main theme of the work. Among the flagships of Speedrunners there is undoubtedly also the netcode, truly exceptional in terms of solidity and stability; it guarantees very fluid matches without latency problems in the vast majority of cases, a practically essential condition for the type of game, recently awarded the title of official eSport in the Electronic Sports League.", "date": "2016-04-21", "grade": "S.V."}
