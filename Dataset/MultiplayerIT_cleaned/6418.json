This was possible thanks to the work done by the guys from NetherRealm Studios on the reboot of the series, initially released in 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Without distorting the concept that has always been the basis of the brand too much, the development team managed at the time to combine graphics that exploited the third dimension with gameplay anchored to the more traditional expression of the fighting game, then leveraging on a certain fan service, a considerable dose of violence and excellent playability without excessive technicalities to relaunch the franchise in a big way . Precisely from these bases NetherRealm Studios wanted to start again for the creation of the first next-gen chapter (porting to PC and previous generation consoles will instead be made by High Voltage Studio), set starting from the end of the ninth chapter of the regular series, for then embrace the 25 years following those events, with the civil war between Kotal Kahn and Mileena for the throne of the Outer Kingdom, the threat to the Earth posed by Quan Chi and his army of undead, with the cumbersome presence in the background of the figure of a not quite tame Shinnok. So here is our review of Mortal Kombat X. Mortal Kombat X definitively pushes the famous fighting game series to new horizons of glory Fighters and gameplay: old and new massacres Following the storyline that shuttles between the present and the past, the Mortal Kombat X roster offers old characters such as Johnny Cage, Sub-Zero and Mileena, and new faces such as D'Vorah, Ferra and Torr and Erron Black, just to name a few . It consists of twenty-four fighters plus Goro for those who pre-ordered the game, a number destined to grow with the various DLCs. But despite appearances, even the existing one already guarantees users a good variety of choices, given that it is possible to ~customize~ the fighting style of each character according to one's needs and tastes. Instead of adding a multitude of fighters that tend to be similar to each other, in fact, the developers have opted for a formula that plans to provide each of those present with a selection of three different styles, which vary their combos, special moves and sometimes even versatility . In this way, players who often prefer to use a certain fighter can access different sets of moves than the classic ones, freeing themselves from having to resort to another character to try a new, more functional style in the match. In doing so, moreover, the phenomenon of counterpicking is eliminated, or in any case limited, i.e. the act of selecting a wrestler only because his characteristics are suitable for ~neutralizing~ those of an opponent. In terms of gameplay Mortal Kombat X maintains the structure of its predecessor, with a style strongly anchored to a certain spectacularity and a massive dose of violence, sometimes caricatured, but with a slightly higher level of difficulty and a frame rate locked to sixty frames for second. This is a very important element, because it directly affects the combat, which flows away pleasantly thanks to the excellent response to the commands, the general fluidity and obviously a whole series of other factors that embellish the mechanics by giving it greater depth. Among these is the physics of impacts, much improved and capable of restoring the feeling of really dealing with real bodies and violent clashes. Likewise, the implementation of running once again gives players the opportunity to try new ways in approaching certain phases of the match, and in trying new combinations of moves. Provided you don't abuse it, since every time you have to pay attention to the appropriate resistance meter which is located under the character's health bar, and which drops dramatically. To make the experience more complete, especially if always compared to that of the predecessor, there is the welcome introduction of interactivity with some elements of the scenario, which can be used to your advantage by pressing R1 when they light up. For example, in the Dead Forest it is possible to cling to the branches to swing and try to gain momentum for an attack, use them to climb over the enemy and escape one of his combos, or detach them from the trunk and use them as a melee weapon. Among other things, confirming the ironic violence that permeates every aspect of the game, there are scenarios where it is even possible to grab and throw a poor old woman or a monk against the opponents: this function canHowever, it can be disabled whenever you want before each match. The new elements just described are joined by all the others, from the devastating X-Ray, attacks that can be activated after filling the usual three notches of the appropriate indicator, with which the vital energy of the challenger can be reduced by 25-30%, literally breaking him the bones, to the revived Brutality, to be performed in particular conditions to mutilate the opponent who is now annihilated and close to death, and thus immediately put an end to the fight. Then the classic Fatalities are inevitable which, with the now famous cry of ~Finish Him/Her!~, allow the winner to make havoc of the defenseless body of the enemy, with often crazy solutions such as Johnny Cage imitating the Jack Nicholson of The Shining or the closing of others with a nice selfie of the scene. In short, thanks to the right mix of old and new elements (in relation to the reboot), in the game of irons on the fire to make the meetings always different and exciting, there is really a lot of it, and the fans will hardly have anything to complain about for months. Playstation 4 trophies Mortal Kombat X on PS4 offers 61 trophies divided into 54 bronze, 5 silver, 1 gold and 1 platinum. To get them you have to compete in both offline and online modes, for example completing the Story mode, winning a match by time out or a Tower Challenge. Or use all variants of each character, perform fifty Brutalities, reach level 50 in all factions or in a specific one, and so on, up to the coveted platinum, which is obtained by unlocking all the others. The new generations In our examination of the NetherRealm Studios title, we have obviously not forgotten the game modes. From this point of view, the product offers everything and more to fans, with different areas for single and multiplayer play. A primary role is also exercised here, as in the ninth episode of the saga, the story mode. The latter is in fact quite compelling and offers gamers the opportunity to have fun in a real adventure with a cinematic cut. It is here that the plot of the game is told, that a logical sense is given to the presence of old and new characters in the roster, that one is given the opportunity to delve into their history, even through flashbacks, and to learn about the tragic fate of some former wrestlers of the series. Contrary to what is usually seen in other products of the genre, in fact, users fight following a plot and interpreting different characters, with the battle sequences interspersed with videos complete with interactive scenes with the classic QTEs, which tell the events as if it were a movie. A ~film~ not very long to tell the truth, which can be completed in just over two hours of play and a few too many deaths at the Hard difficulty level, but all the same nice to experience and well designed considering that after all we are talking about a fighting game and not an adventure title. And then play the role of Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade and other old acquaintances, or those of the young people of the Special Forces team Cassie Cage (daughter of the two characters mentioned above), Takeda Takahashi (Kenshi's son), Jacqui Briggs (Jackson Briggs' daughter) and Kung Jin (Kung Lao's younger cousin) is priceless. But Mortal Kombat X is also characterized by a myriad of other game modes, such as for example the Tower of Challenges, within which it is possible to select five different types of ~competitions~: in addition to the one called Klassic, which refers to the traditional arcade, there are variants for strong hearts called Endless and Survivor, in addition to the inevitable skill tests on strength and luck, which in the latter case use a series of random modifiers or modifiers programmed by the user himself to condition the progress of the clash. Dulcis in fundo, there is the Krypta, the interactive environment where you can unlock costumes, moves and much more with the gold tokens acquired by winning matches in the other modes, with the most important novelty being the presence of particular secret trunks that appear inside it only at certain times, in relation to the Clock of the Krypta, which the player must be able and lucky to cross and open in time. The game modes are therefore largely borrowed from those present in the reboot, but as for the gameplay, also in this case there is no shortage of novelties, especially related to some network functions. In this sense there is Living Towers, a sort of evolution of the usual Tower of Challenges with however dynamic game conditions, that is, which are updated periodically and automatically via an Internet connection. Within thisIn this mode, as in the other, you can choose to face a series of tests of variable difficulty, where each battle is accompanied by modifiers that alter the battle conditions, from those that slow down time or speed it up, giving rise to extremely amusing moments, to those that make players immune from being knocked down, that poison with every hit, that start with penalties or advantages, and so on. But compared to the original, here it is possible to do it in three different towers, each of which has different updating characteristics: there is in fact the hourly one, the one that does it once a day and the other main one that changes weekly, perhaps in occasion of some special event organized by the developers. Warring factions Another new, very interesting Mortal Kombat X mode is the one entitled Factions. In this area users can choose, not necessarily, to be part of one of the five groups available in the game, namely Black Dragon, The Brotherhood of Shadow, Lin Kuei, Special Forces and White Lotus, with the possibility of contributing to its success through a series of performances both offline and online. Every week a new war will be started, and users who have decided to be part of a group will be asked to complete some challenges or achieve particular objectives, such as winning a tournament, a one-on-one fight on the network, performing a series of Fatalities in single mode, and so on, acquiring points that will replenish the general ones of your team, allowing it to excel over the others. At the end of the week, a winner in the Faction War will be determined based on the points that have been accumulated, and in return the player will receive special rewards related to the faction to which he has joined, including exclusive finishers. In short, any action performed within Mortal Kombat X earns money, experience points or points for the Faction. For the rest, speaking of usability of the service during battles, the netcode seems to work quite well, and we rarely encountered lag and stability problems during our test, living an experience all in all much faster, smoother and easier than multiplayer online of the reboot. However, we must also add for fairness that when we carried out our tests there were very few connected users, since we worked with a version of the game provided to us by the distributor before its release on the market. Also for these reasons it was not possible for us to try some methods or verify the effectiveness of the system that supervises the regularity of the matches, punishing with a Quitality those players who purposely disconnect and abandon the matches, rewarding those who suffer such impropriety with the victory. As for the technical front, Mortal Kombat X confirms the good impressions we had during our tests. The characters are well characterized and even the newcomers, some more, some less, enjoy a fairly inspired design. The qualitative level of the polygonal models is good, the textures perhaps do not fully exploit the hardware potential of Playstation 4, but all in all they are fine and there is the icing on the cake of the (sensitive) aesthetically visible differences depending on the fighting style adopted . Their animations and the various game settings, both old and new, are more convincing, ranging from the Kovo pier lashed by the waves of a stormy sea, complete with a vessel stranded among the rocks and corpses splashing out of the water, to the ruins of destroyed cities, jungles, dead forests, and so on. Some of these scenarios are really fascinating, visually full of details and atmospheric effects, even if in a couple of arenas we noticed that some backdrops are slightly less defined than others. However, it is fair to underline that in these cases these are details that can only be noticed by staring at them for a long time, distracting oneself from the fight, and which end up in the background before the general goodness of their design. If anything, the real flaw is that the arenas available are decidedly few, although some of them exist to unlock alternative versions. In any case, everything is corroborated by the excellent solidity of the frame rate which, on the PlayStation 4 version we tested, is practically nailed to sixty frames per second, and practically never shows an uncertainty in the 1080p resolution. except in the intro sequence and another story mode cutscene. As for the audio sector, nothing to complain: the title reveals itself o", "date": "2015-04-14", "grade": "9.0"}
