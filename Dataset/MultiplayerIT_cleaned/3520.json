{"name": "Blair Witch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blair-witch-recensione.html", "text": "Talking about Blair Witch through a review means dealing with a phenomenon that has influenced low-budget cinema by putting the camera in the hands of the protagonists. A brilliant intuition that in 1999 gave birth to a sub-genre halfway between fake documentary and amateur film, a trend still in vogue capable of creating engaging experiences with minimal expense. For the first chapter of the series, just to clarify, we are talking about an investment of 60,000 dollars which yielded something like 248.6 million dollars, guaranteeing the franchise a long history that takes us up to the 2016 film, a half flop which made many think of the definitive decline of the myth of the Blair witch. This at least until the appearance of Blair Witch, the new effort of the guys who have dealt with the valid Layers of Fear and the peculiar Observer. A nice resume for a first-person horror adventure which, based on a brand new story, promises to change significantly depending on the player's actions and integrates basic elements of the franchise into the gameplay, including video cameras, wooden idols and terrifying murders. A faithful companion and an invaluable camcorder The curtain rises on a car traveling along a highway surrounded by trees, in 1996, in the middle of the forest. Driving is Ellis, an ex-cop whose stormy past peeps out of a phone call from what appears to be the ex-girlfriend. Maybe things can be sorted out, but for now the goal is to find a recently missing boy and luckily in the passenger seat is the faithful Bullet, a dog with an extraordinary nose that can make all the difference in a situation of this type. Thus begins our adventure, with an effective cut scene that refers to the imagery of a certain type of horror and immediately makes clear the importance of the four-legged companion in the mechanics of Blair Witch, a title that gives the dynamics investigations a dominant importance while including fights, desperate escapes and various puzzles both mechanical, with fuses and locks, and environmental, sometimes linked to the possibility of activating the night vision on the camera. Finding it, among other things, opens the door to an interesting mechanic: the boxes marked by a red part in fact allow you to manipulate reality. Locking the playback at a certain point brings a certain scene back to that exact moment in time, thus allowing us to obtain objects or open doors and remove obstacles thanks to an elegant solution that uses videos made with discreet effectiveness to blend the oppressive atmosphere with the game mechanics. Nothing new, mind you, but part of a title that focuses more on the atmosphere than on the challenge, trying to involve the player in a flow of events on the one hand malleable with their own behavior and on the other so fast and alienating as to make difficult to come up with any strategy. It is no coincidence that there is no trace of an interface on the screen, excluding an indicator that appears when our animal companion barks, indicating dangers, finds and so on. Sometimes Bullet acts alone, but there's a whole menu of actions that allow us to take advantage of what is a real companion, a character capable of warning us of dangers, following tracks and even frightening us. Hence the need to cuddle or scold him, both to guarantee his efficiency and to prevent him from getting into trouble. Therefore also essential as a psychological foothold, Bullet is the sidekick of a protagonist in difficulty, a man who tries to take control of his life by doing his job as a policeman, but has to face a long series of inner demons that make it difficult to distinguish the border between madness, suggestion and the supernatural. Let alone then in the middle of a dense forest which, moving on to the technical side, enjoys an excellent realization, starting from the sound sector. Crunching branches, thuds, moans and forest noises are felt to the bone and this even with a simple pair of stereo headphones. Here and there some volume and dynamic track management problems emerge, but overall things work decidedly well starting from the innumerable verses of our dog, a companion created with extreme care with the express purpose of making us become attached to him. Among other things, Bullet can also be useful in combat which in some ways recalls that of Alan Wake. The presences that haunt the forest in fact react to the light of the torch, but compared to those of the title Remedy they are lightning-fast and translucent, which makes them difficult to frame. Hence the usefulness of the dog which should indicate the position of the creatures and sometimes succeeds. In other cases instead everything is done decisely confused, which generates a bit of frustration but also transforms a fight that is not too difficult, like all the mechanics of Blair Witch designed not to interfere too much in the rhythm of the narrative, into a moment of pure anguish. A fluid experience that puts the spotlight on the psyche Blair Witch does not bet on the challenge, except in very rare cases, but leaves us time to savor a story made up of messages, finds and radio communications, with the pace increasing when the protagonist's disturbances enter the field and when a reality beyond the imaginable it gets confused with anxiety crises, macabre finds and memories made of unrecognizable faces that re-emerge from an increasingly dark past. It's a pity that the boundary between the dreamlike and the supernatural is all too clear to the player, but we are talking about an openly horror title, even if attentive to the psychological side both in terms of themes and in rhythm. The same inventory, which allows us to access fundamental objects such as the camera and the radio, hides a lot of information related to the human dimension of a story that does not rely too much on easy-going jump scares or action sequences. And it's fortunate, also because when the action coincides with visions dictated by the fusion between panic attacks and the paranormal, it shows its side from a technical point of view, losing the magic that instead distinguishes the splendid forest of the Black Hills. The polygonal mass is certainly not high, the areas are rather small, the textures are not all of excellent quality and even Bullet, although characterized by animations so effective as to make anyone become attached to his muzzle, shows his side to some criticism. But the vegetation is thick, the fog thick, the water lively, the lights realistic and the infamous PacMan effect, which makes us reappear on the other side of an unfinished area blocking us without having to use too many forced natural barriers, it works quite well , placing us in the middle of a credible and suggestive nature. Too bad that in this case it is haunted by presences and nightmares that drag Ellis into a frenzy of dream sequences, increasingly detailed flashbacks, memories of innocent victims, mistakes, war, domestic violence, a forest that spans the decades, demonstrations that raise one often cloaked in foliage and memories of fallen comrades. Enough, thanks to an excellent English dubbing, to really confuse the protagonist and the player, both faced with an enormous sense of guilt that becomes the story itself. A visceral feeling that goes beyond the screen and becomes resentment, familiar to all and tangible vector of a long finale, a descent into hell that perhaps lingers a little too much on the loops, blocking us for a long time in a couple of scenarios, but it is effective in confusing us and surprises us with a couple of memorable scenes. However, it does not shine on a technical level, as anticipated weak point of various dream and action sequences which among other things also suffer in terms of gameplay, often approximate. Of course, these are side elements designed to confuse the senses and break the rhythm, but they occupy a large part of the experience in a title that, respecting the promise of lasting approximately 6 hours, is not particularly long-lived. However, it costs 30 euros and guarantees a certain replayability, even partial thanks to the possibility of copying the automatic save on five slots, proposing a formula with multiple endings with a structure that is anything but trivial. In fact, we almost never find ourselves faced with dry choices, even if there are a couple of explicit and rather dramatic decisions, but we are called to face the consequences of our actions evaluated in an absolutely non-mechanistic way. In short, it is not enough to cuddle Bullet and answer all the calls to arrive at a less dramatic ending than the one we found ourselves facing, hit in the stomach by a title that was sometimes confusing and often fluctuating, both in terms of rhythm and execution, but capable of hitting the right keys.", "date": "2019-08-30", "grade": "7.8"}
