{"name": "Windbound", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/windbound-recensione.html", "text": "Survival The incipit of Windbound, the protagonist of this review, is quite canonical for survival titles. The protagonist of the story that you will experience is Kara, a navigator who is thrown out of her boat during a storm. Awakened alone on an island, with no trace of her clan, she must quickly adapt to the hostile environment to survive. Around her there is only nature and with the trusty knife, which is the only weapon and tool that can be used from the beginning of the game, you will have to craft materials including bamboo, wood and metals to be able to resist the pitfalls that lie ahead . You will be forced to hunt to be able to continue living and resist the pangs of hunger, as well as forced to explore the beautiful and evocative waters of the large circular procedural map surrounded by the storm. Among swamps, deserts, forests, rocks, air currents and wild creatures, you will have to be able to untie the knots of an enigma much bigger than you, a story about creation and cooperation, battles and gods, which will take you to travel not only on the water but also within yourself, finding in the depths of the similarities with everyday reality, the motivation to be able to smile. Crafting and choices As soon as you wake up on the island you will find yourself lost, just know that. There is no real tutorial, there are no on-screen indicators that tell you what and how to do. Nothing. It will be you and your intuition, which will be the true companion for all 5 days during which the game is spread. The first thing to understand is precisely this: what to do. The game itself does not help in this sense as mentioned, so armed with your knife you will have to explore the islet on which you woke up to try to figure out how to advance. This is precisely the heart of the whole gaming experience, the customization and uniqueness of exploration. Yes, it is true, the materials and the creatures will be more or less always the same for everyone, but how to approach them, how to use the resources collected and how to kill the various enemies, that depends on you. Fortunately, the developers take us from the point of view of progress, putting us in front of a particular structure on which to climb in order to begin our journey in search of sea shells collected on their top. Practically the aim of each game day is to navigate and explore the map in search of the 3 structures that contain as many shells, and then reach the main altar in which to insert the artifacts and discover the secrets that are hidden in the main hub where you will be transported. Once the first fronds of grass and the first timber have been collected, the thing to do is build the trusty boat to be able to navigate and understand what may have happened to your clan. Initially you can only build the simple basic boat and once you get on board you will find yourself in the boundless expanse of water, rowing towards the unknown accompanied by a very apt melody and which we found ourselves particularly appreciating, especially after several hours of play. Opening the map with the touchpad (PS4 version) you will realize the vastness that surrounds you but above all one thing, the absence of any direction indicators or objectives. The only thing you will have available is your directional icon and the portion of the location discovered and explored up to that moment. The rest is up to your intuition and your gaze. The hand-shaped towers that contain the shells to be collected are very often far from each other and almost never reachable by the eye until you get close to them. You understand well that the exploration is quite staid and slow, being the map really large and in the total absence of fast travel points. We also spent a good 30 minutes sailing without knowing where to go in search of the last (or even the first) shell. Obviously the speech is particular, since the experience is based on personal choices. While sailing, you can easily stop on this or that island to look for any new material or health or stamina upgrades, respectively represented by small altars with red or yellow stones. . Once you have mastered the game system you will find yourself faced with various opportunities, such as being able to build a more resistant boat or a stronger weapon, you can cook the meat of enemies hunted on fire or you can even create armor for the invisibility. In short, there is plenty of customization and depth for all tastes. Obviously survival and pitfalls could also lead you to death. Once you wake up, get ready for arude awakening, given that the 5 lives studios have decided to take everything away from you, especially the shells, so as to have to start the day over again and making the exploration and search for resources more and more prudent. Progress and problems As we have mentioned above therefore, the game is divided into 5 main chapters, the days, during which you have to collect the 3 shells around the map in order to then be able to move to the main hub. This hub, a sort of alternative dimension, is represented as a small square where you will wake up, with a fresco on the sides that slowly, completing the days, will reveal the story hidden behind the events you are experiencing. Once the fresco relating to the day that has just ended has been revealed, you will then have to get on your boat again to face a crossing with increasingly greater pitfalls, until you reach a sanctuary surrounded by calm waters, where you can buy upgrades for Kara. The currency used to be able to make the only purchase that you will have available for each single chapter, are the marine fragments, collectibles that can be traced randomly within the game map, normally enclosed within some particular menir or in vases break. Once you have purchased the desired upgrade, which can be an indestructible bow as well as greater resistance to poison, you will have to navigate through the portal behind the sanctuary to start the next day, and so on until the fifth day, in which you will have to face the more difficult and certainly spectacular crossing. But let's get to the sore points. The game suffers from several bugs due to missing polygonal interpenetrations and pure programming problems. We found ourselves several times stuck in some rocks with Kara screaming as if she were falling from a skyscraper, or sometimes we were unable to climb a certain handhold because the animation shots did not allow us to do it, even if it was obviously within reach . The artificial intelligence of the creatures that inhabit the game world, apart from some cases, is not the most advanced in the videogame landscape. Very often we found ourselves faced with animals that instead of attacking us, turned on themselves or made immense turns to attack us, forcing us to wait for them to be able to kill them. Another sore point is exactly what a strong point should be, the boat. Let's understand, it's great to sail carefree accompanied by the sea breeze, but when we made the mistake of mounting one of the sails we could build on our boat, it all turned into a frustrating and, if possible, even more cumbersome and slow experience. Sailing is profoundly different from simply rowing to advance. The developers wanted to apply an almost more simulative structure than the rest of the production, inserting 4 commands to modify the sail and try to advance, but making everything difficult to understand and even more complex to manage. In theory you should take advantage of the current to inflate the sail, but most of the time you find yourself against a rock or stuck in the middle of the sea trying to turn it around in a thousand ways without result. In addition, we have never been able to build the keel, we don't know if it is due to some other code problem or due to our own lack. Once the materials were obtained, there was never a way to be able to place it. The worst note, however, is unfortunately the slowness of everything. Windbound is a really slow game, albeit short-lived, not offering the player the entertainment that an open world survival should have. Navigation is often linked to simply pressing the back button to advance, waiting to be able to capture some interesting structure or island to be able to explore, but this process can also last tens of minutes, empty, filled only by the OST and the sound of the sea. Not that this is a bad thing in general, but since Windbound isn't a simulation, we didn't expect to have to experience so much downtime. From a stylistic point of view, however, the title is a small design jewel. It has a style that, perhaps deliberately, recalls the fantastic Disney Atlantis and takes up the colors of Oceania, another work by the same production house. Kara is really well characterized and modeled equally, the settings are very colorful and the cartoon style that permeates everything makes it really enjoyable. The water then, true companion throughout the adventure, even if not as realistic as we are used to seeing it for example in Sea of Thieves or Assassin's Creed, does its job managing to remaingive us a very good sensation between currents and waves.", "date": "2020-09-05", "grade": "7.0"}
