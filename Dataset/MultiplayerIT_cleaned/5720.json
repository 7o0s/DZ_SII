The excellent intuition of parkour, the attention to detail and the relaunch of the night phase as an element capable of truly frightening the player are all aspects that have contributed to the consecration of the title released last year, and whose experience has been enriched through several post-launch updates. The latest DLC, The Following, however, is the most important and ambitious; not only for a mere matter of numbers, but also and above all for the introduction of a new, vast scenario and a completely new way to explore it: get behind the wheel of a powerful buggy. In short, the last taboo of Dying Light is skipped, in which you could do everything except drive, and new, interesting elements are put on the table. Will they be enough to entice us to buy the expansion? The Following adds further elements of interest to an already very valid product Get out of here The narrative incipit of The Following takes us out of Harran, in a valley where people who are immune to the contagion are said to live. Armed with his usual unwavering determination, Kyle Crane decides to follow the directions given to him by a dying man and finds himself, after a quick tour in the sewer pipes, breathing a whole new air. In fact, a boundless expanse opens up before his eyes, on the edge of which stand impenetrable mountains and lakes, while in the middle, scattered here and there, there are settlements inhabited by survivors; all united by an unshakable faith in the ~Mother~, a mysterious woman who seems to possess the power to stem the virus, and who has actually ~miracled~ several people. To get close to this figure with otherworldly traits we will have to earn the trust of his followers, completing a series of missions of various kinds: from eliminating groups of marauders to restoring water systems, from transporting objects to rescuing lost survivors, from the destruction of the nests of the terrible Nocturnes to the clearing of buildings that can thus become safe havens, where perhaps we can hole up when it gets dark. To act as a glue to these mechanisms there is of course the great novelty of this expansion, a very nervous and fun to drive buggy, capable of darting at full throttle on asphalt, dirt roads and even tall grass, running over zombies as needed and providing us, in all cases, a fundamental means of being able to cover large distances in a relatively short time. Between old and new The Following's map is practically twice the size of that of Dying Light, although several areas are in fact desolate, were it not for the constant presence of undead belonging to all the types seen in the base game: slow and fast, military from great resistance or agents in decontamination suits, passing through spitters and boomers as well as the prodigious tanks. It is no coincidence that to deal with the expansion you need to have a character of level eighteen or higher, otherwise the challenge would be really too difficult. The country lanes often lead to the discovery of hidden places, perhaps stakeouts where it is possible to find resales, as well as a central urban part in which to use up the well-known repertoire of acrobatic movements of which the protagonist is capable. Also in this situation the use of the grappling hook proves to be fundamental, although using it ends up diminishing the value of the puzzle solving applied to the platform component; while all the stealth mechanics remain valid in the approach with the living dead, a factor also emphasized by one of the new weapons, the crossbow, as lethal as it is silent. We have noticed outposts identical to each other, but beyond this there is great variety in the landscapes of The Following, a convincing design that always remains at the service of the gameplay, and which from this point of view carries on the excellent work done with the original title. Together is better As highlighted in our test, Dying Light: The Following includes a series of challenges starring the buggy, to be faced both in single player and in the already tested cooperative multiplayer. A whole series of measures to prevent incorrect or solitary behavior by other users remains valid (see the possibility of sharing the vehicle or not), but as always the best possible experience can only be guaranteed by a minimum of organization with friends. Otherwise we get angry The introduction of the buggy revives an attension for the booty which, in the early stages, becomes almost maniacal. The car deteriorates exactly like the tools in our arsenal, its mechanical and electronic components can be upgraded, but it must necessarily be repaired when the impact damage starts to get serious. Being short of screws at this juncture proves to be a misfortune, and in fact we spent a lot of time repeating one of the first missions precisely because the car was damaged when loading the checkpoint, preventing us from darting towards our goal respecting a countdown. Having become aware of the maintenance needs of the vehicle, as well as the need to constantly refuel it (although it never runs dry), we will often have to stop along the road to search abandoned vehicles for the components and petrol we need to be able to continue on calm. The most spectacular upgrades, above all the assembly of weapons such as mines, flamethrowers or blades, will materialize according to the terms of a new skill tree, ~guide~, which we will be able to unlock by completing small challenges as we wander around the map. However, don't expect to be able to transform the buggy into an armored car, much less to be able to do it before the final phase of the adventure, which will keep you busy for about fifteen hours if you decide not to try your hand at all the optional quests. Performance and visual rendering The setting of The Following opened up many new possibilities, but also the risk of falling into the generic. Fortunately, Techland handled it very well, managing to design a convincing scenario, diluted in content for obvious reasons but captivating thanks to its many facets, from the already mentioned urban section to the mountains and caves, passing through the peak in which is the sanctuary of the Mother. There is so much to explore, both on foot and by car, and the rendering of the vegetation seemed excellent to us, thanks to the effects that constantly ~wet~ the view or dazzle us. However, we experienced one of the most evocative sequences at night: having lingered on the way between one mission and another, with the looming darkness, we decided to hole up at the top of a hunting tower and wait there for the first light of dawn. dawn, observing the dynamic changes of light and climate. At one point a sudden rain stormed the lands, illuminating them with lightning, while in the distance the Nocturnes emitted their unmistakable cry. How many times does it happen, in a video game, that you are really afraid of the unknown? On the performance front, the PC version we tested performed very well, clinging to sixty frames per second at 1080p, with all effects maxed out (except shadows) and v-sync turned on, never a hitch. not even during the most frenetic and fast phases. Of course, no progress has been made on certain adjustments compared to the original edition of Dying Light, and in fact there is always an unidentified antialiasing to soften the contours of the polygonal models. The sound sector also boasts an excellent dubbing in Italian, with very few flaws.", "date": "2016-02-09", "grade": "8.5"}
