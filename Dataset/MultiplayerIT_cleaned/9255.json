An unclear, subjective and sometimes contradictory approval phase certainly doesn't help, leading the most unfortunate game developers to have their game rejected after months of intense work. Although many turn up their noses, in the end there are obviously few who decide to transfer their applications to other platforms, while most prefer to accept the requests of the Cupertino managers and make sometimes drastic changes. This is the case with Snuggle Truck, a small and nice game created by the US team Owlchemy Labs which, despite being approved on the App Store, has seen the satirical message that has probably accompanied its development since the beginning be completely distorted. 'start. Smuggling cuddles Initially presented as Smuggle Truck (smuggling truck), the title was supposed to be a funny and ironic driving game in which to transport a group of immigrants across the US border, avoiding dangers and bumps along the way. In short, the guys from Owlchemy Labs wanted to satirize a phenomenon that our Yankee cousins know very well, but evidently in Cupertino the idea must have seemed so inappropriate as to block its release. The version that later appeared on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad is characterized by the same and identical game mechanics, but presented in a totally different way. After a subtle but very unfortunate name change, Snuggle Truck (truck of cuddles), leaves the group of desperate illegrants across the border, replacing them with colorful and cuddly stuffed animals. The player's goal this time will be to lead them to the stuffed animal zoo safely, making sure that they are not tipped over by transport. It is a trick that has allowed the developers to launch the title without changing even a single line of code, but which has certainly made it less irreverent and original than before. At least the gameplay has remained unchanged: each level offers a short path full of bumps, sudden climbs and obstacles which, if tackled with excessive speed, risk causing the unfortunate passengers to fall. The player will thus have to adjust the speed, accelerating or slowing down, respectively by tapping on the right or left of the screen, and tilting the iPhone to move the weight of the truck forward or backward. This proves to be essential especially on the occasion of the numerous jumps, since an imperfect and violent landing could ruin the entire level in an instant. To access the next level, just lead even one animal to its destination, but Snuggle Truck encourages you to replay and improve through a system of trophies assigned for each run. These, in addition to being an excellent supplement to the unlockable achievements on Game Center, are also indispensable for accessing the more advanced and complex courses. And it is precisely here that the game finally becomes interesting, abandoning those too simple and banal first levels and challenging the player in tortuous ups and downs and crazy loops of death to be faced by activating the various power-ups collected. A further challenge is represented by the Fuzzys, small furry puppets who suddenly launch themselves towards the truck and who, slowing down or accelerating at the right moment, will have to be collected on the fly. For the record, in the original version they were Mexican children born during the trip. Furthermore, given that the physics of each animal is influenced by various factors (the position on the vehicle, the proximity to other cuddly toys, the angle or the speed of the truck...) it can sometimes react in an absolutely unexpected and almost random way, displacing even the best player. From a purely aesthetic point of view, Snuggle Truck remains a graphically lively title characterized by pleasant and funny sound effects, although the tender soft toys added at the last second cannot boast the same appeal as the unfortunate Mexicans who preceded them. Added to this is a clear inconsistency between the various graphic elements: seeing a group of animals crossing the caves and deserts of New Mexico to reach a toy zoo is quite strange, just as the signs with skulls and walls with barbed wire are clearly remnants of the original version of the title. In closing it must be said that, despite an online ranking system that allows you to compare yourself with other players, Snuggle Truck is above all a challenge with yourself, encouraged by time records, unlocked objectives and collected trophies.
