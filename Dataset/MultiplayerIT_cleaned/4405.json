{"name": "Slay the Spire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/195193-slay-the-spire-il-provato-di-slay-the-spire.html", "text": "Hearthstone has dominated an entire sector for some years now: that of games based on virtual decks of cards. His are intuitive mechanics to learn, but often complex to master thoroughly, at least to be able to bring home victory online. Blizzard plays alone, but the presence of a giant has never prevented the proliferation of many clone titles based on mechanics completely copied from the original, often of embarrassing quality to say the least. Slay the Spire, however, is different. It's not a clone: it's a title that was inevitably inspired by the only model worthy of the name, and then took its own path, in a very original way. We spent several hours grappling with this small independent project, which quickly became a real drug. Dungeon you go, deck of cards you find Slay the Spire is not an online deck building that asks us to challenge other players after putting together a respectable deck. The cards are the heart of the gameplay, but the title is a full-fledged roguelike. Yes exactly, a roguelike. You know the randomly generated maps, permadeath on defeat, all the cool items we had in our inventory taking flight? Here, that. Now think of a roguelike that must be faced with a deck of cards as the only weapon, and you will understand why Slay the Spire has deserved all this attention. Beware that, incidentally, it arrived rather late. The title is currently available in early access on Steam, already before Christmas, but is only getting the right attention now, and only thanks to the noise of fans of the genre, who immediately guessed its good quality. Because there are so many good ideas. Let's leave the mechanics of the cards themselves and their rules aside for a moment, and instead analyze the progression system. For now there are only two playable characters who will have to venture into the dangerous dungeons: the Ironclad, a sort of soldier who has sold his soul to the devil to obtain incredible powers, and the Silent, halfway between assassin and hunter. The developers have promised to add more later when the official release takes place. This is very interesting, because the only two characters available already show how the approach to games can change radically, since each of them has peculiar cards, a specific style, and different bonuses at the start of the game. A quick example: the Ironclad, at the end of each fight, will automatically restore 6 Life Points thanks to the Burning Blood ability. Not bad, since the more you go on the more aggressive the enemies become, and that in the final stages of each dungeon every single life point can make a difference. But the Silent is much more dangerous during the fights, because with Serpent Ring he automatically draws two more cards at the beginning of each hand, allowing for more complex strategies. In Slay The Spire you proceed through small static game areas, within which turn-based combat will take place, all rigorously designed in 2D: characters, environments and animations. The areas continue in a vertical order and a practical legend on the right side of the screen gives us an idea of what we should expect from the next one. After each battle, we will be able to choose one of the three routes proposed by the crossroads, depending on our needs. If we are weak, perhaps the best choice will be to rest instead of engaging in a new fight, or in any case, with the same battles, some icons indicate the presence of weaker enemies than others. Not all areas, however, lead to battle. From time to time merchants appear who can sell us new items, rest areas in which we will have to choose between resting or forging enhanced versions of the cards we already own, and even bonus situations that closely resemble the very first graphic adventures with PC, those with screen text only. For example, a storyteller will warn us that we have found a valuable artifact. What do we have to do? pick it up? Leave it there? Each action will have consequences, which will give our character bonuses or penalties in combat. They are usually suggested by the text on the screen, next to the proposed action. But it would have been better to let our imagination work, instead of knowing in advance what is about to happen: we lose a little that taste for risk that goes so well with roguelikes. The rules of the game Slay The Spire manages in many cases to be truly infamous, proposing one after the other too many enemies, or in any case excessively powerful opponents for our resources. Sometimes we have to curse our rashness:we had to rest instead of trying to fight again. Other times the development team is willingly cursed, with an unfortunate or useless hand of cards in the current situation. Because after all, dungeons to explore and death always around the corner aside, the cards are the heart of the production. The game system has been studied in a very intelligent way and it seemed to us well balanced for the moment, more than the exploration of the dungeons. In fact, the clashes between the protagonist and the little monsters scattered everywhere take place in turns, and the turns are marked by the way we will play our cards, literally. Like Hearthstone, each card has a cost to play, and we only have three points available each turn. We will therefore have to tell the Ironclad or the Silent what they have to do: attack, defend or activate some special ability. If the procedure is immediately clear for the offensives, it is not the same for the defense system (called Blocking). Block cards give our hero armor points, marked with a shield on the screen. They are a bonus score: to receive damage, the enemy must first eliminate all those bonus points. But the cards usually give us protection of five, eight points at a time. Some bosses can inflict more than thirty damage in one go, and here the clash balancing system cracks a bit. Overall, however, the game system always manages to keep you on the alert, but rarely exaggerates by proposing insurmountable situations. When they appear, it is a good rule to take full advantage of the specific skills of our character, or of the bonus items that we have found while exploring the dungeons (and which are lost forever in the event of death). Apart from the consumables that act immediately during the fight, but only once, with a little luck we will also be able to get our hand on the relics, which instead allow us to take advantage of permanent bonuses, and which will make us start the fight with a clear advantage. It goes without saying that the decks are fully customizable, upgradeable and alterable. Furthermore, the developers indulged themselves with collectibles and with the variety of situations: there are two hundred cards, fifty different types of enemies, more than one hundred objects, and we are still only in early access. The potential for having an interesting (and cheap: it costs just fifteen euros) title in your hands is all there. The animations, on the other hand, should be completely revised, because they are embarrassing, like the design and inspiration of almost all enemies, except for the bosses.", "date": "2018-02-16", "grade": "8.0"}
