Even if, however, neither the first nor the second, the monsters we were talking about, will unfortunately be controllable directly by the player. In fact, the action provides that only the main character can be used in these phases (as in the rest of the adventure). However, while not being able to actively act on your army, there is no lack of fun deriving from the fact of still finding yourself in the middle of epic clashes between hundreds of soldiers and creatures like never before seen in any other video game, remaining positively involved. And while the adrenaline rises to a thousand you can use Skarin's power to throw himself into the fray and give vent to his destructive force. The clashes are very entertaining: the beefy warrior can unleash deadly sword blows with the simple and repeated pressure of a button, also generating devastating combos (there are fifteen in total and also include counterattack actions) which often result in bloody spectacular kills, such as decapitating enemies, or choosing a calmer approach, taking the enemy from behind and silently, a la Solid Snake. These moves can be expanded in number by others learned in one of the three arenas present on each of the islands in which the area in which the events take place is structured. It is also possible to use magical runes to imbue the sword with the power of the elements. Worth noting is the presence of the now inevitable Quick Time Events to be performed in this case against the bosses. But not all that glitters is gold. Viking also has some flaws in its gameplay. For example, the AI of the enemies does not appear very developed. Mind you, the various abominations are not stupid, but neither are they ~arches of science~. Then, in our opinion, a character level-up system is missing which perhaps would not have failed in a similar product. Without forgetting that for many hardcore-gamers being able to perform their attack actions simply by repeatedly pressing a key in the long run could be boring, since it deprives the title in some ways of that technical aspect that perhaps the implementation of most of the other buttons of the Pad for certain moves could have imbued them, for added depth. Fairytale settings As far as the aesthetics of the game is concerned, it must be said that Creative Assembly has done a decent job and frankly we don't understand certain criticisms rained down on the product from the United States. Viking doesn't have the best graphics of all time, but neither is it censorable. Visually, the title offers splendid fairy-tale glimpses and settings that those who have been lucky enough to see live on some of his trips to those lands or similar, such as Ireland and Scotland, will not struggle to recognize on TV. The scenarios also range well from fairly detailed outdoor landscapes to more gloomy ones and indoors of some caves. The characters are well cared for even if they have a typically American comics design like Conan the barbarian rather than real, as well as monsters and creatures, and ~dancer~ animations, in the sense that they range from good to bad in some situations. However, the graphics sector is affected by the enormous number of characters on the screen during the battles, with evident drops in frame-rate in the most agitated phases. As far as the audio is concerned, there is a soundtrack without infamy or praise, uninspired ~in game~ samplings, not so much for quality as for limited number, and a discreet dubbing in Italian that alternates splendid voices such as that of Pietro Ubaldi, seen at work in various films such as ~Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest~, to others however on the sufficiency. Comment Viking: Battle for Asgard is a title of the particular ones, so to speak. On the one hand, the splendid setting and part of the gameplay aimed at representing simple but very spectacular white weapon clashes, can attract the attention of that part of the public who is passionate about the genre and eager to try their hand at something not particularly deep or complex, devoted to the unvarnished action. On the other hand, however, a meager plot, a partially limited depth of play, and a certain overall monotony can make those who would like something more from this type of game turn up their noses. But in our opinion Viking: Battle for Asgard should be taken for what it is, namely a hack'n'slash with epic elements, such as mass battles, which does not invent anything new, nor does itdo it, but which knows how to entertain without too many frills despite its linearity. Pros: Splendid Nordic settings Fun as a whole Graphically discreet Cons: Animations to be reviewed Repetitive gameplay No multiplayer mode", "date": "2008-04-18", "grade": null}
