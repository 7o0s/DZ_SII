{"name": "Resident Evil 3 per PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-3-pc-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Resident Evil 3 for PC is a new opportunity to reflect on the great charm of remakes: productions that start from the original experience, with all its emotional and nostalgic load, and revolutionize it in every respect, redesigning not only the technical sector but also the artistic direction based on the most modern and effective solutions. From this point of view, the first twenty minutes of the game are absolutely out of scale: a swirl of emotions that first slyly recalls the atmospheres of Resident Evil 7 biohazard, then strikes with the disruptive power of Nemesis and involves us in a visually extraordinary ride, with a cinematic cut, which mixes in-game sequences and cutscenes together as only the best action adventures can do. Party in full swing, the Capcom title makes you catch your breath only when Carlos Oliveira and his companions from UBCS enter the scene, the mercenary unit that the Umbrella Corporation has deployed on the streets of Raccoon City in the vain hope that they could contain the accident that has turned the city into a nightmarish scenario, with hundreds and hundreds of zombies hungry for living flesh. As the beautiful and courageous Jill Valentine, we will have to try to help them and ourselves find a way out. Gameplay Once the initial ride is over, which as mentioned mixes in-game action and cutscenes, inevitably limiting the interaction in favor of a cinematic direction of great impact and spectacularity, the gameplay of Resident Evil 3 returns to the consolidated formula of a linked system double thread to what we had seen in the remake of Resident Evil 2, characterized by a series of simple environmental puzzles (here very few, in fact) that involve finding key objects and a movement system far from the ~tank ~ of the origins, rather quick and agile, which in this case also includes a reinterpretation of dodging: executing it with perfect timing not only allows you to avoid a potentially fatal blow, but by attacking immediately it also gives rise to a bullet time during which you can inflict damage to the enemy. The feeling of tension typical of survival horror has therefore been placed in another area of the controls, the aiming system: the precision of the shots takes time, but above all the zombies tend to move suddenly and unpredictably as they approach with great strides, with the close-up view ending up masking distances. The result? Lots of empty shots, headshots that only rarely result in the explosion of the skull of the undead on duty and the real possibility of getting bitten if you stay still and shoot for too long. Episodes of inevitable frustration, especially when a living dead that we were sure we had eliminated gets up and attacks us when we go back to visit the place where it is; but nevertheless perfectly adequate to the type of experience that the developers wanted to package, and which in reality at the normal difficulty level often proves to be a little too permissive. In fact, it is difficult to run out of ammunition, unless you have very poor shooting accuracy: the game dispenses resources in a rather generous way, with almost infinite refills, inevitably, during certain boss fights. Structure and duration If it is true that the first sequences of Resident Evil 3 are absolutely spectacular and the Raccoon City that is outlined in these phases appears truly suggestive, unfortunately the promises made by the developers have not been kept. In fact, there was talk of a very large city, when in reality the urban scenarios are limited to those seen in the demo and little more: the main road, a couple of shops, the metro station and its offices, a warehouse and a roof. Places where perhaps you only find yourself passing through, which are not valued in any way also given that the puzzles, very abundant in Resident Evil 2, are practically completely missing here: there are some gems to be placed in a machine that dispenses ammunition and objects, but for the rest we go on between keys and badges, giving the clear and distinct sensation of having wasted a sensational opportunity to enrich the experience rather than, in some way, reduce it. Yes, because some settings that were present in the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis are also missing, such as the Clock Tower and other areas of a certain importance. Then when Nemesis arrives and you have to flee to the next scenario, the situation does not improve. The sewers are basically the ones we had already seen in the previous remake, and when you switch to Carlos's command you are faced with another largewasted opportunity, that is, to enhance the main setting of Resident Evil 2 instead of reducing it to a simple appearance in the context of a campaign that not only has to deal with a skimpy duration, just five hours, but cannot even use the expedient some parallel events to give us at least an alternative new game plus. It is true, the hospital area has been enriched in some way and it is tantalizing to move inside those corridors looking for a way to cross certain doors, but even there the experience it runs out too briefly, without high notes, to then flow into a final phase in the Nest, which is also dull and has already been widely seen, moreover with an insipid final battle. The PC version Net of the many, surprising problems that afflict Resident Evil 3 from the point of view of mechanics and structure, technically the Capcom title is one of the best things that have been seen in recent times, especially on PC. In the first place it was done an excellent job in terms of optimization, which allows you to run the game at 4K and 60 frames per second, with all the effects at their maximum, simply by scaling the real resolution, without getting too many problems. Even higher definition texture packs can be activated than what the GPU memory could theoretically handle, without affecting performance too much. Wanting to play with the advanced adjustments, the choice is wide: ranging from the type of antialiasing to the aforementioned textures (quality and filter), from meshes to shadows, from reflections to translucency, from volumetric lights to particle lights, passing through ambient occlusion (up to to HBAO+), bloom, lens flare, motion blur, depth of field, lens distortion and FidelityFX with CAS, the latter a feature of AMD video cards. The RE Engine's abundant scalability allows you to fully enjoy graphics that, like having said that, it strikes from the start. The polygonal models of the characters, in particular, boast an extraordinary level of detail and move convincingly, but the same can be said for zombies: divided into various types to prevent the inevitable ~clone effect~, they can be crushed in parts of the body other than the head, if necessary. The only drawback: from a distance they are displayed at a reduced frame rate to lighten the general load. Nemesis itself boasts a solid design, which undergoes mutations depending on the phase of the game in which we find ourselves, while diverting the whole experience towards sci-fi b-movie atmospheres with its gimmicks. between highs and lows. The areas of Raccoon City, as mentioned less numerous than we would have hoped to see, boast a great visual richness even in the perspective of a simplistic level design, and do not miss anything from the point of view of effects, with in particular volumetric lights and screen space reflection steal the show. The textures always offer an excellent level of detail, naturally provided you select the high quality ones, but the interaction is quite limited, as indeed happened in Resident Evil 2. The other locations are much less brilliant, as mentioned, between occasions missed (a renewed centrality of the police station, for example), real cuts compared to the original game and undervalued novelties (some nice choices for the hospital, but we are talking about an aseptic place and with few surprises). effects more than on the music, as is normal, and in any case it does not disappoint. The Italian dubbing is excellent, made by a cast of seasoned professionals who once again give excellent performances. The only drawback: the volume levels during the last sequence tend to hide Jill's voice, and it's a shame that such an annoying inconvenience occurs at this juncture, of all possible moments.", "date": "2020-03-31", "grade": "7.5"}
