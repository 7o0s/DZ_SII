Contrary to expectations, however, Housemarque has come out with this Furmins, a cute and cuddly puzzle game at first sight like many others: let's see if it's the case not to stop at appearances... Ball of chicken skin Furmins belongs to the category of so-called physics puzzle games, which find their progenitor in the historic The Incredible Machine and which still today inspire high-quality titles such as Casey's Contraptions released last summer and whose review you can find here. The mention of the Snappy Touch product is not accidental, as it has managed to establish a new paradigm of the genre on the iPad to which Furmins, let's say it immediately, does not even come close. In fact, there are many aspects in which the Housemarque work is objectively inferior to its direct competitor, a real shame also considering the good presentation of the game. Distinguished by a soft graphic style in pastel colors, Furmins is decidedly pleasant to look at, thanks above all to well-designed backdrops and the convincing animations of the protagonist fur balls. The music and sound effects do their duty by accompanying the action without intruding too much, for a delightful general picture despite being light years away from Housemarque's previous works. We said, we are sorry to note how the purely audiovisual sector is the only area in which Furmins manages to stand out, proving instead compliant and banally average for everything else. The basic gameplay is typical of the genre: the user's task is to get the round creatures from point A to point B by juxtaposing the platforms and tools that are made available in the various levels. As with any physics puzzle, the prevailing logic is that of trial-and-error, and therefore most of the time is spent trying, observing the effect and repeating everything until the circle is squared. Unlike a title like Casey's Contraptions, however, here the solution is one and only one, severely limiting the player's inventiveness and increasing frustration in the more advanced levels: precisely for this reason, it is not even possible to rotate the pieces at one's disposal , which instead the Snappy Touch product allowed to do with great ease. The result is a much more framed and static puzzle game, although the developers have tried to make everything more dynamic by inserting gadgets (trampolines, treadmills and so on) in some levels that must be activated with the right timing by acting on a point at case of the touchscreen. These are pleasant variations on the theme which, however, fail to completely revive a fundamentally uninspired title, which in short carries out the homework without infamy and without praise but showing its side when compared with other Apps with a decidedly more complete offer: in this sense , the absence of a level editor raises a lot of clamor, now practically mandatory for anyone belonging to the category that aims for the first places.
