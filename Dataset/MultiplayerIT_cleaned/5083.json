{"name": "Tales of Berseria", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/179040-tales-of-berseria-v-per-vendetta.html", "text": "When we completed Tales of Berseria and overwrote the last save to restart it in New Game + mode or resume the checkpoint before the final boss to go explore the inevitable super difficult secret dungeon, we practically breathed a sigh of relief. It was a different ride than usual: we spent fifty-three hours together with a very complicated cast, talking about revenge, death and redemption. The characters of Tales always leave something inside, despite being real walking stereotypes of Japanese animation, but those of Tales of Berseria are truly singular anti-heroes. And the strength of the umpteenth Bandai Namco proposal is all there: there is a strong will to change course compared to the past, in this JRPG, but the limits of the old-gen consoles (and more specifically of PlayStation 3) have really made everything to prevent the new vision of Tales from emerging and give the brand the evolutionary impetus it now absolutely needs. In the following lines we will better explain our point of view: fasten your seat belts. Tales of Berseria is one of the best exponents of the saga, but feels the weight of the older generation The suicide squad In our previous test a few weeks ago we told you how the story of Tales of Berseria begins, but if you've seen any trailers (or the episodes dedicated to Velvet in the animated series Tales of Zestiria the X) you probably already know enough. In any case, it is worth remembering that Tales of Berseria has a female protagonist, for once, even if she is not exactly human: Velvet Crowe turned into a demon when her brother-in-law Artorius murdered his brother in front of her eyes, in a ritual that gave him enormous powers and granted every human being the ability to see the malaks, the spirits that usually roam around us invisibly. Artorius' goal was to stem the demonite, the same ~disease~ that transformed Velvet, and to fortify the order of the Exorcists who now, thanks to the contribution of the bound malaks, can better defend humanity. Artorius' reasons for Velvet count for nothing: she just wants to avenge her little brother Laphicet and the story of Tales of Berseria constantly plays on the conflict between logic and emotion, between the greater good and the wishes of individuals. Velvet Crowe is an almost intolerable character for a good half of the adventure; forget the usual incurable optimists that the Tales have as protagonists, because Velvet literally reminds us every two minutes that she is willing to sacrifice everything and everyone in order to achieve her goal, and that is to kill Artorius. It cannot be said that the supporting actors who join her cause have nobler goals, as swordsman Rokurou is also a bloodthirsty demon, Eizen is a cursed pirate in search of the missing captain, Magilou... well, she wants just screw up. In this quartet of misfits, two more positive characters fit together despite themselves: a little malak whom Velvet will call after her brother and who will have to learn to live on her own and a disillusioned Exorcist who will join the group first as a hostage and then as a voice of conscience . Essentially Velvet will chase Artorius and his minions around the world, leaving behind a trail of destruction that will boast the nickname ~Dominus of Catastrophe~: Tales of Berseria, in fact, is set about a thousand years before Tales of Zestiria and goes to fill those small holes in the narrative of the other Tales that gave certain characters and events a real aura of mystery. Bandai Namco has only partially succeeded in the prequel move, but in any case Tales of Berseria is highly enjoyable in its own right and the references to the contrary maintain perfect autonomy. The story, however, is expressed in a very direct way, despite the very complex subtext to digest: Velvet and his cronies are multifaceted anti-heroes with immoral purposes, but the cause Artorius fights for is as ambiguous as theirs. Eventually, when everything becomes clearer, it's hard to tell who the bad guys really are. Tales of Berseria offers interesting food for thought, even if we haven't digested the idea that a murderer should be esteemed for his total dedication to a homicidal cause. As we said, it is an adult and complex story that delivers real punches in the stomach and makes the character evolution of some characters - Velvet in primis - even more convincing. Despite this, there is no shortage of funny gags and skits, carefully dosed and integrated into the narrative above all through the system of optional dialogues in a modor to lighten the most dramatic moments without weakening their impact: it is a pity, in this sense, that some dialogues - despite the excellent adaptation in Italian - have seemed really too long-winded. Often the cast stops to brood over the development of the plot with very long explanations on the rules of nature and magic in the world that break the rhythm and confuse ideas, turning around some key concepts to build ad hoc twists. Together by force Tales of Berseria presents the same, identical structure to which the last twenty years of Tales have accustomed us: we visit a city, we follow the story through the various dialogues and the kinematics that develop it, then we go to the ~dungeon~ on duty and scours to the end where, usually, the boss awaits us. The small solutions devised in the latest Tales fit together in this old-school JRPG formula, since once again there is no three-dimensional world map but a geographical map that allows us to travel instantly from one place of interest to another by consuming bottles of Inoph or setting sail in Eizen's ship. The open-air areas that separate the cities from the so-called ~dungeons~ are practically dungeons in their turn: while not reaching the dispersive amplitude found in Tales of Zestiria, they are however sufficiently complex and stratified. And for this very reason the backtracking that we have been forced to at certain moments in history has particularly tired us out. Fortunately, at a certain point the geotable is unlocked, a sort of hoverboard that allows us to dart at high speed and run over enemies who, if weaker than the party, will vanish in a cloud of smoke without triggering a fight. Unfortunately, the geotable does not save the truly terrible design of most indoor dungeons, practically an endless sequence of corridors and rooms where every now and then you come across some irritating environmental puzzle. We had the strong feeling that the developer had tried in every way to prolong our stay in these areas by resorting to extremely repetitive areas, both in structure and in appearance, which sometimes tested our patience: fortunately it is possible save at any time in a dedicated slot, as well as at the appropriate save points. It was the fighting that lifted our morale during these excursions. The enemies are well distributed within the various rooms and we can choose whether to go around them or fight them, perhaps attacking them from behind to enjoy the initiative or engaging more than one at a time to face more demanding but also more profitable battles. Tales of Berseria's combat system is, indeed, absolutely superb. The game pours out one tutorial after another for hours and hours, continuously teaching us new mechanics that make it more and more profound and satisfying: basically you can also lower the difficulty level and play by pressing random keys without worrying about elemental properties or vulnerabilities, but we wholeheartedly advise against it. Everything revolves around the ~souls~: you start with three and you can accumulate up to five by automatically stealing them from enemies after having stunned them or afflicted them with some anomalous condition. The more souls you have, the more shots you can ring and the more damage you inflict but, sideways, you also become more vulnerable and can be stunned more easily: the rule applies to both the player's party and the enemies on the battlefield , so you have to find the right balance in terms of souls and employ the so-called Breakthrough Arts to continuously download and reload resources. Considering that the player can map up to four Arts (the special attacks, in short, which change for animations, power and elemental attributes) per button and that each character has a completely different breakthrough Art from those of the others, the combat system of Tales of Berseria soon becomes incredibly creative and varied. When the Explosive Bar is unlocked, then, it reaches even higher levels of complexity: at that point it is possible to switch characters in battle with reserves on the fly, instantly switching from one to another to prolong combos, exploit the weaknesses of enemies and counterattack them at the right time, perhaps by hurling the spectacular Mystical Arts. The latter not only serve to inflict a lot of damage, but also to increase the chances of receiving items to equip at the end of the fight. Tales of Berseria, in fact, abandons the absurd glyph system seen in Tales of Zestiria to adopt a much more intriguing system thatand remember the random loot from games like Diablo: each weapon or armor can be upgraded and has a specific bonus that we can learn permanently after defeating a certain number of enemies. If the bonus in question is fixed, however, the others are not and therefore it will often happen to find many objects with different bonuses to be weighed carefully while defeating enemies and on enemies and passing objects from one character to another in order to enrich their repertoire of bonuses and prepare them for every challenge. Advancing age The problems concerning the design - but also the appearance - of the dungeons undoubtedly reflect the old-gen nature of Tales of Berseria. The game arrives in Europe in PlayStation 4 and PC versions just like the previous Tales of Zestiria, but in Japan Tales of Berseria was also originally developed for PlayStation 3 and converted for other platforms, and the limits of the old hardware, in a market where now there are RPGs like Final Fantasy XV and The Witcher 3, they all feel. The artistic direction compensates for the problem only in part; Tales of Berseria is absolutely not a bad game to look at, on the contrary it is very colorful and lively (despite the bloody themes) and the polygonal models of the characters stand out especially during the cinematics that the team shot with a much more attentive eye than usual to the choreography. Almost indistinguishable from a cartoon - although still far from the rendering of paradoxically older titles such as the splendid Tales of Vesperia - the models of the protagonists and their main enemies stand out for their texturing and attention to detail. The animations in combat follow one another fluid and spectacular between flashes and explosions in profusion, but when it comes to interacting outside of a fight, the characters tend to sit annoyingly impaled with their arms at their sides as if they were beautiful figurines. Perhaps it is precisely to divert attention from this contrast that Bandai Namco has implemented most of the conversations in the form of static illustrations, but the effect gets tired in the long run and in certain moments, when the dialogues go too long as already mentioned, it appears even a little poor. In terms of settings, the situation improves only partially. Some of the scenery is actually beautiful, especially when it comes to traveling across vast prairies with the grass swaying in the wind and the clouds casting their animated shadows above us. Others, on the other hand, seemed really poor to us, disadvantaged by very low resolution textures and an indecisive frame rate. The caves and ruins in which we will have to infiltrate, in particular, tend to look a bit alike, also thanks to the soundtrack which in some situations is not very incisive and reuses the same tracks in multiple settings. It's strange because the composer Motoi Sakuraba usually does not disappoint, but this time there are few traces left with us, including those that boast the unmistakable signature of Go Shiina (like the music of the city of Loegres, for example) and those that accompany the cathartic moments of history. On the localization front, however, we really can't complain. Beyond the canon accompanying the introductory film, the energetic Burn by Flow, which remained in the original language, it is possible to choose between the excellent English dubbing and the Japanese one for lovers of subtitled anime.", "date": "2017-01-23", "grade": "8.5"}
