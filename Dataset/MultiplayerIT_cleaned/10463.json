{"name": "Il nuovo Asteroids?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71326-meteor-blitz-il-nuovo-asteroids.html", "text": "Shoot everything that moves and move quickly so you don't get hit: this is the gameplay behind the extraordinary Meteor Blitz, a shooter clearly inspired by the classic Asteroids, which brings a lot of action to the iPhone combined with an excellent game structure, full of depth and equipped with facets that you would not expect from such a product; especially if sold for only 79 cents. There are two game modes available: arcade and survival. In the first we have to face six different ~worlds~ to unlock, each divided into five stages; in the second, a mix of different environments and enemies, in which the goal is simply to survive as long as possible. If in survival mode it is possible to manage the upgrades ~on the fly~ and even set them automatically, given the lack of interlude screens, in arcade mode we have the opportunity to decide each time how to spend the credits earned by collecting the rings that appear every time we destroy a meteorite or an enemy. Our ship is equipped with three different cannons (the basic green one, the blue one based on ice and the yellow one based on fire) that we can alternate at any time and which can be upgraded to thicken their range and increase effectiveness pure and simple. These are not the only weapons at our disposal, however: from time to time a ~bonus~ device appears within the stages which, once destroyed, leaves a ~smart bomb~ in place (which can be activated using the relative button on the touch screen, or shaking the iPhone), an energy shield, a bonus that momentarily slows enemies, or a simple extra amount of rings. When the situation gets complicated, we can double tap on the left virtual stick to produce a quick ~leap~ capable of instantly sowing any threat. Threats come from every direction The game action, as mentioned, refers to that of Asteroids: our ship is located in the center of the screen and must defend itself from the arrival of meteors (which, once hit, shatter into smaller and even more dangerous parts) as well as of hostile vehicles of various kinds, each characterized by a different pattern of movement. To pass the stages it is necessary to destroy the boss that appears at a certain time, in the form of a circular device equipped with ~pods~ that orbit around it. Even at that juncture it is possible to continue to devote oneself to the destruction of meteors and other enemies to collect rings, at least until the final battle becomes inevitable. As in any shooter of this kind, it is essential to move the spacecraft continuously and never stay still in the same spot, also because the further you go, the more serious the threats become, with hordes of opponents materializing in your wake or they surround us and then converge looking for the collision. To complete the missions we have a certain number of lives and a shield system that allows us to survive a couple of attacks before the ship explodes. In addition to the excellent upgrade system and the progression between one stage and another, Meteor Blitz can count on truly exceptional controls for immediacy and precision, which as usual tend to cover part of the playing area (since we still have to keep your thumbs on the screen) but they always work great. Let's say that in the economy of the Alley Labs branded product only the introduction of the ~leap~ leaves some perplexities, quite complicated to carry out and less useful than one might expect. Starry Night A top-notch gameplay, Meteor Blitz accompanies an exceptional technical realization, especially as regards the graphics. The on-screen action is smooth and fast, the map flowing convincingly and never faltering, even in the busiest of situations. The choice of colors appears excellent, that is, it is difficult to confuse one's fire with the enemies: every situation is always well ~readable~, just as it should be in the most chaotic shooters. The design in general is extremely accurate, and there is an excellent variety of enemy ships. The only note that can be moved to the game concerns the start screen, which should definitely be revised as it gives an almost ~artisanal~ idea of a product that is instead among the most ~professional~ in the App Store. Finally, the sound has good effects but only one music, nice but too repetitive: fortunately it is possible to replace it with any playlist of our choice. The intelligent saving system is excellent, which stores our progress in approxknow where we find ourselves having to press the HOME key.
