{"name": "Per Aspera", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/per-aspera-recensione.html", "text": "In a historical moment in which the colonization of Mars seems like a science-fiction objective, but within reach, Tln Industries has tried to imagine the challenges that humanity will have to face before being able to peacefully settle on the Red Planet. In the review of Per Aspera we discover, in fact, that behind a manager who is only apparently very dry there is a deeper and more intelligent simulation than suspected, capable of making us open our eyes a little to how far there is still to go before being able to complete this feat. This is because the Argentine developer's game mixes different elements together, but above all it confronts the player with rather interesting moral choices. And it also confronts him with the possibility of failure. This is because in the game it will not be enough to accumulate resources and buildings to win, but you will have to be careful to carefully manage what the planet can offer, as well as not to exceed certain limits. If at the beginning of the game, in fact, the lack of water and oxygen could be the main obstacle to colonization, in the final stages of the game the problem will be the opposite. In fact, we will have to check that there is not too much O2 in the air and that the water level of the new seas does not end up completely submerging our colonies. The history of colonization One of the most interesting features of Per Aspera is the fact that it has a campaign mode in which the story of the colonization of Mars is told. It is a science fiction story perhaps not perfect, but able to accompany and mark the pace of the game, combining the discovery of new buildings and resources with rather interesting dialogues and interludes. We will be AMI, the artificial intelligence sent to the planet to oversee the colonization, so as to create the requirements to safely host human colonists. At the beginning of the game AMI will be little aware of himself, but progressively he will start asking questions about his being, his role on the planet and the whole colonization operation. Thanks also to the excellent interpretation of actors of the caliber of Troy Baker, Phil LaMarr, Laila Berzins, Yong Yea, Lynsey Murrell and Nneka Okoye, these interludes are interesting and guarantee an additional cue to reflect in a slightly less superficial way on what it will happen in the coming years. From a gaming point of view, having tried to insert a narrative element with ethical ramifications in a strategic/managerial one of this type is certainly an interesting choice, which we hope will be reworked and perfected in the future. For more traditional players (or for later games) there is still a sandbox mode in which you can immerse yourself in the game without too many frills. Layers The campaign mode also helps to enter the game dynamics more gradually. At the start, in fact, Per Aspera looks like a rather canonical managerial game, with very essential graphics. From the initial landing point it will be necessary to start collecting basic resources at the nearby mines, so as to be able to build ever more elaborate components. At our service we will have a series of drones that must be maintained and replaced in case they break. From a city-building point of view, the game does not seem to offer much: apart from the mines that can be placed exactly where the extracted resource is. , placing the rest, apparently, doesn't seem to require much planning. In reality, it soon turns out that it is better to create some kind of productive districts capable of maximizing the yield of some buildings and reducing distances as much as possible. After having built the first mines and the first spare parts factories, always keeping in mind keep an eye on the energy produced, we will be notified that a group of settlers is about to arrive from Earth. At this point we will no longer have to think only of the mechanical population, but also of the biological one, building buildings with a protected atmosphere and water extractors. Human personnel, moreover, will also unlock the research system, or the way to get hold of new technologies with which to improve existing buildings, but also discover new ones to further expand the colonization of the planet. Terraforming The ultimate goal, in fact, is not simply to host the settlers in controlled environments, but to transform the Red Planet into a new Earth. To do this we will first have to regulate the planet's temperature, then introduce new plant species capable of converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and finally create expanses of water capable of guaranteeing life. To do this we will have to proceed to the conquestof the entire planet, through the opening of new sectors and the creation of secondary colonies, but also through brute force. Without revealing too much, know that there will also be a part of the experience that will ask you to create an army and defense systems to repel enemy attacks and destroy their positions. This is a fairly marginal aspect of the experience and perhaps even the one developed with less care, but it is still more than enough to give a change of pace to the advanced stages of Per Aspera. There is no single strategy to obtain these results: for example, to obtain water, one can choose between melting the ice at the poles or hijacking an icy asteroid on the planet, and above all there is also the risk of excessive zeal which leads, as previously mentioned, to having rather unwelcome adverse effects, such as floods and fires. The technology to go to Mars. To be able to enjoy Per Aspera it is not necessary to own the latest generation of hardware. We played it in FullHD and all at maximum on an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750U laptop. The later stages of the game, those with more colonies scattered across the planet, may be more demanding in terms of resources, but it is still a rather light experience to run. Furthermore, in the coming weeks, when the developer will intervene on the artificial intelligence routines that manage the drones and the distribution of resources, the situation could improve further. It remains a pleasant experience to play, with its minimalist graphics, but of sure impact . Less memorable are, in our opinion, the music, a little too monotonous. While, as we said, dubbing is the flagship of the experience, thanks to top-level talents who have lent their voices. Obviously only in English.", "date": "2020-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
