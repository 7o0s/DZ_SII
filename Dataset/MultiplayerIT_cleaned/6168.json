Very accessible ~thought crackers~, open to a vast casual user, who can pull them out even for a handful of seconds each time and attempt the record. Mountain Goat Mountain belongs to the jumping game vein, and as can be easily understood, it puts us in command of a mountain goat engaged in an endless climb, amidst a thousand pitfalls and difficulties. Starting from the valley, our goal in the game is precisely to reach the highest possible altitude, jumping on blocks that are very reminiscent of the scenarios of the classic Q*Bert, but at the same time avoiding the chasms and paying attention to the traps scattered along the way: bricks that crumble, barrels that roll down from above, even little clouds that dispense lightning. A very simple and linear structure, which already after an hour has very little to offer to those who have a minimum of familiarity with this kind of production, but who try to keep the variety high thanks to a rich system of achievements and bonus coins. gold, which can be collected during each game but is also awarded at regular time intervals. With one hundred coins it is possible to buy a ~mysterious chest~, which in most cases contains new skins for our little goat (which can also be purchased directly, but for 99 cents each), and each type of ~dress~ corresponds to a different scenario. You got it right: choosing a different version of the likeable protagonist doesn't simply mean tackling the climb in an alternative guise, but also doing it in an unprecedented location, which passes from the default green mountain to the snowy one with a Christmas atmosphere, or to the dusty Wild West style. Changes that are not only aesthetic, but that influence the composition of the route, naturally different from attempt to attempt. Mountain Goat Mountain is a nice looking jumping game, with a nice and graceful protagonist As long as the goat goes, let it go It really takes a few seconds to assimilate the mechanisms of Mountain Goat Mountain, but to become fully familiar with the touch control system you need a little more time. The default setting allows you to jump forward, right or left, by touching the screen on both sides, while going back requires a slide. And here the donkey (or, better, the goat) falls, because unfortunately this gesture is often misunderstood by the game and this translates into a game over that is as undeserved as it is frustrating. Fortunately, from the options screen it is possible to access numerous alternative configurations, for example functioning only with taps or only with slides, or still according to an ~intuitive~ approach that allows you to touch in a single direction to move forward and then eventually change direction as needed. The best solution seemed to us to be the one with the four different touches for as many directions, but even in this case you have to be a little careful, because the risk of touching the wrong area of the display and falling into an abyss is high. In addition to the traps and the void, there is of course a further element of risk that forces us to never stand still: hunger. The goat has to eat some grass after a few jumps, and if the relative indicator appears we have to hurry up and get some, or it will take a few moments for our energy to run out and game over will occur. Putting aside the playful aspect and the structure, which as mentioned unfortunately reserves few surprises for the habitus of endless titles, it must certainly be emphasized that the new Zynga-branded product is really beautiful from an artistic point of view: the goat and the scenarios are designed with taste , using a very pleasant and effective style, supported by an adequate set of animations to cover each maneuver. In short, you play a game every now and then just to admire the nice gestures of the goat and the colors of the scenery, which naturally change according to the location; and to listen to the fun music accompanying the experience, also themed.", "date": "2015-07-25", "grade": "7.0"}
