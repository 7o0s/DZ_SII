{"name": "Egypt III - Il destino di Ramses", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/egypt-iii-il-destino-di-ramses.html", "text": "..we are faced with a title that effectively manages to coherently and effectively integrate myths and historical notions with a relatively exciting plot and sufficiently stimulating puzzles. Magic and mystery on the banks of the Nile In the shadow of the columns of the temple of Piramesse dedicated to Amun Ra, the High Priest Kaemouaset narrates the deeds of Maya, a young sorceress sent by the pharaoh to watch over the construction of the largest obelisk ever erected in the land of Egypt: if she succeeds in this undertaking, solemnly promised to the sun god, Ramses II will be able to reign undisturbed for many more years. What Maya gains is not clear, but of course our busty heroine will not hesitate to put her supernatural powers at the disposal of the pharaoh, to investigate a series of mysterious incidents that seem to hinder the architects' work. Soon she will discover that behind these seemingly inexplicable events are hidden powers much greater than her and she will find herself traveling up and down the Nile, also invoking the help of the capricious Egyptian deities... Magic and mystery on the banks of the Nile These are the interesting premises of Egypt III which, after the preliminary investigations at the Piramesse construction site, will lead us through a series of tests which will test the magical abilities gradually acquired by Maya and the historical and mythological knowledge that in theory we should acquire in turn, by carefully exploring the game's settings and consulting the in-depth information sheets! The latter have been compiled with a certain rigor and cover a wide range of topics, from architectural techniques to magical and religious practices used by the Egyptians. Don't worry though: their reading is rather smooth and painless (for once, they really represent the ideal way to learn something new in a relatively short time and therefore apply it to the context of the adventure)! The rich and clean graphics and the admirable attention to detail shown by the developers offer a good level of immersion in the fascinating atmosphere of ancient Egypt: every aspect of the game reflects the spirit and style of the works that this indelible civilization has left us , from the realistic and detailed settings to the practical interface, through which it is possible to examine the environments and objects that surround us and interact with them without major difficulties, except in identifying some active points on the screen. Maya sets out to explore the colossal temple of Piramesse. The game interface, perfectly in theme, is; elegant and functional. Not just pyramids... The adventure is divided into ten chapters set in as many locations and is absolutely linear: the objectives are always well defined and it is impossible to make irreparable mistakes and have to backtrack, although Maya is far from immortal and sometimes we are granted the possibility to try again to pass a particularly difficult test. The solution of the puzzles is invariably logical, which avoids frustration and contributes to the overall realism but tends to affect the longevity of the game: you will hardly stand still for hours on the same puzzle. However, this does not detract from the quality and variety of the puzzles, which are almost always pleasant to solve and very well integrated into the context. There are various types: purely logical ones and those based on the use of items in the inventory and interaction with the environment. It is worth pointing out that some are distinguished by a certain originality, especially in the last stages of the game: Maya will find herself collecting ingredients for rituals and spells, warding off powerful curses, persuading the gods to help her with every trick, manipulating ancient artifacts , solve riddles and open complicated locks. The catchphrase of the labyrinth is also back, albeit revisited in an Egyptian version with discreet originality, and the timed puzzles, which however are not too indigestible! Multiple choice dialogues play a fundamental role but, in most cases, it will simply be enough to exhaust all the topics of conversation to obtain the desired result. The use of magic, on the other hand, is a more unusual element for a graphic adventure and helps to spice things up a bit: Maya has the gift of clairvoyance and during her mission she will also learn other spells, to face the trials more difficult and to the enemies that will appear in front of it. The classic sliding block puzzle... in an Egyptian sauce. The section of a lock that we will have the pleasure of opening during the game. Virtual journey to the Egypt of the pharaohs As mentioned, the graphics are nice and quite detailed, it offersgiving the player the opportunity to roam freely within the houses and monuments of the time (all faithfully reconstructed), admire the decorations and bas-reliefs of the temples and immerse yourself in the myths that have shaped the history of Egypt. The cutscenes are fluid and equally appreciable. The only downside is the relative bleakness of the game's environments, many of which feel utterly lifeless and feature no more than one or two characters to interact with. The models of the latter, however, are more than good and animated in a dignified way. The soundtrack is spot on and decidedly catchy: although the accompanying songs are relatively few, they are well orchestrated, contribute to the atmosphere and dynamically follow the events, becoming from time to time conciliatory, pressing or triumphant. A note of merit goes above all to the ultra-realistic and immersive sound effects: among the columns of the temple of Piramesse you will hear the echo of the chisels of the decorators, inside the crypts you will distinguish the crackling of the fire on the torches, in Memphis you will hear the wind blowing through the trees and in the forge of the god Ptah you can hear the continuous bubbling of the lava. As for the localization in Italian, I have nothing to say... also because I personally took care of it, on behalf of Jinglebell Communications! However, I can assure you that it was followed with the utmost care and maniacal attention to historical details and that the local voice actors did a good job (they've been almost spoiling us lately). A courtyard in Memphis. Brickmakers, initially reluctant to cooperate. Our Maya in all her glory. Comment It almost sounds strange to admit that this Egypt III, in addition to being actually educational, is also an ultimately good adventure! It offers a coherent and well-developed plot which, although not shockingly original, always manages to keep the player's attention, boasts a classy technical realization, has a discreet pace and varied, well-integrated and quite stimulating puzzles. Of course, perhaps it languishes a bit in terms of the longevity and difficulty of the puzzles and one could also reproach various settings for a certain static nature and lack of life, but it still remains an absolutely unmissable title for Egyptology enthusiasts and recommended to all adventurers who don't rattle on the innovation front of the genre. Pros: Noteworthy graphics and sound Fair quality and variety of puzzles In-depth information sheets on ancient Egypt Cons: Limited difficulty level Poor longevity Fascinating but a bit empty settings Adventure at the service of history In the integrated in-depth tabs, you will find many curiosities about the topic. on civilization Egyptian. Surely there are not many fans of the ~edutainment~ genre, i.e. the one that aims to combine business with pleasure and offer the possibility of learning by playing - most of the time with dramatic results, both in terms of content and on that of playability. However, this is not the place to discuss the possible causes of failure of these courageous experiments (this is a rather complex matter, which ranges from the principles of teaching to the very foundations of interactive entertainment), also and above all because it is not the case of Egypt III, a first-person ~point and click~ graphic adventure with 360 panoramic scrolling: we are dealing with a title that effectively manages to coherently and effectively integrate myths and historical notions with a relatively exciting plot and sufficiently stimulating puzzles. In addition to the excellent technical realization by the developers of Kheops Studios, the game also has to its credit a large collection of in-depth information sheets on the myths and customs of the Egyptians and is based on a substantial work of historical research that permeates every aspect of the adventure and will not fail to satisfy the curiosity of enthusiasts.", "date": "2004-06-15", "grade": null}
