This new game is part of the vast array of Tower Defense, or Defend the Tower, a very popular genre on PC and which has also made its appearance on the console and mobile market for some time. In essence, it is a question of tenaciously defending your base from the assault waves of enemy troops. The peculiarity of the Segnal Studios game is also the realization of the dream of every child, every little leader who hoped that their plastic or lead soldiers would come to life by staging real battles. This is how the bedroom or the kitchen become the scene of the most exciting battles that took place during the First World War. Toy Soldiers stages real battles that took place during the first great conflict but proposing them in a ~home~ setting and with slightly nuanced warlike contours. In fact, if the setting refers to the first real phases of the conflict in which Germany tried to enter France through Belgium, the intention is clear to play down everything with imaginative settings and a cartoonish style. Strategy and Action From the gameplay point of view, as anticipated in the introduction, it is a question of defending one's base, rightly called the toy box, from the advance of the enemies who try to break through our lines in ever stronger cyclical waves. Through the management of the fire stations it is possible to exploit all our artillery to resist the assaults. The map is in fact characterized by some areas in which it is possible to place our defenses, after having paid the equivalent price. By destroying the enemy advances, our treasure increases and thus it is possible to better develop the defensive arsenal. The component that varies the gameplay and which at the same time is the key point is the possibility of using the defensive structures in first person, so here we are in the role of a machine gunner who mows down enemy lines or a brave biplane pilot who dives kill the advancing tanks with precise bombardment. In this way it is possible to use not only all the defense positions, from machine guns to mortars, passing from howitzers to poison gas generators, but also all pilotable means, such as biplanes, bombers and tanks. Only with the right combination of strategic management of resources, positioning of defenses and first-hand use of them is it possible to achieve the best results and complete all the required objectives. Strategy purists will not appreciate this possibility but given the excellent execution of the fights both on the ground and in the air and the good balance between the two phases (keep in mind that it is always possible to play even letting the artificial intelligence take care of the enemy after the positioning of the defenses) given by the developers we are of the opinion that this addition makes the gameplay more varied and decidedly captivating. The game phases prove to be fun, as are the clashes with the end-of-level ~bosses~ such as giant tanks and airships capable of making the famous Zeppelins pale. The variety of gameplay is guaranteed by the right mix between strategy and first-person action, this avoids excessively heavy criticism given that there is no doubt that the possibilities to vary the defenses are somewhat limited, such as the fairly small number of weapons and a of repetitiveness in the game phases which in the long run affects the liking of Toy Soldiers. Xbox 360 goals The 200 points are divided into 12 objectives that require you not only to finish the campaign in single player but also to play multiplayer, to unlock the elite mode and to finish all the missions with the maximum level of success, then yes you can take advantage of the rank of General! Colored just right From a technical point of view we are in the presence of a more than successful game, the environments in which the battles take place are colored and well reconstructed and all the cannons and troops are also cared for. The animations during the elimination of the soldiers and vehicles were very successful, perfect for reminding us that they are toys. The only comment is related to the camera which sometimes narrows the shot too much, forcing you to look for absurd inclinations to see the battlefield; luckily a bird's-eye view becomes available later in the game, perfect for getting a full look at the array of forces. The controls work very well and the management is really immediate, both in terms of battle at first forsona that management by mere field strategists. We consider some small frame drops and some imperfect collisions to be youthful mistakes that have no effect on the good overall rating of the game. To complete the picture, we remind you that it is possible to play multiplayer both locally via the shared screen and via Xbox Live.", "date": "2010-03-22", "grade": "8.5"}
