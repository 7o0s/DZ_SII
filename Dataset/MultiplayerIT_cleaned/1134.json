By the power of paperaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Also as regards the technical side, the work carried out by the Japanese team is sublime, giving this new production all the necessary appeal. The polygonal environments blend perfectly with the characters who never miss the opportunity to show themselves in all their paper essence. The animations themselves recall this particular style in every circumstance, the subtleties of which are so many that we can write an encyclopedia. Entering a house will cause it to open like a cardboard box instead of using the usual transparencies. The same screen changes materialize in incredible goodies, with pages that crumple or leaf through in perfect book style. The color palette used also contributes to further giving the sensation of the picture book, with soft pastel colors and effective contrasts. Finally, the audio sector performs its task perfectly, taking up the most classic sounds of the world of the mustachioed plumber. Mario is a plumber! Nice discovery, you say. In all these years, in the huge Multiplayer house, pipes have broken at will, and every time we have always tried to call the one who is the most famous expert on the subject ever. We couldn't rely on anyone else, for obvious reasons. It's a pity that this monster of sympathy has always denied us his precious expertise with extremely far-fetched excuses. One time he was playing tennis, the other golf, then, and this is the biggest one, he even went so far as to invent that he was going around in a kart on a Mushroom Kingdom track. Since we are perspicacious like Lieutenant Colombo, we didn't believe him and we turned elsewhere, to more conventional plumbers, so to speak. But we never thought we'd run into a lie of this magnitude. Do you think that he has even come to tell us that he has turned into a sheet of paper, and that he is dealing with magic crystals and an ancient portal. I mean, who does he take us for? Origami Mario and the papier-mch portal By Intelligent Systems - to be clear the geniuses who gave birth to Advance Wars, Fire Emblem and the first Paper Mario - this long-awaited sequel follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, which landed on N64, to develop it from every point of view. Perhaps the wording 'every profile' is a little exaggerated: as for the plot, we find in our hands the same paucity of the illustrious ancestor. Basically something serious happened to Princess Peach, try to guess what! Yes, she was kidnapped on this occasion too, this time however not by the terrifying Bowser's hand, but by something darker. Logically it will be Mario who will have to go through all the colors to be able to find his beloved, but to do this he will first have to recover the seven crystals necessary to open the millennial portal. Those who have played the prequel won't find much news in these lines; the plot, in fact, is trivial and narrated with a certain superficiality, as well as always the same. As hilarious as the background is, more could and should have been done to propose a slightly more in-depth narrative plot, or at least diversify it in its key points. The rest is magic, gentlemen. Paper Mario: The Millenary Portal takes the most classic foundations of Japanese RPGs, filling them with paper scenarios and characters that will thus combine a definitely unique visual aspect with a lively level design. In this respect, in fact, Intelligent Systems has done a truly commendable job, playing on the depth of the screen and on the paper peculiarity whenever it could. Although the environments are polygonal, the coders have preferred to focus their exploration on depth rather than on 360 degrees. Paper Mario: The Millenary Portal takes the most classic foundations of Japanese RPGs, filling them with paper scenarios and characters that thus combine a definitely unique visual aspect with a lively level design. Origami Mario and the papier-mch portal Almost to look like a two-dimensional game, on certain occasions it is possible to find the videogame whisker far away on the screen, taking advantage of the visual depth created by the developers. The two dimensions above all invest Mario, capable of squeezing them beyond belief to fit into the cracks in the walls, or to fold down just like an origami, becoming an airplane or a boat if necessary. During exploration, our hero can also use his inimitable jump and a hammer to open new locations, as well as a diverse group of friends whothey will join him to help him with their peculiar skills. Everything grows exponentially in parallel with the development of Marione and her party. The rather linear structure of the main game - based on the more classic find the way, make the dungeon and go home - is in any case reinvigorated by a carefully studied backtracking to always keep the player's interest alive. During the exploration it is possible to find many useful elements to tickle the user's curiosity, puzzles that can only be solved with the particular skills of the protagonist or his acolytes. An example? It will happen to pass alongside walls with an apparent ear similar to a folded book page; at first you won't be able to do anything about it, then, helped by a partner with fairly large lungs, a breath and away you go, the game is done! The page will fly as if pushed by a strong wind, opening a secret location and, perhaps, giving the player a treasure to open. To encourage backtracking there are also sub-quests in the form of aids that Mario can provide to the commoners of the main village. Services that are logically rewarded with a large prize. The growth of cellulose Mario and his acolytes will grow proportionally as the game progresses: if our multifaceted hero's friends accumulate moves and points thanks to sun wedges that the player will have to allocate at will, the evolution of the 'whisker' will be more complex and accurate . With each successful fight, Mario will receive experience points in the form of stars. Having reached the constant quota of 100, here comes the level up, which will allow the player to decide what to develop between the protagonist's health, his skill points or the available slots in order to characterize the famous plumber as much as possible. This last item works roughly like the subject of FF7, giving the player full freedom to allocate the free slots to the features he deems most appropriate. Available along the pilgrimage, and sometimes really well hidden, these particular skills will give Mario new moves, or the possibility of regenerating health and skill points, or, again, the possibility of defending himself with the help of particular stratagems. This new Nintendo production has style to spare. The result of the obsessive work of Intelligent Systems, Paper Mario: The Millennium Portal amplifies what good was seen in its illustrious predecessor, while leaving the basic defects that afflicted it unchanged, mostly attributable to a never driving and rather unsatisfactory plot. As already mentioned in the course of the review, the rest is pure magic. The rich level design and the combat system that evolves dramatically with the continuation of the adventure are just the tips of the iceberg of a really well packaged game. This production winks at all types of players, precisely because of its apparently 'soft' RPG nature. For this it could be, paradoxically, inadequate for maniacs of the genre eager for statistics, hyper-characterized characters and an epic plot. But Paper Mario: The Millennium Portal is undoubtedly one of the best productions on the Gamecube. Pros: Style, style and more style. Masterful level design. Well thought out combat system. Also suitable for non-RPG enthusiasts Cons: although it may not fully satisfy genre fanatics. Plot (as usual) trivial and poorly cared for. By the power of paperaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Like any self-respecting Rpg of Japanese origin, this Paper Mario: The Millennium Portal also features turn-based combat. Enemies are clearly visible on screen though, so avoidable. The type of approach that is established with the villain on duty determines who first has to initiate the disputes: once a meeting has been engaged, the scenario changes, which transforms, as in the prequel, into a sort of theater concocted to give prominence to all contenders. However, this time there is also a real audience, destined to increase or decrease depending on how you behave in battle. In some cases real ultras of low league can be found in the crowd, who, equipped with blunt objects, will try to hinder the player's epic moves. This novelty implemented by Intelligent Systems also has a weight on the progress of the meetings, as the points necessary to use the devastating powers of the crystals are awarded by the public. It is therefore necessary to pamper and hold dear every single spectator, making every move with the right timing. Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, and not too dissimilar from what was seen in the Rpg dedicated to Mario and Luigi which landed on the GBA last year, this Paper tooMario: The Millennial Portal plays a lot on the timing factor. In fact, it is necessary to execute one's shots paying careful attention to the pressure times to ensure that they are more effective. Mario can strike with the most canonical of his jumps or through his inseparable hammer, as well as making use of an interchangeable companion at his side during combat. Here begins the strategic component, as almost all enemies have an invulnerable part, be it the side or the head. It's up to the player to decide which attack to make and which friend to use to defeat the enemy forces. If at the beginning everything might seem like rose water, going forward in the game the combat system takes on a general complexity worthy of note.", "date": "2004-11-19", "grade": null}
