{"name": "Resident Evil: Confidential Report File 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-confidential-report-file-2.html", "text": "If it weren't for the writing that stands out on the main menu and for the very long loading that precedes starting the game, it would be really difficult to distinguish this File 2 from the disappointing predecessor. To welcome the user there is therefore still an extremely poor screen, from which to start or continue a game, view the commands, turn the sound off / on or exit: to understand our reactions to the title in question, just know that we believe the latter option is the best of the whole package. The Capcom product does not seem to have learned from its mistakes at all, on the contrary, playing Confidential Report File 2 one gets the clear feeling that the title was created together with the previous one and then went on sale a few months later. Otherwise it is difficult to explain the cloying fixity of every single negative element, which punctually returns to poison the unfortunate game buyers. Let's start from the graphics, already not very honorable in the prequel and which here returns in very bad shape: framed from an isometric view, Confidential Report File 2 therefore continues to offer bare and chromatically questionable two-dimensional scenarios to the eye, as well as sprites of small, poorly defined and almost completely devoid of animations. A trivial HUD at the bottom of the screen and a status / inventory screen that defining ~minimalist~ is a euphemism complete a truly disheartening general picture, clearly inferior to a myriad of other mobile games. The situation is certainly not better from the point of view of gameplay, where Confidential Report File 2 really gives its worst. As mentioned, the user returns to take on the role of agent Tyler Hamilton and investigator Naomi McClain, two days after the events narrated by the first episode. This time, the two will face the horror of a university campus crowded with zombies and the like from different perspectives, in search of the author of a mysterious phone call. As with the prequel, here too the only minimally interesting aspect is the plot and its developments, while the play structure is a real sieve. The action is slow and cumbersome, the control system is simply ill-conceived and the RPG pretensions of the product fade in the face of the boredom that immediately strikes the player. Of course, Confidential Report File 2 offers classic monsters, weapons and objects from the series, as well as a good number of documents to read to compose the pieces of the puzzle: all elements which, however, absolutely fail to compensate for an incomplete gameplay lacking a suitable rhythm to mobile use.
