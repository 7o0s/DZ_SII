{"name": "Devil May Cry (2D)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry-2d.html", "text": "Devil May Cry is probably the modern series that was the first to go back to the dynamics of the old scrolling fighting games. It's no coincidence that behind this latest success story there is a producer like Capcom, who didn't invent the original genre but put a lot of his own into it with titles like Final Fight, Captain Commando or Cadillacs & Dinosaurs. In the mobile sector, the Japanese company has so far not shown great commitment, presenting products that are sometimes effective but always characterized by a just sufficient technical realization, probably aiming for maximum compatibility with the various terminals. Unfortunately Devil May Cry is no exception in this regard. The start screen of the game allows us to start the story but also to try our hand at training aimed at learning the various offensive maneuvers available. Once you get to the heart of the action, you realize that the choices made by the developers for the control system are in many ways innovative: the joystick is used to move the character, while the attack is delegated to the # keys (sword ) and 9 (pistols), with 0 for jumping. You play with both hands in a really comfortable position, in short, and it would be nice if other developers also took this type of configuration for example for their action games. The textual introduction to each stage tries to give a semblance of a plot to this Devil May Cry, but we soon realize that it is a gimmick that has avoided further work on the graphics to add a minimum of direction and narration to the product. In any case, the action itself soon proves to be quite captivating and quite varied: Dante can count on a good number of different shots to eliminate his opponents, the collection of red spheres (which can be spent on upgrading weapons) and green (which restore energy) represents a minimal element of thickness and in addition the game must be completed several times to see all thirty-six levels. The combat system is rather simplistic, in general the opponents are not that smart and only being surrounded can represent a dangerous situation. Things change slightly in the presence of the bosses, but not for the right reasons: often we find ourselves being flogged even while on the ground, and the same ~technique~ can be applied against enemies to get it right without too many problems. As mentioned above, unfortunately Devil May Cry in its 2D mobile version does not differ, qualitatively speaking, from other Capcom mobile products. We therefore have well-designed characters but equipped with essential animations, made up of very few frames, who move within scenarios with dull colors and full of graphic elements that tend to repeat themselves. The most appreciable thing is the number of different opponents we will have to deal with, each characterized by peculiar characteristics. As far as the sound is concerned, the situation is not much better as it consists only of some fairly well made music. We have already talked about the control system: the layout of the keys is really guessed and adapts very well to any type of telephone, with an always prompt and precise response to inputs. PRO Great control system A good number of attacks available Good longevity AGAINST Mediocre animations Dull and repetitive scenarios Simplistic combat system", "date": "2008-01-25", "grade": "S.V."}
