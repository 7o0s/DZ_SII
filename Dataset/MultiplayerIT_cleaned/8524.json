It was 2007 and the second iteration of one of the first games that in this generation had shown, together with Oblivion, what the new consoles could do, convinced , but not overwhelming the favors of fans and enthusiasts. Then there was the Call of Duty cyclone that ousted even Halo from the throne of the most played FPS on Xbox 360 and since then the market has changed in favor of fast-paced, adrenaline-filled shooters and breathtaking graphics (when possible ). In light of all this, Ubisoft must have decided that it was time to take the field again and bring to the surface a different type of gameplay, made up of strategy and more reasoned approaches, seasoned with gadgets and coordination between members of a willing team do anything to win. That's the picture of Ghost Recon: Future Soldier and there's more than one reason to be happy with this return. There is crisis all over the world Ghosts are literally ghosts, soldiers trained to act invisible anywhere in the world to solve the most diverse crises. They have all kinds of gadgets at their disposal, which are not just frills to show off graphic effects at the highest levels of this generation of hardware, but real gimmicks to make the gameplay as varied as possible. The maps through which the campaign unfolds can be tackled in a thousand different ways, depending on how the player manages to analyze the picture of the situation and this is, without a doubt, the most important advantage of the single player of Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. The story, while based on the Tom Clancy license, certainly doesn't make one cry for a miracle. A team of Ghosts is killed on the trail of an explosive warhead stolen by some drug traffickers in South America. The player is put in charge of another team of four who must understand where the bomb comes from until he traces the usual fanta political espionage machination around the world. Yes, because the locations are the most diverse, from Africa, to the Middle East, up to Russia and Siberia and are linked by a series of interludes made with the game engine, but of far from excellent quality, indeed even lower than what the team managed to do with the graphics in game. In essence, the game is far more beautiful while holding the pad than when the story is told with rendered cutscenes, which give the impression that they were made very early in the three-year development span, without be adapted to what was subsequently obtained by the programmers. That said, the problem is that one feels jolted from one part of the globe to another without a real common thread or bite and it is difficult to follow the movements through the maps, which seem more like an excuse to put the player in situations more diverse and let him try, with great taste, all the electronic gadgets available. In short, the gameplay is the real engine of the experience, but, even taking into account that you are always in very beautiful locations from an aesthetic point of view, the paw is missing, the coup de theater that makes the characters excite or become attached to the epilogue. The gameplay is that of a third-person shooter, in which cover is essential, where thanks to the sensors thrown like bombs, enemies and their position on the field are identified. You have to study their movements and give your companions the order to eliminate them in order not to be discovered. The trick is to kill them a little at a time, killing those who walk along the edge of the map, to then get to the center, but at the risk of repeating ourselves, you feel free to do whatever you want, also because you can strike stealthily with ~fatalities~ that can be performed with ambushes from behind. The team's command system is excellent. A pointer locates the target and an icon turns blue when one of the squad members has it under fire, with a trail of light indicating the possible trajectory of the shot. At that point the player presses the key and the team moves in unison to very spectacular effect. In short, one feels like the real coordinators of a team of war machines. The hard life of the team leader The team is made up of four elements, each of which, if we are online, can be moved by a player via Xbox Live (the local split screen is only provided for Guerrilla mode). The possibilities of directing your teammates, when playing alone, are simply reduced to signaling the different targets, after which the highly sophisticated artificial intelligence of these will bring them into position for a perfect shot. Not only comrades move in man excellent way, allowing the player to clean up entire game sessions simply by giving indications on which enemies to eliminate, but also at the audio level the work is incredible. The other ghosts, all in Italian, comment on each area, giving precise indications on the position of the enemies as soon as they are sighted, with a detail comparable to that of the navigator in a driving game like Dirt. Paying attention to what they say and when you are not using the flying drone to reconnoiter the battlefield to give directions, looking at the map becomes almost superfluous, the voices of your soldiers are so exhaustive. When playing cooperatively, coordination must necessarily take place via microphone. Once the team leader (the host) has assigned everyone their target, things get more difficult also because, unlike the soldiers moved by the CPU, all flesh-and-blood players can put enemies on alert . Playing alone at the normal level (here called Veteran), the generosity of checkpoints and the possibility of being resurrected twice by the diligent companions make Ghost Recon: Future Soldier certainly not a difficult game, even if it is quite long, since it is impossible to complete the campaign in less than a good ten hours. There are moments later in the story where you are de-teamed or have to pass zones without raising any alarm and in those cases you may have to repeat some sections more than once, but nothing that causes your hair to pull out. The absence of real bosses doesn't help that feeling of lack of incisiveness of the campaign, in case you don't get caught up in the beautiful game mechanics and challenges. These are well indicated before each mission and must all be completed in order to unlock weapon upgrades (infinite between online and offline), which allow further variations on gameplay, from triggers that allow longer bursts, to underbarrel upgrades for secondary weapons for every weapon. To increase longevity, the Elite difficulty also takes care of it, with which Ghost Recon: Future Soldier becomes another game. In this case, in fact, you cannot be treated by your companions and each shot (you die after a machine gun anyway) leads to the repetition of a section, even when playing with friends online, which forces you to meticulously study the maps. The detachment is all too clear between the great softness of the Veteran level and the martial discipline of this which is the definitive mode for Ghost Recon lovers, but which could bore those who would have preferred an intermediate path between the two, probably. Heavy metal Gadgets are plentiful, from EMP bombs that disable radars and sensors, to blinding and smoke bombs. What makes the difference, however, is the drone that can be launched into the air and controlled to explore the maps and report the opponents to the team. In certain missions, it will have to be used as a ground vehicle, to be moved like a radio-controlled car, in order to be able to disable doors and ducts with a sound impulse. During the campaign you also have to deal with a mech, to be piloted as needed and capable of launching missiles and protecting the team. One of the easiest missions, also considering the power of the vessel, but one of great satisfaction with pieces of the seabed blowing up from everywhere Gunsmith As always, however, the real enjoyment of Ghost Recon: Future Soldier is online, thanks to competitive modes for up to twelve players and the new Guerrilla mode. This, a real novelty, allows up to four players to face fifty waves of enemies, of increasing difficulty, in five different maps. You have to reach an objective and hold it until the end of the waves, during which you are replenished with ammo, new weapons and extra abilities such as airstrike. A sort of slightly more simplified version of the Horde 2.0 of Gears of War 3, but which works great and which, given the good level of challenge even in Veteran, will keep players from all over the globe busy for a long time. also because you can resume at any time from the wave in which you left the previous session. Frenzy and fun are guaranteed, at least from the sessions we had with colleagues who are populating the servers in these early hours. For competitive multiplayer, the three classes of the beta (engineer, scout and stormtrooper) are provided, which give access to another three once you reach level fifty of experience with each one. Along the progression of each class (each only evolves when you use it) and for each of the two factions, you unlock new items and weapons that tangibly affectthe playability. The customization of the weapons marks the richness of the game with millions of different combinations and with items and accessories that are unlocked with both online and offline challenges and which make a big difference when you find yourself fighting online. Forget the simple Deathmatch, even in teams, which does not exist here. There are four modes, each of which always involves the achievement of a series of objectives to lead your team to victory. Conflict involves solving intermediate and random missions. Esca sees the forwards intent on scoring three goals, two of which are false, and a fourth which is revealed only when the real one is scored, while the defenders just have to let time pass (games generally last fifteen minutes, which makes us understand the different air you breathe compared to other shooters). In Sabotage there is a bomb in the middle of the map and the two teams must carry it to the opposing base and detonate it. Finally, in Siege there are no respawns and the team that realizes or defends the goal or the one that, more simply, survives the enemy blows wins, constituting the closest thing to the traditional playability of Ghost Recon. In the tests we carried out, despite having checked the speed of American connections on our gums, and even considering the low traffic of still sparsely populated games, the code seemed solid, with only a few cases of evident delay in the game signals. The maps, even very large ones such as Millstone or Refinery, are scattered with buildings, making life a little less easy for campers, typical of Ghost Recon's tactical gameplay, marking a slight change of direction in the structure which now, also for the objectives mobile of the highly popular ~Conflict~, requires a step more similar to that of other shooters of the latest generation. It takes patience, you have to learn all the possibilities offered by weapons and gadgets by heart, on pain of an infinite sequence of deaths that design a game for those looking for something much more technical than what the competition usually offers, but who by giving something to the new generation , may not fully convince the lovers of the first hour. Xbox 360 goals At the end of the Veteran level campaign, we have scored about 350 of the 1000 points available for Ghost Recon: Future Soldier and there is little to do, between Elite level, completing all the challenges in the levels and playing online by fulfilling the objectives of the modes competitive and guerrilla, those who want to get to the full loot will have to dedicate a large amount of hours to the game. There shouldn't be impossible goals, but neither should they be quickly achievable. Shining ghosts Ghost Recon: Future Soldier boasts first-rate technical execution with a frame rate that rarely drops below thirty frames per second and with only a few textures that leave a little to define. The rest is really excellent, including highly detailed polygonal models of the soldiers, excellent animations and a plethora of post-processing effects that perfectly convey the idea of a futuristic war, above all thanks to the visualization of the optical sensors and the information of the battlefields fired in the sky as you progress through the levels. An excellent job, which again clashes with the interlude scenes which, as mentioned, do not convince and do not even help the game which passes through thirteen very beautiful settings, but rarely memorable, except for a couple of really good situations . The team knows how to build balanced maps and gameplay, dosing many different situations that serve to break the monotony. There are sequences in which you have to escort VIPs by arm without the possibility of moving, but only having to worry about shooting enemy soldiers. Sequences aboard helicopters armed with machine guns, coordinated actions to be performed when all soldiers are in position and ready for action complete with bullet time. There are those couple of moments that make you remember a game forever, but these are probably the sensations reserved for very tense online sessions. Even the models of the weapons that break into a thousand pieces in the Gunsmith mode are made with care and the possibility of doing everything via the fast voice commands of the kinect also helps not to get lost among the many combinations. In the tests carried out, however, the recognition of body movements, useful for changing weapons or menus, could have been more precise.", "date": "2012-05-22", "grade": "8.8"}
