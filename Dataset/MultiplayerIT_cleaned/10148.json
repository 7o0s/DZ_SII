Now let's see if, with this Rune Factory: Frontier exclusively for Wii, we can say that the student has surpassed the master. Hoe passing you Since its debut on DS, the Rune Factory series has fielded a fundamental feature that differentiated it a lot from the various Harvest Moons, namely the mix of bucolic activities and a bit of healthy old dungeon crawling in an action-RPG sauce: a a peculiarity that has obviously been preserved in this Wii version, and which in fact represents the greatest strength of the product. The player takes on the role of Raguna (already the protagonist of the two previous portable episodes), a young man who settles in a small village and soon finds himself in charge of a farm with an attached plot of land. Despite the presence of some NPCs common to DS adventures, Rune Factory: Frontier is completely independent from a narrative point of view, even if it should be emphasized that the plot is one of the more sketchy aspects of the whole package. Without getting too lost in chatter, therefore, the game immediately puts the user to work, revealing itself to be even too brisk in its ways: the almost total absence of indications on what to do is unsettling, and it is not uncommon to find yourself - especially at the beginning - wandering around without goal in the hope of coming across the object indispensable to continue. Once these obstacles have been overcome, Rune Factory: Frontier offers a number of elements that will undoubtedly be familiar to Harvest Moon fans: the game universe is divided into four seasons, each characterized by its own crops, while the working day is made up of 24 units of time lasting about one minute each. Optimizing your activities immediately proves to be essential: you have to try to make the most of each solar cycle, while guaranteeing Raguna the right rest, on pain of a significant drop in its performance. As you progress in the adventure, the tasks to be performed increase, and there is no doubt that users not accustomed to this videogame subgenre can experience genuine frustration in the face of so many things to do and little time available. A strong sign of demarcation that inevitably makes Rune Factory: Frontier a product that can never be defined as a niche product as in this case. The stick and the carrot What is certain is that the developers of Neverland Company have absolutely not limited themselves as regards playful content: by exploiting the resources made available by the village, Raguna can cultivate fields, go fishing, cut wood, cook, build objects and so on, all through mini-games or simple menus. As if these activities weren't enough to keep the player busy, Rune Factory: Frontier also throws a substantial action-RPG component into the cauldron, in which you are called to face a handful of dungeons full of little monsters of all kinds, in order to accumulate points of experience, money and items but not only: every enemy that you meet on your path can in fact be tamed and exploited on the farm to perform certain tasks. More than ever in this particular juncture of the playful experience, the Marvelous Entertainment product is characterized by a very heavy grinding, or that process that pushes the user to move forward more for the achievement of a goal rather than for the pleasure of the game itself : seen ~from the outside~, in fact, Rune Factory: Frontier is an extremely repetitive and routine title, which for these reasons will hardly be able to extend its catchment area beyond the hard core of enthusiasts. From the point of view of this particular audience, however, it is a really valid title, even if it is not free from some defects. In particular, the developers seem not to have always been able to give a solid foundation to the enormous amount of work carried out by Raguna, and the result is a clear imbalance between well-structured activities and others that end up proving to be unpleasant fillers. A striking example in this sense comes from the so-called Runeys, spirits who at a certain point begin to populate the villabonus: to make things work properly, it is necessary to keep the four different types of Runeys in balance, running left and right and often having to remedy imbalances that seem to be randomly generated just to complicate the player's life. Staying on the subject of weaknesses, the menus don't always shine for convenience, and it's not uncommon to feel the lack of more accurate systems for keeping track of one's progress. Nothing to object instead with regard to the technical sector of Rune Factory: Frontier: graphically the title appears very accurate, the character design is more than good and the sound performs its task without infamy and without praise.", "date": "2010-03-15", "grade": "7.8"}
