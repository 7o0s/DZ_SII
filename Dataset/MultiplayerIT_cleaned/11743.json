{"name": "Call of Duty 4 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-4-recensione.html", "text": "As if to underline what was one of the most important gaming events of this year, the launch of Call of Duty 4, Activision has decided to take the portable route for its most famous brand, never attempted until now. Remark what then? The simple fact that the strength of a game like call of duty doesn't lie entirely in the realistic graphics sector, but also - and perhaps above all - in what are the foundations of the series, that extra touch that allows it to survive (and amaze) in the midst of a market that has all too quickly become saturated with first-person shooters set in the war era (whether it's the first, second or modern, it makes no difference). The bet called Call of Duty 4 Ds has been entrusted to a team known to very few called nspace, which came to the fore more for Geist's delays than for the goodness of the game itself. And you know what? The gamble can be considered won, Call of Duty 4 doesn't have the features of its older brother, but it manages - elbowing - to make itself a place in the crowded DS lineup as one of the most interesting shooters. Read on to find out why... The big differentiator for a game made on DS is the amount of dimensions used: following a recent and happy trend, imitating the example of the excellent (and equally ignored) Metroid Prime Hunters and the surprising Brother in Arms, the whole game is set in completely three-dimensional worlds, leaving the only representation of the weapon in use to a rather well disguised 2D. The game takes up the home counterpart in all respects: weapons, settings, assault teams, missions, keeping everything more on the line of the quote rather than the shameless copy. Also in this double-screen version the protagonist is a newly enlisted soldier who, following the short tutorial, finds himself catapulted into the heart of battle due to enemy attacks. And so we go to fight alongside the SAS (the British assault unit) aboard a merchant ship sailing in the middle of the Pacific to recover a series of documents, while the marines fight in the Middle East on the trail of Al- Asad. The CoD4 Ds missions act as a compendium of the lived history in CoD4 for consoles (just with some inexplicable script holes), taking place in parallel but presenting different and often more complex objectives than the major versions. In fact, if on consoles we often find ourselves with the sole purpose of defending such an objective or attacking another, the contribution of the touch screen allows us to differentiate the tasks assigned to the player. Attack and defense tasks are obviously the order of the day, but they are accompanied by document recovery by hacking terminals and by defusing (and priming) C4 charges and bombs. And it is precisely the last two objectives mentioned that give an extra boost to the game, putting the player in front of a series of puzzles to be completed in order to continue or finish the mission. In the first case, the recovery of documents, the touch screen is transformed into a sort of printed circuit in which by combining 4 transistors at the same time to the single energy source it is possible to unlock access to the encrypted file; the second proposed interaction, the defusing, instead puts the player in front of a series of bundles of electric cables to be joined in the right sequence (and above all with good precision and a steady hand) to be able to avoid the sad ending of the situation. Pixel bullets The game control system uses a mapping of the commands in all respects similar to the one already seen, tried and tested with Brother in Arms Ds. The pointer of the weapon can be moved with the stylus, the character in use can be moved within the setting with the analog cross and the fire can be fired with the left trigger (the commands, if the person is left-handed, can be completely mirrored, with the four buttons used for movement and the right back for fire). On the touch screen, on the other hand, the second level of control develops, with three 'buttons' to be used to: pick up an object (whether it's a weapon or a document, it makes no difference), change the weapon in use (by sliding the stylus among the various possibilities offered by your battle arsenal) and above all to switch from the use of a firearm to the classic grenade. The probably least successful expedient of the game (and unfortunately, also the most decisive) is the one relating to the passage from the normal fire mode to the zoomed one with the viewfinder: the command can in fact be activated with a very normal double pressure on the touch screen, pressure which - due to the nature of the game - is very easy to create by mistake when you are thereto move within the settings, constantly moving the weapon in an attempt to prevent any enemy attack. It therefore happens very often to insert the viewfinder mode without really wanting it, and to have considerable difficulty in deactivating it, creating moments of turmoil and great confusion while the enemies attack the player, leaving him without the possibility of replying. Call of Duty 4 Ds comes with a respectable graphic sector, with a slightly lower rendering of the settings and depth of field than that already seen in Brother in Arms Ds, but with a whole series of events capable of leaving your mouth open. By shortening the field of view of the game, the developers had the opportunity to focus on other elements that are far more impactful and decidedly more related to the major series, elements such as the possibility of blowing up cars and putting movement of vehicles such as helicopters, perfectly modeled in all their parts, to make the situations proposed by the game even more credible and immersive. A particular applause must also be made for what concerns music and dubbing, both excellently made and present in practically every phase of the game. Unlike the single player, which manages - in proportion - to keep up with what the console adventure is, multiplayer, however varied and well done, does not confirm the good things seen (and played) online. CoD4 Ds allows four players to challenge each other locally (also shared) in the classic modes deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag and hunter / hunted, where the real and great absentee is the online aspect. A real shame and a missed opportunity, in a game that in fact bases its fortune on world-level clashes. Call of Duty 4 for Ds is a title to remember, not so much because it is one of the best games on the Nintendo laptop, but because the developers have managed with a series of shrewd choices to bring the idea that lies behind the CoD brand, adapting it to what the DS knows and can offer. The single player is long and well structured, the missions run parallel to those for consoles, embellished with a series of very well thought out game gimmicks. Leaving aside the definitely rich but deficient online multiplayer section, some control problems and the inevitable and sporadic graphical bugs, CoD4 Ds is a bet won by Activision and certainly one of the best shooters on Nintendo's dual screen. Pros Excellent transposition of the original series Good variety of objectives to complete Music and dubbing at the top Cons Not very original Multiplayer not online Small problems in the controls", "date": "2007-12-12", "grade": null}
