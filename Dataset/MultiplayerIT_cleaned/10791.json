{"name": "Biliardo in tasca", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anytime-pool.html", "text": "There is no doubt that billiards is an exciting and fun sport that can be practiced at various levels: from the complete beginner who gets one shot out of ten right to the professional who blows the ball and manages to make multiple holes. The video games that simulate this discipline are varied, even if in the PC and console fields they have never conquered a large portion of users. Unlike racers or possibly football simulations, in fact, accessing a pool table is very simple and the direct experience remains far superior to a video game, however realistic and accurate it may be. Entering the field of portable devices, however, things change profoundly: at this juncture, billiard games present themselves as immediate and fun entertainment, available at any time you feel like playing a few shots. The story of Anytime Pool, in this sense, however, is a bit different: the title developed by Distinctive Developments was born as a simple playful application for Facebook, which allows users of the famous social network to challenge each other in matches that can last up to days given their ~turn-based~ structure. On mobile, of course, the game takes on the more classic connotations of an old-fashioned simulation, which in addition to quick games and challenges with a ~local~ friend offers an interesting online multiplayer. As usual, however, it is the career mode that plays the leading role: once a profile has been created, we will be able to access a series of games that will see us face various characters in sequence, increasingly colorful and cunning, using the rules of the three versions of existing billiards. Completing all the internships and all the challenges really takes a lot of time, so in terms of longevity, an excellent job has certainly been done. Moving on to an analysis of the gameplay, the action is simple and multifaceted, even if some significant elements are missing. The balls take a while to stop after a shot, and if on the one hand this may appear more realistic, on the other hand it forces us into boring additional waiting times, which added together unfortunately can only lower the pace of the games. Shot control takes place via the d-pad and it is also possible to determine the point where the ball is hit by the cue, to give the shot a rotation. The problem is that the possibility of rotating the direction of the launch in a slower and more precise way has not been added, which often forces us to cumbersome returns to check the trajectory as it is represented on the screen. The power of the shot is expressed through a bar which, however, we can adjust manually, without having to count on the reflexes: the lower the value, the stronger the shot will be. Anytime Pool boasts fully polygonal graphics, which show us the matches through two shots: the close-up one to make shots and one from the distance, which takes up the whole pool table once we've made our move or when it's the opponent's turn. The behavior of the balls is quite realistic, the usual indicators for the trajectory appear on the screen and the engine never suffers from stuttering or slowdowns. In the background, however, there are some notes to move, in the sense that we will often find ourselves playing in really ugly environments to look at, with poorly defined and even less inspired textures. The sound accompaniment consists of moderate quality MIDI music, which does not conquer but does not disturb either.", "date": "2009-03-27", "grade": "S.V."}
