{"name": "Resident Evil: The Missions (3D)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-the-missions-3d.html", "text": "As is known, mobile video games are always made in different versions, in order to meet the highest possible range of compatibility: in the case of Resident Evil: The Missions, however, the discussion is not limited to graphic quality more or less elaborate depending on the device used. The two titles created by Capcom are in fact different in form and substance, to the point that it seems almost an inconsiderate decision to label them under the same name. Suffice it to say that, while the two-dimensional incarnation (already reviewed by Wirelessgaming) is configured as a pure and simple first-person shooter, the 3D product object of this review is an adventure more similar to the ~real~ Resident Evil, although always broken up into short but numerous missions. The similarities begin right from the cosmetic sector, as in the first chapters of the saga characterized by 2D backdrops and polygonal characters: in this The Missions the result is certainly appreciable, especially as regards the excellent definition of Jill's three-dimensional model. The entire Capcom work is still remarkable from a technical point of view, even if the limitations of the mobile support are seen mainly in the not excellent quality of the images that act as a background and in the realization of the various enemies, visibly less cared for than the protagonist. Fortunately, however, Resident Evil: The Missions does not inherit the woody control system from its illustrious ancestors, here decidedly more simplified and accessible: four keys to move in as many directions, one to interact with the elements of the scenario, one to activate/deactivate the run and one to enter aiming mode. The latter must obviously be triggered in the fights, and allows you to hit zombies and the like by aiming at the head, torso or legs: the mechanism, although obviously limited, works, even if it cannot improve the anything but lightning-fast pace of the clashes on fire. However, Resident Evil: The Missions is not an action game, and in fact the various missions range between the most disparate objectives (such as saving civilians, collecting certain objects or reaching a place in the shortest possible time) without forgetting the presence of the very bad Nemesis to revive things a bit. The pyramid scheme and the crossroads nature of the missions also remain, an element capable of providing a great boost to longevity, but in the end, Resident Evil: The Missions is a slightly less exciting experience than it seems: credit must be given to Capcom for having had some excellent intuitions about the pill-missions and the cosmetic realization of the product, but the ups and downs of the game almost makes us regret the ~ignorant~ shootings of the simpler 2D version.
