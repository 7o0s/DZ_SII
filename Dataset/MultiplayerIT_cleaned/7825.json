{"name": "C'era una volta il West", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118893-call-of-juarez-gunslinger-cera-una-volta-il-west.html", "text": "Having abandoned (fortunately) the torrid modern atmospheres of the previous The Cartel, the Call of Juarez franchise of the Polish Techland returns to its origins, those of the Wild West with Gunslinger, a real tribute to those who love the Frontier, the dusty saloons, the green prairies and rides at sunset, all then seasoned with the encounter-clash with the legendary gunslingers that we have all come to know in dozens of Hollywood films and why not in our own Tex. In short, a real encyclopedia of the West, then embellished by a peculiar narrative system, very refined and inventive, which enhances the digital delivery publication of the title, proposed on PC, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. Lead by the bucketful We are in Abilene, it is 1910. The old Silas Greaves, legendary bounty hunter enters a saloon, and here he begins to tell his story to interested patrons. The missions that make up the campaign are his memories, Silas narrates, indeed he tells us, with a constant voice-over throughout the game, his epic story, his long ride that made him meet people like Billy The Kid or Butch Cassidy without forget of course the most dangerous outlaw gangs of the time. But the memories of an old man are certainly not written in stone: more often than not the level will change shape under our feet, some characters will drop from above as just like manna from heaven, or if a section ends badly, Silas will warn us that it didn't quite go like this, making us replay it as we remember at the time. In short, a nice solution, alienating and used intelligently sparingly, then perfectly inserted in the clash between history, the official one and the one that Silas remembers in his own way. In short, we are pleasantly surprised and enjoy observing how Techland has ~expanded~ the marked linearity of the gameplay. From a purely playful point of view, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is an extremely classic and no-frills first-person shooter, although there are some gimmicks to enliven the bland shootings. Just the shootings, not the duels or boss fights, are the weakest part of the title. In fact, the choice to set everything up in the name of a total, fast and frenetic arcade has made the game mechanics almost equal to a Mad Dog McRee-style shooting gallery, in which the artificial intelligence limits itself to getting up and down from the covers (almost always leaving a large part of the body at our mercy), also being found well in the open to favor precious headshots. In short, the scripting does everything to allow us to splice the opposing cowboys by moving quickly from cover to cover, but at the same time the airiness of the levels and the good number of enemies present who attack us from all sides manage to pose a good challenge. especially as you progress through the game. To give more movement to these bland mechanics, in addition to the frankly useless quick time events, Techland has inserted a double declination of the bullet time. The first, ~active~, called Concentration, allows us to activate slow motion after a good series of hits, especially the lethal headshots: the enemies are highlighted in red and go down on the first shot. The ~passive~ one allows us to dodge a bullet when we are close to death, with a nice animation on the screen that is so Matrix. In addition there is also a slight, but effective, ~role~ growth of Silas. By leveling up, it is possible to access three distinct branches which increase the effectiveness of the protagonist in using two pistols, rifles and shotguns, unlocking real ~perks~ such as the possibility of reloading faster, aiming better, slow down time briefly without accessing Focus and much more. In practice, you choose and improve your style of play, including your weapon. Xbox 360 goals Call of Juarez: Gunslinger rewards the player with 26 objectives for a total of 400 points: the more challenging ones commit us to dissecting the game in its entirety, such as finding all the nuggets to have a complete background of the story, or unlocking all the skills of growth. Some are instead quite challenging, just mentioning winning all duels honorably, but also shooting a bird while killing our opponent is not an everyday thing. Old legends Where the game manages to untie itself from mechanics as fast and frenetic as all in all bland and not very incisive is in the clashes with the bosses and above all in the duels to the death. The former are for the most part well choreographed and involve us in using thoroughly and with knowledgeion of cause our entire arsenal, from pistols to sniper rifles, passing through dynamite, strictly with short fuse. They effectively manage to diversify the action and above all they shouldn't be taken lightly, mindful of the easy life in the missions, otherwise game over is guaranteed. The dynamics of the duels was instead restored through the simultaneous use of two sticks. With the left one we have to bring the right hand closer to the gun to facilitate a quick extraction (a percentage tells us clearly how we are going) while with the right hand we are asked to follow and therefore focus on the goal. We must not shoot before our opponent makes the first move, if we do, feeling our heart beat wildly, we win easy, but we will say goodbye to the precious experience points, also being branded of cowardice. The tension is great, we really need to coordinate and extract with the right timing, otherwise we would be mercilessly killed. Or we will be remembered for the infamous who kill without honor. The game offer set up by Techland does not end here. Next to the main campaign, the Arcade Mode and Duel find space. The first extremes, as the name implies, the arcade bases of the game mechanics, and invites us, indeed pushes us to run through the levels ringing combo after combo to raise the score multiplier, all using the arsenal that the challenge makes us available. Duello instead focuses only on facing all the legends of the title with only five lives available. Again reflexes and concentration are necessary to get to the end. Visually, Techland has used the cel shading technique to take us to the Far West. The proprietary Chrome Engine does a decent job of staging rather varied and undoubtedly evocative levels that go hand in hand with the good characterization of Silas and the ~most prominent~ outlaws. Obviously given the limited space available in a digital delivery title we cannot expect anything exceptional, and in fact Gunslinger suffers from these limitations, but it still has a good impact even if the modeling, detail and general cleaning cannot fail among the cons at the bottom of the review. What matters most, however, net of the above criticisms, is that Call of Juarez: Gunslinger effectively takes us to the Frontier territories, which almost makes a good but not memorable cosmetics fade into the background. Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is a tribute to the old West, total arcade, but with some obvious problems", "date": "2013-05-22", "grade": "7.5"}
