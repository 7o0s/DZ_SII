{"name": "Bladestorm Nightmare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/147168-bladestorm-nightmare-spade-spuntate.html", "text": "From 1337 to 1453, with some more or less lasting pauses in between, what is remembered in the history books as the ~Hundred Years War~, was fought, a very long and exhausting conflict between France and England which ended with the expulsion of Britons from continental soil. The political maneuvers and bloody battles on the field involved charismatic characters such as Joan of Arc and Edward the ~Black Prince~, as well as various rulers of both factions, figures and events that over the years have inspired numerous films, novels and even videogames, among which Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War (2007) by Tecmo Koei stands out for relevance, despite the different poetic licences. ~Illegitimate~ son of the famous Dynasty Warriors saga, from which it took several ingredients from musou translated into a real-time strategy game, the title developed by Omega Force came out quietly on last generation consoles, where it gathered overall unflattering opinions, although offers some interesting concepts. About eight years after its debut, the Japanese software house has decided to resurrect its creature on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (on PC it will arrive in May), thanks to the usual updated graphics, some novelties in the gameplay and above all a new mode called Nightmare, which in addition to indicating the renewed name of the game, adds fantasy creatures in the medieval historical context. After putting the Sony flagship version through its paces, here's what we think. Strategy musou Bladestorm lands on next-generation consoles Alternate Middle Ages After having downloaded the approximately 15 GB that make up the data package with some difficulty and having witnessed an epic (but poorly inspired) CG introduction, we are projected into the slim main menu of the Japanese work, behind which stands a polygonal reproduction of the sumptuous cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, which however literally pales in comparison to the one appreciated in the discussed Assassin's Creed Unity. Beyond the two main campaigns, namely the Hundred Years War and the new Nightmare mode, which we will discuss shortly, it is possible to access the so-called ~Free Mode~ where you can fight the main battles already unlocked, and above all the full-bodied editor , which allows you to customize your digital alter ego down to the smallest detail, with a myriad of haircuts and indicators to modify the face. TO unlike the design devoted to the excesses of Dynasty Warriors, Bladestorm: Nightmare offers a decidedly more serious approach, although it is always declined in a Japanese key, with the inevitable flowing multicolored hair, busty damsels and doe eyes, elements that clash a little with the context medieval historian, while carrying out its task admirably. As specified, the work of Omega Force winks at the classic Musou, both for the vastness of the battlefield and for the numbers involved, but the player, instead of taking control of a single practically unstoppable hero, commands entire combat units (quickly interchangeable with each other) placing themselves at their head. The direct approach to the clashes is arcade and similar to what has already been seen in the historic Tecmo Koei saga, with simple and special attacks (with cooldown) assigned to individual keys, however it is linked to logical dynamics that recall the traditional Chinese morra. Each of the available units, from cavalry to archers, passing through spearmen, simple soldiers armed with swords, maces, axes and so on, in fact has a set of privileged targets and nemeses to avoid (who would ride a horse against a formation of pikemen? ), the playful fulcrum around which the strategies to be adopted on the battlefield revolve. Although such an approach may recall the one appreciated in Creative Assembly's famous Total War saga, in Bladestorm: Nightmare everything is reduced to observing a bright icon positioned on enemy units, which quickly suggests when it is appropriate to launch an attack or to ~grab~ another more effective allied unit. In the main campaign, the same seen on older generation consoles, the player plays a mercenary general who can switch from the English faction to the French one freely, accepting contracts (ie missions) in the tavern, a real hub where the innkeeper and the patrons from time to time they provide new ones, marking the progress of the adventure. The plot, as specified, is shaped on the main events and protagonists of the Hundred Years War, and it is possible to participate in many of the battles that determined its fate.nevertheless, the interpretation is always a little out of line and full of poetic license: overall, the plot represents a completely marginal component of Bladestorm: Nightmare, effectively delegating emotions to the noise of weapons alone. The Untouchables The main aim of the player is to conquer and defend the various settlements scattered along the huge French territory, where it is sometimes necessary to face simple alternative missions (such as the escort), although the entire playful scaffolding revolves around the fighting and the systematic elimination of the lieutenants enemies, generally not very charismatic. It all begins in Normandy, where the first skirmishes to gain strategic positions follow one another without interruption; despite having conquered a certain settlement with France or England, in fact, in subsequent contracts the strategic chessboard does not always take into account the actual progress made, making the plot that supports the Japanese work even more tenuous. In the tavern, in addition to acquiring missions, you can buy and sell equipment from the merchant, but above all manage the RPG component of the title, given that with the experience gained in the field you level up, and the points can be spent to improve the attacks of your units or unlock new ones by collecting and buying the pages of the so-called ~Book~. The units are numerous and divided into categories, including not only traditional warriors of the time, but also specialists such as buglers and lansquenets, and even exotic divisions such as ninjas, Roman centurions and Mongol sabers, which obviously have nothing to do with the Hundred Years War. This great variety, certainly appreciable, however, clashes with one of the most serious gaps in the playful framework of Bladestorm: Nightmare, or the extreme ease with which it is possible to mow down enemy battalions through simple button mashing. If in the very first clashes it is necessary to weigh one's moves and follow the Chinese morra logic we have mentioned, concentrating the upgrades on a specific unit of warriors, it becomes so strong that in a very short time the strategic factor can be beautifully ignored. This aspect, combined with the basic repetitiveness of the action and the vastness of the map, which often forces tedious and kilometric movements, gradually increases the monotony and reduces the interest in the game, also tainted by an artificial intelligence to say the least deficit. A real shame, because when things work Bladestorm: Nightmare can be a pleasant pastime, especially playing in co-op or online PvP, although in our tests we encountered several access problems and scarcity of available games. Unlike the original work, in this new version it is possible to manage up to four generals simultaneously, assigning each of them its own objective in the briefing, or it is possible to join forces to create a real steamroller machine, capable of annihilating any obstacle on screen like an ocean of hungry locusts on a cultivated field. Not even the commanders and the grotesque guardians who appear after liberating the largest settlements are able to contain such an effective threat, strong not only in the single shots of the various units - which can be moved in line with the simple push of a button - but also in a devastating group move, which can be launched after slaying dozens of enemies and charging the appropriate bar. The Nightmare mode represents the main novelty of this version of Bladestorm for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, an alternative campaign where the French and English forces are forced to join forces to face a terrible common threat, a demonic army made up of goblins, orcs, skeletons, dragons and other fantasy-derived bestiary led by none other than an attractive Joan of Arc. The new mode, conceptually similar to some expansions with zombies that appeared on other games, such as the beautiful Undead Nightmare of Red Dead Redemption, works exactly like the basic title, with the only difference represented by the monstrous enemy units, sometimes capable of very powerful attacks magical. Among other things, many of these new units can become part of their own army, while the single missions, for the occasion divided into chapters and not into contracts, are generally longer, dramatically increasing the kilometers to be covered on foot or by horse. The plot revolves around a mysterious sword and the figure of Joan of Arc in a ~demonic~ key, but alsowhich in this case is a completely forgettable aspect, above all due to characters with very little appeal. Overall, however, it is a remarkable addition in terms of longevity, and will certainly be appreciated by all those who manage to turn a blind eye to the structural deficiencies of the Omega Force title. Tighten the crabs The term ~remastered~ has probably become one of the most hated in this young generation of consoles, literally flooded with old productions - more or less dated - sometimes revised and corrected only in terms of fluidity and resolution. Although Bladestorm Nightmare does not represent a simple remastered work, given the additions we have mentioned, the updated graphics represent one of the elements promoted by Omega Force, while not achieving the desired results. While on the one hand the improvements on the main characters are appreciable, especially as regards the care of clothes, armor and accessories, the same cannot be said of the immense battlefield, where quality has simply preferred to favor quantity. The first illustrious victim of such a choice is precisely the frame rate, which defining lame is a compliment: beyond annoying collapses in certain particularly chaotic circumstances, it is rather depressing to have to play entire sequences with a fluidity well below thirty frames for second. The map, although vast and well-finished in terms of design, thanks to wooded areas, castles, rivers and villages, which offer an appreciable medieval bucolic cross-section, shows the side to annoying pop-up phenomena, washed-out textures and even questionable aberrations chromatics for objects at a distance. Polygonal interpenetrations are the order of the day, while the physical management of groups of soldiers can sometimes be extremely confusing. Emblematic is a mission in which it is necessary to escort a merchant's wagon, dragged like a styrofoam box at the mercy of the waves when it comes into contact with other units. Although the optimization and attention to detail are therefore not at home, it must be emphasized that the general glance can also be satisfactory, thanks to the copious number of units that flood the screen and some particularly successful scenarios. Too bad that the faces of the soldiers often repeat themselves indefinitely (some cutscenes starring groups of clones are ridiculous), while the animations are generally woody and not very varied. The physical sensation of the clashes is also almost impalpable, given that the game interface is flooded with abundant counters in pure arcade style, with large colored numbers and pachinko sound effects. The technical picture closes with a horrendous English dubbing (Italian subtitles are not available), while the soundtrack ranges from the inspired to the pompous, with some catchy orchestral pieces and cantatas suitable for the duel.", "date": "2015-03-23", "grade": "6.0"}
