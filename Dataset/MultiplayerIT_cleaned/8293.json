This is more or less what happens to actors who play a certain role in a successful television series for years: people are used to seeing them in the role of their character and there are few who manage to successfully dedicate themselves to something else. Now, it is clear that all game developers would like to be in the position of Rovio, a company that made a big splash thanks to the extraordinary success of Angry Birds. But after four essentially the same episodes, with a few variations on the theme and little more, the pressure began to mount to have something different. And here it is, Bad Piggies, or the ~dark side~ of the blockbuster that we all know, the game that puts us on the side of the green pigs in their plan to take revenge on those damn pissed off birds. Is it still the same gameplay rehashed? No, absolutely no. Indeed, it is surprisingly different. The physical context remains, the materials each with its own specific weight, the explosions and the traditional three-star system to certify the goodness of our performance, but otherwise we are faced with a real action puzzle, even refined in some of its mechanics, which starts with almost one hundred levels and which, over the course of the weeks, will be further enriched with contents, perhaps focusing with even greater emphasis on its extraordinary strengths. Screws and bolts There are three modes that Bad Piggies makes available to us: ~Ground Hog Day~, ~When Pigs fly~ and ~Sand-box~. The first sees us build land vehicles with the aim of collecting certain objects and reaching the ~finish~ in each level, the second instead explores the aerial possibilities of the pigs and therefore equips them with balloons, propellers and bellows for inertial flight sessions. finally, the third provides us with all the materials unlocked in the first two (obtained thanks to the best evaluations) to face very demanding mixed routes, which must be studied through numerous ~trial and error~ sessions to understand what shape to give to our vehicle, which ~bricks~ to use to build it and which thrusters to equip it with. We could talk about LEGO to identify Rovio's source of inspiration, but in reality the reinterpretation of the gameplay of Banjo-Kazooie: Screws and Bolts, a title developed by Rare in 2008 exclusively for Xbox 360, in which we were to use different objects and materials to create vehicles with the characteristics necessary to solve the turn problem. And they are precisely the problems we will have to deal with in Bad Piggies, within a puzzle dimension properly so-called (not like in Angry Birds, therefore, which is rather a simple action game), which at first may perhaps frighten who expected something simpler, but which gives a tremendous depth to the experience. At the beginning of each stage we see an overview of the path that we will have to cover, then we move on to a very simple ~box~ editor in which we can move the objects located in the lower part of the screen: cells in which to eventually place our piglets, wheels, the aforementioned balloons, fans, bellows, motors that can automate their activation, umbrellas for gliding and those for moving, counterweights and even explosives, which can provide us with the necessary thrust to reach otherwise inaccessible areas provided you want to sacrifice your newly built vehicle. After some initial hesitation, it will be a real pleasure to find different ways to achieve our goal, perhaps by gently acting on the vehicle's engines to avoid the pitfalls of the scenario. The technical sector, as per tradition, appears functional to the gameplay: no revolution, but the Rovio style is now very recognizable, which in itself is a plus.", "date": "2012-10-02", "grade": "9.0"}
