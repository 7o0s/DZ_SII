It is clearly a first step for the franchise on the Windows platform (increasingly in line with the console releases, it must be said) if we consider that the chapter in question is nothing more than an improved version of Earth Defense Force 2025, with more enemies , additional missions and some other tweaks. In short, we are talking about a product that already suffered from an old-gen technical realization in 2014, albeit functional to the spectacular action that characterizes the gameplay of the series, and which in the transition to PC only gains stability and a potentially higher graphic resolution. In fact, the frame rate problems that afflicted the game on PlayStation 3 and even on PlayStation 4 have been resolved, so you no longer risk encountering slow-motion battles when literally hundreds of enemies, allied soldiers and giant robots move on the screen; but, at the same time, the (scarce) complexity of the polygonal models, the basic textures and the retro effects have remained intact, to underline once again the parallelism between Earth Defense Force and certain B series sci-fi television productions, or the same Japanese science fiction of the 60s and 70s. Earth Defense Force debuts on PC with an episode that will not disappoint those who have always wanted to try the series Astrobots As already mentioned, Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair is basically a remaster of Earth Defense Force 2025, so we find in the game the same four selectable character classes and an almost identical mission structure, with a campaign featuring almost a hundred internships to be tackled in single player, in local cooperative via split-screen or online for a maximum of four participants. We had the opportunity to test the multiplayer co-op and it seemed valid, free of latency problems and potentially a lot of fun, even if at the moment it is not possible to join games that have already started and this necessarily slows down the pace of the game. experience. As for the news compared to the version released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there have been some changes to the balance of the units, with the Fencers who can finally jump and the Air Raiders capable of calling vehicles even in underground scenarios; but above all a work has been done aimed at giving greater visual coherence to the battles: at our side we will have a large number of NPCs who fight the giant insects, the alien vehicles, the huge Independence Day-style ships and the robots that invade from time to time Japanese cities. In short, the atmosphere has gained a lot from this update, and the developers have seen fit to also put the proverbial icing on the cake, inserting new missions in which we will have to face a terrifying kaiju using none other than Balam, the ~Walking Fortress~, a robot giant with a classic but convincing design, terribly slow just to underline its exaggerated dimensions. A dream come true for Japanese anime fans. The musketeers of the vast skies The cornerstones of the Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair experience are represented by the peculiarities of the four selectable classes, by the progression system for each of them and by the enormous number of weapons that can be unlocked by progressing through the campaign. The first class is that of the Ranger, a fairly fast and moderately resistant soldier, armed with a powerful machine gun and a devastating bazooka with which he can target enemies and blow up a large group of them. Then we have the Air Raider, a support class that can use and summon vehicles on the battlefield, as well as land shots from great distances thanks to an arsenal that includes various sniper rifles. We then arrive at the Fencer, an ultra-armored soldier, very slow in moving but able to defend himself thanks to a shield and to attack in a particularly effective way using a Gatling gun and a devastating spear for close-range battles. Finally there are the Wing Divers, real Amazons equipped with a jetpack that allows them to reach considerable heights, for example to climb to the top of skyscrapers and target enemy troops from there thanks to the devastating plasma cannon or, if necessary, to a repeating pulse rifle. The downside for this class is represented by the low resistance and the obligation to wait for the restoration of energy, even just to shoot, herelora has flown too long. However, it remains our preferred option, given the dynamism that gives the gameplay being able to move so quickly vertically and be able to carry out devastating attacks from a distance. In the case of Wing Divers, for example, progression leads not only to a desirable armor strengthening, but also to the unlocking of weapons such as homing missiles, pulse rifles and so on. Here they are! Here they are! The formula of Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair has also remained unchanged compared to the previous chapters, although this in no way represents a limit for PC users who are preparing to try this experience for the first time. Of course, the selling price appears a little too high considering the nature of the product and its assumptions, both structural and technical. The missions are in fact exciting and engaging, but also rather repetitive: we are usually asked to eliminate all enemies on the map and possibly attack the vehicles they come from, collecting the objects dropped on the ground with a view to the aforementioned progression. Despite this, alone it is a lot of fun and playing online in co-op with three other friends can create fantastic moments, especially on the higher difficulty levels. Factors to be taken into due consideration, but which cannot make us turn a blind eye to such dated graphics and the presence of an incredible number of more or less serious glitches, in particular polygonal interpenetrations. As mentioned above, the simplicity of the models and effects is put at the service of the gameplay, giving us a boundless and completely destructible map, as well as a huge amount of enemies and allies on the screen, in this case without the slowdowns that were noticeable in the versions console. Visual adjustments are equally essential, with only the selection of the desired resolution and type of antialiasing, possibly marred by a bug that makes interface texts unreadable if your desktop uses fonts with DPI higher than 100%.", "date": "2016-07-26", "grade": "6.5"}
