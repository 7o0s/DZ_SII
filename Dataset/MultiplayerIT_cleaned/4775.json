NetherRealm Studios wanted to include the legendary ninja from the celestial jacket to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Mortal Kombat, and in the arcade mode (the ~Combat Simulator~) this choice is justified through the expedient of the dimensional passages: Sub-Zero is suddenly projected into the world of Injustice 2 and, having faced the threat of Brainiac, decides to face him to complete his own path of redemption. Will the powers deriving from the cold be enough to stand up to the powerful DC villain and his minions? The evolution of the species Sub-Zero's debut dates back to the first chapter of Mortal Kombat, in 1992: belonging to the fearsome Lin Kuei clan, the ninja with a black and light blue uniform is endowed with the ability to suddenly lower the temperature around him, creating darts of ice and immobilizing their opponents. The latest iteration of the character, seen in Mortal Kombat XL, boasted a strapped, armless costume that was completely open at the sides, with a rigid mask from which icy breath escaped. For his debut on the roster of Injustice 2, the legendary warrior's appearance has been modified once again, inserting a traditional type hood, transforming the chest straps into something more like armor, adding shoulder pads composed of spikes of ice and, most importantly, a cape. From an aesthetic point of view, however, it is possible to make various modifications as the objects are unlocked during the games, by opening the mother boxes. This operation draws on the fighter's history, thus offering a welcome fan service, and allows not only to change his appearance based on one of his previous looks, but also to modify his abilities accordingly, as happens for all the other characters of the rosters. For more details on this, take a look at our review of Injustice 2. Cold heart Sub-Zero's road test reveals a solid and deadly fighter, surprisingly well balanced, who can express himself both from distance and in close exchanges. The ice swords that the character creates by instantly solidifying the humidity in the air allow him to throw opponents into the air like a traditional uppercut, but also the combinations of punches and kicks are confirmed as valid and effective in the horizontal progression, perhaps concluding the assault with a charged punch to throw the enemy over a wall and move to a different area of the scenario. Even the grip takes advantage of ice swords, but not only: Sub-Zero pierces the opponent with a blade and then appears in front of him with a mallet: a visually very painful technique! The use of the Circle / B key allows you to create an ice bait that immediately freezes the enemy if it is touched, and which we can also throw when needed. As for the set of special moves, the repertoire includes the traditional freezing projectile, a disruptive ground punch that allows you to respond to a flying attack, the inevitable slide, a charged ice punch, the ability to teleport from side to side Another part of the stage and to use the ice hammer, both from the ground and in mid-air. And what about the super? When the relative gauge is full: Sub-Zero freezes the ground under the enemy's feet, surprises them with a very rapid slide by throwing them into the air and turning them into a block of ice before it hits the ground, then hits them with a mallet and teleports on the other side of the location, ~receiving~ him with a barrage of darts that pierce him and closing the combination by grabbing the victim and crushing him to the ground. So many possibilities and facets for a character that is certainly worth adding to your roster, even more so if you are a fan of Mortal Kombat and have enjoyed Injustice 2. Too bad only for the slightly high price and the impossibility of saving anything by opting for the Fighter Pack 1, which costs 19.99 euros.", "date": "2017-07-15", "grade": null}
