{"name": "La lunga marcia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99370-dear-esther-la-lunga-marcia.html", "text": "The task of describing Dear Esther is extremely easy, almost childish. The player is only required to walk through the levels and listen to the protagonist recite letters without rhyme or reason, addressed to a certain Esther (hence the title). The only interaction is a flashlight that the protagonist turns on automatically when he enters dark environments and that is of no use. If desired, there would also be the possibility to zoom by clicking on the left mouse button, but that's really all. You will understand well by yourself that, if you are looking for a traditional video game, you can also look elsewhere without hesitation. However, before running away, try to make an effort and read on. We will not try to convince you of how good or bad Dear Esther is, which could be given any vote between 0 and 10 without falling into any contradiction, but we will try to explain its genesis and understand what profound contents melt its charm that has struck more than someone (in a few hours of launch he sold the copies he needed to break even). Dear Esther was born in 2007 as a mod of Half-Life 2, created for a university project of the Arts & Humanities Research Council. The artistic project, in its simplicity, is so popular that the authors obtain funding from the Indie Fund to develop it and turn it into an independent product. The original author, Dan Pinchbeck, is joined by a key figure, the artist Robert Briscoe, to whom we owe, among his other works, the visual style of Mirror's Edge. Briscoe takes up what he did with the mod and reshapes the game world as if he were a sculptor in front of a block of marble just scratched by another artist's chisel. The soundtrack is instead created by the talented Jessica Curry, who interprets the action by creating songs of great emotional impact and perfectly linked with the lyrics written by Pinchbeck. In short, you have certainly understood that Dear Esther has worked on young people who have talent to spare and who, from an audiovisual point of view, have done an exceptional job. However, the fundamental question remains open: how do you like a game that, after all, is just a long march? Emotional landscape We could boil it all down to ~you call them emotions if you want,~ but by doing so we wouldn't have explained much and would have just piled on a bad citation. Dear Esther is slow, the protagonist's monologues, i.e. the reading of some letters addressed to a certain Esther, whose identity will be discovered only towards the end, are apparently disconnected, contradictory and difficult to understand, especially if you don't know well English (fortunately the game is being translated into our language, see box below). There is objectively nothing to do. You walk and admire the melancholy landscape. And yet, if you let yourself be carried away and get into the right spirit, Dear Esther becomes an all-encompassing experience. You are soon invaded by the same loneliness that drags the protagonist to his destiny (it is tiring to tell a similar title without mentioning the plot, sorry if there is a preview), you admire the environment in which he is forced to live and savor it the sense of emptiness and emptiness due to the deafening abandonment that surrounds it. The walk becomes the march of a condemned man who retraces passages of his existence enveloped in a delirium which he also expressed in his conflictual relationship with the island, the latter being the objective correlative of the desperate state in which a body never appears and that it is the same player, forced against his will to participate in a story that is told and finds meaning only in its end. Dear Esther isn't funny indeed, it's definitely distressing, but it doesn't even want to be funny and it was never presented as such. It is a profound aesthetic experience that stages the introspection of a convict who reflects on the meaning of his existence. There is no middle ground: either you accept it or you reject it. But don't be fooled, it's not a matter of taste; it's more of a mindset. Indeed, let's say better: as a traditional video game it sucks (forgive the brutality) but, simply, it doesn't care at all not to do it. Dear Esther in Italian The language barrier represented by the difficult understanding of the English texts that make up the game, particularly important to fully appreciate Dear Esther, could demotivate many in giving Dan Pinchbeck's work a chance. If you are curious to try it, but are held back, you will be happy to know that within a few weeks the game will be translated into various languages, including Italian. When that happens, we will definitely update you. The island that doesn'tthere isn't The island of Dear Esther, an immense allegory rather than a real place, although designed with a photographic taste that finds few comparisons in the world of video games, is criss-crossed by paths and lanes that allow you to reach even its most hidden recesses. Along the way, the player will encounter a lighthouse, caves with strange symbols drawn inside, a ship covered in sand, ruined buildings, caves, and so on. The four levels that make up the work, if explored carefully, run out in a couple of hours. Returning to lower odds, we can say that there is no other title made with the Source engine as beautiful to look at, not even among the works of Valve. Especially the last two levels are a continuous visual spectacle. More than the individual details, the general fresco that is composed before the eyes of the viewer amazes, a fresco whose overall description is made even more penetrating and pervasive by the soundtrack, with the sound of the wind and the music (when present) that mix in a symphony of sophisticated and powerful sonorities. Everything serves to create empathy for the protagonist's confused words, disconnected memories like dust raised by gusts. This journey into the lucid madness of those who collect the fragments of their lives and try to give them a sense that is impossible to grasp could only end with a splendid lunar landscape, with the light of the natural satellite of the Earth which draws the borders between the sea and the earth and which makes the ghost evoked manifest throughout the journey, in a crescendo that has only one possible conclusion.", "date": "2012-02-20", "grade": "9.0"}
