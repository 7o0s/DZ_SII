This factor affects the development of expansions that do not see the mere addition of new bricks with which to build our experience. What is added by Nobles and Pirates are in fact new missions and two new characters to interpret and with whom to face an unprecedented, insidious challenge from two different points of view. Obviously we can also count on some classic additions such as clothes, treasures to decorate with and new movements, after all the soul of the title is that of The Sims. And also in the future there will certainly be new settlements to be built, as Electronic Arts has assured, but for the moment our goal will be to resolve a dangerous dispute between two factions that do not disdain the use of weapons. The arrival of the pirates, shipwrecked near our charming town, brings to light another faction which, unleashed by the advent of the raiders, enters the field. These are the aristocrats who can't wait to put what they've learned in their military training to the test. But even the warriors of the sea have no intention of sitting idly by, convinced that there is sabotage behind the sinking of their ship. We are in the middle, with our hero, and we have the opportunity to side with one or the other, and to decide whether to aim for peace or war, declining the continuation of the adventure according to the customs of one of the two groups. In addition to varying the quests, the choice of faction unlocks new game possibilities, some of which are in pure The Sims style such as the greetings and movements of the pirates or the attitudes of a nobleman. But even duels, a peculiar element of The Sims Medieval, are enriched with new moves which, like the other new elements of the expansion, are made according to the customs of pirates and nobles. With the former we learn disloyalty, being able to literally spit in the face of the enemy, while siding with the nobles we will have a jab like a true aristocratic swordsman. The fearsome chinchilla The first expansion of The Sims Medieval gives us three more novelties: a bird following us, the torture room and the treasure maps. As a pirate we can predictably count on the company of a parrot while as nobles we have a falcon in tow. The birds, available in 12 colors and able to help us fight and find treasures, are present in five varieties each and to see them all it will be necessary to find as many whistles hidden here and there in the game. As we said, the second novelty is the torture room which expands the variety of missions by adding the interrogation, a real mini-game that we have to play trying to lower the will of the ~victim~ while keeping his attention high. In fact, to complete some quests, we find ourselves having to extract various information from citizens and torture is undoubtedly the fastest method. Obviously everything is declined in The Sims style with one of the most ferocious tortures with which to torment those questioned represented by the fearsome chinchilla. Finally, let's move on to the search for treasures which is perhaps the most trivial addition even if it allows you to find extremely rare objects, armor, riches of all sorts and even some unexpected surprises. The economic utility of this activity is undeniable but the difficulty is minimal, after all it is simply a matter of looking at a map and digging where indicated, and therefore does not add much to the experience in terms of fun. On the contrary, the new quests maintain the ironic tenor of the main chapter, are rather streamlined and allow us to meet peculiar characters such as the pirate queen. The Sims Medieval: Nobles & Pirates extends the experience of The Sims: Medieval by introducing pet training, torture, new moves, clothing and especially factions and quests. Furthermore, the expansion allows us to choose whether to follow the noble code or ride the pirate emotions, giving a wider breadth to our experience and to the game world which is now more varied and characterized. Finally, the upgrade includes the replayability factor as it declines quests, outfits, shots and movements according to the chosen faction and also allows you to take two distinct paths towards resolving the dispute. In short, if you liked the original, there's no reason to deny yourself this Adventure Pack which, knowing the developers, is the first of a long series. The only drawback is undoubtedly the price. Although it is a complete product, in fact, the number of quests and hours with which to amuse yourself thanks to the novelties is certainly lower than the titlemain, but despite this EA has decided to shoot high by asking us as much as 29 euros and 90 cents.", "date": "2011-09-20", "grade": "7.8"}
