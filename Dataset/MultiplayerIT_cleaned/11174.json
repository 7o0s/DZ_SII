{"name": "Toy Story Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toy-story-mania_a.html", "text": "More than ten years have passed since the release in cinemas of ~Toy Story~, the first cartoon made entirely in computer graphics: a real classic, which paved the way for a whole series of similar productions and which still enjoys of great popularity. The film narrated the rivalry between Woody and Buzz Lightyear, who at the beginning competed for the place of little Andy's ~favorite toy~ but who then had to join forces to face the dangers of the real world, becoming great friends. The success of ~Toy Story~ has given rise to extraordinary and timeless merchandising, and even to the birth of attractions inspired by the characters of the film. ~Toy Story Mania~, in this case, puts its visitors in front of a series of tests of ability, which must be addressed by wearing 3D glasses. Depending on the stage, participants will be challenged with pie toss, darts, egg toss, baseball throw, etc. Basically the same things you have to do in Toy Story Mania, the mobile video game. Developed by Disney Mobile, this ~casual game~ offers us the possibility of taking on five different modes: ~Ball World~, ~Recruit Camp~, ~Space Base~, ~Old West~ and ~Egg Launch~. The ~Balloon World~ mode consists in eliminating a series of balloons, which becomes more and more numerous and complex as you go from one level to another. You have to read the number written on each balloon and press the corresponding key on the numeric keyboard for the crosshair on the screen to move in the direction of the target, after which you release the key to shoot an arrow. The response to the commands is not immediate, in the end it is a sort of inertial system and to hit the target you need to calculate the times well, thinking about what the movement of the balloon we want to hit will be. In the ~Recruit Camp~, things are a little simpler: we will have direct control of a crosshair on the screen, therefore we will have to use the d-pad to move it in the desired direction and then press the 5 key when we want to throw the ball. The aim here is to eliminate as many targets as possible before time runs out. Introduced by Buzz Lightyear, the ~Space Base~ is nothing more than a ring toss: the trajectory of the shot is not free, but follows the continuous movement of an indicator that goes from left to right. When we want to throw, we must press the 5 key for this indicator to stop, and hold it down to increase the power of the shot, given that the objects to be hit are located at several different distances. The ~Old West~ mode, naturally introduced by Woody, is a sort of shooter in which the scenario scrolls horizontally and you have to hit the targets after maneuvering the viewfinder using the d-pad. Finally, the ~Launch of the Egg~ is perhaps the most complex application: we are faced with a scenario in which characters appear to be hit, but doing so is not an easy undertaking because the power of the launch must be dosed each time matching it to the target distance. All modes refer to the ~Rewards~ section, where it is precisely possible to view the objects that have been unlocked thanks to one's performance in the various tests. As one might imagine, Toy Story Mania is a product intended for younger players, therefore it does not focus on a spectacular technical achievement. The graphics are just enough, equipped with cheerful colors and designed in an unobtrusive way. The most successful sections are those in which background scenery is present, while the others boast a much more spartan appearance. Unfortunately, the situation is not relieved by a mediocre and repetitive sector, nor can we sing the praises of a control system which in many cases proves to be anything but precise or immediate in its response to inputs. PRO Five different modes Good longevity Some minigames are fun... AGAINST ...others less so Mediocre technical achievement Quite limited", "date": "2008-09-24", "grade": "S.V."}
