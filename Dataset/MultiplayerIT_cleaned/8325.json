{"name": "Mikey Shorts", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108135-mikey-shorts-il-platform-per-chi-va-di-fretta.html", "text": "As we have pleasantly been able to find several times, the iOS environment represents a fertile meeting ground between concepts of the old videogame school applied to the current trend of using games via smartphone. There are therefore countless cases of products inspired by great classics of the past that find new lifeblood in the concept of hit and run gameplay that is typical of mobile devices: the present Mikey Shorts makes this concept his own by bringing to the scene a platform completely devoted to time attack. Michelino Shorts The plot of Mikey Shorts is almost non-existent, and sees the protagonist of the same name engaged in rescuing the inhabitants of the Earth who have been transformed into statues: there is no background, there are no noteworthy explanations and the short fixed screens that mark the passage from one world to another do not help to dispel this climate of ambiguity, indeed fueling it with textual descriptions for which it is difficult to find a meaning. Wondering whether all this is wanted or not by the developers still makes little sense, given the very little weight that the contour elements have in Mikey Shorts' game economy. In fact, the title is of extreme structural simplicity: we are talking about an old-school two-dimensional platform, in which the user's inputs are limited to moving the protagonist to the right or left and making him jump or slide using the comfortable virtual keys. Through these basic mechanics, you have to complete a series of 24 levels with the primary objective of reaching the finish line in the shortest possible time by freeing all trapped humans. Although generally quite short, the stages have an intelligent design, which stimulates the player to develop the best trajectories and to perfectly dose jumps and slides to stop the clock with that handful of seconds in advance, essential to place him in the highest peaks of the rankings. These constitute a real leitmotif of Mikey Shorts: in addition to being available practically at any time and in every possible and imaginable sauce, they represent in fact the real incentive to retrace one's steps to improve oneself, also considering how the low difficulty of the product allows you to obtain the inevitable three-star rating with just a few attempts. Not that other content is missing, mind you: coins are scattered throughout each level to collect and then spend on the purchase of new clothing for Mikey, and there are also very precious gold shorts that are often particularly difficult to find. However, the race against time always remains the main stimulus: it is no coincidence that, after the brief experience with the Story Mode, the title offers the beauty of 48 challenge levels even more focused on the time attack. It is therefore clear how the BeaverTap games product is aimed at a well-disposed audience towards similar mechanics, while lovers of more traditional titles could find it difficult to establish a strong connection with the title. In this sense, it doesn't help that from an audiovisual point of view Mikey Shorts is really spartan, thanks to elementary graphics in all respects and a sound composed of a handful of music and even fewer effects. Also in this case it is probably an aspect desired by the developers, the fact is that there is a big difference between pixel art and such a blatantly naive look.", "date": "2012-09-13", "grade": "7.5"}
