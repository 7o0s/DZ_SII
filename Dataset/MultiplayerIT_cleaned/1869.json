Tony Hawk, yes indeed, a few days ago delighted his audience, therefore practically the whole world, with the latest (the latest!) Ollie 540 which, for the uninitiated, is a trick invented by himself in the distant 1989, when it was considered impossible given the difficulty. Basically it's about a turn and a half with the skate attached to your feet during a jump. When it comes to Tony Hawk there is always that little smile on his lips, especially for those who are of the writer's generation, given that, like Michael Jordan for basketball, he is one of those mythological figures to whom we link memories and youth. Now he's 52, and watching him skate is still, like then, a pleasure. But let's get to us. We were saying, just when Tony delights us with his latest Ollie 540, the next-gen version comes out, polished, of the title that sees him as the protagonist and which pays homage to him more than any other. Let's see together how and how much Vicarious Vision worked to make a title that had little to improve even better in our review of Tony Hawk's pro skater 1 and 2 for PS5. delivery For those who missed the review of our good Serino let's take stock of the situation. This remake includes the first two chapters of the franchise, the first of which sold more than a million copies at the time, with all their arenas, tricks, legendary skaters and dizzying challenges. A real blast from the past for those who appreciated the original titles and a couple of sumptuous games, fun and full of things to do for those who are only now approaching it. The main mode is the Tour Skate, in which you will be shot inside the first arena, warehouse for the first game or hangar for the second, during which you will have to achieve specific objectives in order to unlock the following arenas. Trust us if we tell you that it becomes a sort of addiction to want at all costs to be able to surpass your own record or the one set by the game, there are so many tricks and things you can do within the individual levels. During the run it is possible to obtain style points with which to level up your favorite skater and every time you complete one of the challenges you will be rewarded with experience and money with which you can customize your character. a nice grind on the pipe of the ~Warehouse~ level There are so many items to unlock between equipment, clothing, protections, wheels and boards, that even with only half anyone would be satisfied. The levels range a lot and we really have something for all tastes, even going as far as a cargo ship or a sort of skater's paradise, a kind of floating island. The multiplayer sector gives a lot of satisfaction and we will be able to compete with other players in games to the last trick with fun and iconic modes, such as the classic Graffiti, in which to mark the various points of the map with a trick. In addition, we will be able to create our own skate park with a very good editor and share it with the community. The upgrade The game is also a hoot with friends Let's assume that we played the title on PS5 and it's truly a marvel. We are talking about the native 4k at 60 fps always and in any case, even in local multiplayer with split screen, with the possibility of switching to a 120 fps mode at 1080p. If the level of quality achieved by the Vicarious Vision could already be seen on PS4 Pro, here we really find it hard to believe that someone can find an imperfection or a texture that is not at the level expected of this generation. The models of the various skaters are made to perfection managing, in this new next-gen incarnation, to even notice the signs of the passing of time (right Tony?). A nice jump at sunset from a half pipe The play of light is perfect (note how the reflection of the window in the hangar has been perfectly fixed), each level is in full shape and there is not a single trick that causes fluidity to lose even half a frame. Adaptive triggers have been implemented to give a new feel to reverts and the 3D audio is just perfect. Between iconic music that really rocks and audio effects perfectly placed in the sound environment, you immerse yourself completely in the game and really want more and more. The only drawback that we want to bring out is not related to the game itself, but rather to the support from the developer. The next-gen version can be obtained for free by those who have purchased the digital copy, while those who have bought the game in the physical edition for the old gen will have to pay the full price of the title to buy another.", "date": "2021-03-29", "grade": "9.0"}
