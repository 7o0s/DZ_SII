{"name": "Outcasters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/outcasters-recensione.html", "text": "Outcasters is an immediate title without too many frills, which ideally recalls the minimalist style of multiplayer phenomena such as Among Us and a former sensation such as Fall Guys, as we will see in the course of the review. It is also an exclusive title for Stadia, a rapidly growing platform, at least from the point of view of content, which however is still suffering from too many prejudices from a dubious public on cloud gaming, probably due to the lack of large-caliber exclusives. Splash Damage's latest effort fits perfectly into a soft library with several light online games for the whole family, such as Super Bomberman R Online and Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle, all coincidentally exclusive. Google seems to have focused heavily on similar products, which however do not guarantee the same resonance as other experiences. Too bad, because often they are simply funny and deserve a little more consideration. Game mechanics The Outcasters concept is really basic: in the role of a character with soft, almost gelatinous features, you have to shoot energy balls at your opponents trying to knock them down, so as to win games and unlock cosmetic items as a reward. The peculiarities of the gameplay is in the possibility of bending the shots, in order to reach the opponents even behind the covers (provided you are very precise). The control system is that of a twin-stick shooter, therefore with the left stick dedicated to movements and the right one to aiming and curving shots. The resulting action is frantic, whichever mode is selected, with players constantly moving and simultaneously shooting effect fireballs to try and surprise the others. At first it seems difficult to be able to play decently, but in reality a few games are enough to see the first results and to master the system, thus making it natural to develop shooting trajectories very quickly and block the opponents' attacks with ours. Some clashes therefore become strange personal challenges, in which players look for a way to circumvent the opponent's defenses, for example by varying the rate of fire or trying to exploit the walls of the maps to their advantage. If we want, however, here comes the first problem of the game, namely the exhaustion in its basic formula. To give a little variety we think the upgrades that can be collected during the fights (undulating shots, fireballs that penetrate opponents and so on) and the powers of the characters that can be unlocked by leveling up (jump, deflect bullets, build defensive walls and so on), but in terms of mechanics, it takes very little time to see everything there and start to get tired. So either you get carried away by its competitive nature, or you end up abandoning it after a few hours, unless you have a few friends to play with from time to time. Game mode After all, Outcasters has no campaign of any kind and offers only three game modes, for a handful of maps. The matchmaking provides a playlist with all the modes, which can be tried individually only by choosing to train against bots. But, what's it about? In Last Caster Standing, essentially a variant of the classic Last Man Standing, the player fights alone and must try to survive longer than his opponents, remaining alive last. Team Battle, the first of the two team modes, offers instead 4v4 matches in which the team that first among fifty opponents wins. Finally, Gold Rush requires you to collect coins scattered around the only map available and take them to the bank. Basically it is a mode halfway between King of the Hill and Domination, in which the winner is whoever accumulates the most points by keeping control of the banks longer than their opponents and depositing the most coins (note that coins can only be deposited in controlled banks). This is also played 4v4. Gameplay As already mentioned, the gameplay of Outcasters is very fast and is all about pure fun. The simplicity of its formula does not deceive you, because there are still different levels of complexity to take into consideration, such as the race for upgrades, or the use of skills during matches, which create interesting dynamics and give a certain sense of progression. In terms of pure action, the only limit is the impossibility of moving the camera independently, a fact that sometimes creates some discomfort, especially when you want to go and track down whoever is shooting at you from afar and the only way to do it is approach. As mentioned, the game also offers many character customization options, which are unlocked by spending moneyor the points accumulated during the games or by purchasing DLC with real money. Don't worry, because skins and the like have no influence on game dynamics, therefore, if you want you can completely ignore the existence of the customization menu and live happily. Graphics In technical terms Outcasters certainly doesn't cry out for a miracle, but it must be said that it has no claim to being a benchmark. The maps are characterized by the presence of neon lights and marked minimalism, which serves to avoid difficulties in reading the action. The characters are well done, but being framed from above and from a certain distance, during the games it is really difficult to observe their details. For those interested, let's also spend a few words on Stadia and its performance. During the hours we tried Outcasters the service never showed the slightest sign of slowing down. Only on a couple of occasions was there a bit of lag, but it lasted for moments and fortunately it didn't compromise the games in progress. At present, however, the real problem, derived from the lack of success of the platform, is another: to find someone to play. Unfortunately matchmaking takes quite a while to find active matches and often you end up competing against bots, with only very few humans on the servers (in some cases one per team).", "date": "2020-12-13", "grade": "7.0"}
