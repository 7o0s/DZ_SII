{"name": "Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box-recensione.html", "text": "On the second playtest, Burnout doesn't prove to have much in common with Guns and Roses' title track, ~Paradise City~: it runs decidedly more, like Hanoi Rocks' ~Lost in the city~, and the essence of the experience we find well evoked in the words of the ~Boss~: Tonight tonight the highway's bright / Out of our way mister you best keep Cause summer's here and the time is right / For goin' racin' in the street~. (~Racing in the Street~, Bruce Springsteen) A Quality Port? No, A Quality Game ~From rags to riches / Or so they say / You gotta / Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame You know it's it's all a gamble / When it's just a game~ (~Paradise City~, Guns And Roses). Burnout is unconditionally arcade. Like an action title in which your avatar is not conceptually inside the car, but is the car itself. Never having raced in virtual cars won't close the doors to having fun. Taking a wrong curve will mean sliding with the side on the barriers that design it, giving the brushwood and rubbish along the roadside a rain of metal embers. Victory depends on the ability to survive in that extreme zone that goes between 190 and 300 kilometers per hour without losing control of the vehicle, or perhaps, trying to lose it as little as possible hoping that something does not appear that proceeds in the opposite direction. Competitions are a sport in which the first rule is the black soul of sportsmanship: the opponents don't surpass each other technically, above all they boycott each other, even with physical elimination (the takedown), in the pleasure of challenging each other under these conditions. Furthermore, our progression as pilots takes place with a gradual and constant awarding of prizes. From rags to riches (from poverty to material wealth), your private garage, reachable from the junkyards scattered throughout the city, will increase by one vehicle every time you cause the crash of a special car that you have to chase. And there's always a car to conquer, a more qualifying license to obtain, a challenge to accept at the next traffic light. The contents that the Ultimate Box adds, i.e. those so far downloadable for consoles, further increase the amount of vehicles and challenges, especially in multiplayer (Party mode!). A necessary reissue to precede the expansion (which will include an island), but without the meager appearance of a cheap edition. The Cagney pack inserts three online variants of three modes already seen in the single player: Online Stunt Run is a challenge for 8 players with the aim of performing as many stunts as possible in the space of two or more minutes; in Marked Man you will be a man on the run with a slow car and without nitrous oxide to be injected into the combustion chamber, in a points challenge based on takedowns; in Road Rage, a blue team must make it to the finish line without being pushed into an accident by a red team; finally, new challenges that consist above all in providing the pilots involved with a goal to contend with. The Bikes pack then adds motorbikes, modes (the Midnight Ride, a nocturnal race against time) and specific routes for two wheels, the day-night cycle, a dynamic fog. Finally, we note two internal browsers, to stimulate participation in the community and download future expansions. If therefore the original console release included almost all the modes encountered in a driving title - best time (like the Burning Route), duel, race, chase, clash, stunt - well crossed in a freely explorable city from the beginning , the Ultimate Box combines all this with a marked increase in online potential, maximizing the socializing aspect at an affordable price. Join The Car Crash Set ~We're gonna take a ride to the Mystery City / We're not coming back so buy a one way ticket, oh yeah! We're leaving right now for the Mystery City / Got no hearth, don't want no pity I knew you'd call this a paradice, dear / People judge you by the clothes you wear / Well, it's a wham bam gangbang everynight there / I tell you, everywhere else is just nowhere~ (~Mystery City~, Hanoi Rocks) Criterion is one of the few development studios that has managed to program a mechanism that is truly capable of representing the variation of speed in a video game, and of influencing our perception of it on screen. As happened in the cinema with Mad Max. The engines roar, it seems to smell the hot asphalt, we feel the physicality of the vehicles thanks to the precise control system (and they respond well, even using only the keyboard), as well as a series of sound details and graphs. When Burnout was released in January last year, the message was clear, made explicit in the promotional propaganda and alluded to by the presence of the ~Guns~ piece: it is the title of the album from which the song is extracted, Appetite For Destruction. The more we press on the accelerator, the more we don't want to leave it. We expect at any moment to see a drop in frame rate, as if the matrix can't keep up with us because our speed has exceeded that of the simulation of reality, but this never happens given the quality of the system, and then we increase the revs, until burnout. We want more racing cars, more aggressive and retro shapes, more neon paints that would make the Day-Glo catalog look like a palette of dull browns. At the climax, darting too quickly for the available space, the moment comes to tumble, writhing and dragging the body for tens of meters, until we stop. In accidents, a ~deviant~ sense of fulfilment, stimulated by the provocation or observation of the crash which is in turn underlined by the slow motion and the sound of bending metal, heightens the excitement and exorcises the frustration of failure, while fetishistically we admire the carcass of the car. Lost In The City Of Angels... Motorvatin'! ~City Of Lights from up here / I gaze in wonder / Children of night I hear you Rolling like thunder / I see the motion of a thousand / Restless souls before me I can't control the actions / of my gypsy heart / Cause i'm lost / Lost in the city of Angels~ (~Lost in the city of Angels~, L.A. Guns)Paradise City is the paradise of street racers, and their cars. Every road can be traveled at dizzying speeds without the need to slow down. The more chemical superchargers are used, the more they recharge, and the engine is not damaged. The radio speaks to us surreally, it has the tone of the pre-recorded female voice of a satellite navigator, it addresses us directly. The driver's seat is empty, the pilot is an invisible entity who has become one with the car. There are no pedestrians, the buildings are just glittering scenery useful for performing spectacular stunts, the neighborhoods are rows of petrol stations and workshops. The cars crash and immediately race again, endlessly. Seldom has a title been more fitting: if racing cars could conceive a paradise, this would be Paradise City. The city is fascinating, it gradually becomes a place that belongs to us. Over time, the modalities are still few in number and the experience is immediately enclosed in those counted actions that risk becoming repetitive not only because their nature is repetitive: in a given moment, saturated by every type of challenge faced, the depth which we will be looking for cannot in fact be found in the technical improvement of the guide which would offer at least a certain margin of simulation, so where can we find it? The most compelling challenge seems to be that of the duel with the special cars to obtain, perhaps due to that pinch of tension and unpredictability that distinguishes it, the truly concrete incentive to support the challenge, an always unique characterization of the prey to engulf. In the end, there is a change if that machine was once an antagonist and now it's us, yet we admit that it is unnerving to think of being the king of an empty city and incapable of reacting to our presence, or the holder of a record of time obtained without spectators on a straight line with occasional soft curves and achieved with a car that has automatic gears, capable of cornering on the guardrail. In multiplayer, fortunately, the perspective changes considerably (viva Road Rage online), offering real challengers-spectators. Initially, we often get lost given the vastness of the place, and still too often our eyes necessarily end up on the mini-map. It is necessary to run while looking at the asphalt, it is equally necessary to find out if after the junction that we made a mistake in not taking there can be an equally valid alternative, but how to drive a missile with the road guide between your legs? One thing is certain: we tried the rides choosing two radically different route solutions, and both worked. Therefore, it is really possible to conclude each race by focusing on the freedom to choose between different approaches, but only once we get to know the city will we be able to enjoy a race as it deserves, being able to run without having to move our eyes to the various maps and graphic signs that indicate the route , and it will certainly take a good amount of hours. The soundtrack excludes our music and has few well-liked tracks, the downloadable content is continuously administered, the vehicles are well characterized and varied. And it's worth more than one tour. A final note is to be spent on the Party mode, perhaps the only one, a true innovation of this Ultimate Box which can be accessed immediately from the game's initial menu (even before getting entangled in thevastness of Paradise City). By doing so, it will be possible to face this offline multiplayer mode where it will be possible to challenge up to a maximum of seven other friends, physically present in the same place in small and immediate clashes, literally passing the controller or the keyboard and mouse combination from hand. Interesting and also nice, for a quick after dinner in the company of some friends. Comment The additional contents would have seemed more like patches to an audience accustomed to receiving full-bodied expansions and free mods on their platform for a thousand euros, but here everything is included from the first release and at a price that is undoubtedly worth the experience. Did you miss such a noisy arcade driving title even on PC? Certainly Burnout Paradise fills the gap, and never gets flooded.Pro Fast-paced, exciting, especially online Technologically flawless Constantly supported and improved Total freedom to explore and choose thanks to the open design Against It's a bit superficial Still too little variety of challenges PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Windows XP Processor: 2.8 GHz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent RAM: 1GB Video Card: 128MB video memory with Pixel Shader 3.0 support DirectX: 9.0c or higher Hard Drive: 2.9GB Sound card: DirectX 9.0c compatible Connection required to activate the game Minimum Requirements Windows Vista Processor: 3.2 GHz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent RAM: 1.5GB Video Card: 128 MB video memory with Pixel Shader 3.0 support Operating system: Windows Vista DirectX: 9.0c or higher Hard Disk: 4 GB basic with no temporary or added files Sound card: DirectX 9.0c compatible Connection required to activate the game Test configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 @ 3.0 GHz RAM: 2GB DDR3 #1333MHz Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX Operating system: Windows Vista", "date": "2009-01-29", "grade": null}
