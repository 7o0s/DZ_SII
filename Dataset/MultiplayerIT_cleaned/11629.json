{"name": "Las Vegas Nights: Temptations in the City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/las-vegas-nights-temptations-in-the-city.html", "text": "Probably one of the reasons for the success of the so-called ~life simulators~ lies in the possibility of putting yourself in the shoes of a character who has to deal with the same problems that we have to face in real life: relating to others, earning a living, paying attention to own basic needs, etc. The Sims, even in its mobile version, places the emphasis precisely on the physiological needs of our character, with the consequence of limiting our freedom of action in relation to more complex issues than eating, resting or going to the bathroom. From this point of view, Las Vegas Nights: Temptations in the City proves to be much more flexible, letting us live our ~virtual life~ without always having to keep an eye on the indicators: when we urgently need to eat or rest, the game will let us notice this in a ~soft~ way, making the urgency only rarely an issue. After customizing the appearance of our alter ego, we will find ourselves in a hotel in Las Vegas, penniless and forced to leave our room after a night of debauchery. We will have to find a job quickly, by contacting the owner of a club, and start earning something to be able to ~grow~ from every point of view: gradually move into increasingly more dignified apartments, buy poker lessons and beauty treatments, relate to a series of characters who pay close attention to our bank account. The jobs that we are going to carry out are different from each other, and always translate into particular minigames: for example, distributing flyers means throwing them towards passers-by, calculating the distances so that they can catch them on the fly, while being a dancer in a club requires the pressure of certain keys at the right time, as happens in various rhythm games. The graphical interface allows us to call up the map at any time, in order to be able to go quickly to a place, or to check the ~growth~ of the character, who becomes more likeable, acquires charm and influence according to the actions he undertakes. You can address each person present in the locations, just get close to them and press the FIRE button (or 5): at that moment a contextual menu will open that allows you to speak (choosing the phrase after analyzing the tastes of our interlocutor ), give gifts, kiss or start a fight. Getting the right sentences right raises a special ~sympathy~ gauge, which when filled transforms the person we talk to into a good friend or something more. The tests to overcome and the things that must be done to progress are many, however, and the game will often lead us by the hand, indicating the places to reach on the map. The technical realization of the game is excellent, from every point of view. The drawing style of the characters is very nice, different from the previous two episodes, much more successful. The developers have even allowed themselves some nice transitions that deform the image when moving from one situation to another, but this is only one of the many touches of class: seeing the animations of our alter ego (especially when ~squeezing~ sitting on the toilet...) is really fun, the environments are rich in detail and are full of characters that you can interact with. Unfortunately the sound sector is of a very different level, with some very simple effects and quite trivial MIDI music. The control system sees us move the character using all the number keys or the joystick, the FIRE button (or 5) to interact and the function keys to view the map and save the game, or to check the messages on the phone and the statistics. PRO Technically very well done Great variety of situations Fun minigames AGAINST Pretty linear You must like the genre Mediocre sound", "date": "2008-02-11", "grade": "S.V."}
