Honestly, in the year of grace 2014 is there still a need to describe the game mechanics that characterize it with painstaking onanism? Ikaruga arises from a specific problem of classic shooters, regarding the rejuvenation of the gameplay, that Treasure had already addressed in some of its previous titles. If in Radiant Silvergun he had aimed to multiply the arsenal available to the player, removing the worry of collecting upgrades to concentrate the gameplay on the choice of attack strategy, in Ikaruga he takes the genre to a decisive breaking point, which does not admits a comeback, focusing everything on the perception of the action and the speed of reaction. The idea of introducing the concept of polarity into a classic shooter, already pioneered by the Japanese developer with the action Silhouette Mirage for PSOne, has been hailed as something of a renaissance for the genre. In reality, it did nothing but detach it even more from the mass of players, projecting shooters, for better or for worse, into an intellectual enclosure by which they are still surrounded today. In short, one of the most commercial genres of the eighties and early nineties suddenly became the subject of refined dissertations among connoisseurs, who disgusted (and disgusted) the worldliness of the most popular genres. Controversy aside, the title is based on a mechanic that is as simple to explain as it is difficult to master: the aircraft driven by the player, the Ikaruga, has two polarities, as well as the blows of the enemies. Shots of the same polarity as the currently selected one are absorbed, accumulating a special attack, while shots of a different polarity destroy the ship. Obviously it is possible to change the polarity of the Ikaruga at any time, to react to the different ranges of bullets that we are facing. What is basically a bullet hell, thanks to this mechanic becomes something different, apparently simpler (there are completely no power-ups or other similar stylistic features that have characterized the classic shooters since their inception), but which places in front of the player a more playful flow. complex, in terms of work required on his concentration and memory, to pass the levels, especially the advanced ones. Ikaruga is the same great classic shooter that marked an era on PC as well Subtract to add Replaying with Ikaruga after so many years on PC it becomes clear that Treasure proceeded by subtraction, removing every possible complication from the way to focus on a single mechanic, explored to its extreme consequences throughout the game. From this desire to experiment derives the extreme difficulty that characterizes it, the only way to make certain design choices evident and to give meaning to the progression necessary to make the gameplay effective. The most basic conclusion we can draw from it is that Ikaruga is not a game for everyone, but wanting to go a little deeper, we must admit that, more simply, it is a work that aims to choose its audience. Treasure was aware of the loss of appeal of classic shooters, already plunged then (we are talking about 2001) into an irreversible crisis, and therefore did not consider it necessary to give discounts to potential buyers: how many more would it attract by facilitating and debasing the gameplay to make it everyone? In such cases, compromises often end up being harmful, because they displease the few interested in purchasing. Fortunately in 2014 we still have a very difficult title in our hands, despite the presence of an ~easy~ level. The PC version is in fact the Xbox Live version, which the good Andrea Palmisano reviewed for multiplayer.it in 2008, with the inclusion of some peculiar features of Steam such as trading cards. Then we find the various hardcore modes, such as the one that introduces a limited number of bullets (forcing you to sip fire instead of relying on continuous bursts), the possibility of uploading replays online, various rankings and all the various accessories that the modern public loves be between the feet. From a technical point of view, the game is faithful to the original, i.e. to the Xbox version, improved compared to the coin op version. Not bad, given that the graphic style still performs well today, although it no longer makes the same impression as it did then. Even the soundtrack is the majestic one ever, capable of introducing a sense of the sacred into the action that manages to make you shiver, despite the passing of the yearsni.", "date": "2014-03-10", "grade": "8.6"}
