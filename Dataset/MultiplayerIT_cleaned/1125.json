{"name": "Driven to Destruction", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driven-to-destruction_a.html", "text": "The work of smashing The career mode of Driven to Destruction is structured in this way: you run on a map where there are several ~hot~ points that give access to as many locations, you can go to the car dealer to buy a new car (exchange your own, possibly), reach the local meeting place of tamarri to make an illegal jog, enter a ~spare parts~ shop (to upgrade your vehicle or simply to customize it with drawings and writings) or, finally, take part in the various competitions available. These are tournaments made up of several races, each with different rules, at the end of which you will earn money and reputation points (essential for accessing upgrades, new vehicles, new competitions and everything else). As far as the type of races is concerned, there is really an embarrassment of choice: mostly these are races with ~classic~ rules, i.e. whoever arrives first wins, enriched however by a series of extras. For example, there are races in which you have to change direction several times, others in which you have to reach marked areas in succession, still others in which you race with trailers. There is no shortage of races devoted to complete destruction, in which all opponents must be thrown out of a perimeter or remain the only car still capable of moving. [C] After completing a tournament, we will see videos that include interviews with those who really try their hand at these sports... We will find ourselves driving all kinds of vehicles. Among the views available, there are some; also a first person, very interesting. [/C] The technical aspect Driven to Destruction stands out for its sober design and for the validity of its graphics engine, capable of grinding polygons in quantity without experiencing any difficulty, even in the most agitated situations. It is also true, however, that the settings are not particularly rich in detail, given that the game is set in desert areas and therefore there is no shadow of a building that is more than one floor tall. The driving system is obviously arcade, with particular attention to drifts and therefore to the progressive correction of the trajectories (after all, you almost always run on mud...). The gearbox is necessarily automatic, and the view reverses when we engage reverse gear, to allow us to move more comfortably during the destruction derbies. As far as the sound sector is concerned, the game boasts a signed and quite lively soundtrack, accompanied by effects that are not particularly distinctive but functional for the purpose. Comment Driven to Destruction is a fun title that will certainly engage those looking for an alternative racing game. Equipped with a rather substantial career mode, as well as a large variety of vehicles and types of race, it is an excellent choice if you want a spectacular and graphically well done game. Pros: Technically well done. Lots of different races. Full-bodied career mode. Cons: Not very varied environments. After a while it gets monotonous. Initially conceived as a spin-off of the famous Test Drive series, Driven to Destruction takes us into the magical world of destruction derby and crazy racing. The game offers the possibility of engaging in quick races or tackling a full-bodied career mode. In the first case, we will be able to choose our vehicle from those available (most of them must be unlocked, of course) and select one of the events to participate in. In the second case, however, we will start with a contraption, little money and a mediocre reputation, and we will gradually have to face impromptu races or mega-events to earn money and fame. But let's see things in detail...", "date": "2004-11-25", "grade": null}
