According to normal market trends, a simple more of the same would have been expected for this new Lionheart: Dark Moon, and instead the team wanted to completely reshuffle the cards on the table and propose something new. That is, ~again~ if compared to the first chapter, because there is not much completely original in this sequel, which in any case manages to distinguish itself for the usual care in the technical realization and for the general cleaning. It is an RPG with turn-based combat declined according to the classic variant of the monster-catching game, whereby we find ourselves having to build an army by placing characters and creatures of various types on our side that we must conquer and deploy on the battlefield, with lots of management of the various characteristics and construction of the party. All elements well established, even too much: the problem is in fact a certain lack of bite that derives from the strongly derivative aspect of the whole scaffolding, however saved by a careful and stylish graphic characterization, capable of giving the whole a certain specific identity . A particularly complex and multifaceted lore is not to be expected, because the story and the setting remain rather simple and not very detailed, as befits an RPG focused above all on grinding and loot research, but the technical sector really shines this game among the numerous similar titles. Fight, capture, progress and fight some more in Lionheart: Dark Moon Gotta Catch'em all Beyond the general lack of originality, mechanically the gameplay works very well, at least until you run into the inevitable wall of grinding. Being a free-to-play game, the game carries with it the natural consequences of this monetization model: there is the classic energy bar (a number, more than anything else) which runs out and leads to the usual ~waiting~ situation or shopping~ to be recharged and continue playing, as well as a myriad of items to purchase in the shop that allow you to obtain permanent or momentary boosts. Given the collectible element given by the presence of more than 100 creatures to conquer and use in combat, the possibility of buying them directly is a recurring feature throughout the game. Obviously, those who have no intention of giving in to the micro-transaction mechanism are free to do so, but it is necessary to face a bit of grinding to be able to enhance the characters in a ~natural~ way and with increasing level and decreasing rewards system can get pretty fiendish. The good thing is that the fights are always pleasant to deal with: thanks to a good construction of the characters, very good animations and a huge number of different creatures and fighters to use (120 for the moment), each with moves and special techniques, Lionheart: Dark Moon offers a stimulating combat system, even deep and challenging in the more advanced levels. On the other hand, there isn't much else beyond this: where in the Japanese RPG combat is fundamental, but always immersed in a powerful narrative structure, here the story is rather weak and hackneyed, with missions that are limited to moving automatic in arenas that involve taking down enemies in successive waves until the final boss. Everything is very schematic and divided into compartments: there is the village which acts as a base, where it is possible to manage and evolve the characters or buy equipment and upgrades, basically a hub from which we can take part in the missions, with some weak narrative interlude given by the dialogues between the protagonists. We also note a very extensive localization in Italian but somewhat marred by grammatical errors.", "date": "2017-10-19", "grade": "7.8"}
