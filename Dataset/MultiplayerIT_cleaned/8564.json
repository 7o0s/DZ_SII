The Shinju Forest, for example, is a sort of parallel world where the laws of nature are completely different from ours, a ~wild land~ where gigantic insects and dinosaurs live that respond to the commands of an evil entity. To save the inhabitants of her village, a girl named Reco decides to jump aboard her trusty Kiniro, an extra-large beetle capable of emitting laser beams (well yes), and eliminate the threat once and for all. In Bug Princess 2, however, we are given the opportunity to play not only Reco, but also Palm, a young man inextricably linked to the events that are taking place and capable of riding none other than a dragon. The two characters don't actually boast substantial differences: the speed of their ~vehicles~ is the same, as is the firepower. In both cases, you can opt for a different arrangement of the secondary weapon, in this case two ~pods~ stationed on either side of the beetle or dragon and which can emit a linear ray or move depending on the context, offering more support ~ dynamic~ versus action. As already happened in the episodes of DoDonPachi, before tackling the story mode you can try your hand at a practice mode in order to memorize certain attack patterns and develop specific strategies before starting a real game. There are four difficulty levels available, which clearly change the number of bullets on the screen and their speed. A further variation of the experience is offered by two extra game modes (Maniac and Ultra) that are unlocked when we complete the five substantial levels of the single player campaign and offer different patterns for standard enemies and bosses. In a bullet hell, moreover, the dynamics that regulate the rain of bullets are fundamental and, if they change, everything else changes too. Lots of bullets, lots of glory Bug Princess 2 is very similar to the first episode in terms of gameplay and structure, and in some ways represents an evolution of the dynamics seen in DoDonPachi, having been made a few years later. The developers have paid great attention to making the game difficult but not impossible, in the sense that we are always given the possibility of surviving a cloud of bullets if we move in the right way and find the ~gap~ we need to escape awkwardness, perhaps with a very rapid movement. Of course, being able to perform these maneuvers at the ~novice~ difficulty level will be one thing, doing the same at the ~hell~ level is another, however continuous practice will not only allow us to better understand what we can expect from the enemy hordes and bosses, but also to earn profits ~continue~ to resume the game after a game over. Still on the subject of optimizations, the upgrades of our weapon (which also in this case can switch from a wide beam and a thin but more incisive laser by pressing a button) are not lost when the character is eliminated, so as not to penalize us too much at this juncture. Further help is the automatic smart bomb when we are hit, which ~delays~ the game over and gives us a second chance, as well as a generally forgiving and incredibly accurate collision detection. Just as the touch control system is extraordinarily precise, which in a few millimeters of travel allows us to move throughout the area with unparalleled accuracy. As for the technical sector, the conversion is perfect but obviously suffers in terms of resolution: the original 2006 coin-op did not boast the same definition as the Retina display, so miracles should not be expected. There is also some slowdown (on iPhone 4S, we specify), but fortunately nothing serious. Finally, the sound is very pleasant.", "date": "2012-04-27", "grade": "9.0"}
