{"name": "Red Steel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-steel-4.html", "text": "Code red Let's face it right away: Red Steel is evidently a title that would have needed at least another six months of programming. You cannot otherwise explain some of the ugliness that mercilessly accompanies the user's approach to the game. The loads are long, the menus are crude, the static comic-style cutscenes are stylistically and graphically very questionable. In short, the incompleteness of Red Steel is already clear from the premises, a macroscopic defect which, as we will see, affects the entire production, considerably affecting its value. But let's go in order. The protagonist of the slender story is a certain Scott, a faceless and personalityless figure (he never speaks) who has to save his Japanese girlfriend, kidnapped by a Yakuza clan. In short, the ideal pretext for a nice carnage to the sound of firearms and katanas, which -obviously- Red Steel stages by trying to make the most of the specific features of the Wii controller. Red Steel is evidently a title that would have needed at least another six months of programming Code red The remote is therefore used to move the gaze and aim at the enemies on the screen, indeed quite imprecisely: pressing the A key still allows for slower but more accurate aiming, facilitated by a sketchy lock-on system. Bringing the remote closer to the screen zooms in (inexplicably large with simple pistols and very limited with assault rifles), while pressing down on the D-Pad and making a vertical movement with the controller launches grenades. The nunchuck is delegated movement via the analog stick and the functions of jumping and lowering via the back buttons, while by shaking it it is possible to open doors, pick up weapons and reload. Potentially excellent, Red Steel's control system actually makes you soon regret the traditional one: if the aiming is imprecise, at the same time the movement of the gaze is too slow, often and willingly allowing enemies to riddle the user for his inability to turn and aim with sufficient timing. Not that the opponents' AI is particularly refined, mind you: endowed with very little brain, the various henchmen simply take advantage of the deficiencies of the control system, filling the player with lead before he can still identify them and return fire. Most of the deaths in Red Steel are not attributable to the user's skill, and are even more frustrating given the unfortunate checkpoint system of the product: in addition to the annoyance of having to repeat entire portions of the game, you can't even skip the annoying cutscenes... Cast steel Were it not for the big problems just described, the shooting phases of Red Steel would also be enjoyable, given the good pace of play and the fair variety of the arsenal (a maximum of two weapons can be carried at a time between the classic pistols, rifles and etc). Furthermore, in an advanced stage of the adventure the interesting Focus Mode is unlocked, which allows you to stop time and calmly aim at enemies. Unfortunately, the evident incompleteness of the product ends up ruining everything, even the fights with the katana that had so inflamed the spirits of the fans in the previews. During duels, the remote is used to swing, while the nunchuk manages parries and dodges. Beyond the totally scripted nature of swordfights, their fundamental flatness is surprising: great technique is not required, on the contrary, several times we found ourselves winning easily simply by constantly shaking the remote. The most evident aspect of the incompleteness of Red Steel is undoubtedly in its graphics sector Paradoxical is the fact that so-called Respect Points are awarded in the event that the opponent's life is spared: points which, in fact, are practically of no use. In short, every single minute of the approximately ten hours necessary to complete Red Steel allows the user to understand the haste with which the game was programmed. There is also a lack of difficulty levels, co-operative modes or bonuses of any kind that could push you to face the adventure a second time. There is a multiplayer section open to up to four players via split-screen, but calling it ~filler~ is almost a compliment: the action is in fact rather bland, the duels with the katana and potentially innovative elements are totally missing (see the use of the remote speaker to define the objectives) are achieved in an approximate way. However, the most evident aspect of the incompleteness of Red Steel undoubtedly lies in its graphic sector. Basically indistinguishable froma Gamecube product from a few years ago if not for some appreciable visual effects (explosions and some distortions above all), the Ubisoft product shows off poorly elaborated and inspired settings, banal and poorly animated characters and poorly defined textures. A whole series of graphic bugs complete the picture: it is not uncommon to see enemies floating or getting stuck in parts of the scenario, obviously surrounded by that strange halo that the game had already shown in its first releases. The sound, on the other hand, is noteworthy, not so much for the music and voices -normally- but rather for the good quality of the effects and for the intelligent use of the remote speaker. Comment Red Steel is a rushed game, and it shows. Starting from the mediocrity of the graphic sector up to the numerous deficiencies of the gameplay, the Ubisoft product is evidently the victim of inadequate development. And it's a shame, because Red Steel is a game full of potential, characterized by a gameplay that is fascinating at first sight and by a control system that has been well studied and unfortunately badly applied. More than a missed opportunity, it seems appropriate to speak of Red Steel as a half misstep: in short, the Ubisoft title has put ideas on the table that definitely deserve to be better developed in the future. Pros Interesting control system Some good gameplay insights Good game pace Cons Incomplete in every aspect Inaccurate aiming Graphics forgettable Presented to the public for the first time during the Nintendo conference at E3 2006, Red Steel was able to immediately attract attention thanks to its peculiar nature: configuring itself as the first FPS ever for Wii, the Ubisoft product has become one of most cited examples of the capabilities of the new console, despite some obvious technical limitations. Limits that also occurred punctually during the subsequent releases of the game, and which unfortunately also ended up accompanying the release in stores all over the world...", "date": "2006-12-12", "grade": null}
