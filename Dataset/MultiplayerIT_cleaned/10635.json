The most substantial method is certainly the ~personalized party~, also because it offers a greater number of choices and really allows us to create a tailor-made party for the birthday boy or girl. In this case, the first thing we are asked is the sex of the birthday boy, then the age (from 1 to 9 years) and finally the theme of the party. There are ten of them available: pirates, princess, sport, music, soldiers, magical forest, monsters, work in progress, trendy and soft toys. The theme establishes what the scenic components of the party will be, so depending on what we choose we will find ourselves in a different room, with furniture but above all with different decorations from time to time. Each theme has its own why and boasts colors and really fun gimmicks. I hope there are plenty of fries Once these choices have been made, we move on to the guests at the party, who can be up to twelve and whose appearance can be customized as desired: they can be boys or girls, parents or grandparents. Then you decide whether to play alone or in the company of friends, for a total of four participants who must use as many Wiimotes. In the event that fewer than four players play, the remaining characters are controlled by the game. Our goal is to decorate the room where the party is held in the best possible way, and to get each element of the scenario we have to successfully pass a series of minigames. There are all of them well twenty-two, really a lot, and they see us doing different things depending on the situation. In the minigame ~Smash the Pinata~, for example, we have to shake the controller to hit the highlighted areas of a pinata until it breaks: the player who succeeds first wins. In ~Birthday Cake~, on the other hand, we have to raise and lower the Wiimote as if we were operating a bellows and blow out all the candles that we find on our way, without letting even one escape. In ~Corsa dei Sacchi~, then, we have to move the controller as if it were a can of soda that we want to splash when we open it. Finally, ~Morra Cina~, sees us simulate the gestures of this ancient game with the controller, pressing the d-pad, the trigger B or the button A depending on the symbol chosen between paper, scissors and stone. Lights and colors! It's My Birthday is presented as a very colorful and fun product, which also amazes for the packaging: in addition to the game case, we find in fact a package containing banners, coloring pages and invitations to better organize our party! The graphics of the game are lively, the themes are very numerous and each of them boasts truly imaginative and fun solutions. The party probably won't be over until attendees have discovered what each of the ten available themes has to offer. The same can be said for minigames, which are many and all different. Finally, the sound is enriched by the nice voice of Pietro Ubaldi, who guides us through the options and who spares no advice and indications while we play. In conclusion, it can be said without fear that this game will delight any child from 1 to 9 years old. But if you are older it is clear that you should look for something more sophisticated...", "date": "2009-07-14", "grade": null}
