{"name": "Tokio Hotel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tokio-hotel.html", "text": "Born in Germany in 2001, the Tokio Hotel group is only the latest of the musical phenomena that have had the merit of filling the stadiums and bank accounts of the major record companies. It is basically a ~boyband~, made up of young adults who were lucky enough to immediately sign a contract with an important label. The German tracks on the first albums limited its international success, a success which then punctually arrived with ~Scream~, the first album in English: more than a million copies sold all over the world, international tour always sold out, covers of magazines and now even a mobile video game, developed by Artificial Life. After selecting our character from those available (all girls, not surprisingly), we will have to join the Tokio Hotel crew and help the four members of the group successfully complete the various concerts. The action takes place through different stages from every point of view: at the beginning we will have to try our hand at a racing game, then we will move on to the typical mechanics of rhythm games and those that are commonly defined as ~casual games~, i.e. products that they can use even without having the slightest knowledge of what a video game is. Between one level and another, there will be quizzes that test our knowledge of the band, and which in fact make this title playable only by those who know the life, death and miracles of the four German boys. The control system varies according to the situation: in the racer phases, we will have to accelerate by pressing the d-pad up or with the 2 key, brake by pressing the d-pad down or with the 8 key and use the 5 and 0 keys to activate special mechanisms. In fact, in view of obstacles, our car will behave more or less like Inspector Gadget's, standing up on stilts or drastically lowering its trim depending on where the danger comes from. The technical realization of the game is unfortunately mediocre, almost amateur production: the scrolling of the scenario during car races is jerky and repetitive in the graphic elements, not to mention the realization of the other vehicles, in particular the scaling of the sprites. Collision management is bad, so we'll have to act well in advance of the events that occur on the screen. Things improve during the 'casual' phases, mostly thanks to the digitized photos of Tokio Hotel members, but there's never a real qualitative uplift. The sound, which also had to play a fundamental role given the topics covered, comes with a series of anonymous and repetitive MIDI tracks, which can be deactivated without even thinking about it too much. Finally, the controls constantly suffer from blocks that make the game experience cumbersome and frustrating, especially in the early stages: driving the car should have been a much more ~fluid~ and relaxing affair than it is in practice. PRO Interesting for <strong>Tokio Hotel</strong> fans AGAINST Mediocre technical achievement Cumbersome and frustrating Severely limited gameplay", "date": "2008-09-11", "grade": "S.V."}
