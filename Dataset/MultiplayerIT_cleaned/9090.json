{"name": "Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yu-gi-oh-master-duel-recensione.html", "text": "From the beginning of the 2000s to today, countless video games dedicated to Yu-Gi-Oh! have arrived on the market, one of the best-known collectible card games in the world together with the immortal Magic and Pokmon. As always, when the numbers are high, the quality fluctuates. This quality would reach its peak with titles dedicated to Yu-Gi-Oh! GX on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, and then gradually faded. Up to today.In recent days the publication of Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel on all existing platforms (on mobile it is already expected and confirmed, but will arrive later) has given a lot of material to discuss for the community, made up of casual players, experts, newcomers and those who had stopped at Yu -Gi-Oh! GX or even the first animated series. But usually no one can resist a free-to-play. We certainly couldn't resist: of course we immersed ourselves in the world of Monsters and Duelists to offer you an exhaustive article as soon as possible. Our review of Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, we anticipate it, confirms an obvious fact: there is a significant change of trend, qualitative and quantitative, compared to the entire videogame past of the series. An intuitive and accessible free-to-play Even the chains from Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel are extremely clear Konami has built the experience of Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel in the name of practicality. Each menu is captivating, clean, precise: it's impossible to go wrong, it's really difficult to end up in the wrong place looking for a certain content. When you first start you are asked if you have a Konami account: it's a good idea to create one right away, because game data can be transferred from one platform to another without losing the contents (decks, progression, purchased gems, and so on). The main menu is also extremely minimal and effective, with just four items on the left: Duel (to fight online immediately), Deck (to create your own deck), Solo (it is the story / tutorial mode, which we will talk about), finally Shop (the shopping store). At the top right, however, there are several secondary features: it should be kept in mind that Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is above all an experience designed to be enjoyed online, so much so that, in the absence of an internet connection, it is not even possible to start the game (exactly as happens for Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Link on mobile ). These items therefore include notifications from the developers, missions (daily or not), the gift box and your friends list. In all of this, the player's banner stands out at the top of the screen: with a light pressure it is possible to access the relative customization menu, thus changing the name, icon, and even the assistant. The latter is an iconic little monster of the series that joins us during duels, praising our skill or suffering for a possible defeat. Currently there are some well-known faces such as the Black Magician, Sangan, Rescue Rabbit and Jar of Greed; many more (for a fee) will probably come later. They are in all respects mere aesthetic objects. And since the conversation has moved on to cosmetics: for the first time Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel allows for customization of the playing field worthy of the name. The latter, made in 3D without really complex elements that slow down the game, can consist of the ruins of an old temple, in a volcanic landscape, in the ~ritual cage~ of the related ritual monsters, in the city of the Ancient Gear archetype. Not only can new lands be purchased in the shop, but also individual parts of those already in our possession are easily modifiable (for example the areas relating to the cemetery and banned cards, or the assistant's position). Solo mode An example of the solo mode from Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel Not everyone has continued to follow the story of Yu-Gi-Oh! It is a very complex story, not so much on the anime side, but due to the constant introduction of new game rules, new modes, new archetypes, new cards (Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, Link). Gone are the days when Toon monsters, the Dark Magician or the Egyptian Gods dominated the scene: sure, they can still be fun, but they would never stand up to the so-called ~meta decks~, capable of summoning six hundred monsters every turn with an attack even higher than 3000 points. To overcome these problems, newcomers (but also veterans) can therefore devote themselves to Solo mode. Solo mode is the almost perfect fusion between the classic tutorial and the real story: so let's consider it a long, interesting, captivating tutorial in disguisefrom narrative ambitions. Here too, simple voices immediately explain what we're going to encounter: the first two explain the basic rules of Yu-Gi-Oh!, but then we immediately move on to something different. ~The absolute Monarch~, for example, in addition to allowing the player to try a deck based on Monarchs by hand, literally tells the story of this archetype, in a narrative composed of static images accompanied by texts. At the end of the short chapters (all consisting of targeted duels) one gets the impression of knowing better the lore of the Monarchs, the context of these monsters, and indeed it is. All Monarch cards are already present in Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel This strategy is repeated in each main chapter of the solo mode, in which progressively the history is known (and played with cards) of the six Elemental Lords, of Ruin and Demise, of the Megaliths of the Beast Gladiators, of the Dinomists, and many others archetypes. Each chapter requires certain conditions to be unlocked, usually having completed all the previous ones, also respecting other requests (for example, you have to win both with the ~trial~ deck and with the personal one). It is above all the rewards that tempt the less poetic: gems, new cards, even entire decks. The themed video game Yu-Gi-Oh! definitive? Visually Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is a pleasure Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel was proposed by Konami as the definitive gaming experience. At present, although it is obviously possible and necessary to intervene on many aspects, it is difficult to raise serious objections. Indeed, the title contains over 10,000 cards, practically all of the existing ones; the missing ones will probably come later, there's no reason why they shouldn't. But already all the material present allows you to build every conceivable deck, from those you loved in your childhood to the tournament ~deck meta~. However, we are not dealing with a mere container like Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution!, which above all allowed to relive the plot of the various animated series. The Cure of Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is clearly superior, both compared to Legacy of the Duelist and Duel Link: the duels are much more compelling, thanks to small (but appreciable) tricks in the animations; to the general care for the playing field, which is animated and begins to take damage as the Life Points decrease; in the presence of assistants on both sides of the screen. And the progression is also appreciable, at least for the moment: the newcomer finds in his hands, in a few hours of play, an incredible amount of gems to spend in the shop to open the card envelopes. With the same gems you can also buy the Season Pass, which therefore does not require an additional expense. Pendulum, Xyz, Link: it will take some time to understand how Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel Another fundamental mechanic, long requested by players, is the one related to the dismantling and the generation of cards. After opening fifty sachets it is possible to find many cards in your hands - as you know immediately - they will never be used. That's when Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel allows you to destroy excess objects, gaining material with which to craft (i.e. create from scratch) cards that you haven't found yet, but which you need to complete the deck. This way, in the long run, anyone will be able to make at least their favorite deck.", "date": "2022-01-23", "grade": "8.5"}
