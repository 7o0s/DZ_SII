{"name": "Dino Crisis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dino-crisis.html", "text": "Have a dinosaur for dinner... Dino Crisis, for those unfamiliar with the titles we have mentioned, rightfully belongs to the Survival Horror category. The protagonist of this type of game is usually forced to deal with standard situations (in pure adventure style - find the key, talk to someone, open the door, solve a puzzle), in the context of a particular moment (generally after a genetic catastrophe or in any case of a scientific nature - pseudo-paranormal, usually caused by the clumsy hand of man) and hunted by enemies: in this case we are talking about those nice creatures that populated the earth so long ago: the dinosaurs. To confirm belonging to a rather rigid game scheme, is even the initial input of the plot, decidedly similar to the one already seen (and overcooked) in Resident Evil: a rescue team must go and recover a group of scientists who from some time they give no more news of them. In this specific case it is Doctor Kirk, an eminent scientist responsible for some important studies on the use of a phantom third energy, who was believed to be dead a few years earlier. In this case, the meeting with those responsible for everything, the dinosaurs, takes place almost immediately, immediately after having watched the discreet introductory film and having solved the first banal puzzle. You immediately notice some small differences (which will be better appreciated as the story progresses) compared to the official progenitor: the enemies, unlike what happens with the Resident Evil Zombies, as well as being naturally faster than the latter, have the ability to chase Regina from one location to another, which adds to the realism and thrill of the game; it is no longer possible to see the classic health bar of the main character in the inventory (which has remained otherwise unchanged - also in the management of the map, the weapons available, their ammunition, and in the possibility of mixing some medicinal substances to obtain them something more powerful -), but only by watching the character on the screen bleed, and leave traces of blood on the floor, will it be possible to understand his physical difficulties; the saving method has changed, as now it will be possible to save only in a certain room and you will have a limited number of saves available (unlimited when choosing the easiest game mode); the game involves the use of only three weapons, which are however modified during the adventure, but which certainly do not offer the variety seen in the zombesque series (this is perhaps the game's greatest flaw); it is possible for Regina to make a sudden 180 turn, which allows her to turn her attention more quickly to the lizard on duty who tries to attack her from behind. Among other things, the artificial intelligence designed for lizard friends far surpasses (this is absolutely not a criticism of the RE series, just an observation) that of the Racoon City Zombies, and it will be more complex to try to escape them: the effect of their run-up, perhaps while they are busy not skidding for speed, when they try to make a leap against you, is really perhaps the scariest thing in the game. Movie or game? Helped in searches by senior members of the rescue team, Regina finds herself catapulted into a frenetic and well-structured adventure. Undoubtedly the strong point of the game is not the technical realization, which begins to feel the weight of the years, but the plot, which as per the script takes place quickly and punctuated by twists and turns, capable of making the player jump more than once. In the face of a not exactly exciting basic originality (the story of the remote island populated by dinosaurs I must have already heard it somewhere else ......), the dynamism of a story that seems to rush the player (it suffices think that the game has an average duration of 8 hours, and can be completed even in less than five), the quality of the same, and the care placed in the creation of some noteworthy sound effects, give the game the characteristics of an interactive film . In fact, despite the absolute linearity of the plot, it is always pleasant to try to solve the riddle of the moment in an attempt to advance in the game, also because the curiosity of meeting the different life forms that populate the island (from Compsognathus to the ubiquitous Velociraptor , from the Pterodactyl to the majestic T-rex, whose rare encounters always leave their mark......) always remains strong and spurs the player to search for the truth behind this new disaster. Alongside this, the fact of having to look for the safe escape route most of the time rather than direct confrontation (in fact, ammunition is scarce, and the impossibility of being able to save at any moment maintains the ever-present feeling of anxiety), the possibility sometimes to choose which path to follow (but don't think it affects the continuation of the story too much) and the presence of some original puzzles (sometimes it will be necessary to recover fingerprints from the corpses of scientists or recover some decoding codes keywords ), ensure a decent quality of the game. In an effort to offer something different from RE, the Japanese programmers of Capcom have also inserted a particular mode (which in the Playstation version could be activated once the game has been completed in a limited period of time), called Wipeout. Quite useless, in my view, this mode offers the player the opportunity to tackle a series of missions of increasing difficulty, in which the only goal is to kill as many dinosaurs as possible in a limited number of minutes: once this mode is completed, and here is the ONLY big addition made in the conversion from Play to PC, it is even possible to record your times in an Online table on the Capcom site: what's the point? Conclusions If in the preview of the game I had expressed some doubts about the concept of the game itself, too abused in recent years and unable to offer something truly original, today I have to partially, but only partially, change my mind. In fact, despite some particularly frustrating puzzles, which force the player to spend most of the time solving them, the job that this Survival Horror has to do does it quite well. Yes, the feeling of fear generated by a world populated by dinosaurs is certainly lower than that offered by the good old Zombies (perhaps also because the number of these on the screen at the same time was certainly higher than that of the dinosaurs that come your way from time to time) , but this is partly compensated by the greater frenzy that characterizes the clashes, or rather the escapes of the protagonist, during the adventure. Unfortunately, a sore point, as mentioned before, concerns the variety of weapons at our disposal, certainly limited (to make matters worse, the rifle and the pistol have practically the same effect........); the modifications to them do not offer the same feeling of variety already seen in D. The game is certainly recommended to all fans of the genre, with the only recommendation that the general approach this time seems to have been focused more on solving puzzles and on how to escape the dinosaurs instead of killing them. But the overall assessment, which remains slightly above the sufficient level in my opinion, is partly conditioned by the limited longevity of the title; capable, as mentioned before, of offering the player only a few hours of involvement. Especially since, unlike the Zombesca saga, the so-called Bosses (so dear to console thought) not only do not represent a tough nut to crack, but are also represented, read carefully, by the number of one. Ultimately, if you have already finished the two episodes of Re that appeared on PC in recent years and you were fascinated by it, approach this title, but do so aware of finding few substantial innovations: one could coincidentally say that the concept is generally the same, only the setting changes. If, on the contrary, you have never been interested in the Survival Horror genre, this could be the right time; if your tastes are derived from a greater adventure setting, please contact the title in question, but if you prefer to deal more with the clashes, turn your attention to Resident Evil. The game is also fully translated into our language, and allows even non-English speakers to follow the plot in every detail. P.s: a small, sore, side note deserves a bug encountered the second time I tried the game, when I had already installed directx 8.0 (the Italian version, on a Voodoo 3 3000, Win 98 and a Celeron processor) , which irreparably crashes the game at the first encounter, about a quarter of the way through the game, with the Pterodactyl, and which distorts the textures on the screen: a patch is awaited. A saga with a thousand twists When the first title of what is now one of the most established videogame sagas, Resident Evil (or Bio Hazard, as it is known in Japan), was released on the Playstation back in 1996, no one could have guessedIt could be predicted that the game would not only become one of the biggest hits of all time, but that it would spawn countless sequels and several spin-offs. Clearly thought of as an evolution of the gameplay originally proposed by Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil based its success on graphics decidedly in step with the times and with an atmosphere worthy of the best horror films by George Romero (among the thousand curiosities related to the plot, it was the American director who shot the promotional trailer of the second chapter of the series). To date, confirming the effective success of the saga over the years, there are about ten titles on the market, whether they are real sequels or simple conversions on other platforms: among these, the lion's share is represented by Resident Evil: Code Veronica, made specifically for the Sega home console, the Dreamcast, which in the last year has contributed considerably to the (fair) diffusion of the new console worldwide. Excluding Resident Evil: Gun Survivor, a disappointing foray from the Zombesco universe into the ~arcade~ genre of first-person shooters, the most successful spin-off is undoubtedly that of Dino Crisis, the title we are considering here. Dino Crisis is none other than the transposition of the adventures of the protagonists of Resident Evil, in an alternative universe, where some secret experiment (so much for originality) has given, or rather given back, life to the oldest carnivores in the universe: the dinosaurs. Yes, of course, the protagonists change, the enemies change (dinosaurs instead of zombies), the setting changes (not a cursed house or an upset city, but a large laboratory isolated from the rest of the world), but what really doesn't change, it is the real backbone of the game. In reality, there has been a small change on a structural level, or rather a small innovation of a technical nature: in fact, unlike RE, the backgrounds, which can be appreciated in the various locations, are no longer pre-rendered, but are were designed using a new engine that allowed the polygonal construction. Even the camera that follows the game framing the character (Regina, a member of the special recovery team) from fixed positions, exactly as it happened in the progenitor Alone in The Dark, sometimes follows the same (which moves through separate locations divided from the others by some doors - and, unfortunately - by boring and inopportune loading) thanks to a sort of cinematographic tracking shot, giving the action a wider dose of dynamism. The title, which originally appeared more than a year ago on the best-selling gray box in the world (the PlayStation), arrives with a little delay (just think that Dino Crisis 2 is coming out on Play these days) on monitors of our computers, and it does so with a more than discreet conversion. In fact, unlike what happened in recent years with the conversions of Final Fantasy on the little one, in this case the programmers got busy and improved the video resolution, bringing it from the cubed 320 x something, typical of the play, to a more suitable (at least for the PC standard) 640x480. However, the luck of this transposition is not based exclusively on the increase in the resolution adopted, but on a tested and tested game scheme capable of maintaining the player's attention level at the highest levels.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
