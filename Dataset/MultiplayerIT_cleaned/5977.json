In short, war is not won only with armies, but also with the ability to dominate the market by hitting the adversaries where it hurts the most: in the production of goods. Trade routes are the core of the game Because if a raid slows down a city in the short term, inflation destines it to a slow asphyxiation that will have repercussions for decades to come. In short, on paper we are faced with a winning and truly original title. Initially Grand Ages: Medieval does not show major problems. The single player campaign begins with an introductory cinematic that contextualizes the gameplay. We are the lords of Sofia and we must try to conquer Europe for Constantinople and for our personal glory. After the tutorial, quite clear even if incomplete, we find ourselves grappling with the first tasks to be carried out: explore the map, build buildings, direct production and create the first trade route. Initially everything seems to work very well. The lookouts run far and wide across Eastern Europe revealing cities close to ours and some lost treasures. Arriving near a city allows you to open a diplomatic channel with the local administration, to negotiate the right of way, the granting of a trade route, declare war, and so on. After a couple of hours of play it is impossible not to notice a fact that will also be confirmed in the rest of the test: the map of Grand Ages: Medieval is terribly empty. In fact, it is not clear why such a large map was created so as not to put practically anything in it. There are a handful of cities, which if you know a little geography you will also be able to find without too much effort, there are roads, there are points to explore to collect resources or participate in some mini events and... that's it. In short, that the first positive impressions are destined to be denied? Economic warfare Having to summarize the latest work of Gaming Minds Studios we could define it as a concentration of excellent ideas implemented badly or halfway. But let's go back to the main concept of the title: conquering Europe through economic domination. How to do? The cities are beautiful, but not very customizable Let's say that it's the most complex aspect of the game and also the one that needs to be spent the most time on, for good and bad reasons. Now, imagine having a series of neighboring cities and wanting to subjugate them, avoiding having to build huge armies to crush their defenses. How about ruining their market by making them compete on the production of certain goods in order to depress their economy? Fascinating, right? The problem is that the idea is there, but the execution is lacking. It's not just a question of the complexity of the interface, which can also be overlooked since the game is obviously aimed at a savvy audience and a lover of the genre. Grand Ages: Medieval works very hard to do wrong what is essential for a strategist: to give information to the player. In some situations it is really difficult to understand what is right and what is wrong. Not that the game should tell us what to do, but at least provide clear economic indicators yes, especially those relating to trade, which is the cornerstone of the gameplay. The drama manifests itself more in periods of recession, i.e. when our economy begins to lose ground. It is true that there are expenditure items that tell us where we are spending more than we should, but only macro-categories are shown which make it a matter of intuition to decide how to intervene to save the situation. In truth, with experience you learn to understand what works and what doesn't, but at that point the interest aroused by the originality of the mechanics largely went to men of easy virtue, also because in the meantime the repetitive factor took over. Our review of Grand Ages: Medieval leaves little hope for strategy enthusiasts Small steps towards the abyss It's a pity that Grand Ages is so ambivalent in its implementation, because it has aspects that work well: for example the management of trade routes, which must be modified from time to time to attack the economy of this or that city, or to defend against galloping inflation. A lot of scene, but in reality the battles are secondary and poorly done Of course, the limit of only one merchant per city is hard to understand, but it doesn't take much to get used to. Too bad, however, that the rest is of a disarming mediocrity. Let's take the combat system. Gaming Minds Studios has gone to great lengths to limit the need to resort tothe army... and perhaps it would have been better to eliminate them all, given what is left. We haven't gone crazy, but the military side of Grand Ages is really lacking. The fights are the most static that can exist and often take place in an absurd way. Just assemble an army of more than one army and go challenge another army. Apparently the troops are well deployed and could lead to majestic battles, but in reality you only get some sad animations with little dynamics. Also calculate that armies tend to fall apart very quickly in the event of an economic crisis and you will understand how instead of enriching the game, the military side tends to penalize it, also because the troops to be produced are few and uninteresting. Other shortcomings A similar argument, even if softened, can be made for the infrastructural side. No, we didn't expect a city builder, but here the options for customizing and managing urban agglomerations are zero. A large map empty Everything is preset and to be honest there aren't even many buildings to build: barracks, churches, convents, some economic buildings and little else. The tavern offers a few more options, since it allows you to build new carts for merchants, to hire labor to build or renovate roads, essential for trade, to hire settlers and more. In general, these are aspects that work, a pity that they are not explored in the slightest and that each unit has very few functions. The exact same discourse is feasible for diplomacy, based on a simple selection of offers and requests, weighed on the relations between the factions. It works, there's little to say, but it offers very few options, not even approaching the complexity of any Paradox or Matrix Games strategy, or even one of Civilization. It is probable that many of the limitations of Grand Ages: Medieval have been designed in reference to multiplayer: streamlining the game mechanics can serve to make online games less heavy. It's just a shame that there are currently very few players to challenge. In short, setting up the games online can also be fine, but if there is no one online then it is those who want to or cannot but play them alone to be penalised.", "date": "2015-10-13", "grade": "5.9"}
