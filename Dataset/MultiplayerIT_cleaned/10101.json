Turn-based strategy, also quite challenging. This is the synthesis of Greed Corp, yet another attempt to bring a historically underappreciated genre to consoles (although it is also being released on PC). On the actual success in overthrowing what is a granitic historical reality and very rarely scratched by some lucky exceptions, frankly we would not put our hand on the fire. But we can say one thing with certainty: for the few (?) Xbox 360 and Ps3 users interested in this kind of product, Greed Corp is undoubtedly one of the best purchases that can be made on XBLA and PSN. I have my resources The setting in which the game is set, and which justifies the basis of the gameplay, is that of a dark and sad future in which the few resources left on the planet are the main reason for wars between factions, committed precisely to taking possession of what is left to exploit. A premise, that of the plot, necessary but negligible once you take the pad in hand; Greed Corp is - as mentioned at the beginning - a strategic game that uses a grid made up of hexagons that make up the squares on which to move or build your own structures. The main one is undoubtedly the harvester, a tool that allows you to recover money from all the boxes surrounding it at each turn; unfortunately the problem is that the collection of resources produces the disintegration, and finally the destruction, of the real terrain, which in fact disappears from the map, leaving only empty spaces. This is an element of capital importance, on which a large part of the game mechanics is based: in fact, it is important to evaluate which areas to exploit and possibly sacrifice, being very careful not to compromise tactically more important areas and at the same time not to leave structures or units on the destroyed hexes, since the latter would be irretrievably lost. The armory is fundamental, thanks to which you can build the basic units with which to take possession of the still free boxes or attack those of the opponent. The cannon is also important, to be loaded - at the cost of a turn - with projectiles capable of weakening the defenses or even knocking down already dangerous portions of territory. These are obviously just some of the tactical elements that make up Greed Corp, but a few minutes are enough in the very first missions to understand the exceptional balance of the gameplay studied by W!Games; each action must be carefully studied and evaluated, taking into account the money available and planning one's actions well beyond a single shift. As if that weren't enough to add tension, the limited timer contributes to making all the choices and decisions within a few seconds. Xbox 360 goals The 200 points aren't exactly given away in Greed Corp; in most cases, in fact, they are not given in relation to one's natural game path, but more specifically they are linked to particular actions such as the destruction of 3 boxes with a single cannon shot and things like that. Nothing transcendental, but the commitment required by the game is also perfectly reflected in the objectives. A future in hexagons The positive and intriguing thing about Greed Corp is that everything is in the player's hands; there is no luck factor, but only one's tactical and strategic ability is the discriminating factor to lead to a victory or a defeat. And we assure you that you will get a thorough knowledge of the latter, more often than not, because the artificial intelligence of the opponents gives little or nothing. There is no room for a sweet learning curve: the first challenge is already a test bench in which to take measurements and understand the weight of even a single error. The demanding and rather long-lasting single player mode actually represents only the long process of learning and perfecting the mechanics, even in the face of a concise and hasty tutorial; the next step is that of multiplayer, locally or online, in which up to 4 contenders can challenge each other on the same battlefield. Too bad that for the online community available is, to put it mildly, rather small, at least at the time of writing. Finally only a note for the technical component, certainly not of capital importance in this kind of products; and in fact both graphics and sound are purely functional, fairly pleasant but nothing more. The sale price is set at the classic 800 Microsoft Points or 9.90 euros on PSN.", "date": "2010-04-02", "grade": "8.4"}
