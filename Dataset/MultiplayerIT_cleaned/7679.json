The rule is confirmed by the case of Papers, Please, a title that is part of the series of videogames that without the indie scene, in all likelihood, we would never have seen: in fact, whoever could think of creating a game in which the Is the juice of the gameplay reduced to sorting through passports and other documents, in the role of an anonymous border inspector? Put this way, we realize that Papers, Please doesn't sound all that good, but we, who are here for this, thoroughly tested the efforts of Lucas Pope and his Studio 3909 which, we feel like anticipating right now, have did a great job Papers, Please is as original as it is surprising. A little gem that everyone should try It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it The dystopian scenario in which Papers, Please places us is that of an imaginary Eastern European nation. We are at the end of 1982 in full communist regime and Arstotzka, this is the name of the state, has faced a 6-year war against the neighbors of the Kolechia, finally gaining control of its own half of the city of Grestin, long claimed and dangerously placed on the border between the two countries. The player, a nameless and faceless ordinary citizen of Arstotzka, is delivered a letter from the Ministry of Immigration at the start of the game, which as a result of the October labor lottery immediately assigns him as an inspector at the border control point of Grestin; in exchange, the offer of a salary with which to support his family, at least in theory, and a modest class 8 apartment in the eastern part of the city. In the role of immigration inspector, the protagonist will now have to thoroughly analyze the data of each person entering Arstotzka from Kolechia, keeping his attention high to avoid granting entry to smugglers, spies and terrorists, from locate among the veritable river of arriving people. To do this, he will have to scrupulously analyze passports and other documents, detecting inconsistencies and forgeries, practically the order of the day in such a scenario in which those who try to cross the border often have nothing to lose. The one just described is nothing more than the incipit of the Story mode, as well as the main component that is offered to us by Papers, Please. Starting from the end of November 1982, the story takes place for 31 days, leading us towards 20 different endings available to us, obtainable by completing the entire game period in 4 hours or so. Those who want to unlock all the endings will certainly appreciate the rescue mode designed by Lucas Pope, thanks to which it is possible to precisely identify the various crossroads that are placed in front of us during the plot, to go and change the story at that point, without starting over everything from scratch. Furthermore, by reaching one of the endings in particular, it is also possible to unlock the Endless mode, with which to face floods of immigrants in the Timed, Perfection, or Endurance game types, each of which will assign us the score in a different way. Dystopia, rogue dystopia Starting from the first day of work, Papers, Please puts us at the mercy of potential terrorist attacks, epidemics and threats of various kinds. If at the beginning it is enough to take a quick look at the passport of the person on duty, cross-referencing the information with a few other data, gradually the variables to be taken into consideration increase, introducing for example the use of body scanners to intercept any criminals or the control of an additional permit for those who claim to enter Arstotzka to work, constantly paying attention to the consistency between the various documents and that the latter are not falsified. Easy said and a little less done, given that the people arriving in front of our cabin are not all the same, and in front of our questions they will react according to their personality, but above all their personal situation, risking in the most desperate cases even arrest. In fact, as days and people go by, the game carries on seemingly secondary story lines, linked to those who show up at the border like the group of dissidents asking for our help or the threatened prostitute. Real moral dilemmas, like the one that leads us to have to decide what to do with the wife with the documents not in order, after having given the green stamp to the husband who has just crossed the border. Human cases that Papers, Please spit on usface it dramatically: the true essence of this game sees the player constantly engaged in coming to terms with his conscience in the face of requests for help of all kinds that are made by people not in good standing to enter Arstotzka, including attempts to corruption. A series of assessments to be made being well aware that any errors can lead to a deduction from the already low salary, to be used at the end of the day to define the budget to be dedicated to the various domestic needs. After 18:00 sharp of each day, in fact, the player finds himself in front of the summary of his possessions, choosing what to allocate them to: care for one's sick aunt, heating and food for the whole family and medicines for one's child are just a few examples. The role of inspector therefore ends up taking on a thousand facets, pushing us suddenly to go from one extreme to the other. From seeing the flood of people arriving in a detached way to try to do their job well and maximize their salary, to turning a blind eye to protect their loved ones or vice versa to favor someone else knowing that this will cost us the plate on the table. A few words for the technical sector, inevitably destined to take a back seat since the entire game is summed up in 2 screens. The interface is more than appreciable and, importantly, never confusing in the management of a thousand documents, while the communist club soundtrack is destined to remain in the player's head, as is the ~Papers~ pronounced by his character at each arriving immigrant. The idea of using the real names of those who have sent their personal details to those who developed the game in recent months is also nice.", "date": "2013-08-12", "grade": "9.0"}
