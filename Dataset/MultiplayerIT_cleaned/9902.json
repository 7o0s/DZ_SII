Had Jett Rocket been released 10 years ago, he probably would have had to fight against a large group of direct competitors, and could have been saved by virtue of its technical implementation, even though it did not shine for particularly innovative solutions in terms of gameplay. Paradoxically, in 2010, Shin'en's game can enjoy greater freedom of movement and also wider possibilities of being appreciated within the new context in which it is proposed, namely digital delivery. Meeting region between low-budget productions, innovative ideas and vintage-style re-propositions, WiiWare probably manages to make the most of Jett Rocket, a game that has no intention of marking the history of the videogame market but which more than fulfills its duty : entertain the player for a few hours with well-tested gameplay and respectable level design, all for a modest outlay (1000 Wii Points). One can object to the lack of stylistic characterization of the graphics, but one must also recognize in this title a quality, from an aesthetic point of view, rarely seen within this context. On the other hand, the well-known elements that permeate the gameplay could have made people cry plagiarism some time ago, but now they are pleasant homages and tributes to the glorious past of 3D platformers, a genre that, in purity, is now limited to very few specimens these days, at least as far as triple A productions are concerned. This is why, while not shining absolutely in any particular sector, Shin'en's new game still represents an excellent new introduction within the digital delivery Nintendo, which in the latter period was going through a certain flattening of content. The Green Fighter The story staged in Jett Rocket is extremely simple, but also includes an ecological message, albeit as concise as possible. There are evil robots belonging to the Power Plant Posse group who, for reasons to be precisely defined, have decided to invade the world of Yoroppa forcing our hero to the arduous task of defeating them. For this, the protagonist must travel within the various areas into which the three game macro-worlds are divided (not many, in fact) collecting solar panels and eliminating enemies, including the institutional bosses at the end of the levels. The structure is typical of the 3D platform, with the ability to move the character 360 degrees within the scenario, hit the robots by shaking the remote control and obviously jump between platforms with the help of the jetpack, which prolongs the aerial phases but of which it is always necessary to balance the fuel consumption. In the midst of the suggestions that fill the game, it is clear how the attack closely resembles the one present in Super Mario Galaxy while the jetpack jump is a very direct reference to Super Mario Sunshine's ~Splac 3000~, just to mention a couple of illustrious sources of inspiration. What could have been a mere hodgepodge of elements taken from other games manages to amalgamate properly thanks to a respectable level design, which inserts the simple collection of objects, the journey from point A to point B and the clashes with the bosses at 'inside an organic continuum between classic jump phases calculated to the millimeter and puzzles to be solved starting from the few elements on the screen. The difficulty is not high, just as the amount of levels is rather low, but in its short duration Jett Rocket is fun and well balanced, leading even the most perfectionists to explore the various game areas several times in search of all the secrets present. The frequent introduction of different elements in the gameplay, such as racing on various vehicles within some levels, also allows for a good variation in the gameplay. Almost vintage taste Of course, if compared to current high-level productions, even on Wii, Jett Rocket's graphics clash somewhat with what the Nintendo console can do, but by contextualizing everything within WiiWare, one realizes how the game stands out under this aspect. His situation is indeed particular, as we note a certain effort on the part of Shin'en in trying to make the product as pleasant to look at, while moving within the budget constraints of a project with a not very high profile. A deliberately archaic or retro-chic style was not chosen, one would say, rather a genuine effort in trying to stage a three-dimensional world as convincing as possible, albeit set within a somewhat comic and senza too complex a polygonal modeling. However, we note the care taken in the representation of textures and various graphic effects such as transparencies, reflections, light sources that somewhat recall certain excellent results achieved in the last generation of consoles. A graphic therefore with an old flavor but not old-fashioned or in bad taste, while not using the vintage taste of the productions more akin to pixel-art. The bright colors, the classic three-dimensional platform settings (sea, snowy mountain, swamps) and the large end-of-level bosses make Jett Rocket an always appreciable and current product, despite the basic simplicity as regards technical realization and gameplay. Some problems are found in the management of the camera, which sometimes does not frame the action perfectly by failing to find the right angle, but these are rather sporadic moments, nevertheless annoying. For its part, the audio sector accompanies the game action with the right liveliness and light-heartedness typical of the genre, in a manner appropriate to the setting present on the scene. Stylistically it is nothing shocking, but it is clear that the whole game has been designed with gameplay in mind as a fundamental element, supported by good level design, as happens in honest videogame craftsmanship products that aim to amuse rather than impress .", "date": "2010-07-15", "grade": "8.0"}
