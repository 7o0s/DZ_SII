This particular action puzzle in fact sees a dangerous extraterrestrial species aiming to conquer our planet , a goal to be achieved, however, in small steps. Microscopic indeed. In fact, aliens are the size of tiny bacteria, and if therefore an attack on the major cities of the planet, on Independence Day, would be at least impractical, the same cannot be said of an offensive brought from within, through a virus capable of infecting one person after another to thereby gain control of the Earth. But how will these tiny invaders get into people's bodies and overcome their immune defenses? Well, that's where we literally come in. Through a story mode made up of five different ~zones~, in the form of subjects brought into contact with the virus, we will have to act with the right timing and very quickly to ~solve~ stages that are presented to us precisely as puzzles to solve. Lethal infection We therefore have an alien virus and a series of subjects in which this virus is inoculated, but how exactly does the gameplay of Tiny Invaders work? It's very simple: each level is represented by a ~circuit~, ideally a small part of the circulatory system of the infected subject, on which there are some objects that we must collect. The most important ones allow us to spread the infection, but there are others preparatory to the same purpose, which once incorporated multiply our vectors. Vectors that move right along this circuit as soon as we give them our input, automatically pick up the objects and deposit them at the starting point (the microscopic alien) along the way. There are basically two actions that we are called to perform in what, all in all, seems more like an automatic context: firstly, modifying the path of our pathogens ~on the fly~ to allow them to reach the objects that interest us, secondly, temporarily increase its speed. This last operation is necessary to obtain the phantom ~three stars~ in each level, the completion of which is related to a timer, but also to escape the pitfalls that the game begins to introduce from a certain point onwards: antibodies which can eliminate our vectors, forcing us to send new ones, set traps and so on. The mix of reasoning, timing and strategy is certainly valid and conquers after a few minutes, even if the gradual increase in difficulty and the time limit constraint can sometimes make the experience frustrating, especially if you don't particularly like this kind of production. From a technical point of view, however, nothing to complain: the graphics of Tiny Invaders are nice, very colorful and designed in a simple but effective style, while the sound accompanies the action without disturbing. Of course, a greater personality of the accompanying musical pieces would have been welcome. As for the controls, entrusted completely to the touch screen, we have excellent responsiveness and a good layout of the commands, capable of making the experience immediate as expected.
