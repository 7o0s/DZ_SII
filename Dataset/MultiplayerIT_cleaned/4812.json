The author of this title is one of the most skilled pens in the world of video games, a profession that he has been dealing with with unparalleled passion since the early nineties. Sawyer was the designer of the two Icewind Dales for Black Isle Studios, and would also be the designer of Fallout 3 which never came to light because Interplay blew up. After an unfortunate stint at Midway, he reunited with his former colleagues in 2005 and officially joined Obsidian. Here his role was fundamental for the creation of Fallout: New Vegas and the two Pillars of Eternity, as well as the futuristic but ramshackle Alpha Protocol and the promising Aliens: Crucible that Sega then decided to cancel. A magical book Pentiment: At the beginning of the game we will be asked to define our character's past Pentiment is an idea that Josh Sawyer has been carrying around since the very first years of his career but which only began to materialize in 2018 thanks to the success of games such as Night in The Woods and Oxenfree (both highly recommended). Microsoft's role was also fundamental: the Redmond giant didn't buy Obisidian to transform it into a highly automated blockbuster factory, but to grant it the economic stability essential to experiment at full capacity. The strategy seems to have paid off since Obisdian has never been so prolific and versatile: Grounded is one of the most original and successful action/survival games around while Pentiment, well, Pentiment... A true story Pentiment: The game is almost exclusively dialogue based, with few puzzles and no inventory Pentiment is a magical book that tells a story that will literally be written before our eyes, above the rubble of our choices. As with any magic, this too naturally requires the magician to use one or more tricks: in this case we have a plot already outlined by pre-constructed moments that will inevitably converge towards a single ending. It's not just smoke and mirrors, and the way we behave throughout the game will still have enormous consequences within the narrative. Pentiment is a historical and deductive thriller, there are murders and the user must try to solve them, yet the heart of the matter seems to be another: the passage of time and the succession of men. The new Obsidian game seems to want to explain how the layers of human history accumulate on the ground, one on top of the other, and to do so it narrows the lens on the imaginary village of Tassen, a Bavarian sixteenth century. It is precisely in Tassen that we will wake up, after an unsettling dreamlike journey, in the role of Andreas Maler, currently engaged as a miniaturist in the scriptorium of the monastery which dominates the valley. You can discover what a miniaturist is and what a scriptorium is for directly in the game, through an exhaustive and interesting glossary that will be enriched along the way with period definitions. The historical reconstruction of Pentiment is one of the most rigorous ones, not only for videogame standards. The team that built this experience is clearly in love with the subject, and has done all the necessary research to give credibility to a setting as simple as it is all-encompassing. The village of Tassen, the abbey that overlooks it, the convent at its feet and the forest that embraces and protects this corner of the Holy Roman Empire, are the home of dozens of unique and perfectly characterized characters. The many names and faces will initially only confuse, but gradually a precious and fundamental familiarity will take over for the emotional functioning of this game. The story of Pentiment and its cast spans more than twenty-five years, a narrative device reinforced by two great time jumps: we will see children grow up and not just the elders die, families prosper and homes once full of life slowly fade away. Melancholy and hope will be tied to various murders whose solution is important, and at the same time completely irrelevant because it will not be precisely the narrative arc that will change, but the lives of those who will suffer the consequences of our words. Words weigh more than actions and choices in Pentiment. May the Lord bless you Pentiment: the work of an illuminator is difficult but it will allow us to live a precious normality Pentiment has no puzzles to solve, other than rather simple little things, nor an inventory full of items and actions. Pentiment is not that kind of game, or graphic adventure, but an experience that is tied to relationships and dialogues. We will be able to build the background of our Andreas Maler by decreeing past studies and travels, giving him particular knowledgewhich will then characterize certain passages of the adventure but above all, once again, the dialogues. The vast majority of your time with Pentiment will be spent talking to the people of Tassen, and living your life between abbey and village. Precisely because the relationships between the different characters are so important, the preparation for each individual murder is deliberately slow and meticulous: to see the first dead you will have to play quite a bit, experiencing Andreas' daily life and getting to know the large cast. The dialogues are multiple choice, with more or less options based on our character's knowledge of the subject matter; from time to time we will also have access to the protagonist's inner thoughts which will allow us to have an advance, always smoky, of the possible consequences of the chosen words. Do you know where it is understood that the dialogues are thought out in a masterly way? Here the unspoken words are also important, in some cases it is better to remain silent and not tell it all or all of it right. This is something we would have liked to know before starting the game, therefore it is also a very good advice for you who will be starting it soon. Everything flows... Pentiment: Religion will play a key role in the game, as well as its pagan origins But don't worry: in Pentiment there is no game over and there is no road that we could define as right or wrong. In the Obsidian game, everything flows relentlessly, organically, twisting around our personal interpretation of Andreas Maler, an improvising actor but of a drama that has already been written. Along the adventure you will explore the surrounding territories and something more, you will often rely on your notebook to cross-reference names and events, you will recite three Our Fathers and a Hail Mary in full. You will experience the daily life of a silent monastery where not everything goes as the Ladies, you will even meet a recluse nun, you will assist and interact in long group chats such as when they invite you to assist in the tanning of women's wool, a moment of normality of extremely rare beauty in a video game. However, we don't want to tell you more, exaggerate with the examples: whether or not you are in tune with the experience proposed by Pentiment you will probably have already understood it, and any additional detail would ruin cascading surprises. An animated picture Pentiment: in the last act the game will flow less effectively than in the previous ones The most striking aspect of Pentiment is undoubtedly its graphics, a crasis between past and present of rare beauty that makes every corner of the game a small work of art. The credit goes to Hanna Kennedy, a young artist who in Obsidian had already collaborated on the birth of The Outer Worlds but who here, as Art Director, naturally plays a much more important, not to say fundamental, role in the success of the project. The music too, entrusted to the ensemble specialized in period music Alkemie, is very good, but its use has left us a bit dumbfounded. We appreciated that for a large part of the game there are only sound effects to keep us company, but even when the music would have had more room to grow and emphasize the most important events this has not happened, except in some very rare situations. If this is not the weak point of the game, it is an always interesting third act, but decidedly less intriguing than the previous ones. In this phase, Pentiment distances itself from its heinous crimes to momentarily change its face, paying a pace that up to that moment, provided you love the assumptions, could be defined as perfect. It remains a unique adventure of its kind, truly excellently made, which will initially immerse you in the atmospheres of The Name of the Rose from which, however, it will not be afraid to distance itself as it begins to close its peculiar curtain.", "date": "2022-11-14", "grade": "8.5"}
