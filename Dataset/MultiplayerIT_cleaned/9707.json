{"name": "Quel treno per Yuma", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81705-trainyard-quel-treno-per-yuma.html", "text": "On a strictly black background, we find two colored objects: one is the starting point of our train, the other is the arrival point. To solve the level, we simply have to connect the two points by drawing a path of rails with our fingers that can connect them, then press the button on the touch screen that starts the train. If it is a short and linear movement, the solution to the riddle is extremely simple, a matter of a few seconds: our monorail starts, moves at the speed we want (it can be adjusted at will) and reaches its destination safe and sound . But when things get a little more complex, the operation stops being trivial and the first problems arise. Trainyard, the new puzzle game for iPhone and iPod Touch created by the independent developer Matt Rix, bases its gameplay precisely on the progressive emergence of new problems to deal with because our train (or our trains, given that in no time at all we will find to manage several at the same time) make its journey without problems and arrive at the end of the line perfectly intact. At the beginning, these are simple physical obstacles, to be avoided by drawing a few curves here and there; but soon forks begin to appear, shared destinations, predetermined arrival orders and so on. A tutorial shows us each time the new features introduced, explaining how they work and then leaving us to solve the puzzle. In some cases, however, we will find ourselves facing unpublished and still unannounced situations: a small adaptation test to verify if we have made the philosophy behind the game our own. Anna, I am a train There are really numerous elements of variation that Trainyard introduces through its one hundred stages, to which another fifty more difficult ones are added once the ~expert mode~ is unlocked. Not content with letting us manage several trains at the same time, in fact, at a certain point the game asks us to work on the ~travel times~ so that each monorail can reach its destination in an established order, for example the blue one first, then the red one and finally the yellow one. Similarly, the use of colors is extended to combinations: matching the path of the red and yellow trains so that a single orange train reaches the end of the line, or even crossing two trains so that their colors combine despite having different destinations . The number of new ideas inserted from time to time in the gameplay seems to have no end, and thus situations are reached in which in a single ~race~ numerous variables must be taken into account, with the ~trial & error~ structure which takes more and more foot and forces us to carry out quick experiments to understand how to solve the riddle of the moment. In the end, this type of approach ends up leaving a lot of room for luck: there are stages, especially towards the middle of the game, which are resolved a bit at random and without particular reasoning, which is a pity because in this way it diminishes the value of our contribution. Perhaps it is also partly the fault of the control system, which is sometimes not as reliable as one would expect and forces us to draw and erase our route several times, then resorting to the ~start~ button in a hurry to make up for lost time uselessly. The presence of infinite ~undo~ should guarantee a certain flexibility during the drawing operations, but it is a feature that in reality we will use very little. Not much to say about the technical aspect of the product: graphics and sound are essential, the latter in particular, even if a good job has certainly been done in terms of style and recognition.
