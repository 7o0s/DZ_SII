This narrative adventure mixing platforming and exploration has been given a rare makeover. In fact, it is not a simple porting, but something more. Let's see the details in our review of Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut. Sea of Solitude | Review Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut: The design doesn't change Let's start with the basics. Sea of Solitude tells the story of Kay, a girl lost in a sea that has submerged a city. Darkness is the enemy, as are the monstrous creatures that lurk in the depths of the sea. The adventure leads us to explore various places, both by boat, our trusted companion, and on foot. If you have already read our original review or even played the game, you know how Sea of Solitude works. In this respect, there have been no changes. Kay's story follows the same original play structure, between jumps, dialogues and simple environmental interactions. However, the narrative component is changed. The development team has basically rewritten the entire Sea of Solitude. The plot, in its key points, has not been revolutionized, mind you. It's still the story of Kay, Sunny and the rest of their family. The main themes have remained unchanged, but the dialogues have been completely redone. In some cases these are irrelevant changes, in practice a paraphrase of what was previously written. In other cases, however, Sea of Solitude approaches the plot differently. Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut: The plot changes, but not too much For example, in the original game it was said that Kay's father had skipped a vacation (which he organized) because he suddenly hated the idea of going to the mountains, at which point the mother replied that she didn't understand how he was doing the man. In Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut, on the other hand, the father was unable to participate because a work commitment kept him at the last minute, to which the mother claims that the rest of the family should have had fun for him too. The tone of the speech is very different, even if in practice the same thing happened. The game is filled with these changes. Furthermore, there are some real omissions. The sea monster that hunts us in the aquatic phases no longer has a voice. If before it was an almost symbolic monster, now it's just a gameplay threat without an identity. Again: the girl who guides Kay from phase to phase has slightly lost its importance: many dialogues that mentioned her have disappeared and it almost seems that Kay doesn't pay too much attention to the fact that she cyclically disappears. Furthermore, in the basic version Kay talks to herself often during exploration (even too much as we told you in our review): in Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut her dialogues have been reduced. Above all, dialogues that had practical purposes (~Now I have to go open that gate~) and some jokes and puns have been eliminated, probably also to give a more serious tone to the game. References to the subject of suicide have also been made less explicit. The changes, in any case, are not just narrative. The positions of the collectibles (bottles and seagulls) have been changed, probably to entice even those who have already completed the game in other versions to re-explore. A photo mode was then added. In addition, the game has received a new dub (always in English). The new entries are more suited to young characters and are well made, but even the previous ones were certainly not unpleasant. The question then is, are these changes impactful enough to justify buying the game if you've already completed previous versions? No, in our opinion not. It is a valid new approach to the story which, however, is essentially the same. The second question is: should a player who has yet to approach the game prefer Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut? Yes, if we consider this the definitive version according to the point of view of the authors and we want to ~respect~ their vision. However, there are a couple of technical considerations to take into account. Sea of Solitude The Director's Cut: On Switch it's not technically perfect The Director's Cut version of the game is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. We are talking about a technically unprocessed indie game, but with the transition to the console of the great N we cannot expect a visual quality equal to that of the PC. It is above all the effects of light and shadows that have been weakened, creating an unpleasant effect with most of the game environments. Even the horizon linete is inferior, with some large elements struggling to load: fortunately it is a minor problem that has no regular impact. Furthermore, the frame rate is far from stable: it is not a playful limit, since we are not talking about a technical, fast or competitive game, but it is still a pity that the adventure is not perfectly fluid. At the very least, this new version includes revised and improved animations.", "date": "2021-03-06", "grade": "7.5"}
