{"name": "Un nuovo inizio per NFS?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73487-need-for-speed-nitro-un-nuovo-inizio-per-nfs.html", "text": "Version tested: Nintendo WiiThe year that has just ended represented a turning point for the popular Need for Speed series, which faced with far from rosy prospects (there was even talk of cancellation, in the face of less exciting than usual sales) has able to reinvent itself thanks to new development teams and substantial changes that have involved all product sectors. The change has also upset the multiplatform policies of Electronic Arts, apparently, given the birth of an ~alternative~ series specially designed for Wii and Nintendo DS which on the one hand recovers the arcade connotation of the origins and on the other focuses on a completely new graphic style, cartoony, with characters that seem to come out of a cartoon and cars with anything but realistic shapes, with huge wheels that contrast with tiny cockpits following interesting rounded lines. In Need for Speed: Nitro you get to drive improbable vehicles (vans, minivans, old utility cars) but also indomitable racing cars, for a total of thirty cars divided into three categories: city, high performance and supercar. Each machine is accompanied by a technical data sheet which describes its characteristics of speed, acceleration, handling and resistance. These are values that cannot be modified with the classic tuning, unfortunately, which in Nitro is limited to the aesthetic sector: vinyls, paints, rims and body parts modified to give a pinch of character even to an old cart. Thanks to the Wii-mote and its infrared pointer, customization operations appear immediately intuitive and fun, allowing us to create what we want in seconds. And so a classic car like the ~Beetle~ becomes a mix of air intakes, spoilers, psychedelic paintwork and oversized wheels. Along the way There are two game modes available, but in reality it is only the ~career~ that offers us a certain progression and an interesting scoring system which, together with the cash earnings, unlocks new cars, new locations, new circuits and new cups. There are three of them (bronze, silver and gold), each paired with a vehicle class and divided into a large number of stages offering more than one hundred events in total. Races can be circuit (the first to cross the finish line wins), elimination (every thirty seconds the last competitor in the group is eliminated), team (traditional race, but organized with a team of several vehicles) and with acceleration. The latter constitute a bit of the novelty of the moment, and refer to the illegal races seen in the various ~Fast & Furious~, in which one competes along straight paths relying solely and exclusively on one's own reflexes in operating the gear change and in the 'activate nitrous oxide, which is a key element in Need for Speed: Nitro for good reason. Even during traditional races, in fact, we must always keep an eye on the nitro bar, make it go up by drifting and overtaking in the slipstream, and use it to create as much distance as possible between us and our opponents. From this point of view, the EA title is very reminiscent of the Midnight Club series and unfortunately shares its limits: when nitro becomes a predominant element in the economy of the race, we end up putting aside important factors in racing games such as cleaning driving, the choice of trajectories and braking management. The experience therefore becomes very chaotic and ~clattery~, inevitably losing the thickness that characterizes many of the best arcade racers around. Points of view Italian dubbing, signed soundtrack and completely redesigned graphics, with an original style at least: from a technical point of view, Need for Speed: Nitro does not disappoint and is undoubtedly one of the best titles of the genre for Wii. The choice to give up the usual ~realistic~ approach with regards to the cars will surely make more than one enthusiast turn up their noses, but it must be recognized that in this way the EA title lays the foundations for a whole new identity, from which to start obtain important results even in a situation where there is practically no valid competitors. The polygonal models of the cars therefore appear less complex than usual and boast a barely discrete level of damage, but they run within well-characterized scenarios, always very rich in moving objects yet anchored to a fluid frame rate, which shows the side few uncertainties. The use of colors is good, the blur effect that is activated when we press the nitro button is convincing and the shot during the drifts adds further dynamism to already frenetic and spectacular situations. The butThe lack of an online multiplayer mode is certainly a limitation that is far from negligible, and we hope that the developers can remedy this as early as the next episode. Meanwhile, it's nice to see that the control system comes in every conceivable configuration: Wii Wheel, Wii-mote and Nunchuck, Classic Controller and GameCube controller. In all cases, help is available to better deal with curves, but even by deactivating it, the impression is that driving via motion detection is equally assisted, albeit to a lesser extent. The experience via the Wii Wheel is immediately precise and convincing, mixing involvement and simplicity, but it is clear that using a joypad solves many problems, especially during special challenges that require pinpoint control.", "date": "2010-01-14", "grade": "7.9"}
