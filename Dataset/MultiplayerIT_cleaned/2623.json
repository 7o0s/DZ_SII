{"name": "Medal of Honor Underground", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-underground.html", "text": "Additions compared to the prequel Although there is a certain feeling of deja-vu at the beginning, you will soon learn to identify the new additions, from the most evident to the almost imperceptible ones: in addition to the new weapons, the enemies will have a greater variety and above all, this time there will not only be human opponents to to face, but also vehicles such as the fearsome panzers, easily knocked down with the new Panzerfaust rocket launcher or, if you don't find it, with the machine guns of the trenches or with Molotov cocktails. There are two other innovations that are worth mentioning: the first concerns a kind of ~buddy~ mode, which will see you accompanied during the mission by an ally, which you will usually have to escort and cover, but which will prove essential to take out quickly most enemies, as a second addition there is the disguise mode, which can almost always be used starting from the scenario set in Morocco: after having trapped a photographer in the bathroom of a hotel, Manon will take possession of her camera and her authorization, finding herself so you can walk around the guards without problems, with the ability to photograph them (really ridiculous when they pose) and blind them with the flash, before taking them out with a quick headshot with your silenced pistol. Multiplayer what a passion! These game variants make MoH Underground more varied and as I have already mentioned before, the moments of ~already seen~ will be very few and as in the previous chapter the fun of shooting Nazi soldiers will take over after a few minutes of play, moreover all the objectives you will have to complete will never make you get frustrated and will never be trivial, from the canonical discoveries of secret documents to the destruction of a series of anti-aircraft guns, the only flaw is that sometimes you may not see a small inlet, which more often than not contains the only element you are missing to complete the mission, forcing you to wander throughout the level at least once. Going more specifically into the technical part of the game we can first of all say that the sound, especially the music, is simply EXCEPTIONAL, showing us that one of Spielberg's many guarantees is that he always gives us splendid soundtracks in all his films or right now , in all the games in which he took part, on the graphic side instead the same previous graphic was re-proposed to us with some more details, which unfortunately do not eliminate the old but fortunately rare graphic inaccuracies already found in the first game, such as the character that sometimes struggles to pass between two narrow walls. Last but not least, the multiplayer mode, which, although not the best seen in this genre of games, manages to considerably lengthen the longevity, already high thanks to the numerous levels of the one-player mode, everything is made more varied possible thanks to the numerous secrets that can be activated by making excellent performances in the single game. To conclude... Finally, I recommend buying the game to all those who are looking for a nice first-person shooter on Playstation, in case they want to change the setting I recommend the excellent Alien Resurrection instead, waiting for the real Medal of Honor 2 on Playstation 2. pros: simply the best first-person shooter cons: game difficulty not very balanced In film school... Some time after its first appearance on the Playstation, Medal of Honor tries again, taking us back to the Second World War directly to the front lines to fight the Nazis. Supervising the project is the usual and incomparable director Steven Spielberg, who proves for the second time more than capable of showing us a tragic historical reality not only with the help of the film industry (the beautiful Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and The Empire of the Sun, as well as a documentary on the subject filmed recently) but also thanks to the world of videogame entertainment, with the underlying hope of at least being able to make younger minds think and naturally more detached. Returning to the game, we can safely say that, rather than a second chapter, this Underground is a kind of Moh 1.5, too limited to be a real sequel but also too extensive to be defined as a ~mission pack~ : the role we will have in the story will make us dress ssometimes in the role of an old acquaintance, controlling the charming girl of the French resistance Manon you will have to undermine the German destruction machine from within, starting right from your Paris up to visit some exotic locations that give that little extra touch of variety that sometimes it was missing in the first game (except for the beautiful level inside a U-Boat submarine, mind you), citing among all the sunny and dangerous Morocco or the mysterious Greece.", "date": "2001-03-04", "grade": null}
