{"name": "Akaneiro: Demon Hunters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114413-akaneiro-demon-hunters-a-caccia-di-demoni.html", "text": "If you put a signature on any object, whether it's a painting, a novel, a wall or a check, it's because you want to link your identity to that of the object itself. Not for nothing in the arts do we speak of authors or ~signatures~, or ~big names~. Putting one's name in front of any work is a demanding act because, like it or not, it becomes a distinctive element that connotes it and creates a different disposition in those who will have to use it. However, doing so also entails a great responsibility: the name must correspond to a certain type of aesthetic content, which is recognizable as associable with the name. In short, ~Django~ is recognizable as a film by Tarantino, just as ~The Idiot~ is recognizable as a book by Dostoyevsky. After playing Akaneiro: Demon Hunters for a bit, it's not clear why American McGee cares so much about attributing him as the author. Apart from the fact that the protagonists wear capes in the style of Little Red Riding Hood, and therefore there is a very vague reference to the distorted fairy tales so dear to the good American, the rest really does not offer any particular cue that makes evident his role as author in the economy of the Opera. We are faced with a most typical action role-playing game with monsters and settings straight out of oriental legends... or someone wants us to believe that the hundreds of wolves who slaughter each other during the adventure are another reference to Western fairy tales? But no come on, they are much more reminiscent of the good Amateratsu than the poor bad wolf. Even at the plot level we are dealing with a very thin product. The narration is entrusted to comics that occasionally appear in the head of the main character, who can be created at the beginning of the game by choosing between three classes, which are also difficult to read. Lag take me away Akaneiro: Demon Hunters can be played from the browser or by downloading the free client from the official website. We preferred the first option, because the second turned out to be hell, with updates downloaded at 100 bytes per second. These problems will probably be resolved in the next few days, so we won't take them into account (but it's fair to report them). Entering the game we choose to face the tutorial, only to discover that we are faced with all the stylistic features of action RPGs, which we now know by heart. There is the red energy bar, the blue magic bar, there are special abilities and packages of all the same objects to be found around the maps, hoping that among the infinity of bitumen collected there is something useful. The most obvious features are the difficulty in finding healing potions, which can be purchased for stratospheric prices, and the possibility of sharing missions with other players, which is very useful especially when tackling the more difficult ones. Obviously the main character, whether man or woman, is controlled with the mouse: the left button is used to attack with the weapon in hand, while the right button is used to use the selected skill. There is no shortage of the usual keyboard shortcuts and merchants, the latter being the real outlet for our efforts if you want to go somewhere and not take a blow from the first generic enemy passing by. But we'll talk about micro-transactions later. In the early stages, little attention is paid to it, because the enemies are not that numerous and they don't do much harm, but it is already enough to replay a map with the highest level of challenge to realize how much Akaneiro is plagued by lag. In the best cases, the visual outputs to one's shots arrive after a few moments, in the worst cases the enemies manage to get away and die who knows where, while we are surrounded by opponents who take away our energy who knows when. Translation: you don't understand anything and you press at random and eagerly hoping to survive. The most extreme cases didn't happen very often, but each time they ended up with our death... and since respawn costs, it's not very pleasant. Either the bag or boredom Akaneiro: Demon Hunters has a microtransaction system that we have no hesitation in defining invasive. It is true that everything can be purchased with the game currency (karma), but it must be said that a very meager loot can be collected around the maps, especially in relation to the prices of everything. Do you want to unlock a new set of levels, with a relative increase in the level cap? Then don't even go and talk to the various merchants, except to sell them your scraps, because it is likely that you will need every penny to buy the right to continue in the game. So let's not talk about the prices of armor and new skills, often really abnormal. The only way to make the harvest more fruitful is to increase the difficulty level of the mission... by paying. If you want you can rely on the game and chooseand only maps with the maximum threat level, but in this case, freedom becomes minimal. For the record, the money can also be spent to obtain the exact opposite effect, that is to reduce the difficulty. The result is that the first, long hours of the game are spent mechanically accumulating money to be able to move forward in the story, without caring about all the other aspects of the character, really unmanageable if you don't want to sit still for hours playing with the same maps (or you choose not to pay). But the player's expenditure chapters are not only those indicated: do you want a healing potion? You pay. Do you want a pet to accompany you for a few minutes? You pay. Are you defeated and don't want to go back to the village losing all the accumulated experience (which doesn't grow while playing, but only at the end of each mission)? You pay. In short, to the standard costs we must also add a whole series of secondary costs which make the accumulation of money even slower. With enemies getting stronger and items found in chests, or slaying monsters, granting only the minimum wage in terms of upgrades, it soon becomes clear that spending some real money is the only way to enjoy the game fully, even if the free2play model guarantees the usual temporary satisfaction of an artificial desire, a bit like drugs, a desire that returns stronger when the money purchased is over and you find yourself immersed in the loop of too expensive objects, growth too slow and so on. Don't be scared, we are among those who don't believe in free games and who take for granted that to keep the situation going there is always a need for someone who pays and who, rightly so, is rewarded by doing so (otherwise who pays to do? To let players play the others?). It's a questionable model as long as you want, but it's now becoming more popular because it allows you to capture a large number of players who would never pay a euro for an original video game. Sure, maybe they don't hunt for anything, but they create that critical mass necessary to motivate others to do so (this is the theory of luxury, which has value only because it is envied by a large mass of people who cannot afford it). Basically it's just a new form of classism, but there is a way and a way to implement it. For Akaneiro: Demon Hunters the most brutal path was chosen, namely the one that aims to convince you to pay as soon as possible. It is interesting to note that more than any other sector of the gaming market, the free2play sector (and micro-transactions in general) puts the economic system at the center of the gameplay, which is impossible not to consider in the review phase.", "date": "2013-02-13", "grade": "5.5"}
