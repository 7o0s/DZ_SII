Good, but not without risks: we have already had the opportunity to underline how a handheld is not the best machine for this kind of game, does the same rule apply in this case? On Nintendo eShop a proposal for lovers of Ace Combat and Z.O.E. Let's go check it out! Not Global The title is set in a near future, in which our Earth is devastated by the usual pre- and post-apocalyptic nuclear wars/revolutions/catastrophes. The story, told through screenshots of text sufficiently well translated into Italian, tells us of the attempt to re-establish local governments after an obviously failed phase characterized by a world super-government: there are two factions in particular, with a Germanic flavor , to collide, Luftstrom and Nordlicht, and the first gives life to a prototype of the definitive weapon, an android with female features capable of transforming into a fighter plane. His name is Eins, Lance for his friends, and, well done, you are in charge of it. In stages / arenas that are very reminiscent of those of Ace Combat and any game of the genre, the possibility of Eins to transform introduces several interesting mechanics on paper. The android form and the jet form, interchangeable on the fly, obviously have different characteristics, and if the latter is absolutely necessary to maintain contact with enemies, move faster and also move up and down, in real combat and indeed it is somewhat ineffective compared to the graceful robotic maiden, who can hook enemies, fire more powerful shots, avoid missiles with greater dexterity, also has a sort of sword (Z.O.E., we said) available for close attacks and which, however, is much more limited in movement. The dynamics are therefore interesting, however, it collides with several problems, first of all a control system that is not exactly intuitive in either mode, furthermore plagued by the absence of any in-game tutorial (despite the fact that they contact us often and willingly from the headquarters), and then by the difficulty that seems to increase too artificially between one stage and another. It is not clear why, for example, if in one level we managed to avoid all enemy blows, in the immediately following one we do not escape even one. The 3D effect In a game of this kind it could make the difference, and instead given the small size of the opponents that will make you resort more to the lock-on mechanics than to the eyes to fight, and to the scarcity of the seabed elements, it doesn't add much either to the spectacularity of the action nor the gameplay. It also seems to affect the smoothness of the graphics slightly, but overall it's decently done. Shopping every day In short, a gentler and above all more natural difficulty curve would be welcome along the 16 levels that make up the story mode, to be possibly replayed in free mode in pursuit of the perfect performance. It is noted that the choice is conscious, to somehow increase the broth which is actually not very long, but not so little, all things considered. Mind you, if you get stubborn you will always find a way to pass an internship, the consequence of this however is that once you have found a strategy, you just need to repeat it ad libitum (and the more advanced internships take on a considerable length) and the game is done . To meet us are the upgrades, which can be purchased with the currency obtained by playing. There are numerous for attack, defense and range and the nice thing is that, in confirmation of good planning, by enhancing a department you often have to give up something in the other, pushing the player to a worthy planning. However, the outlay is significant for each purchase, thus forcing you to replay a level in order to evolve properly, another way to increase longevity in an artificial way, which then collides again with the length of the levels and, possibly, the not excessive freshness of the gameplay. From a technical point of view, the model, or rather the models, of the protagonist are really well made and animated. A careful study reveals a certain lack of detail and above all a lot of aliasing, but since it is a production for eShop we can be satisfied; not at the same level, however, the models of the enemies (see belowwe also linearize the small dimensions, which also affects the gameplay), and above all the settings, very few in polygons and dull both in colors and in textures. The fluidity is however, and perhaps thanks to this, good. The music of the stages is so anonymous that it will make you regret the disturbing silence present in the text screens through which the plot unfolds, and there is also a fair amount of speech, remained in Japanese, which however is perfectly useless and in the end , for some, even annoying. The price of 7 Euros can ultimately justify the total absence of multiplayer and/or online components, and finally mention, as we have already mentioned, for the good Italian of the texts, albeit with some imperfections here and there.", "date": "2015-04-28", "grade": "5.8"}
