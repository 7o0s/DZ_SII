{"name": "Tranformers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tranformers.html", "text": "Unfortunately, this time the result is not up to the good inspiring film; Transformers: the game, as in the case of the console editions, is a mediocre quality tie-in that fails to establish itself on real merits, limiting itself to exploiting the popularity of the moment to try to end up on the mobile phones of fans. The game puts you in control of Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots (the good guys), in an attempt to defeat the Decepticons (the bad guys). The game structure is incredibly trivial and limited, a rather strange factor given the excellent curriculum of a software house like Glu. Yet Transformers is simply a side-scrolling action/platformer that adds nothing to the genre, and fails to prove itself good enough to earn a pass. In practice, everything is resolved in crossing the various levels by eliminating the enemies present through the cannon available to the protagonist. Although the weapon in question is equipped with an auto-lock, and therefore does not require the need to aim to hit, the presence of an overheating indicator requires its use in moderation, thus adding a minimum tactical component to the product. But in a Transformers game you expect to find mostly transformations, right? And so here is that Optimus Prime can change at will from the humanoid form to that of a truck; in the latter situation it is not possible to use the cannon, but on the other hand you can count on a higher movement speed, on the possibility of crossing otherwise inaccessible areas and lastly on the ability to literally run over the opponents. That's all; and if the impression you have drawn is unsatisfactory and unrewarding, the reality is exactly this. The combat system does not offer great satisfaction, nor does the structure of the levels, decidedly flat and linked to archaic mechanics nowadays by now very little fun. Even the presence of simple puzzles, which involve the use of his friend Ironhide, don't add much to an experience that remains insipid and colorless; the same adjectives can also be used to describe the story, not analogous to that of the film, and which finds its only point of interest in the presence of Bumblebee as narrator, made in a good 3d. The picture closes with an unattractive graphic component, which limits itself to ~doing the homework~ without offering any particular ideas. The details are reduced, the variety of enemies very narrow, and in general one immediately has the clear impression of being faced with an aesthetically outdated game, which - for example - can only look at the recent Gameloft productions with binoculars .
