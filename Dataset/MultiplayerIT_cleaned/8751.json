Thanks to a greater diffusion of fights via TV and to a series of reforms carried out on the regulations which effectively eliminated some of the most brutal components of its fights and introduced stricter and more attentive rules for the health of the athletes, the UFC has seen an increase the public's approval of him on a planetary level is notable. Hand in hand with the real counterpart, the video game based on MMA, namely UFC Undisputed, has also been able to gather acclaim and new followers in recent years, thanks to the skilful work of THQ and Yuke's, the pairing behind WWE '12. After the critical and public success of the previous edition deriving largely from a gameplay that, albeit with some compromises and a not exactly soft learning scale, proved to be quite profound in its mechanics, the series seems ready to make an encore of this year with UFC Undisputed 3, a game with which the producer tries to expand the offer and at the same time to meet all types of players, from veterans of the genre to newbies. While starting from the salient features of the previous chapter, in fact, the title introduces several innovations such as for example the addition of a new set of simplified optional controls, the Featherweight and Bantamweight divisions and the introduction of the PRIDE Fighting Championships brand, the old federation of mixed martial arts of which Zuffa LLC, the American company that owns UFC, holds the rights. And last but not least, a roster of one hundred and fifty fighters destined to expand further with future DLCs, one of which will finally contain our Alessio Sakara, who together with his colleagues Chan-Sung, John Hathaway, Pascal Kraus and Kyle Noke will be playable starting from April by downloading the International pack for 400 Microsoft Points on Xbox Live or approximately $4.99 via PlayStation Network. Online mode and support However, let's proceed in order and let's find out which modes are present in this 2012 edition. The options available in this sense are as always varied even if they are essentially the traditional ones for the genre, so we have for example exhibitions, challenges and quick tournaments . However, there are a couple of new features, among which in our opinion the one called Ultimate Fights and the revised Career mode stand out. The first consists in playing a series of historical matches in which the ultimate goal is not only to win the match but to satisfy a series of specific objectives required by the product. The second, as the title itself suggests, allows you to impersonate any athlete chosen at will from all those available on the roster and lead him towards a bright future in the world of MMA. This mode now focuses greater attention on fights rather than on training, which are more targeted and allow you to enhance specific statistics of a wrestler by sacrificing others, and to make him learn any technique, even if everything is calibrated so as to prevent create too powerful fighters. Furthermore, the training sessions are not mandatory since the progressive deterioration of the athlete's statistics has been eliminated, which in the past edition forced the gamer to train him more or less constantly to keep him in shape. To seal a very rich package this year is the introduction of the PRIDE brand and related rules into the game, which adds variations to the classic Undisputed matches. The matches in this case take place in normal square rings not caged and with the bloodiest rules of the Japanese. These allow you to do much more harm to the opponents, since you can hit the opponents face with direct instep kicks, trample them or give them heavy blows on the knees when they have been knocked down and are dying on the ground. There you can even stun them with knees to the head. The mode in question also features the official commentators Bas Rutten and Stephen Quadros. It should be noted that the fighters of the UFC and those of PRIDE can be used in both federations. The online experience has also been renewed which is quite substantial and presents a variety of new and old game modes, with exhibitions, ranked, quick or customized matches in which you can decide for yourself the rules to be adopted for matches, a new points system and the possibility of joining some camps or creating your own. You can then save videos of your meetings and through a file service sharing share them on the web together with your own creations like new athletes or logos, etc. No holds barred Once the part relating to the modalities has been liquidated, we now have to tell about the aspect inherent to the actual playability. In this sense, attention, strategy and quick reflexes are, as always, the three keywords that profoundly regulate the challenge played. Before starting to do so, the user is asked to decide what type of commands he wants to use: in fact, compared to its predecessor, UFC Undisputed 3 offers two different types of control. The first, more simplified, was designed for newcomers to the genre, with a key scheme that facilitates some actions during fights, eliminating the complicated crescents to be performed with the analogs to make transitions during the grapple, while the second, the one called PRO, obviously requires a certain mastery and skill on the part of the gamer, given that it instead exploits the complex classic command scheme of the series. In both cases, however, the approach to the match remains similar, given that the substance does not change: in the game, as in reality, the matches always evolve in a credible way and it is not possible to win or simply try a body by pressing the buttons of the pad at random. In short, button mashing is not contemplated and indeed constitutes the best way to be defeated by opponents with a more developed AI than in the past, and not to fully enjoy this product. For beginners, we recommend taking advantage of the excellent tutorial that reveals every detail on the operation of the control commands of the athletes and on the rules of MMA. Once in the ring in Undisputed 3 we have, as always, an excellent response to the commands and the feeling that has distinguished the series for some time. Xbox 360 goals There are 1000 points available in the game through 39 objectives. Apart from a decidedly difficult couple, most of them can be obtained without excessive worries by progressing in the various modes or creating exclusive content with the appropriate editors, as well as playing online matches. All real Although everything has remained as before for the control scheme, with punches and kicks positioned on the front buttons and the parries and the various modifiers on the back ones, plus the analog sticks used to determine the weight of the blows, the direction or the moves and holds on the ground, thanks to the additions in terms of new feints and counterattacks and to the finishing work carried out by the developers, it is clear that everything that happens during the match now takes place in the ring in a very fluid and immediate way. In addition to what has just been described, we also have a completely renewed management of body collisions and blows that takes more account of the weight classes of each athlete, so that they have different reaction times depending on the size and parts of the body that strike, where the wounds are derived from the precise point of impact on the joints. There are some side effects, but in general the new physics engine has brought undeniable benefits to the level of simulation of the encounters. It's not for nothing that this year it can happen to end a match early due to too much damage caused to an opponent or suffered, or to ~easily~ knock someone out with a well-aimed knee. The contacts between the fighters are therefore even more convincing than in the past and once they engage, the resolution of the clash becomes quite complex. Here emerge the innovations introduced for the clinch which now provide a greater range of options. If in the 2011 edition of UFC Undisputed the only way to free oneself was in fact linked to transitions and one was consequently subject to counters, now it is possible to try to get out of a clinch even by hitting the opponent in order to make him lose his grip. or by moving in such a way as to unbalance him or even by closing the space for him to prevent him from launching stronger blows than necessary to then take advantage of the right moment and reverse the situation. Submissions When you are hit hard, perhaps by a flurry of direct punches, as tradition has it for the series, the screen becomes almost circumscribed by a strange blur effect designed to underline the hardness of the blow received and the momentary state of stun of those who suffered it. In these situations, the athlete who is the victim of all this risks ending up at the mercy of the opponent. Well, contrary to what happened in the past, now the loser has more alternatives available to try to recover in time before ending up under the enemy's clutches. He can thus try to dodge the blows of the latter or attempt a parry, which fails pera which is in danger of collapsing definitively. Speaking of ~blocks~, fans of this sport will certainly be pleased to know that quick shots have been improved and made effective even in the defensive phase: through them you can deflect the opponent's blows or block his attacks by anticipating him with a quick counterattack. By performing one of these two moves the athlete can eliminate the stun faster or slower depending on which of the two tactics he has adopted. Once knocked down you can make or suffer a submission, one of the key elements for this kind of sport which in this edition has undergone a significant general overhaul: made more manageable to carry out thanks also to an upgrade of the animations, they are regulated as always from the state of health and from the personal statistics of each athlete, and performed through a special octagonal-shaped indicator. But compared to the past they require better timing since now the opponent can try to defend himself against this too, preventing the submission in order to avoid it altogether or at least to get a better position when he ends up on the mat. However, when a wrestler initiates a move to imprison an opponent with his limbs, an octagon is displayed in the center of the screen. Within the lines that make up its two-dimensional geometric structure appear two colored stripes and two dots, one red and one blue, which correspond to the two athletes. Each of them will therefore try to maneuver his colored area with the one attempting submission trying to cover that of the defender, who in turn will instead try to escape avoiding being reached: if the attacker succeeds in his aim, he immobilizes some the whole opponent either causes him considerable damage, if vice versa the defender has the upper hand, he frees himself or in any case manages to loosen his grip. As the seconds pass, the on-screen indicator will decrease in size until it disappears completely and thus signal the end of the phase. The feeling that derives from what has just been described is that in this edition the skill of the gamer affects more the success or otherwise than what happens in these situations. To what has been described up to now is added a clear graphic improvement, with the aforementioned animations that in some cases have even been redone from scratch and therefore made even more credible, and a truly maniacal attention to detail for the graphics in general, from the wrestlers entering the arena to the post match stages. The athletes are reproduced in an optimal way, with details such as the expressions of the faces that change, the sweat dripping on their bodies or the splashes of blood to embellish everything. If then we also add a simply atmospheric sound sector, with spectacular effects that even include the match comments of team members at ringside (when they are heard amidst the din of the audience) and the enthusiastic comments of commentators Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg for the UFC and the aforementioned Bas Rutten and Stephen Quadros for PRIDE, the picture is complete.", "date": "2012-02-17", "grade": "9.0"}
