Available for download at a cost of 1200 Microsoft Points, this new racing game strongly winks at successful productions such as Twisted Metal, Destruction Derby and Micromachines, let's find out together if what is proposed by the developers of Slick Entertainment really has the ability to entertain so much as much as the titles that inspire it. Victories and destruction Scrap Metal is a car racing title with an isometric view whose key point, however, is not only to always arrive at the head of the different competitions but above all is to destroy the opponents, thanks to the particular gadgets mounted on the vehicles. Flamethrowers, machine guns, grenade launchers are just some of the weapons available to the different vehicles. You start playing by piloting a beetle equipped with a machine gun but subsequently you can unlock up to 20 new cars, essentially once the opposing cars are destroyed during the races they become part of our garage. Once these new vehicles have been taken from the junkyard, they can be repaired and placed in one of the four boxes available in our garage. Too bad that seats are limited to four since the number of cars is particularly numerous and each car, be it a buggy or a racing vehicle, has its particular merits and weapons. All vehicles are modifiable not only in appearance, through a fairly limited editor which provides for the application of different colors or accessories on the bodywork, but also in their qualities: speed, grip, armor, firepower and nitro. After successfully passing the various challenges, you get points to spend on these upgrades. Xbox 360 goals Scrap Metal allows you to earn 200 points divided into 12 different achievements, most of which can be obtained by defeating the bosses at the end of the level. To complete the work it is necessary to win online and get all the gold medals in the single player campaign. Gameplay for everyone From the point of view of the actual gameplay, the challenges are the masters, in fact it is a question of competing on the track against the opponents, not only by competing normally in the 8 circuits available (the variety of tracks is excellent!) and aiming for the first position, but even in decidedly particular competitions. There is the challenge of who destroys the most vehicles, who stays on the track for the longest time and each lap leads to the elimination of who is last, the challenges against the bosses, actually a bit frustrating given the too high difficulty, the races in which you have to escape from pursuers or in which to escort other vehicles. As you can see there is a lot of irons in the fire and if it weren't for an excessive lightness of the vehicles, which fly from one side of the track to the other in the event of a collision, and for a control system that is at times too sensitive, we would be in the presence of one of the reference titles of the genre. The game allows you to set up the driving system in two distinct ways, a more simplified one that allows you to control the vehicle in acceleration with the left analog stick, and a more complete one that more closely resembles recent arcade racing games with all the buttons in place Right. The first solution may be more suitable for avoiding falling victim to anxiety attacks, due to less than perfect collisions with the elements of the circuit and sudden changes of direction due not only to the tracks but also to the isometric view. From a technical point of view we are in the presence of a good job done by the graphics, the cars are very different from each other and characterized in detail as well as all 8 circuits. We have not witnessed any failure of the game engine which travels constantly without uncertainties even in the most intricate situations. Scrap Metal not only offers multiplayer locally but also up to 4 players via Xbox Live, above all the mode we preferred is the one called King of the Hill which allows you to earn points by arriving in the first positions of the race (destructions allowed of course! ).", "date": "2010-03-24", "grade": "7.5"}
