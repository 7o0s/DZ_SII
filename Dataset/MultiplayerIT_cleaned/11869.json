{"name": "Table Tennis - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/table-tennis-recensione.html", "text": "When the name of Rockstar Games is mentioned, three things usually come to mind: Grand Theft Auto, the troubles of Manhunt and the now well-worn concept of violence in video games. It is therefore strange, if not ironic, to find yourself reviewing Rockstar's first game for the Nintendo Wii, a game that does not exploit car thefts, college kisses or iron poles, but simply a game of Table Tennis or put it in a better known way: a game of Ping Pong. Brilliant Rockstar intuition that has thrown itself headlong into the world of Wii Sports and the like? Not at all, the game recently released on store shelves is nothing more than the Wii transposition of one of the first (and still visually more incredible) games for Xbox 360, created as if to demonstrate to the world that Rockstar is not just GTA , but is a developer capable of creating in the round. Now the softco lands in WiiLandia, the court of non-hardcore games par excellence; will his Table Tennis be able to pass this set unscathed? Wii-mote in hand, let's get started... Geek or sniper? The first -very important- thing that must be said about the Wii version of Table Tennis is that the hopes relating to the days of the announcement of the game were half satisfied: the dreams of those who expected a Table Tennis with 'children' controls of that Wii Sport (which is still today the greatest star of Nintendo's home console) crashes on the wall in the first moments of the game, in which it becomes evident how much the game uses a mapping for the controls that is completely similar to that already seen on 360 , with the obvious plus of using the wiimote to direct your shots. Why then half satisfied? The game offers different ways to control your character, modes with high-sounding names such as 'standard', 'geek' and 'sniper'; the use of the standard controls implies the sole use of the wii-mote to respond to the opponent's blows, moving him in the six different possible directions (long strokes to the left, right and centre, short strokes to the right, left and centre) and helping the d-pad to give the cutting effects to the ball (on 360, the triggers were used). The 'geek' controls exploit not only the remote control, but also the nunchuk with which the stick moves the character and with the back triggers the shots are activated at maximum concentration. The latest - and probably more simplistic - control system always involves the use of the wiimote/nunchuk pair, with the trigger of the latter dedicated to placing the ball, and the remote control downgraded to a normal shot indicator, i.e. used with any motion just to signal your player to hit the ball. No movements therefore to execute cut balls, strong or weak shots: in each of the three control systems provided by the game, all these behaviors related to one's shots are managed directly by the player through another type of physical movement (much more classic), by pressing the buttons found on wiimotes and nunchuks. There is... there is... there is... it is missing! This Wii version of Table Tennis can boast of having practically everything that characterized the 360 version: same characters, same stadiums, same elements to unlock and same tournaments. The 'practically' that precedes the previous sentence, however, weighs like a boulder on the final evaluation of the game since Rockstar, due to obvious shortcomings of Nintendo itself, has found itself cutting one of the pillars of Table tennis: the online mode. Nintendo's online infrastructures have not yet been completed, and so Table tennis becomes - like many others - a living room game, to be played with friends and relatives, without the possibility of challenging fearsome Chinese players or American kids who train for various hours every day. Hand in hand with the 'disappearance' of the online mode, the graphic downgrade operated by Rockstar is unfortunately evident to meet the potential of the Wii, in an attempt not to lose even a point in game fluency. At the time of its release, a further strong point of the sister version had been the incredible graphic sector, capable of surprising with well-kept characters, photorealistic faces, shirts that followed the movements of the characters and filled with sweat as the challenge; all of this is missing on the Wii, or rather it is as if it were artificially deteriorated: the settings are visually less extensive, the characters less detailed, almost as if the game action were recorded by a less performing camera. The audio elements and sound effects are unaffected by switching between consoles, and - as in every other Rockstar game - they manage to paint perfectly what they arethe atmosphere of the game. Those who expect to find a worthy successor to Wii Tennis in Table Tennis may be partially disappointed. Is the Table Tennis glass half full or half empty? It depends on many factors. Having already played the title on 360 makes this transposition for Wii unfortunately very avoidable, both for the evident graphical downgrade and for the loss of the online mode (definitely one of the trump cards at the time of its release in 2006). Those who expect to find a worthy successor to Wii Tennis in Table Tennis may be partially disappointed: although the controls are intuitive and quick to assimilate, Rockstar's Ping Pong fails to perfectly emulate the collection of pick-up & play elements which still make Wii Sport a cornerstone of many living rooms around the world. The undeniable fact remains that Table Tennis is a deeper game, much less casual and which undoubtedly represents the best transposition of ping pong ever created. Whether or not that's enough for you, you decide... Comment Porting. This word alone is enough to encompass many of the aspects represented by this Table Tennis for Wii. The control system has been adapted for the use of the Wii-mote, but still represents a hybrid (functional but not very daring) between traditional pad controls and Wii Sport. With few game modes at its expense and the cut of the online mode, Table Tennis remains the aggressive price, immediacy and many hours of fun, undoubtedly representing an excellent choice for those who have the deep desire to play a game of ping -pong on the Nintendo console. Pros Good conversion of the 360 version Control system that is well suited to the Wii-mote Definitely fun in multiplayer Cons Could have done something more for player control Noticeable graphical downgrade compared to the 360 version In single player, it becomes monotonous in the long run and boring Nothing online", "date": "2007-11-02", "grade": null}
