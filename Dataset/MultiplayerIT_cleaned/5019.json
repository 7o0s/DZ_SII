The promoter of this extraordinary rise is a man, El Sueo, ~the boss of bosses~: fanatic to the point of considering himself a saint, absolutely ruthless and charismatic, he surrounded himself with men and women capable of holding together a criminal structure of enormous, which presides over and controls every village and every city in the country. But someone has to stop him, and to succeed where the rebel troops can't, the Ghosts arrive: a unit made up of only four men, real fast and lethal ghosts, who represent the best that the American army can express. Sent on the spot following the discovery of the corpse of Ricardo Sandoval, a DEA agent who was operating undercover, the group immediately implements Operation Kingslayer: a series of missions aimed at destabilizing Santa Blanca, identifying its leaders and eliminating one to one, until you get to El Sueo. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands welcomes us like this, with an all in all traditional plot, which can however count on the undoubted atmosphere created by the voice of Luca Ward, which gives character and depth to the main nemesis, in many ways close to the Kingpin of the television series ~ Dare devil~. A historic collaboration, the one between the Roman actor and Ubisoft, which is renewed by rekindling a topical issue, if it is true that on the one hand there are those who choose not to invest in Italian dubbing for their top titles, despite of their own history, and who instead, like the French house, do not give up this aspect of production. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands marks a great debut for the series in the open world genre Santa Blanca, pray for us For its debut in the open world, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon focuses on the largest map ever for a Ubisoft game, created through painstaking documentation of Bolivian geography and an in many ways accurate reproduction of the country, divided into twenty-one regions controlled by as many officers . During the campaign we will be free to move and explore the scenario, as well as try our hand at the missions we want, aware however of an increasing degree of difficulty that is there to suggest a certain type of path. However great the freedom of action that is provided to us in the game, in fact, we will necessarily have to defeat all the mini-bosses that revolve around the four commanders of the Santa Blanca in order to be able to identify their position on the map, and only once the twenty-five officers we will be able to face El Sueo. This translates into a particularly rich structure, made up of a hundred main missions and a very large number of secondary missions, which must be completed both to acquire further information on the cartel and to unlock extra skills and support from rebel troops. But what really matters is the nature of the missions, which in most cases revolve around the attack of an enemy garrison, but also and above all the variety of approaches and settings that the game can offer: we can get behind the wheel of any car , motorcycle, van, truck, helicopter or plane that we will find within range, using the GPS to mark the destinations (although the track on the mini map is not always very visible and creates some headaches: we hope it will be made more readable with the next updates) or, better, breaking through the fields where possible in order to save a lot of road. The distances, as it is easy to imagine, are in fact quite large and it takes a lot of time to cover them (fortunately you can resort to rapid movements towards the already discovered bases), with flying vehicles which from this point of view do not facilitate that much things, proving to be inexplicably slow and therefore having the only concrete advantage of providing a straight trajectory, as the crow flies, towards the goal. All this to say that in the (short) time given to us by the publisher for the review, we achieved 33% completion of the game, completing thirty-five main missions and about twenty secondary missions, as well as trying our hand for a few hours with cooperative online multiplayer. We are therefore talking about a product that requires a hundred hours to be gutted, the evaluation of which will be readjusted in the event that, in the next few days, critical issues or merits such as to justify a correction should emerge. Forms operands We thought that the confirmation of the third person view and the open world setting could distort the deeply tactical and reasoned experience of the original 2001 Ghost Recon, but it didn't happen: the many innovations introduced in the gameplay by the developers have left intact the planning and strategy that have characterized the franchise since its inception, enriching the system with further, varied elements. Here too there is a great distance between the dynamics of the single player and those of cooperative multiplayer, the latter inevitably more complex and difficult, even just to frame, but we'll get there shortly. After determining the appearance of our character using a simple editor, we will meet CIA agent Karen Bowman, who will provide us with radio support and coordinate our operations. The sequences that see her involved act as the narrative glue of the campaign, which however, as mentioned, does not shine from this point of view; also on the technical front, given that we would have definitely preferred four well-characterized and defined characters for the Ghost team instead of modifiable models (only initially, watch out) but without thickness, also made poorly even when the standard graphics engine changes its parameters for the cutscenes , as per Ubisoft tradition, pumping effects and detail in order to present more beautiful and convincing faces and bodies: in the case of Wildlands, a poorly done job. Starting from one of the already unlocked bases, we will have to get behind the wheel of a vehicle and move towards the yellow markers on the map, Intel missions in which we must collect documents or hack computers to obtain information on the local Santa Clara officer and bring up the main quests that concern him. In the vast majority of cases it is a question of sneaking inside an enemy garrison, choosing whether to do it silently or with guns drawn, but in all cases taking care of the tactical phase through the use of the telescope and the drone. The latter, duly enhanced, simplifies things to the point of substantially influencing the gameplay, effectively taking away the bulk of responsibility and deposing to our infallible teammates, controlled by artificial intelligence, the silent elimination of the guards through the ~synchronized shot~, an ability that needs about twenty seconds to recharge but which allows you to mark up to three targets and order their simultaneous killing, while we maybe stand behind a bush, three hundred meters away, at sip coffee. The mechanics that characterize drone reconnaissance, enemy reporting and their ~automatic~ elimination are well implemented and fun, the problem is that the more complex things get, the more they end up replacing the first-person action; also because our colleagues are apparently able to frame the targets even where they are in impossible positions, for example behind a hill, and the only moment in which they have difficulty is when the guard on duty enters a building. This is certainly an excessive simplification, and perhaps making this aspect more realistic would have helped the challenge in general, however it also happened in the original Ghost Recon to entrust one's companions with the task of carrying out certain eliminations: the strategic element has always been in the DNA of the franchise even if, as mentioned, here it appears a bit too marked. When the enemy gets pissed In short, the ~synchronized shot~ plays a leading role in the gameplay of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, solving many situations but not all. In fact, when managing group eliminations, care must be taken to hit isolated enemies, otherwise their companions will realize they are under attack and will activate a series of more or less insidious countermeasures depending on the difficulty of the mission: the recall of support troops from the outside, the turning on of acoustic alarms (which, however, we can preventively destroy with a silenced shot) and even of anti-aircraft in the case of an approach from above. Drug traffickers weren't enough, in the game we will also have to deal with the Unidad, armored and well-armed Bolivian soldiers who intervene where there is heavy unrest, but are mostly made up of agents on El Sueo's payroll. Fighting the militia inevitably leads to unpleasant situations, raising the traditional level of attention towards us and determining the rapid appearance of tanks and helicopters that attack us from above. Life energy management passes for a few whiletendencies that make us and our comrades more resistant to bullets, but in principle the system adopted is of the ~rechargeable~ type, that is, it is enough to take cover for a few seconds to recover the energy that has been stolen from us. Where you fail to do so and end up on the ground, the other Ghosts will come to our aid in a shrewd way, eliminating any nearby opponents before reviving us, without therefore showing the side to artificial intelligence criticalities in which a companion does not realize account for the presence of hostile units and you all end up on the ground in sequence. However, the resuscitation is limited to once per session: if they shoot us down again, it will be game over and we will have to start the mission over. If the intelligence of our team members appears convincing, even infallible when it comes to sniping, with a few blunders in which a character gets stuck somewhere and is left behind (only to find him automatically at the next stop), it is not can obviously say the same of the enemies, whose ability adapts to a fairly forgiving stealth context. When we end up in a full-blown clash, we must appreciate the fact that the opponents try to surround us, which happens above all during the missions in which we activate a particular switch and we have to resist a real siege of hostile forces for a few minutes. In stalking, however, their behavior is quite predictable: they hesitate for a long time under cover, but they don't move or charge headlong as happens in other titles. This approach is particularly disappointing during the bosses, which in the end are not bosses: the commanders have the same characteristics as the standard soldiers and can be easily eliminated, even using the ~synchronized shot~, therefore the only factor that differentiates that type of situation from the other fights is perhaps the need to carry out a daring chase or to enter a basement in search of the hidden officer. Free and happy The inevitable degree of repetitiveness of the missions, which as mentioned consist in the majority of cases in the attack of enemy positions, the inconsistent narrative sector and the general lack of personality of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands fortunately do not go to undermine what are the aspects of greater impact of the Ubisoft title, the first of which of course is the great freedom that the experience grants. As a good open world, the game allows you to appropriate any vehicle to reach your goals or simply to explore the immense scenario, which with its eleven different ecosystems guarantees a certain variety on a visual level, beyond the differences between the regions determined by the presence of more or less hostile bases and a higher degree of difficulty. Thus we pass from dirt and muddy roads, which also thanks to the support of HDR and its ability to brighten the colors in daytime situations bring to mind some stages of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, to the asphalt of urban areas under the rain, from the night flight aboard a helicopter over boundless forests to the unbridled motocross through fields and steppes, from the exploration of snowy wastelands aboard a pickup truck to sailing on the coast, finally passing through the climbing of steep mountains in which the various vehicles reveal that they are affected by the Skyrim horse syndrome, managing to lead us to the top even with scary, almost vertical slopes. Expedients and simplifications to which one turns a blind eye, as introduced to avoid the frustration of situations in which the inaccessibility of an inaccessible area could have forced us to make long detours. The handling seemed very similar to that of Watch Dogs 2, so don't expect great consistency and a realistic rendering of the weights, but an arcade approach necessarily, devoted to accessibility and fun. The multiplayer component As mentioned above, the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands experience changes drastically whether you play it solo or in online co-op, but even the latter mode is subject to substantial changes if you resort to normal matchmaking or play together with a group of friends. In the multiplayer the simplification of some tactical mechanisms is lacking, therefore the missions are fundamentally more complex, especially the advanced ones, and it is necessary to act in the first person rather than delegating the dirty work to companions who are no longer infallible and indeed often prove to be less attentive and less friendly than artificial intelligence.
