{"name": "Guild Wars: Eye of The North - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guild-wars-eye-of-the-north-recensione.html", "text": "Traveling to the frozen regions Once the game has started, unlike the other episodes, it will not be necessary to create a new character to access the campaign. Provided that you have a level 20 protagonist, you will have to go to the capital of your region (Kamadan for example in the case of Nighfall) and be assigned a mission that will ask you to interrupt your chores to go to the Lion's Arch and then to the Asura Portal to provide assistance to the dwarves. Once there it will be necessary to escape from the terrible Destroyers to reach the Boreal Station and the Eye of the North where you will begin to receive the classic missions related to the plot and the secondary ones, useful for accumulating fame and wealth. The plot, as always exciting and well told thanks to the videos made with the same graphic system of the game, unfolds through the frozen regions of Cimefredde. As usual, the developers have spared no effort in terms of the number of quests and after a few hours of play, you will find yourself with a long list of missions that will allow you to get in touch with two new races (Asura and Norn), 10 new heroes, 150 skills to discover, 40 sets of armor and 18 dungeons made up of several levels. There are no new professions to add to the 10 already existing, which is only partially justifiable by the fact that it is an expansion, even if some new class inspired by Nordic mythology would certainly not have disfigured. Gameplay and multiplayer The game structure in Eye of the North does not differ much from the three basic episodes, but even if more than half of the missions require you to defeat a particular enemy or collect specific objects, the variety of situations is still excellent. In some it will be necessary to escort particular characters, in others to duel alone against a single enemy, or to flee as quickly as possible from entire legions of opponents. It should also be highlighted that to access some advanced missions, it will be essential to increase the character's notoriety towards the Norn, defeating particular enemies during the quests. The many dungeons available, in addition to hosting the most powerful enemies, also have traps, hidden shortcuts and puzzles to solve, elements that require you to carefully plan the moves to be made in order to avoid finding yourself dead or overwhelmed by enemies. As for the creatures to face, about a dozen new opponents have been introduced, while others are ~Christmas~ versions of monsters already faced in the other three campaigns. The artificial intelligence of these has been significantly increased, given that wizards and other physically weak units (but capable of doing a lot of harm if well defended), will almost always be safe, forcing the player never to launch headlong, but to choose well on which opponent to concentrate the attack. Even the PvP challenges have not undergone any changes of note, but the new skills introduced in this expansion certainly allow you to test new builds (groups of skills to be inserted in the 8 available slots and which cannot be modified during battles and missions) and consequently innovative tactics. PvP is in fact the soul of Guild Wars and a few fights are enough to understand that nothing can be left to improvisation and that it is necessary to find the right harmony with one's companions, perhaps reaching the point of entering the world rankings and being able to participate at the world championship. Audio and graphics never disappoint Graphically, Eye of the North offers the same game engine already seen in the previous episodes and despite having two years on its shoulders, it still proves to be valid and spectacular, running at maximum detail on the test configuration and guaranteeing excellent performance even on recently updated PCs . In addition to well-modeled characters, we have well-characterized scenarios and panoramas, capable of being admired for a few seconds before launching into a new quest. Animations and light effects are extremely well done and capable of giving authentic fireworks displays during the battles. The background music and the voiceovers (in Italian as well as the rest of the game) are also of good quality, even if the choice of some leaves a little dumbfounded, as in the case of the Asuras, whose voices it would be legitimate to find in characters such as humans, rather than one-metre-tall, very peculiar-looking creatures. Comment Eye of the North is an excellent expansion for Guild Wars and although it does not distort the structure already seen in the three basic episodes, it guarantees fans many hours of adventures and missionsi in the frozen lands of the new campaign. It was reasonable to expect some more news such as new classes, even if it should still be remembered that this is an expansion. Technically we are still on good levels, thanks to a fully optimized graphics system and a top-level audio sector. In short, while waiting for Guild Wars 2, fans will do well not to miss this valid expansion, capable of constituting a valid challenge and an appetizer of what will be the next highly anticipated episode. Pros Good graphics and sound Beautiful atmosphere Very long-lived Cons No new classes Sometimes too difficult System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium III 1 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 64 MB Ram or Radeon 8500 Disk Space: 4 GB Guild Wars Prophecies / Factions / Nightfall Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce 5700 or Radeon 9600 with 128 MB memory Guild Wars Prophecies / Factions / Nightfall Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Card Video: Geforce 7300 with 256MB of memory Guild Wars, the NCsoft online role-playing game developed by ArenaNet, since the first Prophecies episode released two years ago, has been able to conquer an important slice of players over time. The reasons are to be found in the possibility of being able to immediately launch into the exceptional Player vs Player without having to accumulate experience to get to the 20th level (thanks to characters created specifically for this mode) and in a structure of missions that rarely takes hours to complete a single quest. The quests are also all instanced, in such a way that each player has his own copy of the mission's theater dungeon and does not receive interference from other adventurers, who can still be invited to participate. In short, immediacy at the base of everything, to which is added a splendidly optimized technical sector, capable of giving beautiful scenarios to play even on PCs that are not the latest trend. In anticipation of Guild Wars 2, which will see the light in 2008, ArenaNet has created Eye of The North, the first and probably the last expansion for its online role-playing game (or MMORPG), which requires the presence of at least one of the three episodes until currently made to work, i.e. Prophecies, Factions or Nightfall. Having this expansion will also allow you to pass on heroes, pets and weapons purchased in Guild Wars 2, an element that you must absolutely take into consideration.", "date": "2007-09-10", "grade": null}
