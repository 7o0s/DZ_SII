In 2017 it was the turn of the remake of Wonder Boy III, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap, signed by DotEmu; then a sequel / reboot, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom, developed by The Game Atelier with the collaboration of the creator of the series, Ryuichi Nishizawa, who had founded the defunct Westone in the 80s. The two games have met with great success with audiences and critics, but how will it go this time that the development has been entrusted to Artdink? Ash's Adventure Originally made for the SEGA Mega Drive back in 1994 by Westone, Monster World IV remained confined to Japan for many years, before seeing some timid releases on compilations, Virtual Consoles and the like. At the time it divided fans of the series: many considered it a step back from the previous ones, being much more linear and focused on platforming and arcade action rather than RPG dynamics. In its new incarnation for current consoles, Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World has remained practically the same game, so much so that some passages have been recreated literally in 1:1 scale, as can be verified by downloading the original through the code in the remake packaging. If from this point of view, in short, one cannot help but praise the fidelity with which Artdink was inspired by the original, on the other hand one must also ask oneself to what extent it makes sense to transpose a title so integrally that, on balance, it certainly hasn't aged very well. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, the protagonist Being basically an action game from yesteryear, don't expect who knows what narrative: the protagonist, Asha, is in charge of saving four missing elemental spirits and restoring peace to the kingdom. After a rather simple tutorial stage, which nevertheless gives us a general smattering on the labyrinthine characteristics of level design, the game really begins only when Asha arrives in the city of Rapadagna, which will become a sort of hub, an obligatory stop between one stage and the other. 'other. Here Asha can interact with the inhabitants, spend the collected gold coins on weapons and accessories, as well as discover various secrets which include the keys necessary to unlock the following stages. In fact, every time you return to Rapadagna, something has changed in the city, and you have to explore it far and wide to understand what and unlock new content that is sometimes necessary for progression. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, the armory in Rapadagna castle. Once you have found the key to access the next world, you pass by the temple where the elemental portals are kept and you enter the world on duty, usually consisting of a short introductory sequence and then the actual stage. Each world represents a different element, which is why it makes sense to buy the appropriate shields in the Rapadagna shop and equip them in the simplistic menu. In fact, Asha can protect herself with her shield from enemy projectiles, but also attack with a saber in three different directions: frontally when she's on the ground, upwards and downwards during a jump. Depending on the sword equipped, it takes a different number of attacks to charge a gauge that allows you to use the Magic Shot, a more powerful than normal attack that proves useful against tougher enemies, such as end-of-stage bosses. The combat system is extremely simple, and most of the time you defeat your enemies even before they manage to land a hit. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, the volcano stage. In the final stages you have to play a little more cunning, for example by climbing over enemies that you cannot damage frontally, but in general the fights immediately appear to be the least important aspect of the gameplay, so much so that the enemies don't even reappear after being been defeated and in moments of backtracking you often end up passing through long, completely empty corridors. And there's really a lot of backtracking, mostly because it's difficult to find the right path right away, especially if you want to look for collectibles in every corner: not only the drops of life that increase Asha's hearts every 10 collections, but also the chests that contain Elixirs to restore health or the money needed to make purchases. Moreover, the latter is never enough, and players who want to buy every weapon, shield oraccessory they will have to repeat the various stages several times to accumulate the money, although it is not necessary at all: the game is completed in a few hours even without having the best possible equipment. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, one of the very first stages. Playstation 4 trophies With eight gold trophies, seven silver, five bronze and one platinum to seal the success of the company, Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World unlocks a total of 21 trophies. Most are earned by simply completing internships, while others are earned by performing particular actions. In general, they are all very easy trophies to collect. Old school mazes Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, as we have said, is a title that looks more like a Mega Man than a ~metroidvania~ like the Westone-branded predecessors. The more you progress in the adventure and the more commitment the platform phases require, between precise jumps that you have to get right on timing on self-propelled platforms, obstacles and pitfalls to dodge or horizontal scrolling sequences. There is certainly no shortage of variety, but the difficulty of these passages is usually quite high, if not exactly unbalanced, so much so that the choice to change the saving system initially seemed more than appropriate: we no longer need to talk to the old men located in around the stages, but just access the appropriate screen at any time and select one of the twelve slots available. It is unfortunately a cumbersome operation that breaks the pace of the game, especially since there is no alternative autosave system; you must then open the main menu, access the save screen, select the slot, confirm, watch the skit and return to the game. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, one of many mini-bosses. In short, an unnecessarily articulated procedure, but which becomes almost imperative when the increasingly long and complex advanced internships are filled with puzzles and secondary steps that can waste a lot of time in the trial and error phase. The problem, however, is not so much the time lost returning to a certain point on the map, but the fact that once the enemies have disappeared, the backtracking in question can simply become boring. Asha in Monster World does not have a very brilliant level design, in this sense. Some puzzles are really ingenious, but most of the time you have to solve simple puzzles with the help of Pepelogoo, the funny little bird that accompanies us throughout most of the adventure. We can recall it and grab it by pressing the back button of the controller, and then throw it against distant collectibles to collect them or switches to crush them. In some stages, Pepelogoo becomes the key to overcoming some platform passages: above the lava geysers it becomes a platform to jump on, for example, or it can turn into a block of ice that we can use as a step. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, Pepelogoo is our adventure partner. The idea, in and of itself, isn't bad, but it hasn't been implemented to perfection. Once called, Pepelogoo takes a few moments to arrive, especially if he has moved away, and the coupling with Asha is not always very precise: this causes quite a few problems if we consider that Pepelogoo is essentially our double jump. In fact, Asha can only make a jump in mid-air while clinging to Pepelogoo, and this naturally gives a certain cumbersomeness to an action that in a platform should be simple and immediate. You get used to it, of course, but the idea you get while playing is that the opportunity for a remake could have streamlined and cleaned up a gameplay and control system that today appear crude, almost awkward. Was 2D better? Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, Pepelogoo's egg. But that the development of Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World lacked the care and love that was perceived in Wonder Boy and the Dragon's Trap or Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom is evident from the very first screens. Artdink employs a fully polygonal engine to reproduce characters and scenarios in 2D and a half, in the sense that everything is 3D but the game still follows a two-dimensional approach even when at the time the parallax was changed and now it actually moves in depth. A convenient choice, simpler than drawing sprites and high-resolution scenarios from scratch, but which opens up to a number of disadvantages. First of all, however colorful and fluid, Asha's cel-shaded world is poor in details and afflicted by a discreet aliasing which is especially noticeable in the interlude sequences, the only ones to have been programmed from scratch following a more modern direction. Practically an exercise in stylean end in itself. Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, the final boss of a stage. The other problem concerns the generic nature of the design: Westone had preferred an Arabian setting in the Arabian Nights style, with a protagonist who deliberately recalled Aladdin's Jasmine; in the various worlds, however, the game takes on a much more generic aspect that refers to the clichs of the genre between forests, pyramids, ancient castles, volcanoes and frozen palaces. Artdink did not waste himself in the transposition, and the result is that most of the scenarios offer backgrounds that are all the same, a barely discreet variety of enemies spoiled by the recycling of recolored models and zero creative flashes. Pleasant to watch, but monotonous, Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World at least pleases the ear with an absolutely pleasing rearranged soundtrack that is probably the best aspect of this remake. Ah, the digital version of the game is published on the Nintendo and Sony stores by StudioArtdink, while the retail edition - published by ININ Games - is the only one to include the original Monster World IV.", "date": "2021-05-25", "grade": "6.0"}
