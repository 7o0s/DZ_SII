{"name": "Z2: Steel Soldiers - Un sacco di metallo in guerra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/z2-steel-soldiers-un-sacco-di-metallo-in-guerra.html", "text": "ATTENTION!! From the first games to Z we realize one thing: 3D reigns supreme. Zoom here and zoom there we realize that we can observe our ~soldiers of steel~ from all possible angles. But it's not just a technical twist, i.e. the presence of technology called True Line of Sight, ergo real field of vision is a fundamental factor to be right of the opponent. Otherwise nisba. We are at war here. But let's not take ourselves too seriously! The message is substantial ... this is a video game and the tension of the battle is often tempered with humor, generating a pleasant mixture. You will soon learn to take a liking to your units, who will respond to you promptly and with the right tone, and above all you will keep them in mind. Yes, because here we don't have repeat-baked units like in the RTS tradition, but we do have a lot of tactics. It is very useful to form teams to send into battle and organize them well. An infantry front must be supported by heavy tanks to get the better of the adversary. Thus flying units such as helicopters will become very dangerous by reaping victims from above, etc etc. ATTENTION!! The primary purpose is generally to destroy the enemy, but the distinctive feature of ZSS is the fact that maintaining and advancing towards the opponent means conquering territories, or rather portions of them, trying first of all to grab the flag of the opponent's colour, effectively making the whole area under the influence of the aforementioned flag is our possession. A logic of fighting for victory handkerchief after handkerchief. In fact, a map that has bumps, rivers, broken bridges separated into many blocks ... it is as if it were itself a virtual container of mini-maps. Now I have 5 map blocks of my color and you have 3? Well, I earn more means of livelihood than you, at the same time I have to defend my possessions on more fronts than you. Conquer all my blocks and you'll basically defeat me and vice versa. (Herzog Zwei was a great teacher in this sense). In fact, don't think that the usual mass-massacre strategic combo works, here things change very quickly and each of the warring factions really has the same chance of emerging and winning or sinking and losing. You have to explore or you become poor. Almost an attack to defend oneself. The AI routines, the real pride of the B.B.s, prove their worth here. The enemy gives you a hard time, but doesn't even exasperate you... and the difficulty level is balanced according to the progress of the game. It doesn't exist that you poor people have set foot on the map for 2 minutes, and the mortar tanks are already arriving and pulling your base down, but I repeat ... do not sit and admire the landscape or they will kill you. The scenarios vary according to the locations .. they range from the desert to the arctic ... finding ourselves each time with a different aspect and behavioral approach of the units ... good! Did I say humor? Indeed! For example, a successful coup will be underlined by a joke from your foreman, to name one... but there are many situations... and they all emerge through a plot that draws heavily on the cinematographic-comic-war tradition, with characteristic characters... one above all the legendary Zod, and whoever has seen Kubrick's masterpiece Full Metal Jacket knows what I'm talking about... War is expensive However, we are not faced with a game free from defects, which however can be overcome with a little dedication. An example of this is the inexplicable reason why if I select some units and order them to go to a point, after the classic ~yes sir~. The units are deselected, going yes to the point, but forcing me to make yet another selection to issue a new order. This becomes awkward especially if we move with caution, without necessarily clicking on a distant point, but step by step we advance cautiously. Don't worry though, the CTRL+number key combination comes to the rescue, which allows us to call up the teams on the fly when needed... there is a remedy for everything! Or almost...since we get to the hardware resources. Z-Steel Soldiers seems to me a little heavy compared to the average, even shooting with a GeForce2... a sign that in the end, to keep up with the times and enjoy a game for what it's worth (I don't mean only in terms of money, but also for the masterpiece that it is) we end users always have to lose out. Already in 800x600 at 16 BIT depth...forget the fluidity with a 500Mhz processor...upgrade upgrade..I hear these words whirling in my head ;-) Rreducing the detail things improve, but the question is always that of compromise..as in all games. Here, however, fluidity counts, to keep up with the incessant rhythms of the action-tactics of this new title. In any case, RTS maniacs be warned: tried Z-Steel soldiers, digital warfare will never be the same! With the right spirit Remember when to play even one game with our favorite video game we would have been willing to go against the wrath of our parents? And surely you also remember when completing it meant for us to have passed a fundamental chapter of our lives. Big words? I wouldn't saymore than anything else the creators of the videogames had achieved their aimto hit us to the core, to make us re-play their masterpieces over and over again. I don't remember much about the first Z, perhaps because I wasn't into the RTS genre much at the time, but I distinctly remember visiting a local video game store often and heck, there was always a guy playing Z. All the time. Months went by and he played Z... small groups of shady interlocutors stood behind him and he in response... played Z. Now do you understand what I meant? When you have your favorite video game, you are on Olympus. (At least up to a certain age, then it would be better to convince yourself to bet on other things...so they say at least ^_^') The Bitmap Brothers are back. The metal toy soldiers are back.. and they do it in grand style, trying to exhume the right spirit of the video game from our bodies tortured by the marketing blows.", "date": "2001-05-12", "grade": null}
