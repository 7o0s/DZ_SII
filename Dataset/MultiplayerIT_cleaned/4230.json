It is a survival with role-playing elements, with a very similar setting to that of the title of Klei Entertainemnt. It begins with the protagonist Sachi forced to make a great sacrifice to the Tree of the Sun: her firstborn, as has always been required of her people. If it didn't, light would literally disappear from the world. However, something does not go as it should and a few years after the event the Tree of the Sun shuts down, allowing the creatures of the night to attack. The woman, fed by a strange character whose identity will be revealed during the adventure, takes the opportunity to sneak into the temple of sacrifices and discover the secret behind the ritual, ending up thrown into a dark underground world where strange figures live masked and where the environment is extremely hostile. Where is it? Why are the two worlds connected? What is that dark fog that envelops everything endangering the survival of all forms of life? Why do sacrificed children end up underground? What is hidden behind the Tree of the Sun? These and others are the questions that will have to be answered by playing. We have deliberately not talked about some topics so as not to reveal too much about the plot (in fact we have only reported the introduction), which is much more articulated and develops throughout the adventure. Survival mechanics Survival mechanics are at the heart of Smoke and Sacrifice's gameplay. As soon as she gets underground, Sachi has to learn to fend for herself. The ways to do this are the classic ones of the genre: look for resources and projects to build the right equipment for the company. Building is really easy: you go to the recipe menu, select the one you want and, if you have all the raw materials, hold down the action button until the object is ready. Some recipes require the use of special structures to be made (for example, you need a cauldron to cook something), but the complications are all here and if you have already tried any other survival you will have no problems whatsoever. You start by making a net and a lantern, then move on to a bat and padded boots that allow you to explore the frozen areas gradually up to ultra-technological armor and sci-fi weapons, unique in allowing you to face the biggest enemies. Constructed items have their own wear rate, but can be repaired directly in the inventory. Finding resources is not complicated, especially if you follow the progression provided by the developers. At the beginning, mainly sticks, some shrubs, luminous insects and other objects that are easily found in the scenario are collected. To produce the best pieces, for example the mechanical ones, however, it will be necessary to obtain the most valuable raw materials, often linked to very strong enemies. Let's say that, in general, when you're ready to change zones, you always have enough equipment to reach the next one. After all, the system includes barriers that prevent you from advancing without having done everything you need beforehand. For example, it is not possible to reach the volcanic area without having armor that protects against heat, while other areas are impossible to explore because they are full of enemies that must simply be avoided at the beginning. The combat system of his is very simple: Sachi can attack with the weapon he is holding (if he doesn't have one he uses his fists) and can dodge the blows of the enemies by making a leap in the indicated direction. Adding to the variety of things is the enemies themselves, each of which has unique attack patterns. In truth we could summarize everything in: the bigger they are, the more they hurt. In short, don't expect anything too varied or dynamic. Things improve when holding rifles and the like, because you can face enemies with much more mobility than those you have to deal with in hand-to-hand combat, but in general the combat does its job and nothing more, resulting quite uniform from the 'beginning to the end of the adventure. Where are you going? To help Sachi in her exploration, the developers have provided her with a map and a diary, where the various missions are marked. Rather than missions, it would be fair to talk about tasks, since in most cases it is required to find ingredients or to talk to characters (who will inevitably ask us to find ingredients). Only the main quest is a little more varied and acts as a glue of the action, even if, examining it better, it is clear how it was used above all to convey the progression. It is in fact by following it that one moves from one area to another.another in search of the next goal to be achieved, be it the discovery of a person or that of a key object. Speaking of items, Sachi is equipped with a large inventory, where she stores all her belongings. Note that there is also a micro adventure component in the game, with Sachi literally having to use some objects on others, selecting them from the inventory, to move forward. These are very simple and piloted operations, which do not require the player to think (usually it is enough to read the mission log to find out exactly what needs to be done), but in a world of video games that has now automated every puzzle, they have their effect. Ups and downs As in the gameplay, even from a stylistic point of view, Smoke and Sacrifice followed the path of Don't Starve, essentially only changing the style of the design: the game world is in 3D, with the various objects rendered in 2D. The shot is fixed and shows the protagonist sideways. All two-dimensional elements are drawn and animated by hand. The animations aren't really very many, but they render quite well, especially if you like the paper puppet effect. The game world, apart from the different biomes it is made up of, looks like a huge irregular plain dotted with trees, barrels and other buildings. It doesn't have an organic design, but it works really well when it comes to gameplay (particularly the survival mechanics). Unfortunately the graphic style chosen did not allow the creation of real three-dimensional architectures and the sense of emptiness is often evident. Don't Starve from this point of view is decidedly more varied and better in its individual elements. The narrative side deserves a final note: the story told is indeed interesting, despite all its limitations, but it is also evident that whoever wrote it is not an exceptional lyricist, given that the screenplay is extremely elementary in some passages. Of course, the narrative glue makes the action more interesting and guarantees an extra motivation to continue playing, but the very fact of having chosen to tell a story should have suggested that doing so is not as easy as it seems. We didn't expect Shakespeare, but something more could be done, especially in the most dramatic and, theoretically, exciting moments.", "date": "2018-05-30", "grade": "7.0"}
