{"name": "Strana la vita", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/144238-life-is-strange-strana-la-vita.html", "text": "Max and Chloe couldn't be more different. Max is shy and introverted, she studies photography at Blackwell Academy and has just returned to her hometown of Arcadia Bay after five years spent with her parents in the metropolis Seattle. Chloe seems to have never set foot outside the beautiful bay that overlooks the beaches and the Oregon sea, she lost her father just in the days when Max, her childhood friend, was preparing to move and since then she has followed the path that every rebellious girl follows in the imagination told by American films, a conflictual relationship with her adoptive father and some problems with drugs. The expected meeting, however, will be unpredictable and much more explosive than expected, with a bullet that goes through Chloe and Max who discovers that he has the unusual power to rewind time at will. It is the beginning of Life is Strange, an episodic graphic adventure developed by DontNod, best known for Remember Me, and produced by Square Enix. We played the first episode, to be released on February 5th for 4.90 euros or 19.90 euros for the entire series, waiting to see what awaits us in the subsequent ones, which will be released one every six weeks. DontNod tries the road of graphic adventures with Life is Strange Password: indie We played Life is Strange sitting on a bed in a Stockholm hotel room, with some of the development team just a few feet away from us. They told us about the genesis of a game that they consider halfway between an independent project, developed by a medium-sized team with no creative limits, and a triple-A production, financed by a large publisher like Square Enix. But they also explained to us that the inspiration for Life is Strange, for the themes it deals with and the characters that populate Arcadia Bay, come from American indie cinema and music. Indeed, the humanity that animates the Blackwell Academy belongs to the provincial bourgeoisie and is presented with the same realism that could convince the critics of any Sundance or Tribeca Film Festival. There is the rich and spoiled girl, the bully protected by the influential family, the super introverted with suicidal tendencies and so on. But there is - or rather, there was - especially Rachel: beautiful and talented, disappeared into thin air for a few weeks when the adventure begins. Rachel will be the reason why Max and Chloe will have to join forces, iron out the differences and the different views resulting from the last five years of life to get to the bottom of a mystery that will lead them to discover that nothing in Arcadia Bay is really as it seems. Playing the first episode of Life is Strange from start to finish, an operation that takes no more than a couple of hours, we were able to grasp all the narrative ambition of DontNod, the will to tell a thriller with supernatural elements whose however, the real intention is to develop a series of somewhat stereotyped but well-written characters. At the same time it is really difficult to express a judgment because the end credits arrive just when the events seem ready to take off. We would have liked to know more, and this is certainly positive, but it is difficult to say if the expectations will be kept and if the promised evolution path will be worth six weeks of waiting each time. A bit Twin Peaks and a bit Fargo, straddling Juno and Donnie Darko, Life is Strange has overall well-written dialogues and an exceptional soundtrack, which helps to support a somewhat boring central phase of the chapter. Social reflection, the representation of everyday life is the great goal that Life is Strange puts in its sights but it is simply still too early to say if it will really succeed all the way. Nonetheless, the premises are encouraging. Not only but above all TellTale DontNod considers Life is Strange the perfect meeting point between the graphic adventures of TellTale, Heavy Rain from which fortunately it does not exchange the massive presence of quick time events and the realism of Gone Home. It's got a little bit of all these interesting points of reference: you move through the three-dimensional environments freely, despite the fact that there is absolutely no sense of exploration at all, but it also really has a lot in common with the formula made famous by The Walking Dead and then taken up several times in recent years by various protagonists involved in the development of graphic adventures. We continue from scene to scene without ever getting stuck in front of videogame obstacles, the developer is not interested in putting the player in difficulty but rather taking him by the hand through the story told. During the first episode there are about twenty choices to make, some more evident while others hidden between lines of diaseemingly innocuous logo, all summarized once this first piece of adventure is over. Each crossroads will lead to some consequences rather than others but, just like in the works signed TellTale, there is always one and only one way forward, only one ending and only one story to tell. The apparent freedom of choice isn't a problem in and of itself anyway, especially given that here there don't seem to be, at least for now, major problems in writing characters and situations so that they adapt to every possible choice. Max's power, capable of rewinding time as mentioned, is used for a series of very simple puzzles, but above all it can be used to evaluate the immediate effect of each decision and possibly change it. At first we thought it was a very nice idea, but on balance the same adventure and almost the same events are perfectly imaginable without this, in fact superfluous, ruse. Also in this case with the succession of chapters we could observe noteworthy developments for this mechanic which so far proves to be a little under exploited.", "date": "2015-01-30", "grade": "7.8"}
