The same goes, of course, for the music. We feel compelled to specify this because Tomb of the Mask instead proposes a faithful and convincing 8-bit style, starting with the sound effects and continuing with graphics that match the darkness of an endless sequence of labyrinths with the technical limitations of the hardware of the epoch, coloring all the rest with flat and simple colors: purple, blue, green, white and so on. Our goal in the game is to explore dungeons that are different from time to time, thanks to a procedural system, collecting coins and trying to avoid traps while we literally bounce from one wall to another until we reach the turn exit. As with most products of this type, the problem is that the slightest mistake will result in a merciless game over and will force us to start the progression over again... unless we want to spend some of the collected tokens to get a ~continues~. Tomb of the Mask is an immediate and tantalizing arcade game, a little dive into 8-bit memories Wall to wall To strongly characterize the Tomb of the Mask experience, in addition to the aforementioned 8-bit style technical sector, we find a gameplay with peculiar features, which effectively uses the touch screen to ask us to draw gestures that go in the four cardinal directions, making so that the protagonist of the adventure moves accordingly in the scenario. The mazes of the game, which closely resemble those of the classic Pac-Man, only with coins instead of candies, in fact boast a structure that goes hand in hand with an original movement system, in which you have to quickly navigate the spaces grazing the walls and find the right bank to be able to continue. Not an unspeakable effort, provided you have a few moments to reflect when the path becomes fraught with obstacles, traps and even hostile creatures whose touch can be fatal. Here, the problem is that in Tomb of the Mask time will be the last thing we will have available, given that a lethal wave will rise from the lower part of the screen which will force us to move quickly, in one go, taking into account the inevitable mistakes and the frustration of an approach that sometimes appears ruthless and does not even provide a ~preparation~ stage before picking up the pace. This leads to two very specific consequences: the first is the traditional ~videogame drug~ effect, whereby the games follow one another rapidly in an attempt to establish new records and unlock some useful masks to enjoy extra bonuses; the second is a substantial drop in enthusiasm after a few hours due to the inherent limitations of this type of experience. Full of atmosphere, as mentioned; certainly immediate and with some traits of originality, but at the same time ethereal and lacking depth.", "date": "2016-02-20", "grade": "7.2"}
