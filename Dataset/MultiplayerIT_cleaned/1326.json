{"name": "Ghost Recon - Jungle Storm", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-jungle-storm.html", "text": "Strategy first The team is divided into two groups, ~alpha~ and ~bravo~ (in the original for PC there were three, but you still ended up ~grouping the forces~ into two maniples), and the player chooses to take control of a single member, leaving the task of managing his direct companions to the computer but giving orders to the second team, which will eventually be called to advance stealthily or to shoot at anything that moves. Ghost Recon's artificial intelligence is very good indeed, and you have no worries about leaving the defense of positions or cover in the hands of your teammates. When you have to face a group of enemies head on, you can decide to attack them from two sides or leave the second group in a strategic position, perhaps by hitting from a distance with snipers. In some situations it is necessary to break into buildings, and even then the behavior of the companions is impeccable. The game control system has been successfully ported to the Dual Shock 2: the left analog stick moves the character in four directions, the right one directs him and controls the crosshair (of course it is possible to reverse the movement); the up and down arrow keys change the character's position (lying on the ground, crouched or standing, depending on the situation), the left and right arrow keys allow him to move slightly sideways while maintaining the viewfinder zoom; the primary backbones (L1 and R1) are used respectively to activate the map (from which it is possible to issue orders, again with the backbones, or to move the second team towards a specific point) and to open fire with the equipped weapon , the secondary ones (L2 and R2) to issue any vocal orders (when the appropriate peripheral is available) and to resort to ~fast~ orders. Finally, the Triangle key activates the night vision device (essential when you can't see a log), the Square key changes the character's weapon, the X key reloads the equipped weapon (never find yourself with a single shot in the barrel at five centimeters from an enemy!) and the Circle key is for action (open doors, take control of machine guns from emplacement, etc.). Game structure As I wrote at the beginning, Ghost Recon  Jungle Storm allows you, in the single game mode, to face two different campaigns: Island Thunder and Jungle Storm. Each of them consists of eight levels that can be tackled in sequence, each of which takes some time to complete (generally a scant hour). Well, hopefully. Often, in fact, one of the objectives to be completed is to complete the mission without casualties in the team, and to obtain it you have to face the internships in a ~reconnaissance~ way before getting serious. Since it was very fashionable on PC to resort to quick save and its relative loading every time a member of the team ended up killed or injured, on PS2 the programmers have chosen to limit these aids numerically. Great decision, in my opinion. When an agent is injured on a mission, you have to let him rest ~one turn~ on the next stage to get back on his feet. At the end of the level, then, the soldiers can be upgraded in their characteristics, by spending the points earned. Each mission involves the completion of several ~main~ objectives and usually an ~optional~ one, which can be pursued without a precise order. Successful missions will unlock new usable characters and new stages for multiplayer game modes (split screen or online). The latter are quite varied and numerous: ranging from the cooperative mission (for two players when there is split screen, for four online) to those in which you shoot against each other in different ways. Technical realization Ghost Recon has a great atmosphere, is very immersive and equally rewarding when you manage to complete a mission successfully. All this, however, is certainly not due to the quality of its graphics, which on PS2 is worse than seen on PC, with the aggravating circumstance that it is a title that is now a few years old. The poor quality of the animations of the enemies (which literally move jerkily, especially when seen from a distance), as well as of their agents, distracts attention from the general poverty of the levels: poor detail, mediocre textures, few polygons. PlayStation 2 has shown that it can do much better, but evidently squeezing Sony hardware was not part of the developers' intentions. It fits into this perspectivealso the speech on the sound, in my opinion excellent as far as the music is concerned but also without any revision: the soundtrack is the same heard on the PC at the time of the release of Ghost Recon, and the effects do their duty without sharp details. To this we must add the slowness that afflicts the uploads, not so much the main ones (the progress bar is missing, but you can turn a blind eye to it), but those that concern the rendering of the agents when forming the teams. It's absurd, you could very well have left the characters inanimate if moving them meant making the player wait even several seconds when switching from one character to another to examine their conditions and characteristics. In one case, my PS2 even froze Comment If you want special effects, lots of polygons, beautiful animations, environments full of details Ghost Recon  Jungle Storm is not for you. But if you are interested in the substance of a game and the setting of this title intrigues you, then buying the new Ubisoft product will not be a mistake at all. It is a concentration of atmosphere, tension and strategy. It is engaging, realistic and very satisfying in the intrinsic underlying simplicity of the missions it offers. Perhaps the game mechanics have a few years behind them, perhaps a different solution could have been found in some situations (the soldier who runs out of ammunition is doomed, the machine guns at the emplacement are practically useless, the missions tend to look alike), but in my opinion right now there isn't a product capable of keeping up with Ghost Recon in its particular sub-genre. Pros: Great atmosphere Two games in one Lots of game modes, even online Cons: Mediocre graphics Annoying menu loading No improvement over the original Ghost Recon - Jungle Storm is what can be defined as an ~expansion~, although this nomenclature is very far from what the console market usually offers. This means that it refers to the original Ghost Recon for all the technical characteristics, adding new missions and new possibilities to the product. Distancing itself from the PC counterpart, however, the new Ubisoft title also contains the Island Thunder expansion (which effectively doubles the numbers of this production), a rich multiplayer mode with horizontal split screen and the ability to play online. For those unfamiliar with Ghost Recon, a refresher: set in a hypothetical near future, the game features a team of experts who are entrusted with unofficial missions. These soldiers must strike and disappear, leaving no trace of their passage. The player is entrusted with a group of six elements chosen from those available, each with different characteristics and equipment: the ~riflemen~ are ideal for close-quarters battles, are generally equipped with a rifle and grenade launcher, and must act stealthily; the ~snipers~ have at their disposal a long-range rifle with a sight that allows them to hit even very distant enemies, often supplemented by a pistol with a silencer; the ~support~ agents have great firepower (machine gun) and are ideal for ~roundups~; Finally, the ~breakers~ accompany the rifle with explosive charges or rocket launchers, necessary to destroy positions or armored vehicles.", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
