{"name": "Cardpocalypse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cardpocalypse-recensione.html", "text": "If you want a game that can bring some fresh air between stale settings and stories, the Cardpocalypse review could lead you to discover a serious candidate to become your next purchase. It can be described as a narrative-driven adventure RPG, but at its core it's actually a collectible card game and that alone may seem strange. Usually the latter are simply focused on the classic action of creating a deck and colliding directly against an opponent on the table but in Cardpocalypse we witness a sort of meta-game whereby the cards are placed at the center of a larger narrative and complex, despite being absolute protagonists of the events. The story tells the adventures of Jess, a girl who has just moved to a new city who has to face the usual challenges of adaptation, starting with the fateful first day of school, which also coincides with her first contact with the card game Mega Mutant Power Pets. Jess has known the franchise up to that moment only as a television series, but she immediately finds herself entangled in the irresistible charm of the trading card game, also because in the Dudsdale school where she has just moved the Mega Mutant Power Pets cards are practically the main topic of discussion, a real fixation widespread among all the boys, so much so that they are seen as a subversive element by the principal and teachers, who end up banning them precisely because of Jess. The dialogues and exchanges with the other characters are generally based on MMPP (as it is commonly called by schoolmates), with the possibility of playing games, exchanging cards or discussing strategies, but you can also see clear adventure elements wandering around the school and cities that expand the scope of the game, starting real quests to be completed and thus building a diversified superstructure above the central core of the gameplay which is obviously represented by the clash between decks of cards. Gameplay: War of Decks The construction of the deck of cards and its use in the game clearly represent the central elements of the whole game structure, but everything else is much more than a mere outline and contributes to building a solid identity for Cardpocalypse. This is an important element for the characterization and quality of the entire game, also because to tell the truth, the basic mechanics of MMPP are not that original or exciting. In fact, it is a rather standard card game even if its humorous tone makes it particularly enjoyable: as per tradition, the effort is divided between the creation of a deck that is as powerful and balanced as possible and the actual battle , which can be started against various characters scattered throughout the settings. At the base of everything is the choice of a champion, or rather a basic card that influences the abilities of the whole deck being the direct emanation of the player. The champions belong to one of four factions present in the world of MMPP: Woofians, Meowtants, Sinissers, Pipsqueaks, which are reflected in the appearance of the characters (they are all mutant animals but belonging to different species, therefore dogs, cats, snakes and rodents) and above all in the usable skills, or in the type of cards that can be inserted into the deck. Some of these are universal and fit into any type of deck, but in most cases the cards are all divided into factions, which determines different possibilities for general approaches to deck creation and combat. The decks are made up of 20 cards, generally divided into defense, aggression and mutations, capable of influencing the attack priority (defense cards must be attacked first), causing damage and lastly modifying the champion's stats and individual various types. The mechanism of the card game is a bit long to explain but it closely resembles that of Hearthstone but resulting particularly simplified, with the need to manage energy, the level of which influences the amount of cards that can be extracted turn by turn and their power and zero hit points of the opposing champion. Apart from the humorous style, there are no particularly original or memorable elements in the card game itself and this is perhaps the weakest element of Cardpocalypse, although there are still some particular ideas. A very interesting element is given by the possibility of effectively modifying the functioning of the card game: continuing the adventure we find ourselves able to enhance the cards by applying stickers, writings or drawings on them that alter the statistics, as well as being able toAdd or change some of the rules of the clashes by adding a strong element of customization to the entire experience. An adventure with a game inside We started by talking in detail about the card game because this is clearly the main core of the gameplay, but in truth it is immersed in a real adventure with RPG elements. The construction of the deck and the progression between one fight and another develops along a sort of narrative adventure in which we follow Jess's deeds from the first traumatic day in the new Dudsdale school to a crescendo of increasingly absurd events that lead the boys to have to deal with otherworldly threats and the need to save the world. The normal difficulties of a little girl on her first day in a new school in fact immediately undergo a considerable escalation: a direct confrontation with the group of bullies in the neighborhood quickly leads to the confiscation of the cards and the absolute prohibition of playing Mega Mutant Power Pets in the school territory, forcing the boys to go underground to rebuild the gaming community, but worse problems soon arise, because creatures, threats and card game situations begin to invade reality with devastating consequences. Everything is represented in a rather facetious way but there is undoubtedly some epic in the story of Cardpocalypse which makes it fully part of the RPG. This and its quest structure, of course: the cards are acquired not only by winning fights but also by completing various tasks and missions, which include dialogues, solving simple puzzles or card battles with other characters throughout the game. school week that is staged in the story. Question of charisma Despite being constantly at the center of the actions and thoughts of the characters in the story, MMPP is in effect a game within a game. What keeps the Cardpocalypse experience standing is in fact Jess's adventure, a real connective tissue that gives a context to a card game that, perhaps, would struggle to find its own consistency if proposed alone. Inserted instead in a story of boys who are crazy about the cards in question, everything takes on a more defined meaning and a truly remarkable character: from the opening song to the bizarre supernatural intrusions that emerge already in the first minutes of the game, Cardpocalypse seems a sort of parody of the 80s-90s cartoons of ~Saturday morning~, but behind it there is also a remarkable maturity in the narration and in the choice of themes. In the story of Jess and his ~strange~ friends we find the daily war with conformity and the status quo: the desire to escape from reality and subvert clichs with the power of the imagination, also conveyed by the mutant animals reproduced on the cards. It is rebellion and pure teen spirit, but also a sense of brotherhood and friendship between boys grappling with the thousand difficulties posed by school and social life, as emerges from the dialogues and the various quests to be completed. Note, however, how Jess moves in a wheelchair but this is never highlighted in a decisive way, it is simply a characteristic of his person that is given a marginal weight in the story but really represents an excellent example of inclusive representation in video games, which is actually badly needed. The childish sketchbook-style graphic style is pleasant and allows you to stage the most bizarre things without particular expenditure of technology, but what matters is the coherence that distinguishes everything between menus, in-game graphics and drawings on the cards, building a 'very unique atmosphere and a solid characterization. Some technical uncertainty is detected in the interface, with some blocks that emerge sporadically and sometimes force you to wait a few seconds before being able to continue, while the translation into Italian is quite negative, containing so many errors and assorted inaccuracies as to force you to use the English to be able to better enjoy the dialogues of the game.", "date": "2019-12-12", "grade": "7.8"}
