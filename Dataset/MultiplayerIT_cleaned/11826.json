{"name": "Rayman: Raving Rabbids 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids-2-recensione.html", "text": "Buahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh The first trailers saw the rabbits running around a miniature world to the tune of the song ~Around the World~, and the final game is in fact structured in travel. Each tour contains nine different tests, even if playing a normal game you will only face six, of which the last is always the musical challenge where by shaking the controllers in time you will have to follow the rhythm of the music. You can choose to go to Europe, the USA, South America, Asia, and finally you can also unlock a trip to the tropics. Each trip offers different games. Before each game you can choose whether to participate alone or in company, even if much of the meaning is lost in the first option. Playing in multiplayer, competitors will be able to compete all together, sometimes on their own, sometimes instead hindering each other, or taking turns in matches, based on the type of game. The title makes use of both the Wiimote and the Nunchuk even if not all games exploit them both. One year after the launch of the console, Ubisoft must have convinced itself that with the Wii the catchment area has really expanded, given that R:RR2 games are now even more accessible. It's really easy to figure out what to do in the mini-games, and just as easy to do it. Only in some cases did the explanation and response of the commands not seem effective. If you're going to invite some curious friends over to give Wii a try, with Rayman: Raving Rabbids 2 you'll be able to entertain them. Some games simply require you to shake the pads as fast as possible (as in the first episode), others instead will invite you to follow the movements represented on the video, still others will allow you to hold the wiimote as if it were a flute or a mobile phone. The situations encountered are quite varied but not all tests are fun in the same way. In particular there are more than a few really lackluster ones. Overall, the fun that is perceived during the game is directly proportional to the number of players and some sections that may seem a little funny in single, become so when you compete with three other humans between the laughter aroused by the expressions of the rabbits and the cursing at other players. Even the only situations described by the mini-games are enough to cheer up the spirits of the players, there are some where you will have to waste time in the office without getting caught by the boss (just like you who are reading this article now!), or where you he will have to disturb using the phone at the cinema, and not forgetting the irreverent burping contest. These are apparently the habits that an alien must learn if it wants to infiltrate humans. The technique Almost a year has passed since the launch of the Wii, the developers have been able to work more calmly this time, and exclusively on the Nintendo console. It must be said that little or nothing has changed graphically since then. The most appreciated additions are the support for 16/9 and 480p which, however, I cannot improve the video performance of a graphics engine that would not shine even on PS2. There is no doubt that better graphics would not have made the game a better product, but it is equally true that seeing Rayman: Raving Rabbids 2 in action leaves you rather disappointed. The polygons are few, and therefore the scenarios are elementary and sparse, colored by textures that do not resolve the situation. Add in a choppy frame-rate in some presentation scenes and a bit of aliasing and you get only enough results. The best work has been done on the funny movements and expressions of the rabbits and on the design elements that distinguish the saga. The Wii is not a technical monster and the style of the title certainly doesn't go well with photorealistic graphics, but asking for a little more didn't seem inappropriate to us, moreover in a rather important title for Ubisoft on the Wii console. In this respect, the only surprise was facing one of the five shooting sections for the first time, the same ones that served as bosses for the level in the first and which this time become an independent game for one or two people. The structure has remained the same, but the objects in the background are not drawn by the game engine, nor by an FMV: while we are shooting at the animated rabbits, a real video shot will scroll in the background that the developers had fun shooting on the streets of the world. In France, for example, we will start at the foot of the Eiffel tower, to reach anonymous neighborhoods for tourists. The result on a standard TV is quite pleasant and fun to watch, while in HD the low resolution of the shooting and the digitally created objects are a little more noticeable thanthey relate less to the real environment. Nothing to report in terms of sound, where the main role is played by the rabbits' noises, amid shouts, grunts, and suffocated words. The latest addition regarding the technological factor is the possibility of connecting to the internet to record the best records and climb the rankings, but only for that. Comment First of all, Rayman: Raving Rabbids 2 is a game that, like the others in the genre, should only be considered from a multiplayer perspective. In this sense, you will take home a title that will not make you want to go back to playing at any time, but which can be inserted periodically into the Wii player, thanks to the ability to involve anyone who wants to try it. The sympathy of the rabbits is now clear to everyone, and the controls are exploited in such a way as to entertain even those who have just picked up the Wiimote. We regret some mini-games of the first episode, and moreover the 45 present (of which 5 are musical ones) are not many, but summing up, the second date of the rabbits remains a party game advisable both for those looking for something to play friends, and those looking for something new to play with friends. However, for the next one, we would like more attention to be paid to the rest, so that the funny Ubisoft aliens manage to be the protagonists of a first-rate game as they deserve. Pros The rabbits!!! Fun with friends Several very successful mini-games Cons Understated technical execution Only 45 games not always fun Very weak in single player Rayman: Raving Rabbids 2 is available for Nintendo Wii Already from the first talks with Nintendo, Ubisoft had sensed that the Wii could work, even if he still lacked to understand what kind of games he should promote with the console. In fact, the software house presented itself at the launch with many titles of different genres and for different targets. Rayman: Raving Rabbids was one of the most remembered titles of that launch, and the French house immediately set to work on the sequel. The intent has remained the same, that of creating a game accessible to all and which allows up to four people to have fun together with the hilarious rabbits that have come out of the hat of Michel Ancel's team. Their sympathy is so irrepressible that it has overshadowed the popularity of the main character with just one title, namely the ~aubergine~ Rayman, who this time is even out of place. If with a little courage the team had excluded him from the game and from the title, probably no one would have missed him. Think for example of the poor single player who is forced to use Rayman who imitates the behavior of rabbits with a lot of crazy scream!", "date": "2007-11-16", "grade": null}
