{"name": "MotoGP 13", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120358-motogp-13-di-nuovo-in-sella.html", "text": "After the parenthesis of Monumental Games, which dealt with MotoGP 09/10 and MotoGP 10/11 on behalf of Capcom, the official license of the MotoGP championship is back in the hands of Milestone. The Italian team has always shown great passion for the genre of driving games since its inception with Screamer (it was 1995 and such a thing was not believed possible on PC), then with the legendary Superbike and, recently, with the series WRC Rally. The Milestone boys have racing in their blood and we therefore learned with enthusiasm that they would be involved again with two wheels with MotoGP 13, which presents itself as an innovative title for the franchise and offers us the beauty of six different game modes: Race Snapshot, which allows you to play a match with default values and without waiting; ~Grand Prix~, to face a single event after having chosen a driver among the really existing ones or having created one; ~Championship~, one of the more substantial modes, which allows us to experience an entire season in MotoGP, Moto2 or Moto3; ~Career~, the heart of the experience, in which we start from the bottom to move from team to team and establish ourselves in the long term; finally ~Multiplayer~ and ~Shared screen~, to play in online multiplayer or in two in split-screen. Arms and baggage One of the elements of MotoGP 13 that immediately catches the eye is the substance, both in terms of the number of modes present and their density, in particular the two more complex ones. In the ~Career~ the Milestone developers were definitely inspired by the latest Codemasters racers, trying to provide the player with a global vision of the drivers, the relationship with the fans, with the manager and the continuous incentive to do better and better to get contracts with more competitive teams. The problem, and this too immediately catches the eye, is that the manufacturing quality of these facets has very little to do with titles such as the recent GRID 2; therefore the objective of providing an apparent variety of situations is indeed achieved, but it would have been the case to take better care of this aspect. Before taking to the track, whether it's a single Grand Prix or Career mode, we can manually adjust the bike's set-up and therefore change the tire compound, modify the stiffness of the suspension, the distribution of the brakes, the electronics and so on, with the possibility of saving the profile to be able to load it later. A ~simplified~ version of these procedures has also been included, i.e. the technical meeting with a team manager who, based on a series of pre-set phrases, can help us improve the behavior of the bike on the track and adapt it to our riding style . Here too the feeling is that something more could have been done, because the technician's advice covers a very limited number of elements, for example it's not possible to ask him to favor acceleration on tracks with many slow phases. On the other hand, the scalability of the driving experience is excellent, which adapts to novice players as well as to the more savvy ones thanks to the selection of one of three predefined styles or a personalized setting. It therefore happens that with all the aids it is much easier to complete races with good placements and without worrying about the reactions of the bike, while with the ~Pro~ style we are even given the possibility of activating the brakes separately and managing the position of the pilot manually, but with a much greater risk of making mistakes and incurring an accident. Xbox 360 goals There are fifty unlockable objectives in MotoGP 13 and there are many that are obtained by completing the simplest tasks, such as contacting the team technician for the first time or modifying the bike's set-up, or even playing for at least sixty minutes. However, the most important objectives, from 90G, are those that are unlocked by completing the career mode and the championship. Engines on the track and go There are some things you really like about MotoGP 13 when you hit the track, such as the TV-style presentation with commentary from Guido Meda (nicely done, but limited to the introduction and epilogue of each event) and the rider animations before preparing for the start, during the bends (in the career it is even possible to choose between various styles in this sense) or when he recovers at the last moment before losing control of the bike. In our opinion, adding more animations during the race, even if it were a simple movement of the head or a shift on the saddle, would have helped to make our alter ego much more ~alive~, which almost seems to turn into a statue when the traffic lights go out. For quantityor it concerns the tracks and the graphics engine in general, unfortunately we move between ups and downs, with a predominance of the latter. In fact, Milestone's engine does not seem to have undergone any improvement compared to the team's previous works, and in particular it shows the side to evident slowdowns on some tracks during tight bends, or when many objects pass quickly on the screen. It is incredible how even in the PC version, which we tested together with the Xbox 360 one, the situation is equally problematic and it is not possible to exceed thirty frames per second on the test configuration, when on the same computer the aforementioned GRID 2, graphically much more complex and spectacular, it goes easily from 40 to 60 FPS. All the more reason considering the very fluctuating quality of the scenarios: there are impactful tracks (in Spain, for example), with beautiful colors and full of objects, but with a static audience; others, such as Qatar at night, absolutely horrible and ~empty~ (but particularly prone to slowdowns, absurdly). MotoGP 13 does not disappoint in terms of depth of experience, but technically it is behind.", "date": "2013-06-23", "grade": "7.3"}
