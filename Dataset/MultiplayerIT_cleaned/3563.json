{"name": "Hyper Light Drifter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hyper-light-drifter-recensione-ios.html", "text": "Hyper Light Drifter was one of the most popular indies of recent years: initially released on PC in 2016 and developed by the Americans of Heart Machine Games, it is an action RPG inspired by 2D Zelda with a top view, but with its own strong personality and a decidedly darker and more mysterious atmosphere than the Nintendo series, strengthened and perfectly supported, among other things, by thick pixel art graphics. After the debut on the computer and the landing, a few months later, on PS4 and Xbox One, Hyper Light Drifter has more recently also arrived on Nintendo Switch, about a year ago. Its conversion cycle now also includes mobile platforms, more specifically iOS and therefore iPhone and iPad. Considering the nature of the game and also its level of difficulty in some advanced stages, it is reasonable to wonder how much the product can actually be enjoyed even through the touch interface. Let's find out in this review. Touch controls and more We have already had the opportunity to talk about the game itself in an extremely detailed way both on the occasion of the PC and the Switch review, so let's briefly summarize just for those who have no idea what Hyper Light Drifter is: as we said at the beginning, it is an action RPG with a top view set in a decadent alternative world in which the player, impersonating the protagonist who is the Drifter, is called to fight and eliminate enemies of multiple forms and solve environmental puzzles. The plot says very little explicitly, and the text is practically almost completely absent: the narration in fact passes through interactions with characters who ~speak~ through cartoons, with images that it is up to the user to know how to interpret. Although it is functional and intriguing, the story is certainly not the main reason that drives you to play Hyper Light Drifter, but rather the goodness of its gameplay. The Drifter is in fact equipped with a sword that he knows how to use with great skill, which is soon joined by a pistol for ranged attacks. Familiarity in the use of these tools, together with the very important ability to shoot, is essential to be able to move and continue in the adventure: in fact, the fights soon become demanding, because even the weakest enemies can attack in groups, making things complicated . Not to mention the less trivial opponents, or finally the bosses, who offer a challenge rate capable of giving even the most experienced users a hard time. This relative complexity and above all the need for precision in the controls obviously raises some perplexity when thinking about the touch interface, certainly not famous for this type of characteristics. It must be said that the effort of Abylight Studios, which oversaw the port on Switch and also this on iOS, went far beyond the simple homework: the team has in fact tried to get the most out of the touch screen, choosing the solution virtual keys on the screen to reproduce the functions of a controller. Once you get used to it and become familiar with it, the progression becomes at least acceptable, even if it is above all in the virtual stick for the movements that you perceive that margin of imprecision which can generate some frustration, small and surmountable in many cases but more annoying during the more complex steps. In any case, playing on the iPhone is undoubtedly easier than on the iPad, where the size and distance of the keys from the frame make operations much more complicated. An excellent conversion So if touch controls can be considered an only acceptable stopgap solution, fortunately there are alternatives that drastically improve the result. Right now, the best is obviously to use an MFi controller to bring the gaming experience closer to that of other platforms: in this way you can take the worry about the controls out of your head and fully enjoy every aspect of the game. We used a Steelseries Nimbus, one of the best controllers on the market, thus fully appreciating the original experience created by Heart Machine Games. But for those who do not own a product of this type or do not intend to buy it, it is good to remember that the release of iOS 13, now just over a month away, will allow you to take advantage of the PlayStation 4 controllers without any problems and natively. Xbox One. This is a feature with enormous potential in the iOS environment, given that it will give the possibility of making your device a real portable console without the limits hitherto associated with touch controls. In the specific case of Hyper Light Drifter, you will therefore be able to fully enjoy the game at the pricelowest, net of any sales or discounts: in the App Store, in fact, the price is set at 5.49, a real bargain for a product of this quality. Among other things, it is worth mentioning how this version follows the contents of the Special Edition for Switch, thus enjoying numerous extras. From a technical point of view, the work is excellent, also as regards the adaptation to the different proportions of the various iPhones and iPads, with support for 60 fps which become 120 on the iPad Pro. If on the latter and on the iPhone XR we do not have no slowdown problems have been identified, the feedback on older devices testifies to some more uncertainty. Finally, it is worth noting that, at least at this moment, cloud saves are not supported, thus making it impossible to play the same save on the various devices. Hopefully future updates will fix this.", "date": "2019-08-06", "grade": "9.0"}
