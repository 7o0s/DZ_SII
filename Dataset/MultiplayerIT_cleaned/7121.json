{"name": "Tex is back", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131816-tesla-effect-a-tex-murphy-adventure-tex-is-back.html", "text": "Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure marks the return, after sixteen years of waiting, of the bizarre investigator Tex Murphy, a grotesque cross between Marlowe, Indiana Jones and Deckard from Blade Runner. A decidedly particular character, Tex was created in his own image and likeness by the developer Chris Jones and was played by the same game designer in the numerous videos that characterize the last three chapters of the series. The same happens in this new episode, the sixth of a saga born in 1989, which re-proposes the formula seen in Overseer and Pandora Directive which are, in turn, evolutions of the famous Under a Killing Moon. Let's start, therefore, from the latter title, one of the forerunners of modern cinematic adventures, an apt mix of live-action films, first-person exploration, good quality puzzles and a decidedly particular noir atmosphere. The San Francisco of the title is in fact that of the great private detectives but it has descended into a future with cyberpunk tones which, thanks to a marked ironic charge, manages to sustain a real maelstrom of cinematic quotations, high-sounding phrases, vintage music and special effects. Many are those who have been conquered by this formula, also thanks to the high technological content of Under a Killing Moon, and although the series has not enjoyed global success, it can boast numerous fans who have supported the Tesla Effect Kickstarter campaign . And here we find ourselves in the role of a Tex Murphy once again dazed and confused but this time not due to too much alcohol ingested. On the floor of the Chandler Ave office stands a briefcase full of money that Tex seems to know nothing about and the whole apartment is littered with seemingly inexplicable oddities. Thus begins the new adventure of the grotesque detective par excellence, a hero made up of three parts of hard ~boiled~, four of recklessness and three of bizarre irony. With Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure, an icon of vintage graphic adventures returns to the field A very difficult case The peculiar vein of the Access series has prevented Tex Murphy from becoming a character acclaimed by the crowds but has created a very solid fan base that has supported the financing campaign of Tesla Effect, sixth title of one of the longest-running adventure series in the gaming market . The declared objective of the campaign is to make us relive the atmospheres of the old Tex Murphys and it is this element that we take into account in the difficult evaluation of an imperfect title explicitly dedicated to fans of the series. But it is precisely this last factor that gives a uniqueness not to be underestimated to the Big Finish Games branded adventure. Tesla Effect, in fact, is a mixture of exaggeratedly vivid images, noir atmosphere, vintage soundtrack, multiple endings, voiceovers and extra-planetary shots that refer to ancestral powers such as good, evil and destiny. All cardinal elements of the series which are seasoned, even in Tesla Effect, by the inevitable films populated by hordes of strange but fascinated characters. The result is a dedication to an entire generation of cinematic adventures that has the pleasant flavor of a homecoming for those who already know Tex's office and have visited the run-down newsstand opposite the entrance to the Ritz Hotel. Unfortunately, even if the colors, the atmospheres and the formula are the unmistakable ones of the series, the first-person exploratory component suffers from a technical backwardness that is impossible to overlook. Of course, a massive title that was made for only 600 thousand dollars cannot be without compromises but we have seen better even in productions costing just a few thousand dollars. The polygonal mass of the structures is almost nil, the backgrounds leave something to be desired and some textures would not have been acceptable even in the late 90s. Not to mention, then, interpenetrations, interactions with the approximate environment, absent animations, often bare rooms and a general, and very evident, lack of finishing touches. Yet, thanks to an almost magical alchemy, even such a gap fails to completely bury the Tesla Effect. On the other hand, even if Under a Killing Moon can be considered a technological prodigy, at least for the period in which it was released, the Tex Murphy series thrives on dialogues and atmospheres and these in Tesla Effect are not lacking just as there are tons of live videos -action to enliven the umpteenth adventure of the shabby Tex Murphy. We are talking about almost six hours of high definition films characterized by an acting which, although not brilliant, is effective and supported by numerous and excellent quality dialogues. We would undoubtedly grafinger more detail in the exploratory part but it is precisely the interlude scenes that form the backbone of what is an old-fashioned cinematic adventure, a title in which the actors' expressions, choices and engaging dialogues represent a large slice of the experience. The other part, however, is the investigative one, inserted in the first-person exploratory component, which while not proposing anything new is more than enjoyable thanks to clues that are difficult to see, secret codes and puzzles in quantity. The aesthetic result weighs, this is undeniable, but those who really can't turn a blind eye have the opportunity to speed up the investigations and reduce the exploration by resorting to the suggestions of the bizarre artificial intelligence that we carry with us. In this way it becomes possible to focus on the narrative component even if longevity, while remaining high, suffers a severe blow. But the worst consequence for those who choose the shortest route is to lose a part of the game and character characterization which, as in many classic adventures, is made up of the countless jokes that the protagonist comes up with in front of photos, clues and scattered oddities everywhere.", "date": "2014-05-15", "grade": "8.0"}
