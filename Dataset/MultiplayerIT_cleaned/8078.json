Tolkien, an author who also obviously enjoys great popularity on iOS and Android and is cyclically ~monetised~ as a result, in this case with a traditional strategy but at least distant from the world of autobattlers. The protagonists of the game are the leading figures of The Lord of the Rings, starting with Bilbo Baggins and Strider: inevitable for a game that uses the terminology ~heroes~, drawing in this case on a roster made up of a total of forty-six unlockable characters, which also include various villains, but relegate special rewards iconic fighters such as Galdalf, Legolas and Gimli. So how is this new journey into the Tolkien universe? We tell you about it in the review of The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth. Structure, contents and microtransactions The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth, the starting phase of a fight Strategy RPGs are a rather popular genre on mobile, thanks to a control system that lends itself perfectly to touch commands. In this case, the narration carried out by the game is an alternative to the events that LOTR fans know well, in a sort of spin-off that nevertheless employs the same protagonists in the same roles. In short, it is a sort of battle of dreams that paras before our eyes and unfolds through three different single player campaigns (Campaign of Light, Shadow Campaign and Guild Campaign), each composed of different chapters, in turn divided into single missions in which our task is not it is nothing more than to defeat the opponents by making the most of the skills of the group. Once certain levels of experience have been reached, two more are added to these options, namely the arena and the adventures. Unfortunately the element of grinding shows up very quickly, indeed the feeling is that the developers have used it with the specific intention of dilating the times; and so the challenges begin to get too difficult where team members are not adequately strengthened, forcing us to replay missions already completed, perhaps at a higher degree of difficulty, or put our hands on the wallet.As mentioned, the available roster is large but less obvious than one might think, given the presence of characters such as Eowyn, Aerendil, Halbarad, Aeldred, Elrohir, Eomer and others, which represents as much a strength as a lack for a licensed game that aims to intercept the largest possible public and not only the actual connoisseurs of Tolkien's works. Gameplay: the most classic of strategic RPGs The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth, a guild campaign fight In practice, the gameplay of The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth turns out to be decidedly traditional, with its group fights regulated by a turn-based system, but as mentioned, the automatisms we talked about for example are far away in the Street Fighter: Duel review, although there is an option to that effect. We will be able to freely choose the target and attack him with a basic movement or, possibly, perform a special action that can have an offensive value or affect the ability of the group defensively, healing wounds, discouraging opponents and so on. Choosing what to do and how to do it actually produces results and can be the difference between victory and defeat. The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth, an instant of a special move by Aragorn Fortunately, there are no tickets to consume and to wait for their recovery: the title produced by Electronic Arts allows you to play for as long as you want, while placing, as mentioned, very clearly visible paywalls, which limit progression and force you to shoot a little bit around the goal before being able to reach it and continue with the campaign. This translates into a considerable degree of challenge already in the first hours, which tests our strategic abilities while remaining within the ambit of mechanisms that are anything but than deep or multifaceted: it's nice to be faced with battles that are difficult to complete, but when you understand that the motivations are all linked to monetization, enthusiasm can only wane. Technical realization The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth, more battle sequences It is a pity that the game suffers from a questionable balance, because on a technical level the guys at Capital Games have done a great job, ricreating the characters of Tolkien's sagas with a cartoonish and convincing style, providing them with a decent set of animations and making them collide in sufficiently varied scenarios, albeit relegated to mere background to the fights. However, it is the sound of this tie-in to surprise, thanks to epic and engaging orchestral music, just as one would expect from a similar product, combined with high-impact battle effects: for once, it is appropriate to turn up the volume of the smartphone.", "date": "2023-05-24", "grade": "6.5"}
