It was a strange time, when Japan was still running, stumbling behind the West and the franchise still had to discount the bonus played with the fifth game, controversial but successful at the box office. Capcom therefore decided not only to continue on that line, but to increase the weight on the scale, providing a product that was certainly rich in terms of quantity but poor in style and general quality. A remastered and enriched version of that very action and little horror construct arrives on Nintendo Switch, an edition already released on other consoles but portable for the first time. The scope of this operation is more interesting than the sum of its individual parts: with this release package, Capcom ensures on Switch almost all of its numbered saga in what could be the ideal bridge to a new episode. Resident Evil 6, in any case, is not a bad title and certainly shows a great commitment in the production phase, less so in the implementation phase: the pleasure of seeing Leon and Chris on the Switch screen is marred by an excessive action polarization that almost seems like a parody of itself. The beginning of the game is the perfect embodiment of this concept so fashionable at the time but badly aged: a riot of explosions, gunfights, bullets, destruction and quick-time events that in a few minutes expose so much almost forced spectacularity , without a real overview, resulting in a punch in the stomach to those who start the software hoping to enjoy some authorship. Portable action From an action point of view, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi's product responds well to the call: with four main stories, additional modes and local co-op, Resident Evil 6 brings a lot of content to Switch that is easy and quick to use, enjoyable in short sessions and suitable for a playful approach without too much thought or effort. Whether it's good or not, we leave it to your tastes; it certainly wasn't for the maturation of the franchise, faced with a sort of frozen winter and therefore at risk of extinction of credibility. The Switch version carries doubts and merits, certainly highlighting the element of comfort in use mixed with a certain relaxation in progress, free from particular puzzles and a lot entrusted to the swirling pressure of keys. What helps if nothing else to give a purpose to this collection of related stories is the particularity of each campaign: sure, Leon and Ada can boast, every now and then, some return to old habits, while Chris and Jake largely suffer from crises of identity, but overall it cannot be said that the title does not provide ideas for diversifying one's offer. Whether or not they succeeded is another matter, but I applaud the effort. It should also be added that Capcom itself, years later, publicly admitted how the game had suffered from a lack of overall vision, troubled development and lack of collaboration within the team. In short, a few not exactly positive ingredients that seen today take on a greater weight than in the past but which, fortunately, have been - at least technically - a little rounded off by releases that are objectively better than the original ones. On Switch If the DLCs and the increase in resolution and frames help on fixed consoles, on Switch - in the absence of substantial technical improvements - portability and offline co-op give greater satisfaction. Living this journey relying on the partner's artificial intelligence is sometimes a forced experience, but facing it by playing in the company of a sentient person gives the software an aura of further interest, making its simplified dynamics a nice gift to anyone looking for a Resident Evil to play together. And the rest? It works quite well: in the most agitated scenes, the console struggles to keep the flow at 30 frames per second, somehow controlling those situations in which the perimeter is more exited without ever dropping too much in frequency. On a technical level, the software defends itself and on a small screen it is still pleasant to see; it's not exactly the same on a television in the living room, thanks to absolutely perfectible textures, imperfect animations and a generation-old polygonal mass, to which is added a visual distance from other times. The movies, on the other hand, are still enjoyable: the dubbing was not stellar at the time and it is not today, but it allows even the non-English-speaking to enjoy a Resident Evil completely in Italian. We did a bit of racing in both portable and docked modes and, albeitr relegated to a 6.2-inch screen, perhaps we prefer the first, precisely because of its ability to enhance a playful flow on the move that more than other episodes is very carefree and full of shootings, perfect for hit and run experiences, accomplice also a more pleasant technical aspect on a small screen. The co-op, on the other hand, we advise you to experience it in the living room unless you want to go blind. Last mention of merit, the inclusion of joycon motion control to improve the game on the street.", "date": "2019-11-13", "grade": "6.5"}
