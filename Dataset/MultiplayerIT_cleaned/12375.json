{"name": "Guitar Hero 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-hero-2-recensione.html", "text": "Tie me up! GH 2 can be played at 4 difficulty levels. At an easy level, it is an experience for rhythm'game novices and linked to mechanical reflexes. Already climbing to Hard, the Harmonix game transforms into the closest thing to playing the guitar. This is also thanks to the excellent performance of the Pull Off and Hammer On techniques, which allow you to perform legato, i.e. consecutive notes played with a single pick at the first of a series. Then, when the Power Chords also come into play, obtained by pressing several keys at the same time, the degree of exaltation reaches unthinkable levels, as well as a sometimes truly prohibitive difficulty. Over the top You don't change a team that wins, you know. The Harmonix guys have therefore wisely decided to keep the game system that has earned so much fame and glory practically intact, limiting themselves for the most part to the classic filings and marginal additions. The already mentioned guitar-controller, with its 5 keys to simulate the strings, the central one for the pick stroke and the handle for the vibrato therefore remains the absolute protagonist with which to grapple with through a new and very rich tracklist. The mechanics is as simple to understand as it is initially difficult to master, at least for those who are not very familiar with the ~real~ instrument or do not enjoy great coordination with the fingers. In practice, the keys to press to play the notes and thus reproduce the chosen song are indicated on the screen; but if the simplest pieces and the lowest levels of difficulty limit themselves to requiring basic movements, on the contrary with more consistent challenges it will be necessary to bring out the Jimi Hendrix that is in each of us with multiple string pressures and very rapid passages like a true tightrope walker. In fact, the cooperative mode adds a further dose of interest to the whole, leading the 2 players to perform the piece as if they were actually playing two instruments Over the top Just to give support on the occasion of the advanced levels just described, Guitar Hero II introduces an appropriate practice mode, with which you can train only in certain sections of the songs, thus avoiding having to repeat them entirely. An ideal support for those who want to get the most out of the Harmonix product, especially in view of the higher level of general difficulty compared to the first episode. The other important addition is instead to be found in the multiplayer; although playing Guitar Hero in two was undoubtedly expensive given the need to buy a second controller, the satisfactions given by the challenges with a friend were truly remarkable. This sequel not only allows you to perform different sections of the same song, but also to challenge each other within the entire song from start to finish, and beyond. In fact, the cooperative mode adds a further dose of interest to the whole, leading the 2 players to perform the piece as if they were actually playing two different instruments; one the lead guitar, and the other the rhythm guitar or bass as appropriate. Although it is difficult to say that playing the bass is as fun as the guitar, the overall sensation is fun and helps to bring playful fiction closer to sonic reality. Furthermore, the possibility of choosing different levels of difficulty for the two participants in the game represents an intelligent addition capable of favoring the joining of expert players with novice friends. The only big regret, since it is now the Xbox 360 version, is the lack of online multiplayer modes, which would have given Guitar Hero II an almost interminable life. I love rock'n'roll Although the most important and valid aspect of Guitar Hero was certainly not the graphic one, the Harmonix programmers had managed to create a pleasant product above all for the style used, which well represented in an ironic key the rocker atmosphere of concerts in front of a more or less large audience. With this second episode everything has been improved and cleaned up, while keeping the aforementioned style intact; for the 360 version, moreover, particle and depth field effects have been added which help to further identify with the atmosphere of these crazy concerts. With everything that happens on the guitar neck, it will be difficult to notice something, but when the eye manages to linger on the backdrop, there is always something to be satisfied especially during the encores which often end with some surprises. The polygonal models of the musicians have also been revised, which, while not making one cry for a miracle, are perfectly suited to the part and well characterizedterized . Obviously, however, the fundamental component of a game of this mold is the tracklist and for the occasion the team has increased the original for PS2 by 10 songs, so as to cover different genres of rock and different periods, from the 70s nowadays, with numerous bonus tracks resulting from the work of a plethora of groups, including emerging ones. Also in this case, as with the first chapter, they are mostly covers, largely well performed, apart from a handful of sensational defaillances that have to do with the voices of some singers that bear little resemblance to the originals. Despite this however, as it is obvious, the list of songs represents a more or less concrete attraction based on everyone's tastes and knowledge, but there is no doubt that in this episode Harmonix has veered towards a selection for true enthusiasts. The songs are, in fact, for the most part more ~sectoral~ with the appearances of historical groups such as Aerosmith and Van Halen, for example, which however present themselves with songs like ~Last Child~ and ~You really got me~: true and their own pearls, but which will certainly sound little known to most. The fact remains that, thanks to a fixed date for the succession of tracks in the career mode, the four levels of difficulty, the online charts for comparing yourself with friends, and the possibility of downloading new tracks thanks to Xbox Live (it seems that most of the tracklist from the first episode!), this new test of Harmonix offers a challenge able to calibrate perfectly to the strings of any player. Especially on Xbox 360, where Guitar Hero II is an excellent debut, enhanced by the remastering of all the songs, so as to take advantage of the DD 5.1. Goals 360 Rarely do you see objectives so well integrated into the structure of a game. In fact, to collect the 1000 points of GH II, you need to be guided through the many facets of your career, practice and virtual shop. In fact, in addition to the points linked to the completion of all difficulty levels, there are those linked to the purchase of all additional songs, clothes, guitars and characters. Collecting almost 300 points will be a result within the reach of many, reaching 1000, however, will take a very long time. Above all, due to the objectives related to the co-op mode, which will force the purchase of a second guitar to have full meaning and to add further regret for the lack of online multiplayer. Comment Guitar Hero II arrives on the Microsoft console as the sole bastion of a genre completely unknown to Xbox 360 owners, and it's a real panacea. In the midst of a sea of FPS and Action, the masterful work of Harmonix sins only for the lack of an online multiplayer mode, which would have forced us to give the game a truly unheard-of vote. Continuous updates and online leaderboards bring to life what is arguably the best incarnation of the series to date. There are, in fact, hours and hours of fun under the plastic packaging of Guitar Hero II, which is certainly an expensive whim, but which we cannot fail to advise you to take away. Unless you've already played the PS2 version ad nauseam or really don't want to know about music games. Pros: A classy debut Very, very funny Excellent multiplayer Possibility of downloading the songs Cons: Basic tracklist for many but not for all Lack of an online mode in addition to the charts A new guitar For the Xbox 360 version, Red Octane has attached a new version of the guitar, modeled on the shape of the Gibson Explorer. With a completely white look, it is well suited to the Microsoft console, with the only flaw of having the select key difficult to reach, given the positioning. This may not be appreciated by those accustomed to using this solution to activate the Star Power, rather than tilting the instrument vertically, to obtain incredible scores by doubling the multipliers. Surprises, in the world of modern video games, are an increasingly rare commodity. One of the most popular and pleasant of recent times has been Harmonix's Guitar Hero, a musical title which, without reinventing the wheel, had the advantage of finding the right, if not perfect, formula: resuming a guitar-shaped controller (idea original by Konami and his Guitar Freaks), mix it with a mechanic largely borrowed from the previous Frequency and insert everything into the world of rock'n'roll with an excellent tracklist. In late 2006, the acclaimed sequel, Guitar Hero II, was released on PlayStation 2, finally arriving on Xbox 360 with an expanded soundtrack, support for downloading new songs and the conline rankings.", "date": "2007-04-06", "grade": null}
