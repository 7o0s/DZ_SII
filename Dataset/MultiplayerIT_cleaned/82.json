{"name": "Final Fantasy XII - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-xii-recensione.html", "text": "A bit of history... Year 704 of the Valendian calendar, the world of Ivalice (the same of Final Fantasy Tactics, created by Yasumi Matsuno - Ed) is devastated by the war that opposes two empires, that of Archadia, to the East, and that of Rozaria, to the West. The kingdoms of Nabradia and Dalmasca lie territorially right between the two contenders, so that when Archadia moves its troops against Rozaria, their invasion appears inevitable. Shortly after the wedding party between Princess Ashe of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler Heios of Nabradia, to seal an alliance between the two peoples as well as the love of the two, in fact, the troops of the Eastern Empire definitively penetrate the territory of the latter nation, then attacking the fortress of Nalbina which is located right on the border with Dalmasca. Here, in a spectacular CGI video that at times recalls some scenes from Star Wars and at the same time the battle of Helm's Deep from Lord of the Rings, we witness the defeat of the Dalmascan army sent there and the total surrender of his people. ~The treaty will be written in blood and signed with the sword~, proclaims the king of Dalmasca who goes to Nalbina to sign the surrender. But having arrived at the place he is betrayed and assassinated... Two years after the tragic events described above, Rabanastre, the multi-ethnic capital of Dalmasca is occupied, and is just another of the cities subjugated by the Archadian Empire which has put a Consul in charge. Hunger and poverty are visible in every corner of the streets, and dozens of orphans, pickpockets and improvised petty thieves swarm the streets in search of some easy illicit gain. Among these is Vaan, a young man who, after losing his brother in the battle of Nalbina, is left alone in the world: he has a secret dream, to buy a flying ship and one day become an air-pirate. But in the meantime he too must try to survive amidst a thousand difficulties. And this is where we come into play: Vaan is the protagonist of this FFXII, and we will be his ~guide~ in this adventure. A new gameplay The first impact with FFXII can be unsettling, at least for those who are fans of the saga and have never played an MMPORPG. There are many changes and you notice it right away, even if fortunately the atmosphere and magic remain the traditional ones. In fact, after the first moment of bewilderment, the world that unfolds before the player's eyes immediately takes him back to the universe he has learned to recognize over many years, that of Square-Enix. Having abandoned the scenarios with fake 3D backdrops, the fixed camera and the random turn-based fights, FFXII marries a game mechanic very similar to an online Rpg, recreating a three-dimensional world where the monsters are always visible on the screen (and therefore avoidable), the fights take place in semi-real time on the spot and no longer in the appropriate battle screen, and the action takes place more quickly. It is therefore inevitable that in the face of this structural and stylistic change, a more or less total modification of the controls has followed. With the left analog stick moves, as usual, the main character of the party, whose elements are also visible on the map (obviously only the other two that make up the chosen trio), but with the right, new, the camera , maneuverable to your liking as in a normal adventure. An authentic revolution for a traditionalist saga up to now, like the fights. During the exploration phases, the areas in which we find ourselves are often infested with creatures of all kinds (many, obviously, belonging to the classic bestiary of the Final Fantasy universe) which are certainly not stupid, but rather, equipped with good AI . If you want to avoid them to pass by you will therefore have to be very careful how you move because they could see you once you have entered their visual space. If you attack them, be careful that there are no other monsters around, because some will feel your presence and throw themselves into the fray, or it may happen that the attacked person flees and runs in search of help... It is important to always study the environment in which you find yourself, therefore, and plan an adequate tactic before jumping into the fray. When approaching an enemy to attack him, press the X key to open a simple Menu where you can issue the classic commands to the character: Attack (physical) Magic (White or Black), etc. Ditto for companions, unless you have activated the ~Gambit~ command, which we will analyze shortly. The Battle System and the Gambit The clash, as mentioned, takes place in semi-real time, with the attack order indexed by a turn bar that fills up according to the rapcharacter identity. Since these are non-static fights, the game involves the use of a kind of enemy lock, which remains centered on the screen after pressing the L2 key, so that you can follow him in his movements. The new FFXII BS can therefore be briefly defined as a mix between a real-time strategy and an MMPORPG with instantaneous semi-management of the fights, in which the administration of the party has a fundamental role and exponentially increases its effectiveness within the game thanks to the so-called Gambit. The Gambit is a system that can easily be compared to a pre-established strategic plan. With this method, in fact, the party leader does not need to give orders to his companions during the clashes, as they act completely autonomously. In this way the action is smoother and more continuous, and the strategic element takes on an even more important role. How it works: each character has ~spaces~, initially two (during the adventure it is possible to increase the number), where a series of ~sentences~ are composed, let's call them this way, under the headings ~Targets~ and ~Actions~, that make up just about every single slot. The first item indicates who, friendly or enemy characters, to ~bet~, while the second, as the word itself says, who will receive or suffer a given move. To be clear, let's suppose we want to ensure that one of our ally is used to take care of party members in difficulty but at the same time does not disdain to perform magical attacks against enemies. Well, just enter the appropriate Gambit menu, insert, by selecting it, the phrase ~Allied with 70% HP~ under the heading ~Target~ and ~Potion~ under the ~Actions~ one to create a sort of command string. Ditto for the attack in the other line: in the first ~block~ we insert ~Nearest enemy in sight~, and in the second ~Fire~. The concatenation of these two inputs will ensure that during a fight, the element of the group that has implemented them, will take care of healing the companion who loses HP with an energy potion or a corresponding magic, only to then resume attacking the enemy with of fire spells on the next ~turn~ (i.e. loading the ATB). Evolution of characters: License Points The Pg in question, in fact, will ~read~ his movement as follows: ~Heal any ally as soon as the HP drops~ and then ~Attack the closest enemy with a spell~. It goes without saying that having more Gambits to combine for each Pg means personalizing him, making him unique, autonomous and useful to the cause in battle, giving him a series of commands drawn from the many available in a vast repertoire of skills, white magic, techniques that can be purchased in any gambitteria of Ivalice. In this way it will be possible to have multifaceted and customized strategies each time according to one's needs, given that among other things the commands can be modified when one wishes. Final Fantasy XII introduces an unusual Pg evolution system, based mainly on the so-called ~License~ and on the appropriate points, called ~LP~, which are added to the classic EXP (both obtained from defeated enemies). The other license is nothing but a sort of certificate that demonstrates the skills of a character in the use of that particular object or art. Without the specific license, in fact, it is not possible to use specifically weapons, spells, objects, etc. By accessing the player's management menu, a real chessboard is visible under the appropriate item. It shows the acquired and missing licenses for weapons, spells, special techniques, additional gambit slots and summons. The former are distinguished by the presence of a star next to the name, the latter, when visible (many become visible only after having unlocked them) are highlighted by a luminous effect. The box containing them indicates the License Points needed to activate them. For example, if we want Vaan to be able to use a specific sword just bought, and it requires 14 LP to be used, if we have them we will just have to move on the board, passing through other items, until we reach the appropriate box and press the X key on of it. At that point we will have the ~certificate~ for the use of this weapon and we will open new paths that lead to other licenses. A bit like what happened in the FFX spherography, albeit in a simpler form. Obviously it can happen that you have the licenses for an item but not the item itself, so be careful not to waste the related points if you don't have the Item available first. Each character, patience and time permitting, can learn the ability to use all weapons, magic and armor. Hunting for monsters For therest FFXII follows a ~normal~ structural path, moving according to the traditional canons of any J-RPG: cities or villages are explored by interacting with NPCs to learn information necessary for the continuation of the adventure or on the plot, yes tries to complete sub-quests, sometimes even trivial but which never fail to motivate, intrigue the gamer, you go hunting for hidden treasures or particularly difficult monsters to face (remember the legendary Weapons of FFVII?), of fights extra for the Level-Up of characters and Items, to sell items collected in battle in shops perhaps in exchange for future discounts or special Items. The shopkeepers of Ivalice are in fact fond of particular objects, such as animal skins or tusks and therefore they will not disdain to pay you well if you bring them to them. How to recover them? Consecutively defeating monsters of the same type creates the so-called ~Battle Chain~. When a chain is formed, it is indicated on the screen how many opponents we have defeated consecutively. The greater their number, the higher the probability of getting loot from monsters, sometimes even rare ones. It goes without saying that even the ~special~ enemies, those to be researched specifically, can release particular objects on the ground once they are defeated. And in this sense, a nice new feature of FFXII is the ~monster hunt~ sub-quest. How it works: In every inn in Ivalice there is a board on the wall where patrons leave an advertisement. These ads are about monsters that need to be killed in exchange for a bounty. If you are interested in the request, just stand in front of the board, click on X and see what it is. But watch the warrants. In fact, to receive the reward it is not enough to read the announcement and eliminate the relative monster. You must first look for and meet the client, i.e. the one who placed the ad with the request, and stipulate a verbal contract with him by accepting his proposal. Spectacular The new Final Fantasy convinces not only with its innovative game system, but also with its technical implementation. The graphics engine of this title represents in our opinion the state of the art for the consoles of this generation. The term squeezed like a lemon has never been as accurate as in this case. By eye, technically, you can't do better on the Sony Monolith, whose hardware has been pushed to the maximum by the programmers. In fact, the game seems almost enveloped in a magical atmosphere, both from a visual and audio point of view, as we will see shortly. The use of an apt color palette, enhanced by the excellent use of lights in real time, give the eye evocative landscapes, enveloping atmospheres, lowering the gamer into a living and truly fantastic world. The cities are large, lively, fascinating, with their futuristic but also ancient, oriental look, splendid to explore even for the sake of seeing what's around that corner or inside that building, as if we were virtual tourists. But it is in the fights that FFXII probably gives its best from an aesthetic point of view: during these phases between magical evocations, explosions and so on, we often find ourselves immersed in a whirlwind of lights and colors, a veritable amusement park of the Fantastic. All without the slightest slowdown. The character design entrusted to the master Yoshida, assisted in the illustrations by Yashitaka Amano, then does the rest, delivering to the story some of the most fascinating characters of the entire saga. Being a title that ~spiritually~ moves in the wake of tradition, despite all the innovations we have talked about so far, FFXII continues to offer an excellent audio sector, offering us a simply Oscar-worthy soundtrack: signed by the great Hitoshi Sakimoto, also seen at work in titles such as Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy Tactics, just to name a couple, he alternates catchy tunes in the softest moments, with others of great emotional impact during the most agitated phases, authentic orchestral masterpieces. Last notes for the Italian translation (which you can test from our screenshots), well made and which repays, at least in part, the enormous wait that Italian users have had to sustain in order to finally get their hands on the twelfth final fantasy. Conclusions Whether you love turn-based combat rather than semi-real time combat, or the traditional scheme of post FFVII J-RPGs, it doesn't matter: Final Fantasy XII cannot fail to be viscerally loved by those who love role-playing games and have the fortunate to immerse yourself in his universe. The last chapter of the Square saga, the most difficult, the most ~different~ and therefore could bring several people closer to the genre, is the J-R", "date": "2007-02-19", "grade": null}
