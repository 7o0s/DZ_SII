In reality, Strange Journey should have been Shin Megami Tensei IV, but the development team - made up mostly of the series' historical programmers - decided at the last moment to unite the main Shin Megami Tensei by setting them in Japan, which therefore excluded Strange Journey from the pile. In many ways, though, Strange Journey is just plain hard-core Shin Megami Tensei  and one of the best! - designed for veterans of the franchise accustomed to its antics and philosophical and paranormal themes. In this sense, the conversion for Nintendo 3DS has been improved precisely to meet those who have never picked up an episode of the series and, probably, also to take time while waiting for Shin Megami Tensei V on Switch. The dimension of terror Oddities, we said, but less Japanese than usual, in the sense that this time the story takes place entirely in Antarctica, where a nuclear explosion has generated the Schwarzwelt, a kind of space-time anomaly that is rapidly expanding and threatens to engulf the whole planet. If the premise reminds you of Annihilation, Jeff VanderMeer's novel recently adapted into a film by director Alex Garland, well... know that Strange Journey was released a few years earlier and that the original screenwriters were mostly inspired by another cult of the science fiction horror, Event Horizon by Paul W. S. Anderson. In the Schwarzwelt, in fact, various dimensions inspired by the deadly sins are stacked up, as the scientists sent by the United Nations to study the phenomenon and try to stop it will discover. We play one of these scientists, needless to say, and we will have to explore the Schwarzwelt to better understand it, by facing the supernatural creatures that inhabit it or by allying ourselves with them. The screenplay of Strange Journey Redux, while lacking in the characterization of the characters, addresses interesting issues that lead to important reflections on the conditions of humanity. It's a bit the usual leitmotif of Shin Megami Tensei, so much so that even in this Strange Journey Redux it is possible to make choices, in some precise moments of history, which will allow us to follow three different alignments, namely legal, chaotic or neutral . Our decisions will therefore change the unfolding of the narrative, leading to different endings just like in the 2009 version. Strange Journey Redux, however, adds something more to the original package, in the form of a kind of optional storyline that develops in an unpublished dungeon called Womb of Grief and it's all about a mysterious character named Alex. This secondary assignment is linked to the new endings - which are actually the old ones, only longer and more articulated - of the main story, but unfortunately we have to admit that Atlus has failed to better fit the additional storyline into the original narrative skeleton. In this sense, the Womb of Grief is somewhat reminiscent of the Mementos of Persona 5 and remains for a long time an unrelated and parallel content in which the player can try his hand at will. Supernatural The historical backbone of the game has remained almost unchanged but, as we have said, Atlus has made a series of changes aimed at simplifying what was actually a decidedly difficult and at times frustrating experience. This doesn't mean that Strange Journey Redux has become easier - unless you choose the corresponding difficulty level, of course - but just more accessible. The deadly puzzles and encounters with the toughest enemies and bosses are still there and will often test players' logic and skill, if not their patience in lovable grind sessions. Those who have played any Etrian Odyssey will miss the ability to make notes on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS, but thankfully it is now possible to save anywhere on the map and this change alone makes for a much more relaxed experience. On the other hand, the possibility of installing several sub-apps at the same time and modifying the parameters of the adventure, for example by increasing the rewards or regenerating the health points at regular intervals, guarantees a greater level of customization and strategy. Similarly, it has also become easier and more intuitive to manage the supernatural creatures that will join our group in the Schwarzwelt: there are more than three hundred of them and fans of the saga will recognize them all, for better or worse, from the mascot Jack Frost tothe Sumerian deities passing through angels and various demons, but the player can recruit a maximum of eighteen at a time. The party is managed in the manner of Shin Megami Tensei and Persona, merging creatures and moving their abilities from one to another, but compared to the aforementioned titles there is a small difference in the turn-based combat system. This time we won't gain extra turns by exploiting enemies' weak points; rather, our teammates who follow our same alignment will attack the targets together with us, thus suggesting that we form parties that also take that parameter into consideration. It must be said that the enemies cannot do the same and that therefore the combined attack system ends up being only in favor of the player, but some clashes can be really difficult and in the long run it is a far from unwelcome advantage from the point of view of a very demanding title.", "date": "2018-05-19", "grade": "8.0"}
