{"name": "Bleach: Shattered Blade - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bleach-shattered-blade-recensione.html", "text": "Shattered sword Let's briefly mention the history of Bleach: the undisputed protagonist is Ichigo Kurosaki, a Japanese teenager who can see ghosts. One fine day Ichigo is forced to borrow the powers of a Shinigami, a god of death that is, to defend his family from the attack of a Hollow, a sort of evil spirit. From that moment Ichigo and his friends, more or less endowed with supernatural powers, remain involved in the events of the otherworldly world called Soul Society, which will naturally lead them to face mortal threats and to meet precious allies. Shattered Blade features a story mode that takes place immediately after the end of the first narrative arc of the manga, the one set for the major in the Soul Society. On a narrative level, Shattered Blade adds nothing to the series, and the plot is a mere pretext, however botched, to make the chosen character fight against various opponents, and to introduce an unprecedented enemy, Arturo Plateado. Players can of course try their hand at this mode, or in the canonical Survival Mode, you can train in using the characters or challenge a human opponent: in the first two cases, however, you get virtual money to spend in the weirdo Kisuke Urahara's shop , in order to unlock various contents addressed above all to the fans: images, movies, additional costumes, artwork, and so on and so forth. These extras are numerous and definitely increase the longevity of the single-play game. Whether you play alone or against a friend, the basic mechanics don't change anyway: Polygon Magic had a good idea, but the results are decidedly mixed. Bleach is played by holding Nunchuk and Wiimote. With the stick you move your character in a sort of three-dimensional arena, in fact the fights take place on a horizontal axis but it is possible to rotate around the opponent to avoid attacks. The Wiimote is reserved for our offensive capabilities: very simply, by moving the remote control vertically, horizontally and with a decisive click towards the screen, it is possible to land three types of blows. The combination of these movements with pressing the A button allows you to launch three more powerful attacks (defined as ~critical~), while holding down the B button performs the canonical special moves, borrowed directly from the original series. The mechanism is incredibly simple and intuitive, and it is possible to engage in spectacular fights with white weapons, also considering the possibility of connecting the various basic shots in any order for a duration limited only by an indicator of fatigue. However, the problems arise precisely at this juncture: in fact, we soon realize that there is no tactic or strategy in the combat system, which is essentially based on the frenetic manipulation of the Wiimote in order to score more hits in the shortest time possible. In short, the visual result is satisfying, but the duels soon become confusing, random and physically tiring. Shattered sword Furthermore, the Bankai could not be missing, even if they are definitely abused. In the Bleach universe, the gods of death possess swords, the Zanpakut, which are weapons and physical expressions of their spiritual strength. Drawing on the power of these swords, some Shinigami can manifest extraordinary powers, which take the form of devastating attacks or physical and spiritual enhancements. The Bankai has been attributed to all the characters present in the Shattered Blade roster, even to the Shinigami who did not have it in the original series and to super-humans such as Chad and Orihime Inoue, even if in the latter cases the Bankai takes the form of an enhancement generic: after loading a special bar (the Reiatsu) it is possible to shake the Nunchuk to start a short scene in which our on-screen alter-ego performs his Bankai, after which the action resumes normally and ends gains a temporary boost to his attacks and special strikes, which take on new forms. Exhilarating for fans, Bankai soon reveals itself as a sort of limit in clashes, given its devastating power: a player in Bankai is practically unstoppable, and technique or evasion are of little use against his shots; in practice, all that remains is to activate your Bankai before the opponent or immediately after him, to hope to survive the incoming damage and win the battle. Nonetheless, a good test From a technical point of view, Bleach is a game without infamy or praise. The feeling is that of a Game Cube production, but the total absence of slowdowns and the more than fair quality of animations and particle effects still denotesome effort from the developers. The polygonal models, vaguely in cel-shade, are quite faithful to their original drawn counterparts, and the attention paid to facial expressions is remarkable. The animations are very faithful to those appreciated in the cartoon: in short, Shattered Blade is really Bleach, and forgiving the variation caused by the translation to 3D one can only appreciate the work done. The various locations in which you fight are naturally borrowed from the original series, but the detail is very small, without considering the total lack of interactivity. As for the audio sector, the rock and metal style of the various original music from the animated series has also been maintained in this videogame edition: it is certainly not a sound-track of who knows what quality, but it does its job of being the background to various clashes, however making himself rather forgettable. The dubbing maintained is that in English of the American adaptation: for those who have been accustomed to the Japanese voice-over, the change is disorienting but the voices remain quite adequate. The Italian translation is good, which seems to respect the canonical terms adopted for the comic series published in Italy. It was said, without infamy or praise... Enough to satisfy a fan, but nothing more. Comment This first appearance of Bleach on Wii is not to be condemned: the game system is all in all pleasant and original, even if implemented clumsily. In short, an experiment that we hope will have a more elaborate and evolved sequel. The fan-service isn't Dragon Ball Z: Budokai-level, that's for sure, but there's enough to keep a fan of the series busy for a long time: thirty-two characters, dozens upon dozens of artwork and goodies, a story mode with multiple episodes... I mean, a fan isn't going to put it back on the shelf anytime soon, and it's them that Shattered Blade is primarily aimed at. It's a pity, because the two episodes produced by Treasure for Nintendo DS were attractive to any fan of fighting games, given the enormous quality. Shattered Blade, on the other hand, remains recommended for those who appreciate Tite Kubo's manga, others can direct their attention towards more complex but perhaps less spectacular fighting games. Pros Simple and intuitive gameplay Lots of extras to unlock Spectacular duels Versus 4:3 and technically decent Combat system is random and confusing Aimed primarily at fans Bleach: Shattered Blade is available for Nintendo Wii. There are some video games which, sometimes, despite their quality, prove to be essential purchases for that category of gamers they are aimed at. They are generally games based on successful animated or comic series, which leverage the passion of some users, willing to spend hard cash to play incomplete products just to see their heroes in action. The situation up until a few years ago was truly disastrous, and the only series that managed to maintain a decent quality, perhaps due to its popularity, was Dragon Ball, served up in all ways, from card-games to more traditional fighting games. In recent times, however, this trend has begun to change and the care given to these productions has exponentially increased. Bleach is a manga, a Japanese comic that is, drawn by Tite Kubo, published since 2001 on Weekly Shonen Jump, and now extremely popular. It belongs to that category of manga, the so-called Shonen Manga, characterized by some main elements, generally the presence of increasingly powerful enemies for the protagonists to face, who thus experience physical and character maturation between one fight and another. Along with Naruto and One Piece, Bleach is considered the true heir to the now archetypal Dragon Ball. Shattered Blade is not the first video game inspired by the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki, numerous have already been produced for various consoles, even four on PSP of decent quality, and two excellent two-dimensional fighting games developed by Treasure for Nintendo DS. In this first appearance in the Wii toy library, the developer Polygon Magic thus finds himself having to figure out a genre, the fighting game, and the trouble of integrating the particular Nintendo console control system in an attractive way: the results will have been satisfactory, for fans and casual gamers?", "date": "2008-03-27", "grade": null}
