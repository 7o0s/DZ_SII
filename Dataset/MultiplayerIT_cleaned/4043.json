If you are a fan of Yuki Tabata's work, which is quite recent among other things, you will be happy to know that your trusted publisher has seen fit to carry on with the work by proposing the first themed video game of the series. Needless to beat around the bush, Bandai has a long view when it comes to manga and anime adaptations, just take a look at the games released so far in 2018: Gundam, The Seven Deadly Sins, Naruto various, Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time, and Tokyo Ghoul and My Hero Academia are also waiting for us in the coming months. And Black Clover of original material to work on offers galore: but will the first video game live up to the starting work? A Plot worthy of the Magic Emperor A couple of years have passed since the publication of the first volume in Italian translation of Black Clover, but the shonen has already managed to arouse good interest, thus surrounding itself with a circle of loyal readers. After all, if the series did not have potential, no publisher would have selected it for a themed video game: as far as we are concerned, Black Clover is a satisfactory work and for the moment it continues to offer some interest, despite the themes, situations and characters suffering of some limits, sometimes reaching a certain amount of repetitiveness. In this sense, the first themed production in the videogame field, that is Black Clover: Quartet Knights, suffers more or less from the same defects, and we will analyze them later. As far as the narrative sector is concerned, however, it should be emphasized that the title of Bandai Namco faithfully follows the events of the manga, thus proposing itself as an excellent starting point also for newcomers, and then generating the due dose of exaltation in true fans and own. In a realm where magic is at home, and in varying degrees possessed by all the inhabitants, Asta is born, the Naruto of the situation, who seems to know how to do almost nothing. Lacking any kind of magical energy, however, he aspires to a decidedly challenging goal: to become the new Magic Emperor to lead the kingdom. Needless to say, since he was a child he has had a best friend who is also his bitterest rival, Yuna, who coincidentally unlike Asta possesses a lot of magic, has a natural predisposition to spells, in short, he is the best candidate for the role of Emperor Magical, with all due respect to Asta. Obviously Asta certainly cannot give up: for a series of mysterious events he obtains a deadly weapon, a broadsword capable of canceling any type of magic, and after hard training he enters one of the many bodies chosen at the service of the 'emperor. From here he will begin his adventurous journey through the kingdom, full of obstacles and discounts with enemies far more powerful and skilled than him, which he will however defeat thanks to his relationship with his teammates. Omitting some marginal episodes and focusing instead on the key points of the story, Black Clover: Quartet Knights proceeds quickly covering almost the entire original work, with some unpublished scenarios; a linear but never trivial trend, perfect for becoming familiar with the Bandai Namco title. Because then the heart of the production is online. Playstation 4 trophies Good news for Trophy Hunters: it seems that getting the Black Clover: Quartet Knights Platinum Trophy is pretty much a piece of cake. Among the tasks to be completed there will be to complete the game storyline, win an online match with every single character present, and then get at least ten victories in ranked mode. With a little patience, fifteen hours of play (perhaps a little less or a little more) should be enough. Magic Gameplay: Third Person Shooter Black Clover: Quartet Knights is a third-person shooter seasoned with many action elements. And this is the first winning point of the production: an original idea, also realized in a decidedly satisfactory way. The player moves within game levels of modest size, frames the various enemies on the screen with the ~scope~ and casts his spells: sometimes simple defensive spells, other real devastating and spectacular offensives. In all of this, of course, he will have to constantly monitor the magic and health bars, as well as the recharge times of the various moves. A system that turns out to be complex to learn and manage very quickly, but which is all in all based on four types of attacksmain hi: the actual offensive spell (R2), the secondary one (L2), that of connection with one's companions (R1) and a fourth move that can be performed with L1. When the magic bar is completely filled, the final move of each character can be unleashed with the Triangle command: and there it is pain for the opponents. Coming to terms with the game camera and the viewfinder is not too tiring and the control system is never really uncomfortable: set aside a good starting idea, however, it is not that the game areas created by the developers do cry out for a miracle. They faithfully follow what was seen in the anime and manga, but the dimensions are really small, the enemies anonymous, the objects present on the screen few and impossible to destroy: in short, if Asta hits a chest resting in a corner with a broadsword, it would be well and good to see it fall apart. Instead, all the objects remain miraculously intact: is this too magic or a lack of attention to detail? Black Clover: Quartet Knights, however, compensates with a rather good dose of content: sixteen playable characters, divided into four classes with peculiar moves and abilities; a long-running story mode; a challenge mode where side objectives can be completed with every single character present, which greatly increases longevity. And then of course there's the online battle, in arenas where two teams of four players each battle it out. It is here that Black Clover: Quartet Knights shows its full potential ... and also its most obvious limitations. The idea is good: clashes between wizards with a magic-based shooter, where technique and training could really reward the best, and where coordination with teammates could really make a difference. The problem is that the game classes are unbalanced: two attackers would be enough to take out a team of curators. But even between attackers and attackers, or between shooters and shooters, things don't get better: just launch the same powerful, deadly and fast attacks in bursts, and the opponent will be able to do little or nothing to counter us, unless he's really good at it. . All in a riot of lights, colors and scenographic moves where sometimes it's hard to understand what the heck is going on around the character, before seeing him end up lying on the ground. And it's a real shame, because Black Clover: Quartet Knights really has a lot of meat on the fire and interesting material, unfortunately without being able to manage them in the best possible way, and therefore to shine in their own light.", "date": "2018-09-28", "grade": "7.0"}
