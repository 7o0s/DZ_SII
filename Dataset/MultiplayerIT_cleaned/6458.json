The expectations of the enthusiasts were partially disappointed due to a series of more or less marked limits, which clearly underlined the difference between the Nintendo product and the albeit ambitious project of the Finnish team Cornfox & Bros. Just over a year later , here we are talking about the PC version of the game, which debuts on Steam with the same goal: to offer users a Zelda-like experience. The boy protagonist of the adventure discovers that his father has left for a mission of no return, to eliminate a monster that threatens the world, and decides to find out what happened to him. Having recovered some objects, including a sword and shield of ordinance, he sails aboard his boat to ever new islands, and there he will have to face the invasion of a mysterious army of monsters, explore dungeons full of traps and finally get hold of three ancient seals that have the power to drive evil out of the world. Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas attempts to clone the Zelda experience, only partially succeeding Between one island and another As mentioned, the references to The Legend of Zelda (in particular to The Wind Waker) are numerous, starting from the graphic style and the presence of vases, tufts of grass to cut with the sword, chests to open, the same combination of sword and shield, interaction with the environment and NPCs, and not least the sessions of sailing from one island to another. Unfortunately, these represent the most boring part of the experience, given that it is not possible to skip them (as happens instead in the remastered version of The Wind Waker - even Nintendo had noticed the problem!) and they are not even interactive, introducing at most a trivial target shooting minigame with bombs, barrels and sea monsters. Each location hides some secrets and there are characters to interact with to obtain useful information; for example the discovery of an island, which from that point forward appears on the map and can be reached by sea. The fact that the protagonist cannot jump leads the gameplay to explore very interesting concepts on paper, such as environmental puzzles in which you have to figure out how to reach a certain point in the scenario to open a chest or activate a switch, running up ramps and stairs until you don't get anywhere near a point that you can ~jump over~. There are enemies around to fight, in most cases rather harmless (but with a successful design, in our opinion), and the combat system reflects the simplicity of an approach that, not surprisingly, was designed for devices mobile. However, some situations remain valid, in particular the boss fights (apart from perhaps the last one, a bit drawn out), which require different approaches and a minimum of strategy in order to obtain a victory and move forward. Come back Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas takes roughly ten hours to complete, but the backtracking element is handled controversially. Where a certain area is not accessible due to the lack of an object or a specific ability (see for example bombs, capable of opening a breach if placed next to some types of walls), this mechanism works quite well, in the sense that you continue to turn and eventually come into possession of what you need to be able to go back and make further progress. The problem is when the expedient of traveling back is exploited to artificially increase the duration of the experience, in concert with a chronic lack of indications and suggestions. Not a small contrast: on the one hand the degree of challenge of the game is low and does not worry, on the other a hardcore-style enthusiasm is expected that justifies long journeys in search of that particular key or that particular power that has been revealed necessary in order to move forward. From this point of view, the level design of the dungeons does not help, which all look a bit alike and bring into play puzzles that are based on the same concept of blocks to be moved in the right way or levers to be activated to open grates or barriers. Limits that add up to those of a sometimes hasty direction and an animation of mediocre quality, which reveals its shortcomings especially during the cutscenes. From mobile to PC The transition from iOS to PC has not brought to Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas that boost that would have been expected. The developers have indeed lethiatus unchanged the low-definition textures and added to what has already been seen on the iPhone and iPad just a few filters to ~beautify~ the general picture, inserting options to increase the resolution (up to 4K, it must be said) and operate on the quality of the objects and the vertical synchrony. Using the test configuration we obtained excellent performance, with sixty frames per second stable at 1080p, without encountering the uncertainties complained, however, by some users on Steam. The use of the Xbox 360 controller, perfectly supported, undoubtedly adds concreteness to an experience that sometimes suffered from some blunders on touch screens, especially where a minimum of precision was needed in order not to fall into a dungeon and have to redo the road from Head up the ladder to get back to the surface. On the atmosphere front, however, nothing to say: when the game does not show its limits, that is during the interlude sequences, the show offered is very pleasant and the splendid soundtrack signed by Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy) and Kenji Ito ( Secret of Mana) proves to be capable of giving the product that something extra. Dreamy promises that, in the end, however, are only partially kept.", "date": "2015-03-26", "grade": "7.0"}
