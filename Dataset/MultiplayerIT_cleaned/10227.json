In this case the work was entrusted to an internal development team, which is therefore different from Beijing 2008; and it is perhaps for this reason that the game ends up ~doing the homework~ without offering numbers and substance. But first things first: Vancouver 2010 presents itself as the most classic of multiplatform products, and in its PC version (subject of this review) it does nothing to hide the multiple references to the Xbox 360 controller, a device therefore more than recommended for enjoying to the best of experience. Apart from training, there are only two modes: the first, ~Olympic Games~, simply allows us to try our hand at the desired discipline among the fourteen available, possibly creating a sequence of different races which are crowned by the nice podium sequence complete with a national anthem for the winner; the second, ~Challenges~, consists of a series of thirty skill tests (divided into three difficulty levels) which ask us to complete the races by maintaining a certain speed, obtaining a certain score or performing particular maneuvers. The online multiplayer, technically of good quality, unfortunately involves only races against a single opponent and the publication of records in a world ranking. Candid expanses As mentioned above, there are fourteen disciplines that make up variations of eight sports. For Alpine Skiing we have the Men's Downhill, the Men's Super-G, the Women's Giant Slalom and the Women's Slalom. These are probably the funniest and most immediate games, also considering the control system adopted: you have to repeatedly press button A on the controller at the start to obtain the initial thrust, then control the trajectory of the descent by moving the left analog stick and the position of the character using the left and right triggers, respectively to raise it (and therefore tighten the curves more) and to lower it (gaining speed). There are two views available (you can switch between them by pressing the B button), third person and first person, which offer a very different feeling: the third person provides more control and allows you to enjoy the animation of the character, the one in the first person is undoubtedly more spectacular and engaging, thanks also to a ~trembling~ effect that gives the descent great realism. The jump is present in a single variant, namely the long trampoline: individual male. This is the typical discipline based exclusively on timing, and in fact we are asked to press button A to select the moment of departure based on the strength of the wind, press it again to regulate the momentum before the flight and finally to prepare for landing after possibly maintaining balance using the dorsal triggers. Learning to jump long is a matter that takes up little time, but just as quickly the charm of the discipline diminishes compared to others with greater thickness. Christmas atmosphere Freestyle is present in Vancouver 2010 in the form of women's Ski Cross and women's Jumps: in the first case it is a question of facing a speed race in a group, therefore with all the opponents on the track at the same time, and to obtain a good performance it is necessary to learn well the trajectories of the course as well as taking off the jumps at the right time so as not to lose speed. The discipline of Jumps, very different, is truly spectacular in its visual implications and rather complex in execution: you choose a more or less difficult maneuver among those available, then you launch yourself onto the trampoline and then move the analog sticks by drawing circles ~coordinated~ with those displayed on the screen. A short experience, therefore, but one that requires quite a bit of practice to be mastered in its more advanced applications. Snowboarding offers us two trials, the men's Parallel Giant Slalom and the men's Snow Cross, which in the end mimic respectively the women's Giant Slalom and the just mentioned women's Ski Cross: the rules and the feeling are practically the same, so we there are very few surprises. Skating once again goes to the bottom in the order of preference of winter sports in videogame version, unfortunately, with two alternatives (500 m and 1500 m for women) of little value, while the offer is completed by three speed disciplines quite similar between them: two-man Bobs, male Skeletonsle and men's single luge. The spectacular implications are undeniable, but there is perhaps too much emphasis on precision and the result is a somewhat frustrating experience. Summing up... There are fourteen disciplines present in Vancouver 2010, and they constitute the variants of eight sports. Alpine Skiing offers the Men's Downhill, the Men's Super-G, the Women's Giant Slalom and the Women's Slalom. Jumping is present with only the Long Trampoline: Men's Individual. Freestyle offers two variants (Women's Ski Cross and Women's Jumping), as well as Snowboarding (Parallel Giant Slalom and Men's Snow Cross) and Ice Skating (Women's 500m and Women's 1500m). The last three disciplines are present in a single variant: Bobsleigh for two, Men's Skeleton and Men's Single Luge. Snow in the sun The technical sector of the new SEGA title is very well cared for, with a series of truly spectacular and guessed solutions: the first person view (especially the long jump), the ~jolt~ effect to underline the enthusiasm and speed, the excellent animations of the characters and a respectable polygonal count, able to offer us detailed landscapes even in the distance. It seems that the visual component has been put first, perhaps sacrificing everything else, and it must be admitted that the work done is commendable. Even the curtains with the awards on the podium are nice and plausible, while everything is enriched by a skilful and dynamic direction, which gives its best also and above all during the inevitable replays at the end of each race. Tested on a less than monstrous Athlon64 X2 5000+ with ATI HD4870 in tow, at 1680 x 1050 pixel resolution, with all effects maxed out and v-sync engaged, the game performed very well, anchoring to a frame rate of 30 fps and showing the side with few uncertainties: the feeling is that it can be played in a decent way even on relatively modest configurations. The sound sector certainly deserves a mention, made up of a series of good quality signed songs, engaging at the right point, and by realistic and convincing effects.", "date": "2010-01-27", "grade": "6.0"}
