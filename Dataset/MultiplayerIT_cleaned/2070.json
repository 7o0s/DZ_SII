{"name": "Crazy Taxi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-taxi_b.html", "text": "Saddle up! The gameplay of Crazy Taxi is as simple as it is captivating: on board your trusty taxi, you will have to take as many people as possible to the places where they will show you until the time available to you is over. Knowing the roads well and knowing how to get away from the traffic are as important as the methods for obtaining extra money, that is by entertaining your passenger, between jumps to the limit of the impossible, drifts of those impossible and furious races constantly touching the other cars. Depending on the speed with which you deliver the passenger on duty, you will have a better evaluation: speedy if you are very fast (and you will receive pats and handshakes from your customers), normal (should we explain what this means? Ed.) up to slowy, complete with a kick on your taxi and non-payment. The city, which may seem small at first, extends for several kilometres, embracing stations, motorways, fountains, shops (complete with real brands such as Fila or Levi's) and so on. Fortunately, the extra city already seen on the Dreamcast, Playstation 2 and Gamecube, as well as the crazy boxes, also appears in this PC version. Saddle up! There should be no doubts about the first extra designed for the home market: an entire city to explore (complete with a tunnel for the train and an underpass for the metro) and from which the inhabitants can earn a pittance of money, a pity that the design of this last differs, at times, little or nothing from the arcade one, but above all it is not so fun to explore. Crazy box is the name under which some fun missions are enclosed in which you will have to perform the stunts or actions that the Hitmaker team will ask you. For the more skilled racers. On the first extra designed for the home market, there should be no doubts: an entire city to explore (complete with a tunnel for the train and an underpass for the metro) and from which the inhabitants earn a pit of money, too bad that the design of the latter differs, at times, little or nothing from the arcade one, but above all it is not so fun to explore. Crazy box is the name under which some fun missions are enclosed in which you will have to perform the stunts or actions that the Hitmaker team will ask you. For the most skilled racers. Playability is at the highest levels: sneaking around dozens of cars, looking for shortcuts, to get where your customer told you, is one of the most intense gaming experiences ever, even 3 years after the original release from which it also inherits the poor longevity: having memorized the morphologies of the 2 cities and once the crazy boxes have been solved, the user will devote himself to other games, dusting off Crazy Taxi every now and then, precisely because of its greatest value (and defect): the incredible immediacy. But be careful, it's easy to get involved, easily bring a couple of customers to their destination but receive a type S medal for valor (and therefore the right to enjoy the -abhorrent- ending), with over a dozen people quickly escorted where you they said, it will take away a busy week of gaming from even the most fanatic of gamers. Fast graphicsalways? Strangelite, the team that took care of this conversion, requires, as minimum requirements, a computer equipped with any 500 mhz processor (600 for Celerons), 64 mb of ram (128, under Windows XP), accelerated video card with 16 mb of ram and, necessarily, DirectX 8.1, however present in the game CD. The recommended requirements speak of a processor of at least 800 mhz, more than 128 mb of ram and a video card with 32 mb of ram. Just over 150 mb is the space that crazy Sega taxi drivers will require from your hard disk. The game was tested on a Duron 800, 256 mb of ram and Matrox G450 and on a P3 933, 256 mb of ram and GeForce 3 Titanium 200. In the first case, at 640x480 resolution with 32 bit color depth the game it appeared fairly fluid (about 20 frames per second), with various slowdowns and shots of short intensity which, fortunately, do not significantly affect the fun. On the second PC, playing with all the details at maximum and resolution of 1024x768x32 color bits, turns into a more immersive gaming experience (less jaggies and a higher definition than the original), although slowdowns and frame rate drops still do peep out, even looking for compromises (eliminate shadows, lower the resolution and so on). A real pity, after all on Dreamcast the only graphical problems that Crazy Taxi brought were a sometimes decidedly marked pop up and very few slowdowns. Unheard of in 2002 to see a fluency non perfect despite cars made with low polygons, trees that suddenly appear and people who get inside the cars (as if they were made of butter) and so on. The quality of the textures varies from the more than convincing (the taxis of our 4 protagonists) to the dull of some houses, Nintendo 64 stuff. On Naomi (and later consoles) the minor graphic detail of some buildings and the polygonal construction of the citizens (all modest after all), was the result of the compromise aimed at guaranteeing a hair-raising speed and a fluidity practically nailed to 60fps (despite the abundance of cars on the screen, adjustable as desired as the time available), such as the Gamecube version, recently released and which eliminated some slowdowns and mitigated, albeit partially, the horrors of bad clipping. Today's personal computers have an average configuration higher than the hardware of the 3 128-bit consoles that are enjoying so much success all over the world, yet it almost seems to cry out to retrogaming seeing Crazy Taxi in 2002, without any facelift action, even minimal (as happened on the 128 bit Nintendo). All i wannnnt All Bad Religion and Offspring fans get ready for some terrible news: the wonderful Crazy Taxi soundtrack.has been lost. We don't know the reasons, but the wonderful soundtrack of the original (and subsequent console conversions), like the fantastic ~All I Want~ by the Offspring, has been evaporated. The music present does their duty more than well, honorably respects the spirit of the previous soundtrack but an avid fan of the game cannot fail to tie this questionable choice to his finger. Digitized speech has benefited from new voice actors, given that, actually, before, apart from the 4 taxi drivers controllable by the gamer, the voices aimed at giving life to our customers were very few (3-4). The sound effects have been converted perfectly, so we'll hear great rumbles from our engines, terrible crashes when we collide with a building at high speed and so on. Conclusions Crazy Taxi testifies that a video game, if really fun, remains so even for decades and that graphics are not everything, absolutely. Graphically, no one expected who knows what marvels worthy of the new Ge Force 4 or Radeon 8500 video cards but worsening a graphic impact, at times decidedly old in itself, with a fluidity far from being nailed to 60 fps, certainly won't help the game, certainly overplayed by the majority of gamers on one of the many formats on which the game has been running for some time. The new soundtrack does its job well but lacks that scratchy galvanization that the songs we listened to in the arcade and on home consoles were capable of. The very high playability decreases within a couple of weeks, with the result that the game CD will only find its place in your CD-ROM player from time to time, perhaps after long sessions in the company of decidedly more profound games such as Warcraft 3, Neverwinter Nights and others. The extra city and the subgames, features also already seen in the versions designed for the home market, are well accepted and increase the intrinsic value of the game a little as well as obviously giving it that extra bit of longevity that has such a (positive) impact in a slavish coin-op conversion. What to say? Crazy Taxi fanatics without a console and who haven't yet had the pleasure of taking home your favorite coin-op, make it yours now, taking into account the cosmetic and longevity limitations. Anyone who owns any 128-bit console (except Xbox, which however will host the imminent third chapter), make the conversion with the lowest price their own (the one for Playstation 2 is sold at a budget price, for example). Anyone who already owns it, the purchase is absolutely useless, there is nothing more than you already know, apart from a scrolling never so uncertain as in this version. Taxi drivers are born The PC user has always been accustomed to a videogame offering based on first person shooters, RTS and simulators, videogame typologies that have always been identified as the most popular on PCs Other videogame genres, more the preserve of consoles, such as fighting games and arcade guide, they hardly appear on our monitors, despite the fact that some of the most famous ones have been converted, successfully or not, on our beloved personal computers. Sega has always been a software house capable of producing videostechnically exceptional games, very entertaining and with the most original and extravagant concepts possible, is a famous name both for the assiduous goers of the arcades (generally hosting no less than 3-4 SErvice Games cabinets), and for console owners (not only by Sega, by now) but also PC; from the progenitor of the Virtua Fighter saga, passing through the various Panzer Dragoon, Daytona Usa, the 2 Sega Rally and The House Of The Dead up to Virtua Tennis, there are dozens of conversions (more or less convincing, Sega Rally 2 the best and Sega Gt the worst) hit of the famous Japanese brand that appeared on our dear personal computers and Crazy Taxi is the last (in chronological order, luckily) to appear on PC. Released back in 1999 under the Hitmaker label (the same guys who created the popular Power Smash, better known as Virtua Tennis) and with the power of the Naomi arcade card (a Dreamcast with double the amount of ram, i.e. 32 mb of main ram and 16 mb video), Crazy Taxi was and still is one of the funniest and most light-hearted videogames in the entire videogame universe, capable of attracting dozens of gamers loaded with tokens in the arcade center and selling in the Dreamcast, Playstation 2, Gamecube and, finally, pc. Let's analyze it more closely and see if 3 years of life will have affected the makings of this galvanizing racing game.", "date": "2002-06-30", "grade": null}
