{"name": "Thomas Was Alone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105859-thomas-was-alone-personalita-geometriche.html", "text": "A lot of imagination and an excellent narration are enough, and even a cold parallelogram can prove to be an extremely charismatic character. Edwin A. Abbott proved it with his Flatland, a wonderful story whose protagonists were simple geometric shapes in a two-dimensional world, but characterized so well that the reader almost forgot about it. Here, with Thomas Was Alone the London developer Mike Bithell seems to want to achieve a similar goal within a video game, proposing a puzzle-platform that makes geometry its leitmotiv but finds its most evident in the narration and in the thickness of the angular characters strength. A square team The title of the game suggests the incipit. In fact, the protagonist of the story is Thomas, a very particular type who likes to ask himself questions about his surroundings. Small detail: Thomas is a solitary blue rectangle, and one fine day he realizes that the geometric universe in which he lives seems to constantly put him to the test. Not having who knows what special ability, he thus begins to jump, move and question the meaning of life. During his adventure he comes into contact with other characters: Chris is a ~short~ and ~fat~ quadrilateral who has difficulty jumping but thanks to his small size he can slip into tunnels inaccessible to anyone else; Claire thinks she's a superhero, but she's actually an overweight square that can float on water; John is a snotty guy who puts on a lot of air due to his height and ability to jump higher than anyone else. Translated into mechanics, this means that each of the bizarre heroes must work as a team, with the player switching from one to the other to exploit the peculiarities of each and overcome the various puzzles until an exit is reached at the other end of the scenario. Unfortunately more often than not it's just a matter of finding a way for all the characters to advance, perhaps using Laura as a stepping stone to reach a high switch, or harnessing Claire's floating power to traverse a huge pool of acidic water. Let me be clear, the two or three hours necessary to complete the adventure are not dotted with badly made puzzles, and indeed soon we have to deal with increasingly elaborate levels and some new obstacles. The problem is that, given the boxy shape of the scenario and the distinct abilities of the characters, it's always clear what needs to be done to move forward: is there any water? All aboard Claire to the other side; is a platform too high? Let's create a ladder for the lowest group members. Not only did we never get stuck, but no puzzle required big thinking until the second half of the game, when the introduction of a gravity-based mechanic changes the cards on the table and makes everything newer and more interesting. The excellent level of narration takes care of keeping the player's attention high. Using the pleasant voice of a British-accented external narrator, Thomas Was Alone beautifully tells the story of the gang of wishbones and the feelings of each character, ranging from friendships to rivalries, from loves to a sense of isolation and xenophobia. It must be said that it takes a while before the contours of the plot are outlined, and at the beginning it is not clear which direction the story wants to take. It is curious how in some moments, and especially in the first minutes, the narrative turns into a design narrative, with Danny Wallace's voice describing the mechanics to the player while telling him a story. This is a different expedient from the one seen in Bastion: in this case the narrator's sentences do not depend on the player's actions, but are always activated the same as you move through the level. This does not diminish the result, and indeed the subtle humor and the numerous quotes only involve the player even more. Perhaps the only problem arises if you move too quickly through the environment, in which case you might trigger a new joke before the previous one is finished. It's a real shame that behind such a particular narrative there isn't a platform capable of offering a higher challenge, also because Bithell's ability to define the perfect atmosphere is also evident in the audiovisual realization. While moving squares and rectangles, Thomas Was Alone's graphics are by no means to be considered programmer art, and both the backdrops and the light inside denote an excellent taste on the part of the author. Finally, hats off to the splendid musical accompaniment, thanks to the apt soundtrack composed by David Housden and which goes well with the emotional changes of the characters.", "date": "2012-07-17", "grade": "7.8"}
