{"name": "King of fighters 99 Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/king-of-fighters-99-evolution.html", "text": "A bit of history Every year the TKOF tournament is held, in which teams of talented fighters fight for the title of king of wrestlers, after having passed the various rounds. Oddly enough, every tournament is also a place for strange events, given that behind these tournaments there is always someone, more or less human, who wants to conquer the world: we started with Rugal B. in the '94 edition and then re-proposed in his robotic version a year later (the 1998 version is a special edition without a background story and therefore I do not take it into consideration here), passing through the otherworldly Goenitz (perhaps the strongest enemy of the whole saga!) and Orochi (from the name of Yamata no Orochi, famous demon of Japanese mythology) and his terrible secret power. The story of this edition starts from the clash with Orochi, in which Kyo Kusanagi, protagonist of the series, is kidnapped by the Nests Cartel, an organization that we will certainly know as the tournaments go by (here it is only mentioned at the end). His captor, a certain Kryzalid, from Kyo manages to manufacture a huge number of clones of the Japanese fighter, to be sent all over the planet to subject him, while in the meantime the real Kyo manages to escape. At the same time a new TKOF tournament is announced in which there is a change to the rule or rather to the gameplay: the introduction of the Striker System, which we will discuss in depth later on, which brings the number of members of each of the 7 teams to 4, which add up 2 copies of Kyo, the real Kusanagi (with a brand new suit!), the super cool rival Iori Yagami and (only for Dreamcast and Playstation versions) powered Kryzalid. As expected, there are new entries and defections: Yashiro Nanakase leaves us with his full team, Jeidern (sigh), Vice, Mature, Goro Daimon, Billy Kane and Yamazaki. We welcome the protagonist of this new generation of the saga, K' and all the newcomers such as the robot Maxima, Kim's student, Jhun, Athena's little brother, Baoh, Leona's colleague, Whip (possibly related to Kryzalid ), the boss Kryzalid and the re-entries Kasumi Todo (from the Art of fighting saga) and Xiangfei (from Real Bout 2). Game mechanics Over the course of the various editions, the saga has been able to continuously refine its game structure by breaking down the taboo of pre-packaged teams in principle, then filing the special attacks of the characters that can be used to try to obtain the greatest possible balance after the excellent Kof 96 which has included the hyper moves and reduced the average distance of ranged attacks such as Power Wave, Hishoken and beautiful company without forgetting that during the various tournaments we had the possibility to dodge enemies from the side or by rolling forward. The 1999 edition includes numerous changes to the game mechanics, making it very special like the aforementioned 1996 edition, starting with the main novelty, the Striker system: now that the teams are made up of 4 fighters, the extra fighter is used in the middle of the fight to instantaneous actions that can be offensive, defensive or taunt, but only for a limited number (however variable between 3 and 5). Now it will no longer be possible to choose between the 2 extra and advanced game modes, in favor of a hybrid one in which your super move bar will load based on the cartoons you will take or give, as well as every time you use a special move. The evasive movement of this edition is also a mixture of the roll and the lateral dodge: you can dodge the forward blow or take a step backwards and then attack after a forward jump. As for the offense, the super moves are obtained for the price of the usual super move bar, which becomes a Hyper in case your life energy is running low but this time if you manage to store more super bars you will have the possibility to do unlimited super for about thirty seconds or to have a much better defense and attack for about ten seconds, however losing the possibility of performing super and hyper moves! Obviously there are various changes to the characters, such as Terry who has 2 different Power Waves, Iori who has a new super instead of the immobilizer one, Athena who has short hair, Ralf and Clark who have a slightly different fighting outfit, etc etc. Graphics and sound Even if the original game takes full advantage of the potential of the 16-bit Snk, we must certainly not be satisfied with its perfect conversion and presentation practically the sameale to that of the coin-op, unlike the splendor of the always valid Kof99 Dream Match, only frightens the new buyer more and more who, after having set the options and made his team, takes the field to witness the same operation carried out for the previous Snk release for Dreamcast: the sprites, endowed with a certain charisma and excellent animations (always hyperpumped 16-bit anyway), have remained the same as the coin-op while the backdrops have undergone improvements, despite the always very low resolution: first of all there are a handful of extras but above all they are represented with a convincing 3d effect that gives a certain depth to everything, bringing to mind the good old days of Super Famicom Mode 7 (remember the pipe effect used in Super Castlevania iv?? ?). The music, as always, is really well done, however slightly less than the best of the entire saga, i.e. the 96 and 98 editions, while the selections of digitized voices and sound effects are always excellent, by now highly tested. Extra goodies and conclusions The Dreamcast version has the following new features: three-dimensional graphics for the backdrops, remastered music, immediately selectable Kryzalid as well as Kyo and Iori, ~only strikers~ characters (the new entries Seth and Vanessa, Yamazaki, Chizuru, B. Kane, etc) and the possibility of interacting with the Kof R-2 of the Neo Geo Pocket color, leaving out the always unusable online mode, which can be used by the usual jokers with almond eyes. A solid fighting game as always, whose only flaws lie in the dated graphics and in the fact that Capcom Vs Snk is also around. Kof99 Evolution is always a beautiful fighting game, highly recommended as always to all the otaku of the technical fighting game for autonomoussia of Snk. Pros: Lots of fighters Excellent gameplay Convincing 3d backdrop effect Cons: 16-bit sprites Given the choice, there is only one 2d fighting game around. An annual saga Neo-Geo is a very different console from the others for 2 reasons: the first is that the vast majority of software support comes from its producers, i.e. Snk and the second is that 90% of its games are all one-on-one fighting games ( la Street Fighter to be clear), indeed, they are all gentlemen fighting game!! In fact, CAPtive COMmunication's dominance in the beatem-up sector has been questioned several times by now historic series such as Samurai Spirits, Last Blade and above all Fatal Fury (Garou Densetsu in the East) and The King Of Fighters. Born in the beginning as a spin-off of the (at the time) main sagas of the black beast of the Osaka software house, or Fatal Fury and Art Of Fighting, retaining some of its most characteristic protagonists, KOF has become an annually updated fighting game that little by little stole the most loved and played fighting game title from Street Fighter, just look at the approval ratings of the Japanese Arcades. Since the 1995 edition Snk has also started converting its protg for various consoles and excluding the SD versions for portable machines, the KOF saga is now present on Playstation, Saturn (via expansion cartridge) and Dreamcast That that we are going to analyze now is the ~revised and corrected~ version of the penultimate edition of the saga, that of the year 1999, which after a long wait is finally available for the 128 bit Sega, once again confirming Dreamcast as the best machine dedicated to 2d video games (primarily fighting games).", "date": "2000-11-24", "grade": null}
