This is the big question that has rained down incessantly on producer Naoki Yoshida over the past few months, since hordes of critics have violently lashed out against the choice to harness the series in a formula based on pure action. Is the essence of the saga really in the combat system? It is impossible to say with certainty where his soul resides, because if there was a single answer, Square Enix could never have made mistakes, while the fans would not have formed an intimate relationship with so many adventures so different from each other. There are those who shed tears in front of the romantic epilogue of Tidus' story, there are those who fell in love with the stylized silhouettes of Terra, Celes and Locke, there are those who were bewitched by the thrill of tactical battles against invincible gods, finally there are those who simply love to be lulled by beautiful melodies while exploring breathtaking landscapes. Just like any other fan, Naoki Yoshida has also developed a personal vision of what Final Fantasy should be, with the big difference that, way back in 2015, the CEO of Square Enix - Yosuke Matsuda - knocked decisively on the door of his office and asked him to design a new colossal chapter in the saga. Why bet so much on him? The reason is very simple: while every single episode released in the last seventeen years was punctually overwhelmed by waves of criticism, Final Fantasy 14 instead transformed overnight into the oasis of success that led to the beatification of the figure of Yoshida: for his colleagues he has become a sort of King Midas, for the audience the hero that the series has always needed. Several moons have passed since that investiture, eight long years that have completely changed the face of Creative Business Unit III, i.e. the team of Avengers carefully recruited by Yoshi-P with the aim of accomplishing an impossible feat: bring back the resounding name of Final Fantasy to the glories of a bygone era, reawakening the ancient flame that had been able to imprint the saga in the hearts of millions of people. Composer Masayoshi Soken, combat designer Ryota Suzuki, producer Hiroshi Takai's right-hand man, creatives like Mitsutoshi Gondai and writers of the caliber of Kazutoyo Maehiro: dozens of great masters finally gathered under the banner of this general, accepting without delay the complex mission that was assigned to him. A mission that, however, proved to be very difficult even for such a handful of superheroes. Final Fantasy 16 has in fact proved to be a video game with a double soul, divided between dazzling lights and vast shadows; a work supported by a great artistic inspiration, with a heart that beats in unison with the component of the story, but rooted in a formula whose problems go far beyond the easy target of the combat system. It is the best episode of the series in a long time, it is the scene of an exciting story, it is the cradle of an extraordinary world, but it is still far from the ideal of absolute excellence that should accompany the legacy of the Final Fantasy name. How is it possible that two such different natures manage to coexist in the same project? Find out in our Final Fantasy 16 review. Valisthea's Masterpiece: Game World Valisthea's is the most complex and richest world ever to emerge from the folds of the saga The zero point of the revolution pursued by Yoshida's team lies in the construction of the world of Valisthea, a perfect mechanism in which every single gear has been positioned with maniacal precision. Never, in the entire history of the saga, had a universe so full of details and historical coherence emerged, not even from the confines of the famous Ivalice by Yasumi Matsuno: the continents of Cyclonia and Cineria have centuries of wars, dynasties, heroes behind them , of uses and customs that refine a narrative fresco that is nothing short of enormous, so vast that it has even found a breather in the fabric of the gameplay; if through the Active Time Lore functionality it is possible to suspend the action at any time - even during the movies - to obtain information and small anecdotes dedicated to the elements of the sequence that one is experiencing, there are even characters devoted exclusively to collecting and analysis of the ~lore~, willing to explain in detail the geopolitical map of the emerged lands and to raise the curtain on an immense and interesting information compendium. The starting inspiration, which the work does not try to hide in the slightest, comes from George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire - better known as Game of Thrones - whose raw essence and odark has been translated according to the language of Final Fantasy, exploiting the medieval setting to caress much more thorny issues than the legacy of the series. War, discrimination, immigration and the environmental issue constantly emerge from the murkiest corners of experience, giving back a panorama that doesn't just turn out to be physically violent, but also and above all psychologically. Just think of the mere existence of Bearers, or people who can use magic without the help of Crystals, abominations equated to mere tools that can be killed with impunity, used as pets, tortured for the pure sake of doing it, without no one thinks of lifting a finger, regardless of ties of affection and even those of blood. There is so much lore surrounding Valisthea that there are tools in play to delve into it The looming shadow of death has also been stolen from the cauldron of the Game of Thrones, a somber undertone that accompanies every beat of the adventure. The characters of Final Fantasy 16 are first and foremost people of flesh and blood, and as such they can get sick, be stabbed or crippled at any moment, completely stripping the cast of any perception of the ~plot armor~ typical of the genre. The specter of death spares no one, leading even the positive characters to want to take lives, to chase revenge, to cut throats without hesitation, setting the outlines of the bloodiest instance of Final Fantasy since the brand has been on the market. The real masterstroke, however, lies in the way this dark fantasy vein has been perfectly fitted with the imaginary of the saga, carving out a space tailored for the Eikon, for the Crystals, for magic and even for the Chocobos. The terrifying Shiva who dominates the battlefields from above, Odin's Zantetsuken blade that cuts the skies of the Crystalline Domain in half, the Dragon Knights of Sanbreque. who share the equipment and even the movements of the historic Dragoon job: it never happens to question the magical dimension at the base of Final Fantasy, an atmosphere that constantly fills the player's lungs, whether it is in the form of the immense Mother Crystals at the feet of which the great capitals arise, or in the mantle of an unmistakable Iaguaro who prepares to ambush the protagonists. The great stories are back: plot and characters The characters were built and handled in a masterly way If the world of twin continents is the beating heart of Final Fantasy 16, the stories and characters that move on stage undoubtedly represent its soul. Clive Rosfield is a three-dimensional protagonist, a man who constantly pays dues for his mistakes, constantly forced to grow, evolve and make very heavy compromises, fighting on the front lines to defend what he will slowly learn to believe. But the most interesting thing is that he moves within the confines of a living world, in which the pages of history continue to flow even when he is not present, willingly giving way to different personalities whose character is colored through an apt scale of greys. The absence of the classic party of playable characters is not perceived even for an instant, because the figures who orbit around Clive inherit this role in a masterful way and can take initiatives in total autonomy, exactly as happened to the group of supporting actors introduced in Final Fantasy 14. The very powerful Jill Warrick, the faithful Gav, not to mention Cidolfus Telamon - better known as Cid - a sensational figure to say the least, or even the sparkling Mid: at the moment these names will not tell you anything, but all together they embody perfectly the concept of ~group~ which has become an integral part of the foundation of the series. Only the great exponents of the political chessboard of Valisthea intervene to steal the scene, who incidentally are also the Dominants of the various Eikons, such as the prince of Sanbreque Dion Lesage, who hides the terrible power of Bahamut under his reassuring blond hair, or the ruthless king Barnabas Thalmr, who thanks to Odin's blade managed to unify the entire continent of Cineria; the objective of the narration tightens and widens several times around these figures, unrolling a great choral story involving all the dynasties at the center of the struggle for power. The plot proceeds along a human and political track, then another divine and occult one The story travels along two parallel tracks: the one underlying the purely human affair, governed by greed, desire and the struggle for survival, to which it affianche classic occult path, son of the great JRPG maxim that states: ~You start with a war and you end up fighting against the gods~. It is a story of revenge, maturation and redemption that grows hand in hand with its protagonists, a roller coaster of sequences that become exponentially more spectacular, slowly taking off until exploding in a great pyrotechnic finale. The integrity of the narration cracks only when second nature begins to prevail over the first, or when the deus ex machina intervenes with arrogance in a plot that already worked perfectly in its political and concrete dimension. This happens mainly due to the presence of a rather weak villain, at least when compared to the other opponents who stand in Clive Rosfield's path. The decision to wrap the great puppeteer in a thick blanket of fog weakens the impact of the final escalation, and what is missing is precisely that profound characterization of the ~bad guy~ which has become a real trademark for Creative Business Unit III. leading her to create finished characters at the top of the ratings like the beloved Emet Selch. On the sidelines, some secondary characters, even very well written - such as the matron Isabelle, the innkeeper Martha and many others - could not count on the aesthetic care they deserved, presenting themselves as anonymous NPCs resulting from a cold character editor rather than from the inspired pencils of a character artist. All that said, it's been many, many years since a Final Fantasy chapter has adhered so strongly to the essence of the name ~Final Fantasy~. A heavy structure: rhythm and gameplay The large main dungeons are extremely linear sections The structure of Final Fantasy 16 is very particular: daughter of the decennial experience gained by the development team, it unexpectedly chooses to anchor itself to the architecture that usually supports the great expansions of the fourteenth online chapter. The work alternates very linear sequences with a high adrenaline rate - practically spectacular corridor dungeons manned by hordes of enemies and fierce bosses - with long sections with a more staid breath; small breaks during which a new region is introduced together with its inhabitants, opening windows aimed at dampening the pace of the action to allow the player to devote himself to secondary activities. This pattern continues almost unchanged for the entire duration of the adventure, each time raising the curtain on the new open maps that punctuate the progress of the plot, characterizing fractions of the world before culminating again and again in an explosive main mission. architecture, which fits beautifully into the gears of an MMORPG, is much more difficult to digest in an experience of this kind, because the amount of ~filler~ activity translates into the continuous repetition of filling chapters always anchored to the same nature. You arrive in a new area, meet your local contact, take part in a chain of missions - almost always very trivial ~fetch quests~ that reveal the backstory of the cities - and then slowly arrive at the next big action sequence. The saturation point arrives towards the middle of the adventure, after about thirty-five hours, when one stumbles into long sequences of mandatory missions that take the player to already explored areas in order to find ingredients, collect flowers and carry out a series of tasks that are anything but exciting, even in the climax of the plot. It goes without saying that the pace suffers more than anything else, the salvation of which lies exclusively in the desire to find out what will happen on the plot front. The game world is mostly empty, exploration and side offers are not up to the greats of the past This design philosophy also extends to collateral activities and above all to exploration, the two segments which - not being able to count on the spectacularity of the narration - end up coming out with broken bones. Open maps have little or nothing to offer: you never come across an interesting encounter, a structure that you can enter, a minigame, and in general it is impossible to ~discover~ anything, even if only a interaction or a unique line of dialogue; the regions just exist in silence, as if they were beautiful paintings to look at, without offering a solid reason to mount a Chocobo and ride towards the horizon. On the other hand, they become the theater that hosts the secondary missions - about a hundred reported and guided activities - too often reduced to mere collection quests, often negligible both in terms of storytelling", "date": "2023-06-21", "grade": "8.5"}
