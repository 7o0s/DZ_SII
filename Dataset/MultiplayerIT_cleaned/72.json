Magical Starsign is set in the same universe as Magical Vacation, although it cannot be defined as a true and proper sequel: let's say that the situation, in terms of connections between worlds and narrative structures, is similar to that created for Namco with its Tales of . Your character, of which at the beginning you can choose gender, name and ~direction of magical studies~ in the Light rather than in the Dark, is a student at the Academy of Magic of the planet Kovomaka, very close to five other classmates each paid in the magical study of a natural element, and above all to his teacher, Madeleine, a sorceress apparently distracted, distracted and late, but actually endowed with great powers and a superior knowledge of the magical world. It is precisely this relationship that binds the protagonist, his friends and their teacher to push the boys into the adventure of their life, when Madeleine leaves for the other planets that make up the star system in question to investigate the rather annoying appearance of mysterious and menacing Space Pirates (no, Metroid has nothing to do with it); after three months without any contact, it is clear that something has not gone right, and as soon as they get the chance the faithful pupils leave Kovomaka, destination unknown as soon as they have the opportunity, the faithful pupils leave Kovomaka, destination unknown The holiday continues! From this moment on, the plot will unfold in an extremely linear way, with very few choices which, in any case, are limited to the decision to visit one planet first rather than another, which will have no effect on the script. The narration flows quickly and pleasantly, the dialogues are endowed with a subtle sense of humor also rich in references and quotations and in general the tone remains light for the entire duration of the journey, even though it touches on themes so dear to the authors of JRPG, even of a certain seriousness. To remember an extraordinary moment, the visit to the offices of the Space Police on the planet Puffoon, where the clash with a crass and inefficient bureaucracy immediately reminds us of a similar misadventure of Asterix and Obelix... Although endowed with its qualities, the plot in and of itself however, it suffers from time to time in keeping the player's attention alive because it is basically traditional and a bit ~already seen~, making it effective only in the most successful moments of comedy and drama. In line with the rest of the narrative sector, the characterization of the characters does not detach itself from the stereotypes of the genre that we have seen too many times by now, with the result that the good guys are on average likeable, the bad guys on average unpleasant and so on, and if none of them will give us annoyance during the game, it is also true that we will hardly be able to get excited by a particular speech or gesture. The characterization of the main character then simply does not exist: devoid of dialogues and jokes that are not simply a Yes or a No in occasional events, our alter ego should be the charismatic leader of the group, the most powerful wizard and the most connected to Madeleine, but identification with him/her is frankly impossible, with all the good will! Better than Harry Potter? Together with the script, the other leg on which the skeleton of every JRPG that wants to be respected should rest is the combat system and character growth. Here, in Magical Starsign we see on paper several attempts to bring some new elements: as you can well imagine at this point the clashes with the enemies, some of which will appear with the classic form of random combat fortunately never too frequent, and some on the game screen and therefore potentially avoidable, will be resolved above all with the use of magical arts; another thing that you can deduce from yourself is that all the combat management, as well as that of the menus, is deputed exclusively to the interaction between the stylus and the touch screen, which in a game of this kind, heavily menu-based and with combats in turns, it makes everything much smoother and smoother. The only usefulness of the classic buttons and directional cross is in movement on the map, where in any case you can also choose to use the stylus: which of the two methods is more convenient is up to you to decide, they are both functional and well made. It is the spell system that is more elaborate and where there are more interesting features Better than Harry Potter? It is the magic system that is more elaborate and where there are more interesting features: as anticipated, each character is linked to a natural element according to the classic formula of ~Water beats Fire, which beats Wood...~ and so on, while Dark and Light are each otherweak relative to each other. However, the strength of each element is also influenced by the position of the respective planet in the star system: each of the five planets present is in fact linked to an element exactly like the characters, and has its own beautiful movement of revolution around the star, which goes on in real time (later you will also acquire the ability to influence this movement); since the system is divided into five segments, each of which is also characterized by an element, when a planet is found in the corresponding segment, the spells of that type will be considerably more powerful. Same thing for the Light or Dark characters, only here their strength will be influenced by the classic alternation between day and night. You will then be able to arrange, both before and during the fight, the characters of your party, which will have a maximum formation of six elements, in two rows: those in the front row will also have a physical attack available and their offense will be concentrated on a single character, with greater damage, but will also be more exposed to enemy attacks; vice versa, the characters in the rear will be able to count only on the spells that will have an effect, the offensive ones such as the defensive, recovery or enhancement ones, on all the members of the opposing or allied party, however having more limited effects. Of course, they will also be less affected by opponents' attacks. Adding to all this classic options such as the ability to use items, escape, defense and the evergreen equipment, and the fact that all characters can learn by growing up to five unique spells for each, it would seem that the elements for a tactical depth- important strategic there are all, but unfortunately it is not like this: in fact with the passing of the levels, which takes place on a completely canonical basis, one of the parameters that rises is the number of magic points recovered at each turn; soon you will recover at each turn a number of points such as to be able to use the basic offensive spell indefinitely, which in 99% of cases is sufficient to remove any opposition in a few seconds, making the vast majority of clashes an operation simple and boring routine. However, a small Action element in the clashes should be noted, perhaps inspired by Paper Mario: by touching the character at the right time both in the offensive and defensive phase, you can increase the effectiveness of the action; nice, but completely useless to revive the fortunes of a well thought out but poorly implemented combat system. Draw me an egg The picture closes, however rich, a multiplayer mode for up to six players who will be able to face the dungeons of the single-player mode together: all the objects and experience gained in this way can then be kept in the main mode. Furthermore, a special Tag Mode will allow you to breed and grow curious eggs, which can then be of great help during single-player fights. None of these aids proves to be indispensable when you play alone, as as already mentioned, the game is too simple even without them, but their presence is still an extra element. On the one hand we can't help but notice that precisely in the light that multiplayer assumes in MS, the implementation of the Wi Fi Connection would have been very welcome, because many more players than it actually will be could have enjoyed the supplementary features that the game in company makes available. Only positive notes from the graphic side: the Brownie Browns confirm their artistic skills of the highest level and the worlds of Magical Starsign come to life in a riot of colors now very lively, now pastels, of well-kept designs and each with a particular style related to the specific atmosphere that we wanted to give to the particular planet, of delightful anime-style characters, of graphic effects linked to spells that are always effective and sometimes impressive, and in general of a remarkable cleanliness and fluidity. Only positive notes on the graphic side: Brownie Brown confirm their artistic skills of the highest level Draw me an egg It doesn't matter if in the end you realize that, apart from rare occasions where the sprites on the screen are numerous and the engine doesn't miss a beat, there's nothing you haven't already seen on Game Boy Advance perhaps by the same BB, because what you will see on the two screens of the DS will impress you not for the technique but for its refined and ~fairy-tale~ style. There are also several scenes in Computer Graphics, technically comparable to something superior to what was seen at the time of the PlayStation and well directed directorially: in short, nothing exceptional at an absolute level, but on alaptop always have their effect. The same cannot be said of the sound department: the music is also pleasant and also skilfully linked to the theme of the planet on which we find ourselves or to the particular moment of the plot, but they are short and end up being repetitive, while the sound effects do not scream at any miracle. A final note, and maybe even instructive for xenophiles at any cost, goes to the Italian translation. As always it is impeccable in syntax and spelling, and the best possible in terms of fluency and pleasure of writing. However, if a character, however cute and likeable, called Roasted Chestnuts had already put us on the alert for a moment, we literally could not believe our eyes when a bad guy appeared in front of us, but one of those bad guys, and he introduced himself with the name by Maestro Bietolone! But can a villain of this kind be called Bietolone? We then went to investigate and discovered that in the American version the villain in question is named Master Chard. What does Chard mean in English? Very good, just chard! Amazed, we then went to look for the equivalent of Roasted Chestnuts, and what did we find? That the name is exactly the same, in Italian! At this point, incredulous and resigned, we gave up on discovering the English name of another end-of-the-world bad guy, the perfidious and very cruel Green Cauliflower! Together with the dutiful and by now usual compliments to the best localization team in history, this time also an apology for having thought badly of them: the problem, evidently, lies upstream Ultimately endowed with two souls, one traditional and conservative and the other more innovative, Magical Starsign ends up ruining everything by presenting a solid system but not enough to make it memorable, and watering down all its more unusual features with fights that are too easy ones that often and willingly make useless all the particular strategies that even the NPCs suggest at every turn. In short, it fails to stand out in a landscape of JRPGs for DS that is starting to get quite crowded and full of cumbersome names. However, the arrows in the bow of the Nintendo product are numerous, starting from the delightful graphics, continuing with the classy humor and ending with a fruition that is still pleasant, even if it often encroaches on repetitiveness. Its linearity makes it suitable for those who want to enter the world of Japanese role-playing games without excessive trauma, and for all fanatics of the genre who do not want to miss a title, ultimately, of good quality. Pros Beautiful graphics Some excellent ideas Sense of humor Generally solid Cons Linear and repetitive Fights are routine Poor Bietolone still cries for revenge Brownie Brown is a team that broke away from Mamma Square and joined Nintendo when things between the two majors weren't exactly going very well, and the fact that Grande Enne was immediately able to take advantage of it led to think that soon the then two flagships, GameCube and GBA, would have been inundated with Japanese-style RPGs capable of competing with the greatest productions of the house of Final Fantasy and its sister novel Enix. Things didn't go exactly like this: first of all, the BBs never dedicated themselves to the living room console, preferring portable hardware, but above all the titles produced did not quite live up to expectations. Magical Vacation was too traditional a title to stand out in the crowd, even with its undoubted qualities, and was never released outside of Japan, while Sword of Mana did not do justice to the seminal Game Boy Action RPG of which it was the remake, that Seiken Densetsu of which we can never stop singing the praises. However, interesting things could be glimpsed, such as an out of the ordinary artistic ability, capable of reproducing in a majestic 2D all the atmospheres, the colors, the drawings of the best illustrations of the fairytale books, and a knowledge of the genre, its mechanics and of its features, second to none. Perhaps what was missing for the team to take off completely was just a little push, perhaps innovative and versatile hardware", "date": "2007-02-23", "grade": null}
