The latter strongly bored the previous chapter, Unity, which arrived in stores with various inconsistencies and problems that undermined the real heart of the experience: certainly not on par with the best chapters - our favorites are those with Ezio Auditore - but still enjoyable and fun. For Assassin's Creed Syndicate Ubisoft has decided to change register, taking a step back in terms of the size of the work and eliminating the online component, relegated to integration with the Ubisoft Club - formerly Uplay - and to some community events that appear on the game map . The title arrived in the editorial office well in advance and as early as last week we were able to download the cumulative patch 1.11, aimed at solving most of the bugs that could have influenced the adventure of the Frye twins. In this regard, there is only one criticism to be leveled at the French-Canadian developer, that of having postponed the PC edition by almost a month. The intent was certainly not to repeat the mistakes made in the past, but at this point we expect to be able to play a version capable of enhancing the beautiful setting offered even more, thanks to the greater computing power available. No more talk, however: we have completed Assassin's Creed Syndicate together with a good amount of extras and, after a couple of nights of reflection, we are therefore ready to express the definitive judgment on this chapter, for a saga destined as always to leave the sign, for better or for worse. After dozens of hours spent in London, here is our verdict on Assassin's Creed Syndicate nothing is real, everything is permitted This time we find ourselves in Victorian London of the mid-1800s, which is the backdrop to the millennial dualism between Assassins and Templars with references to the future and to the initiates, to Abstergo and to characters already seen in previous episodes. The gameplay of the title, however, is practically entirely concentrated on the historical period chosen by the developers: Queen Victoria is the ruler, but the hands on the city are those of Crawford Starrick, a templar who created a dense network of activities that guaranteed him the complete control, starting with the economic and political system. Obviously unscrupulous, to the point of exploiting even the children of the less well-off classes in factories and putting the entire population in check. An unsustainable situation for the order of the Assassins, which includes the twins Jacob and Evie Frye, who after a brief introductory parenthesis decide to reach the future capital of the United Kingdom to stir things up and put an end to this tyranny. Jacob and Evie, therefore, equipped with two different attitudes that will be reflected in the types of missions available: Jacob is mainly interested in reconquering the city, at the cost of facing the Blighters - the criminal gangs who control it in the field - and Starrick himself; he is a bit of a braggart and for this reason he decides to form the Rooks group, to help him in his intent. Even if the ultimate goal is shared, Evie instead wants to follow her father's teachings, acting in the shadows and looking for the fruit of Eden sighted in the city, together with the Shroud which seems to have supernatural powers. These different attitudes will be reflected as mentioned in the course of the adventure, both in narrative terms and in the types of exclusive missions available to each. Now, in an atypical way compared to our other reviews, let's start right from the setting that is the background to the events of the game. A real feast for the eyes: this time the developers within Ubisoft have outdone themselves, not so much on a purely graphic front, but above all for the artistic choices made in order to reproduce the Victorian historical period. Each district of London has a different and believable visual language, from the suburbs of Whitechapel to regal Westminster, passing through the River Thames and other districts. The extension of the map is important and the streets are teeming with people, street details, buildings, signs; in every corner there is a different glimpse, and the level of attention used really allows to obtain an enviable visual variety even in the interiors, actually present in fewer numbers than in Unity. The panorama to be admired is sealways wonderful, and the different times of the day and the weather conditions enhance it considerably. We have sunrise and sunset, rain with the sun or at night, fog, good weather or cloudy; a series of filters - if we want to call them that - capable of returning a soft and ~enveloping~ image: this mastery of use reminded us of inFAMOUS: Second Son, in this case with a decidedly superior map and detail. Some duty on the console is paid, however, in the form of uploads that last several seconds during the rapid journey, and of a frame rate that is not always stable, especially in numerically excited situations or in which one runs in a carriage at sustained speed: in these junctures we opted for a rather accentuated blur, which depending on personal sensitivity can be annoying or not. The musical sector follows the great quality of the technical one, proposing arranged old glories, such as the main theme of the series - made famous in the version dedicated to Ezio Auditore - and new songs perfectly integrated into the Victorian setting. Particularly successful is the motif dedicated to the phases of combat / discovery by the opponents, made with fine use of the cello and extremely catchy. The game is obviously dubbed in Italian, with unpublished interpreters or performers heard several times in other productions, fairly well done on a technical and acting level; worth mentioning is the possibility of independently managing the subtitles, the language of the texts and that of the dubbing, for the combination that best suits you. To close the technical discussion, and the one strictly related to the bugs, during our review phase, made up of over 20 hours, we ran into a situation in which the characters were invisible during an interlude sequence, another where the carriage it's ~stuck~ in a wall forcing the mission to restart, and little else, nothing that compromised our experience. We will return to artificial intelligence problems later in this article. Playstation 4 trophies Assassin's Creed Syndicate offers 50 trophies, obviously linked to the completion of all the sequences, a certain number of upgrades brought home, unlocked skills and so on. You must then maximize all levels of loyalty with allies, conquer all districts of London and perform a certain number of killings of various kinds. Dulcis in fundo, the collectibles: getting platinum in the Ubisoft game takes time, but it's not particularly difficult. Long live the Rooks! The moment the protagonists arrive in London, you have access to the entire game map, in which initially there are sections where the opponents are more difficult to face, practically insurmountable in conquest missions. Each district is divided into zones controlled by the Blighters, and among the purposes offered by the title is to conquer them one by one to obtain complete control and less ~ruptures~ when there is wandering around the street. In this context we have the presence of key allied characters for Jacob and Frye, who insert themselves into the narrative flow and require the two protagonists to carry out some actions aimed at conquering the neighborhood. They tend to be of four types of objectives, for as many allies: Henry Green needs the elimination of all the opponents of the Blighters stronghold, together with their leader; Clara O'Dea to liberate children from factories; Sergeant Abberline to capture some wanted people alive or dead. For each activity completed, the level of loyalty of the character who commissioned it increases; there are five of each, and they carry a bonus in the form of blueprints, weapons and equipment. Once the neighborhood has been freed in its entirety, the war between the gangs is unlocked, or a brawl between the two factions which ends with the challenge to the boss who commands the opposing one. This substrate dedicated to factions allows you to obtain a strategic advantage while navigating the map, with the Rooks increasingly present in the city up to the possibility of calling up to five of them for help, by pressing the R1 key. Linked to this aspect is the enhancement of the band itself: at the cost of pounds and materials, which are obtained from chests or during missions, it is possible to activate a good amount of perks from a special menu, starting from the enhancement of the level of the own allies or the entry of brutes and assassins into the gang, up to the appearance of more ~friendly~ carriages, discounts on purchases and more to increase your income. The help of the Rooks and some of their upgrades make the situation much easier, in a Thuco which has never shone for the high level of challenge; on the other hand they manage to reproduce that sense of involvement and constant removal of London from the hands of Crawford Starrick. The nerve center of operations is represented by a train that must initially be conquered and then moves constantly between the rails of London; inside there is the safe for the aforementioned annuity, and some notice boards, most of which are accessible at any time from the options. We must say that the use of the train is rather weak and uninteresting: the times of Monteriggioni and the Kenway estate are long gone, the Rooks' train is of little use and the dedicated missions are three in number, with the last one, in which it is necessary repel the onslaught of the Blighters with a Hatling machine gun, which clearly highlights a certain disconnect between the beauty of the graphics engine and its integration with the gameplay. Assassin's Creed Syndicate, in fact, ~fails~ when it tries to offer more engaging and spectacular moments - present in any case to a reduced extent - because the game world reacts little compared to what the protagonists do or the narration proposes. Apart from people running away and screaming, practically nothing happens, and the same characters, when they run out of dialogue or the mission, behave as if they were ordinary inhabitants, breaking the atmosphere a little and undergoing identical treatment by the artificial intelligence. Same music for example when there is an explosion or an escape, during which the characters can ~get caught~ in the inhabitants and it really seems to be dealing with two different levels of interaction. And again, we have dialogues that are interrupted if you are too quick to bring a character to their destination, or if you are ~distracted~ during a kidnapping; long-standing problems related to artificial intelligence that are also reflected in the stealth phases and in the identification by enemies. Which, when required by the plot, are activated at a sidereal distance, but usually remain helpless even if a fight made of screams and many good noisy slashes has just taken place around the corner. Ubisoft seems to have completely given up on making this aspect of the game credible, and this is also seen in the fact that now practically all missions can be tackled with fisticuffs or killings without discretion. Inclination that translates into greater freedom of approach, God forbid, but missions are often solved much faster using the first mode, also because the control system continues to be based on the timing of the counterattack with the circle and on avoiding gunshots / rifle with triangle, dancing from one opponent to another even with combos that can well exceed one hundred consecutive shots. Precisely for this reason they remain fun, like a rhythm game or titles like Batman, but you just need to have a minimum of timing, perhaps improve your characters, to reduce the sense of challenge to practically zero. Curiosity Is it possible to play Syndicate after finishing the main storyline? Absolutely yes, among other things, some new missions dedicated to a historical character are unlocked Is it possible to use multiple save slots? No, just one per profile, like for Unity Is it possible to disable the interface completely? Yes, in the options it is possible to deactivate all the overlays and also the tracking system for the carriages, beyond the selected points to reach What are microtransactions for? Tendency to buy materials, Helix credits or money, if you don't want to collect them during the game and unlock everything almost immediately. During our review we didn't feel the need to, and completed the game by unlocking almost everything via in-game collection. The Frye twins Jacob and Evie have a level that increases by spending skill tokens, acquired for every 1000 experience points derived from kills and completed missions. Most of the upgrades are identical for both, except for the advanced ones which for Jacob favor hand-to-hand and weapon skills, for Evie stealth. As you can imagine they allow for example the increase of the resistance and the energy bar, a wider window for the counterattack and greater precision with the guns. The equipment includes the offensive weapon, the belt, the cloak and the dress, to arrive at the inevitable ~gadgets~ such as firearms - only pistols - and knives, hallucinogenic darts and finally two types of bombs, with the unprecedented voltaics which immobilize enemies. They are obtained by spending precious pounds or by producing them, thanks to four types of materials that, as mentioned, are collected", "date": "2015-10-22", "grade": "7.8"}
