{"name": "Syberia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syberia.html", "text": "The final verdict As promised, they have given us an immersive virtual experience, both realistic and escapist, with a very compelling storyline, which ranges from the fate of an ancient prehistoric civilization and the extinction of mammoths to the problems of modern life, up to even touching on cyberpunk themes such as the man-machine relationship. Touching and original is above all the story of the Voralberg family, which acts as a common thread between the events of the game: through old photos, diaries, newspaper clippings and personal objects collected during our journey, we will reconstruct the life of the brothers Anna and Hans, marked by a tragic accident and inextricably linked to the automaton and toy factory that our heroine Kate's customer is determined to buy. In fact, we could say that the true protagonist of this adventure is Hans, the brilliant creator of the fantastic machines that populate all the game's settings, as well as the man we are looking for as the only heir to the family business. Kate, the lawyer that the player finds himself impersonating, is actually just a spectator of the exciting story of this man who dedicated his life to chasing a dream... and it will be up to you to find out which one! Summing up There are many improvements compared to the beta: the graphics now appear in all their splendor, highlighted by even more fluid movies and animations, the characters and three-dimensional objects move on the highly detailed 2D backdrops with the utmost naturalness. The title and the main menu have been completed: finally, in addition to starting a new game or loading one in progress, it is possible to view the movies and access the game options, to change the level of detail and color depth to your liking , adjust the volume of music and sound effects or turn on subtitles. The finishing touches have also been given to the point-and-click interface and inventory, which offer a perfect synthesis of elegance and functionality. I had already mentioned the remarkable contribution of the musical commentary and the realistic sound effects, but it is appropriate to add that the Italian version of the game has been translated and dubbed splendidly: for once, the localized dialogues have nothing to envy to those of the original version that I tested last month and Italian players will be able to enjoy them in all their irony and smoothness. In short, Syberia is a pleasure to listen to and to watch: it is one of those rare adventures that must be played enjoying every detail, because there are few games so well done! Summing up I had already described the game mechanics in great detail, illustrating the nature of the puzzles encountered in the beta version and explaining that Microds and Sokal have set out to make Syberia attractive to both beginners and more experienced players, certainly not an easy task! In fact, I must admit that as the adventure progressed I also came across some relatively tough puzzles. The puzzles are quite varied and push the player to skillfully dose action, dialogue and reasoning. The solution is always logical and it's difficult to find yourself stuck without knowing where to hit your head - the only risk of getting stuck is when you leave out key objects for solving a puzzle. You will hardly get tired of Syberia before completing it: you don't die and you can't make irreparable mistakes, which avoids unnecessary frustration. You will never get tired of the automatons and ingenious inventions of the Voralbergs, on which most of the puzzles are based: it is impossible to resist the temptation to discover their functioning and history, to understand all their secrets to reach the next stage of this journey as mysterious as it is fascinating. In general, the level of difficulty is very well calibrated and the pace of the game is sustained throughout the duration of the adventure, always keeping us glued to the screen with increasingly bizarre gadgets, new characters and places to exploration, unexpected plot twists, and spectacular cutscenes. To go where no adventure has gone before In conclusion, considering the impeccable technical realization, the satisfying puzzles, the originality and variety of the settings, the suggestive atmospheres and the engaging plot, I will ventureand to define Syberia as an ~old-fashioned~ adventure, but dressed in the best technologies of the moment: in short, it is an ideal partnership between the old and the new, which evokes the flavor of an unjustly forgotten genre, respecting the needs of practicality and innovation of the most current games. As an avid consumer of adventures of all kinds, traditional or not, I can say with some satisfaction that I played Syberia convulsively from start to finish, never getting tired and never finding a single element or a single conversation out of place. I therefore warmly recommend it to everyone: to the most nostalgic adventurers, tired of the substitutes that have been foisted on us in recent years, as well as to younger players or in any case to those who have never been able to fully appreciate adventures, precisely because lately they had lost sight of the ingredients that had brought them to success in the years of the best Lucas and Sierra titles! The final verdict After a long gestation, Syberia has finally appeared on the shelves of the Bel Paese, a much awaited and much celebrated adventure (even by myself). Following the special dedicated to the first tests on a beta version, many of you will have the idea that this game had the right numbers to attract the attention of any adventurer who survived the near-total extinction of his favorite genre - anyone who falls into this category. category and has not yet read it is warmly invited to do so, because in this article I will limit myself to sum up what was written previously. In fact, I ended my enthusiastic preview holding back from crying out for a miracle, waiting to get my hands on the final version of the game: now that I finally had the opportunity, I feel free to cry out that the miracle happened and how! I can confirm that Microds and the brilliant Belgian artist Benot Sokal have actually succeeded in the arduous task of ~rehabilitating~ the graphic adventure genre, indecorously neglected and mistreated in recent years.", "date": "2002-06-28", "grade": null}
