{"name": "Da Disgaea a Dark Stalker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71658-cross-edge-da-disgaea-a-dark-stalker.html", "text": "Given the semi-shortage of ~Japanese-style~ RPGs of a certain level in our parts on PlayStation 3, there is always a certain expectation among enthusiasts when a title of this kind is announced for the western market. And if behind a production of this type there are teams of the caliber of Capcom, Nippon Ichi, Namco Bandai, Gust and Idea Factory, developers and producers of RPGs of a certain level in the past, it is logical that this expectation mounts more and more among the public. It therefore appears evident that for the game that we are about to deal with a little late, Cross Edge, a classic turn-based JRPG, there were certain expectations, perhaps even too many compared to what probably were and are the very objectives of the product and the its creators. In our opinion, the main peculiarity of the title in question is the presence of characters taken from other famous video game series. From Disgaea to Dark Stalker, passing through Artonelico, Spectral Souls, Atelier Marie and Mana-Khemia 2, there are several heroes available in this production such as Lilith, Morrigan, Marie and Prinny just to name a few. While for all the rest there is little to add if we exclude a traditional gameplay and a rather sparse and linear plot which serves as a pretext more than anything else to justify the presence of the aforementioned characters within the universe in which the title is set and to accompany the gamer throughout his experience. Stolen souls The story behind the adventure mainly revolves around the figures of the two protagonists, Miko and York, who from their reality are catapulted into a crazy dream world where they meet characters from other places (and games) as well as a strange girl who tells them that she was waiting for them to help her stop the dark threat that hangs over them... And here we stop so as not to spoil too much. To complete the thankless task, however, our friends will be able to count on the help of various and strange heroes that they will meet during their journey and who are linked to the places explored. Most of the latter recall the games mentioned above as settings. The game structure, as we mentioned earlier, is typical of the genre. You must explore cities, non-urban areas, dungeons and various locations in search of clues and items useful for continuing the adventure. In this case the exploration assumes the typical canons of the platform, with a side view that follows the characters made in anime style in their movements according to a two-dimensional game mechanic. In the most dangerous areas there are numerous enemies who attack the party of heroes thanks to the more classic pattern of random encounters. In short, nothing that has not already been seen and often appreciated in other products of this kind. The problem with Cross Edge, however, is that compared to the aforementioned titles it presents a rather considerable difficulty in managing the party and the characters. The game interface is in fact one of the negative elements of the product, at least if seen from the point of view of the average user, given the excessive presence on the screen of parameters, bars to fill, icons and writings of various types to keep under control often in the fundamental phases of a fight and a ~not friendly~ inventory management system characterized by many menus and submenus, which makes even the simplest discarding an object from the list of Items and the like annoying. Positives Paradoxically however, where Cross Edge shows obvious gaps at the same time, on a more in-depth analysis and from the enthusiast's point of view it probably also gives its best: the game's battle system proves to be more than valid by carefully mixing game rounds and a wide range of attacks and spells combined with devastating combos. In short, the in-game battle phases themselves are dynamic and engaging, which reduces the feeling of frustration that one feels in having to manage twelve thousand parameters. The player must place his party members on a grid, some in front and some behind. The choice of how to arrange your companions depends on various factors related to the skills of each character (type of attack, range and equipped weapons in particular) and the enemy. Each action requires a certain number of special points to be performed: they are available to the various PCs at the beginning of each turn and are linked to their learning level, the clothes worn, the weapons, etc. These points can also be set aside if desired, in order to be used in subsequent rounds. By performing blows in a certain order with one's own elements of the group, one can also perform blowsspecial moves that can be linked together in a series of terrifying combos. Once the opponents have been defeated, you can then obtain, among other things, also Special Points which are then used in future battles precisely to launch the powerful blows mentioned above. The possibilities offered by this system are really many. It is obvious that such a battle management mechanic, the menus we mentioned above and the PCs requires a certain patience and passion on the part of gamers, who will be busy juggling single attacks, positioning, spells, countdowns, combos and so on has more to put. Playstation 3 trophies Cross Edge offers the player 24 Trophies of which 5 are bronze, 11 silver, 7 gold and 1 platinum. They are obtainable as always upon completion of particular events or implementation of certain requests of the game. For example by performing a 400 hit combo or defeating a certain number of enemy units or finding 150 hidden objects, etc. To receive the Platinum one called Crossover Conquest it is necessary to obtain all the Gold, Silver and Bronze Trophies. Quality two-dimensional As far as the technical sector is concerned, we are faced with a rather atypical production compared to current standards. For the visual realization of the title, the developers' choice fell on a graphic engine that mixes elements in fake 3D with other two-dimensional ones (characters and monsters). The decision, which we consider appropriate given the context, was probably partly determined by the type of characters selected for the story, all coming from video game series characterized by a certain anime style. The graphics are thus very clean and detailed, with beautiful avatars and very lively colors. Ditto the animations which, although not complex for obvious reasons, are all in all well made and suitable for the context. For the audio, on the other hand, there is the presence of dialogues, which take place through static screens in which the drawn figures of the various characters appear, dubbed in English (and Japanese) and the text of the speech (also in English), and sound effects which, although within the norm, manage to perform their task well. Finally, the soundtrack is good which in principle is appropriate to the product and in which the opening theme created by Haruka Shimotsuki entitled ~Blade of Tears~ stands out.", "date": "2010-02-08", "grade": "6.5"}
