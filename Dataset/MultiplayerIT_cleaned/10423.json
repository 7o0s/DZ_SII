{"name": "House of Ashes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-dark-pictures-house-of-ashes-recensione.html", "text": "The Twin Towers have been collapsing for just two years. The conflict in Iraq is rampant and US special forces are on the trail of Saddam's chemical weapons stockpile. However, what lurks underground should really scare you, where conflict doesn't even exist and the history of the first civilizations unfolds. For the third chapter of the Dark Pictures Anthology, the guys from Supermassive Games have raised the bar, trying to tell a dark moment of our recent past, going fishing in the recesses of the legends of millennia ago. Without distorting a style that is characterizing an experiment particular and courageous like this horror anthology, The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes at the same time tries to put its feet down and seek a narrative substance totally absent in Men of Medan and feeble in the discreet Little Hope. House of Ashes is a chapter that will divide fans, which will also know how to displace thanks to a total upheaval present in the final phase, but which certainly brings a little more courage from the team. It represents that turning point of the anthology that could make a change, or bury it forever. Let's find out why in our review of The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes. A curse from the past House of Ashes: the architecture of the past It is now clear to everyone that the guys from Supermassive are great fans of a certain type of cinema. The attention paid to the more or less rampant quotationism has always been the basis of their projects. After a very successful teen horror and the first two chapters of the anthology, this time the team takes us into the Mesopotamian and Sumerian legends, staging the best plot of the series up to now. In 2003, US special forces find themselves in full enemy territory, in today's Iraq. A group of soldiers led by officer Rachel King is awaiting developments regarding a satellite system capable of silently intercepting the enemy. Rachel has been married for years to Eric, chief designer of the Kletus system and colonel visiting Iraq to take over the operation and wipe out Saddam Hussein's stockpile of chemical weapons. On the other side of the fence, soldier Salim is about to celebrate his son's birthday, ready to give up his uniform even for just one day, except to be called directly by his captain to take part in a sortie to intercept and defeat the US attack. Something goes wrong, there is no trace of Saddam's weapons and a settling of the ground plunges both factions into the bowels of the earth. Difficult to understand where you are, except to recognize the ruins of an ancient temple, probably of Sumerian origin. We have deliberately avoided telling you the prologue of the adventure itself, set several millennia ago, so as to leave room for the imagination and what the group of protagonists will be called to face. In the four or five hours necessary to conclude a single passage in history, House of Ashes will be able to capture the taste of a certain type of enthusiast. The contrast between the futility of today's war and something greater and unknowable that comes from the past is the basis of a successful and certainly more mature plot than the previous ones. We are certainly not talking about a title that will change the fortunes of the medium, but House of Ashes knows how to entertain with the right amount of action and fascinate with a staging and some touches of great class, which culminates in a final phase so close to the atmospheres of Alien and Prometheus, which for the writer was as positive as it was alienating. Gameplay what? House of Ashes: descending into the bowels of the desert can be more dangerous than expected It's almost trivial to say that anyone who buys a Supermassive title for a great gameplay experience is clearly going completely off track. Despite this, House of Ashes implements a free camera for the first time, a fundamental prerogative of the dark setting that forms the backdrop to the story. It is no coincidence that the protagonists can now move freely, even turning on and off a torch which is used to make their way through the ruins of the temple. Although in our opinion the choice turns out to be prudent and almost obligatory, it is also true that the control system remains wooden and plagued by a delay in the response of the models to our inputs, which in some situations generates a pinch of discomfort and the breaking of the 'identification. The same happens due to a really too invasive screen interface during QTEs, which would require a refresh, or at least the possibility of modifying and reducing the size and design of the interaction elements. houseand of Ashes: Eric is a multifaceted character full of problems On the other hand, compared to the past, the game immediately appears more fluid in the presentation of events and the continuous change of point of view between the characters - which for some could be chaotic and difficult to digest - is precisely the aspect we have most appreciated, able to always keep the rhythm at a more than sufficient level. The usual collectibles take care of the usual collectibles: mysteries to discover here and there for the map, as well as tablets through which to undergo the inevitable premonitions. In short, nothing new under the sun from the point of view of content, but we are also talking about a type of adventure that does not leave much to chance and which is exhausted in its desire to tell a story, however successful it may be. Difficult relationships House of Ashes: there are poignant moments House of Ashes, for the first time in the series, uses war to put us in charge of different factions. It is precisely in analyzing the relationships between the five protagonists that one digs into the psychology of the characters in a much better way than in the past. This does not exclude some choices and reactions that clash with immersion, but the whole gives off a much more inviting smell than what happened in Little Hope and, above all, in Men of Medan. It is difficult to tell you about interpersonal relationships without ruining elements of a game that bases everything on storytelling and plotting, so we will limit ourselves to telling you that never like this time in the Dark Pictures Anthology have we become attached to and hate some protagonists, thus ending up make difficult choices, sometimes necessary for the common good. As always, there are several endings and it will be possible to reach the end by saving everyone or nobody, leaving the player with the ability and willingness to play with the lives of the five unfortunates. To give you an idea of our journey, we can tell you that we have reached the end credits with three characters still safe and with a fourth perishing right in the very last bars in a heroic and poignant way. Technical aspect House of Ashes: Towards the finale things get really dark House of Ashes picks up exactly where Little Hope closed its doors. The technical skills of the Supermassive guys continue to be spent largely on the reproduction of models faithful to the originals, inserting a Hollywood actor as always. This time it was the turn of Ashley Tisdale, hired to take the features of the female protagonist Rachel, but failing to outclass the others, indeed remaining on the sidelines and limiting herself too often to go with the flow. In general, House of Ashes is present more than well on PS5 - where we played it - not always fully convincing in the textures and interiors of the aseptic cave, but giving its best in the final stages, when even the artistic flair of the creatives managed to stand out in the settings, clearly outclassing the previous chapters. The sound and the mix are good, with an Italian dubbing certainly improved compared to the past. Net of some imperfect cutting and some totally erroneous intentions in the voices, House of Ashes is also enjoyable in our language, without prejudice to the advice to experience it in English, so as to better grasp the acting of the actors.", "date": "2021-10-21", "grade": "7.8"}
