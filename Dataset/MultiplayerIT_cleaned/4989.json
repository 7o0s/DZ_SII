From a genre relegated to portable consoles and almost disappeared from the market, this particular type of video game has become a bulwark of the independent world, a perfect combination of depth and fun chosen by many young software houses to demonstrate their skills - also by virtue of the fairly limited costs at the development level. With a myriad of long-standing players abstinent from Metroid and Castlevania, and Kickstarter acting as a bridge, its rebirth was therefore rapid and very rich; all despite the structural complexity that made it approachable only by the most talented of indie programmers. After surprises such as Axiom Verge, Ori and the Blind Forest and Valdis Story, however, we haven't seen quality metroidvanias for a while, at least until Hollow Knight, a project created by Australian Team Cherry, appeared. And believe us when we tell you that today's title can easily be compared to the names just mentioned, because - after throwing ourselves into the project with average expectations - we came away from the experience amazed and with quite a few scars. Hollow Knight is a real surprise: don't ignore it just because there's no shortage of gamers this year Insects and darkness Hollow Knight is not a crystalline plot, on the contrary it is as gloomy as the game world: a dark and inhospitable place inhabited by anthropomorphic insects, unmentionable monstrosities, and mysterious forces that govern existence. You, here, play a small silent warrior, ready to venture into the maze of Hallownest (this is the name of the kingdom in which it all takes place) for who knows what reason. Clearly there is a reason for your raids, but don't expect a typical narrative from the Team Cherry game: Hollow Knight is full of clues, colorful characters and fascinating moments, which must be collected and revealed from time to time as if they were objects to be discovered. Putting the puzzle together will not be a walk in the park, yet once done we assure you that it will not fail to give you great satisfaction. Pleasures that, to be honest, also derive largely from the gameplay of the title, since we are not dealing with a common metroidvania. Once you start exploring Hallownest you will immediately realize that you are unaware not only of your identity, but also of the map, which will have to be collected in pieces by a peculiar character with a passion for travel and will be updated gradually as soon as rares are reached benches where you can rest (stickers to buy in a small shop in the initial village allow you to indicate important shops and areas). This is certainly not a common feature for a game that makes the complexity of the maps one of its main qualities, but it is clearly designed to increase the player's anguish as he explores, and make his wanderings more meaningful. You could seriously spend dozens of minutes in an area and even get to its boss without finding the map vendor, so it's always a good idea to stop and look around to avoid any nasty surprises. Lost in the immense Indeed, the choice to manage exploration in this way is both the strong point and the worst flaw of Hollow Knight. Let's explain ourselves better: while we understand that this is a design choice, necessary in order not to make the player sit on his laurels and keep the adrenaline high when reaching new locations, the developers could have worked a little better on shortcuts and navigability of the game world. The collection of the movement maneuvers necessary to fully explore the global map (it is still a metroidvania, so expect many areas that are unreachable initially without the right powers) is very slow, and the various settings are not only extensive but often labyrinthine and full of enemies; getting from one point to another can be a long and tedious operation, and zones that allow you to use rapid transport are even rarer than refreshment zones - which are also the game's save points. We therefore find ourselves having to do more backtracking than normal, even in a genre where backtracking is essential, with a considerable weight on the overall rhythm. It is fortunate that the rest of the title is truly excellent, because at least this lack takes a back seat in front of an impressive mass of quality, starting with the excellent management of combat and progress. The first, predictably, is very simple, and starts with our alter ego barely able to give a few trips with the help of a nail-sword, and to hop around. Advancing, however, various maneuvers are obtained, from charged shots to super shots, passing through a sort of spiritual Hadouken andfor a slow heal (both usable by draining soul from affected enemies). Overall, therefore, we find ourselves with various tools available, all of which are very important to get the better of the fierce enemies of the game. The mosquito and the light On the other hand, the difficulty always remains at very high levels, despite being given a fair amount of freedom in choosing the advanced areas to face. It doesn't matter where you go and in what order you will face the maps: in each location you will find some extremely difficult bosses to face, progressively more difficult platform sections, and a long series of common opponents with variable resistances and behaviors. Hollow Knight, simply put, is relentless; capable of making even veterans of the genre and longtime players struggle at times, and so full of secrets that it puts a strain on both the memory of those who face it and the patience of those who underestimate it. Consider that the game also boasts multiple endings - the achievement of which is far from a walk in the park - a huge bestiary to compile, scattered vermicelli to save, various optional bosses and a long list of equipable amulets that allow you to customize the style of play with numerous bonuses; completionists, be warned. Cotanto ben di dio is then accompanied by exceptional cartoon graphics for a 2D game, close to professional animation and animated with a rare grace, within settings of rare beauty for a similar product. Even stylistically, Team Cherry's work has a lot to say, thanks to an unequivocally gloomy atmosphere, but dampened greatly by the cute insectoids that populate Hallownest and by their continuous expression in verse. The only technical flaw that can be attributed to the game is the presence of annoying stutters that do not seem to depend on the configuration used (we tested the game on two PCs, both well above the recommended specifications, yet the stutters remained), and which can create serious difficulties during the difficult boss battles or the elaborate leaps required to reach the most hidden areas. Annoying, true, but easily negligible.", "date": "2017-03-20", "grade": "8.8"}
