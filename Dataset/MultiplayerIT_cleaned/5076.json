This means that by downloading the free package you now get the whole story, including three chapters, with the addition of some ads that can be removed with the specific in-app purchase, obviously recommended for those who don't want advertising but not necessarily mandatory, considering that these are not excessively invasive. Of course, for a title that is entirely based on immersion in history and atmospheres, a total closure to annoying references to the glittering world of the Store may still be important, there is no doubt about this, but it is positive that you can still enjoy of The Detail in complete form even by downloading for free, an advantage that must also be considered in the overall evaluation of the game. The features are those already discussed at the time of the first chapter, with this new version representing only a content extension, but the fact that the story is now complete makes the Rival Games game a finally self-conclusive and satisfying experience, at least regarding this first season, looking forward to any future developments with further story arcs. It is an investigative adventure, built as a sort of interactive comic with noir and detective tones, which in the authors' intentions recalls the atmospheres of historical series such as The Wire, although the results achieved in terms of narration and dialogues are not quite all height of the maximum productions. We return to the investigation with the full version of The Detail, now free-to-play All the details in their place The Detail is a mature product, with various non-trivial choices, which despite an evident stereotype of characters and situations still manages to be interesting and appreciable even by the most demanding enthusiasts of the genre. It clearly owes its debt to the Telltale series as a whole, giving narrative precedence over classic point-and-click adventure gameplay, yet it manages to build its own identity thanks to the style adopted and the depth of the story. Each screen requires interaction with various elements of the scenario and characters, reducing the puzzles to a recomposition of evidence and elements on the basis of which to make choices throughout the story. These are the basics of the involvement required of the player: more than the work of research and composition of the puzzles based on the use of the inventory and the like, The Detail requires you to take positions, assume attitudes and act accordingly, with choices which then have a certain weight in the development of the story. Unfortunately, this element for a large part characterizing the entire gaming experience demonstrates weaknesses by continuing from chapter to chapter, up to revealing its relatively low weight in the final episode, ~The Devil in the Detail~. It is a problem common to Telltale adventures as well, although it is revealed in these to a lesser extent: to carry forward a complex narrative structure like that of The Detail, the freedom of choice has necessarily been limited, channeled towards some pre-established alternatives which nonetheless demonstrate more superficial what else. In this way, a solid and flawless story remains, which allows the player to take an active part in it without implementing structural upheavals and for this reason it is especially suitable for lovers of graphic novels and television series who want a predominantly passive entertainment experience but with a certain degree of customization.", "date": "2017-01-26", "grade": "7.5"}
