{"name": "Ninja alla riscossa anche su PSP", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-alla-riscossa-anche-su-psp.html", "text": "It's nice to remember how the first chapters of Tenchu, Siphon Filter and Metal Gear Solid actually created the current stealth genre on PSone, practically at the same time. Several years have passed since then, yet it is not that many steps forward have been made to make this particular trend more sophisticated or convincing: with the exception of the Konami product, which has best interpreted the transition to the nextgen, the other two series yes. I am definitely lost along the way. Tenchu, in particular, has passed from hand to hand and has gotten worse each time, with the original concept lost sight of by the developers and an ever more nebulous future on the horizon. This until the announcement a few months ago, which saw the series return to the original team (Acquire) for a series of new episodes that it was believed would be made exclusively for the Wii and which instead will enjoy a transposition for the PSP. We will therefore find the ninja Rikimaru and Ayame, engaged in ten parallel missions which will see them defeat the clan responsible for the kidnapping of the daughter of Lord Goda Matsunoshin. Lights and shadows There are two modes that Tenchu: Shadow Assassins makes available to us: in the first we will follow the story alternating at the command of Rikimaru and Ayame, in the second we will be able to complete a series of short challenges to unlock extras. The initial mission, focused on the elimination of a dishonest merchant, acts as a tutorial as the various phases are enriched by suggestions and useful indications for understanding how to move within the stages, how to hide from the sight of enemies and how to eliminate them silently . Fans of the stealth genre will have bread for their teeth, given that this new episode is very unaccustomed to half measures. If in the past we could complete the missions in a more or less brilliant way, earning us an excellent rating if we left no traces and weren't spotted or a ~failure~ if it ended in a brawl with the guards, now we don't have much choice: in case an enemy notices our presence, we will necessarily have to start the stage all over again (the first time it happens, at least, there won't be the guards we have already eliminated). If we have a sword, we can try to tackle what is effectively the darkest side of Shadow Assassins: the combat system. Forget about the third-person fights to which the series has accustomed us: the PSP version of the game takes up what was seen on the Wii, so we will see the view change to first-person and we will have to move the analog stick in the direction indicated on the screen to parry the enemy's blows and then inflict ours. Apart from the very little appeal of this type of solution, which could perhaps have made sense with the Wii-mote but certainly not with a standard control system, the (big!) problem is that these fights are really too difficult to complete. The player is asked for an absurd speed of execution, and an unblocked blow is enough to have the worst. In short, when it comes to fighting this new episode of Tenchu shows all its limits ... What you don't see doesn't exist Having rejected the hypothesis of proceeding like drunks outside the disco on Saturday evening, we will necessarily have to understand how to move and plan every aspect of the mission, both during construction and during the numerous attempts that we will certainly be forced to repeat. The main element in a stealth game is undoubtedly the visual factor: the enemies must not notice us, we must move silently and carry out our attacks from behind. Just like ninjas. The game seems tailor-made for this kind of interpretation, with stages made up of various rather short sections that are a bit like a puzzle to be solved until you reach the turn exit. Our best ally will be the shadow, which in Shadow Assassins is graphically represented in a different way than in the past: if our character is in a dark area, it becomes completely black and we are sure that no one will be able to see us, even in the short term. distance. When the shadows aren't there, you have to create them using the right tools: a bamboo cane to sprinkle water on lit candles, shurikens to turn off other lights, etc. Our ninja can move normally or run, and once in the right position with respect to an opponent we will see indications that make us understand that it is the right time to eliminate him: just press the Square button and the analog stick in one of the four directions to proceed to a different kind of silent execution. Once this is done, we will be able to collect the corpse of the killed enemy and hide it bybehind a wall or in a bush to prevent anyone else from seeing it. Lacking a right analog stick on the PSP, the developers inevitably had to find alternative solutions for the control system: the stick allows us to move the character, with the view moving automatically, while the d-pad lets us access the inventory and the main buttons allow us to attack, jump (a malign maneuver), climb and use the ~mystical vision~. The latter blocks our ninja and gives us the possibility to move the stick to take a look around, adjusting the view freely and controlling the point of view of the guards. It is an operation that in fact makes walking close to the walls almost useless, a maneuver that is moreover cumbersome when it comes to changing position quickly. Technical realization Although the number of polygons on the screen is not extraordinary (but on PSP we are now used to ~edgy~ characters), this new episode of Tenchu has well done graphics. The ninjas we control and the various opponents we will face are well animated and full of details, the rendering of lights and shadows is good and the locations are convincing despite a certain repetitiveness and the always quite limited dimensions. The frame-rate holds up well, with just a few glitches every now and then, and the 'fatalities' performed by Rikimaru and Ayame are quite spectacular. The story is told mainly through good quality CG cutscenes, while the sound sector can count on discreet music, average effects and dialogues that do not drive you crazy but are not to be thrown away either.", "date": "2009-05-28", "grade": "5.9"}
