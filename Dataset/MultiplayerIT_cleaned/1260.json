{"name": "Onimusha 3: Demon Siege", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/onimusha-3-demon-siege-2.html", "text": "A Spasso nel Tempo The first Onimusha had ended with the clash between Samanosuke Akechi and the general of the demonic armies of the Genma, the deadly Fortinbras. The battle had had a positive outcome, but the ending left the player with several doubts about the fate of the Onimusha Samanosuke, a human with Oni blood capable of using the powers of these ancient spiritual entities to counter the Genma invasions. The second episode of Onimusha, on the other hand, changed the cards on the table, proposing as protagonist Jubei Yagyu, a samurai despite himself involved in the conquest plans of the terrible Nobunaga Oda. After a dense (however incoherent) web of encounters, new friendships, tragic losses and surprising revelations, the Onimusha Jubei had destroyed an increasingly otherworldly Nobunaga, bringing peace to Japan in the 1500s. Now, in the incredible Onimusha opening-movie 3, we find Samanosuke fighting with the Genma and with a revived Fortinbras, but this time the battle is truly desperate: with the help of the scientist Guildenstern and his time machine, Nobunaga Oda is planning the invasion of the planet in 2000, which will start from Paris, where Samanosuke will be teleported by chance. And at the same time, an eccentric Parisian policeman, Jacques Blanc, will find himself catapulted into Japan in the 1500s, grappling with unprecedented Oni powers, demons and Tengu for company. The two heroes will have to make their way through the hordes of Genma, each looking for a way to return to their own time and put an end to Nobunaga's threat, teaming up with unsuspecting fellow adventurers (Jaques will have the Samanosuke of the past on his side, Samanosuke's fight in Jaques' feisty girlfriend will join instead) and communicating with each other through a very special emissary. And if the plot may seem like a B-Movie summary, it must be said that in fact it is, but also that Capcom has been able to narrate it in an excellent way to say the least. Blade Warriors Onimusha 3 maintains the mechanics inaugurated by the very first episode of the series, enriching it at the same time with the natural evolution of the experiments seen in the second episode. The progression in the adventure is semi-linear, embracing the mechanics of many similar adventures: the player controls Jacques or Samanosuke in the various environments in which they are catapulted, wiping out every hostile element on the screen with the available weapons, solves the proposed puzzles by Capcom game-designers and following the story line of the game progresses into the following areas. Nothing surprising, everything already seen, but excellently re-proposed. As in the previous episodes, both Jaques and Samanosuke have a series of weapons with different characteristics, to be alternated at discretion in the demolishing work. However, the two characters are not a mere clone of the other, but their weapons and skills force the user to adopt different combat strategies to get out alive from the assaults of the Genma: if Samanosuke can count on surprising agility and deadly edged weapons that he will find on his way, Jacques instead will have to count on the Oni-Whip which allows him to attack enemies from a distance, to grab them and throw them away and to jump from one platform to another using special handholds. All the weapons (as well as the armor and the Oni-Glove) of the two heroes allow you to cast destructive spells at the price of a certain amount of spiritual energy, and can be upgraded by using the souls sucked from the enemies: as in the prequels, in fact, by pressing one key after having knocked down an enemy it will be possible to suck his soul into the Oni-Glove, which, depending on the type, will guarantee different bonuses (more points to upgrade the equipment, increases in vital and spiritual energy and so on). Not to mention the fact that by collecting five souls of a certain type, Samanosuke and Jaques will be able to transform into Onimusha and unleash their indisputable power on their enemies. In addition to this basic set of weapons, the two main protagonists have other offense and defense skills, which include dodging, counterattacks, killing blows and much more. The result is therefore a wide-ranging, varied and fun playful experience, far from mere blind progression by frantically pressing the pad buttons. And after all, the adventure of the two protagonists will often be hampered by puzzles of various kinds (which at a certain point will even involve the transmission of objects and information from one era to another) and by bosses who will have to be faced and defeated using specific strategies . In this regard, it is fair to point out the enormous scaling applied to the RPG-like elements seen in Onimusha 2: if in the previous episode wandering through the inhabited centers in search of objects to give away or consegnare could appear a forced and rather inconsistent slowdown, in Onimusha 3 this aspect is present in a minimal dose, representing more of an element of variety than a cornerstone of the game. And if to this consideration we include the bonuses that are obtained by grinding enemies as quickly as possible and in the most sophisticated way, it is easy to understand how Capcom wanted to emphasize above all the action aspect of Onimusha 3, managing at the same time to perfectly calibrate the variety of product. Feel the Power Without any doubt, Onimusha 3 is currently the most technically impressive product available on PlayStation 2. Capcom's will to abandon the pre-rendered backdrops and adopt the total polygonal three-dimensionality of the environments (a bit like it did on PSOne in the creation of Dino Crisis ) should be welcomed with open arms, as it gives us absolutely high-impact locations both in detail and for the general realization. The Paris of the Arc de Triomphe and the Notre Dame Cathedral as well as the Japan of forests and traditional temples leave you stunned by the monstrous amount of details that Capcom has managed to insert, making the various settings in which the story takes place alive and evocative. 'adventure. And on the other hand, the same care has been placed in the creation of the polygonal models, which if it proves to be very high for the various diabolical creatures (especially in terms of animations), for the protagonists really leaves you speechless: Kaneshiro and Reno are there, they are almost alive, both in Full Motion Video footage and in real-time cutscenes, almost indistinguishable were it not for the evident and exceptional quality of the FMVs, which rivals the best Square Enix productions (Final Fantasy X anyone?). To complete the picture there is an excellent soundtrack and an excellent, as very original, dubbing, which mixes tracks in English and French using a banal and at the same time brilliant narrative device. Onimusha 3 had aroused many doubts at the initial demonstrations by Capcom: the commercial turn taken by the series with its spin-offs and the inclusion in the ~cast~ of Jean Reno seemed to want to sink a now cult saga by transforming it into an excessive B-series product and banal. Onimusha 3, once played, demonstrates how well Capcom knew what it wanted. The conclusion of the saga is a product of the highest quality, balanced on all fronts (narrative and playful in particular), able to glue the player to his seat for about fifteen hours to finish it the first time, and then again to complete the tons of extra modes or unlock the many secret bonuses. We are also faced with a technically commendable title, with attention to every detail and very well made, which rivals without problems, for example, with the Resident Evil Rebirth available for the GameCube. An absolute must-buy for fans of the series, for action-adventure lovers and for those who simply want a real bigwig in their toy library. Final notes go to the European adaptation of the game, equipped with the very welcome 50/60 Hz selector. Pros: Technically at the highest levels. Great balance of storytelling, action, and puzzle solving. Fun, varied and full of extras. Cons: Difficulty level not always perfectly balanced A second opinion by Antonio ~Tanzen~ Fucito I have always been a fan of the Onimusha saga, especially the beautiful (but very short) first chapter. Its sequel, on the other hand, partially disappointed me, in fact I didn't digest some choices made by Capcom, first of all the introduction of RPG-like elements. Onimusha 3 represents the definitive consecration of the series in the field of action/adventure, the temporal paradox between France and feudal Japan in fact works very well, with the two main protagonists endowed with a great charisma and quite different fighting styles, which offer variety and depth to the game. All this is surrounded by a finally discreet longevity, a large number of extras and a fun and never boring game system, which, together with an always fluid graphic sector, full of polygons and particle effects, makes this third chapter an unmissable title for all lovers of the genre and of good video games. Onimusha was one of the first titles to show the technical capabilities of PlayStation 2. Its first appearance on shelves around the world dates back to 3 years ago, in 2001, and in the time that has passed since then Capcom seems to have wanted to cultivate this brand in a way that, however bizarre, has been able to give depth and originality to a saga often erroneously labeled as a ~Resident Evil clone~. Onymusha is actually an action-game stained with adventure, set in a completely different world from the corridors of zombie-infested mansions, and where firearms and enemy dribbles are replaced by white-armed clashes with demons and otherworldly creatures . In addition, Capcom wanted and knew how to give Onimusha the flavor of cinema, developing not too complex but certainly captivating plots, and using the famous Japanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro as a ~cast~ for the protagonist's model. Since then, water has passed under the bridge and Onimusha has risked turning into a commercial saga at best, distributed in every form and everywhere: after the edition of the first chapter for Xbox (Genma Onimusha), the mediocre Strategic- RPG for Game Boy Advance (Onimusha Tactics), the recent and discreet fighting game Onimusha Blade Warriors and, above all, a contradictory second chapter, that Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny which confused the background of Samanosuke's fight, Capcom decides instead to put the word End to the series, as it was in its original intentions, with a concluding chapter that if initially could sow doubts and perplexities due to the presence of the very good, but here apparently decontextualized, Jean Reno, after careful examination it can only turn out to be a true masterpiece such.
