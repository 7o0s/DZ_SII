When Square Enix announced the release of a multiplayer expansion pack, fans and detractors of the game - because, let's face it, there are now one or the other without much in between - raised their eyebrows and frowned. It's clear that, at this point, Square Enix is using Final Fantasy XV as a kind of platform on which to experience what is likely to be the future of the franchise both in terms of narrative and gameplay. After the mediocre Gladio Episode and the excellent Prompto Episode, waiting for the Ignis Episode which will be released on December 13th, we can therefore dabble with a multiplayer component that wants to lengthen the longevity of Final Fantasy XV in a completely different sense without fully succeeding. Monster Kingsglaive Even this DLC, which initially seemed designed to offer an impromptu entertainment to those who had already finished Final Fantasy XV but just didn't want to stop hunting for monsters, binds to the original script by telling us the vicissitudes of an Angone - unhappy Italian adaptation of Kingsglaive rank - survived the fall of Lucis. In fact, the game is mainly connected to the computer graphics feature film that preceded the release of the game in 2016: at the beginning, the avatar that we created to represent us through an excellent customization system, is recruited by none other than Libertus, the Angone who helps Lunafreya escape from Lucis at the end of the film and who we had never met in the game. It's been months since the fall of Lucis and the world of Eos is growing darker with each passing day, so Libertus is gathering the few remaining Angoni in the city of Lestallum, the last stronghold of the human race. Our task will be to destroy tons of monsters in order to collect the kilowatts necessary to unlock the nodes and outposts on the map, gradually becoming stronger and more worthy of serving the new king. In reality, the story essentially boils down to the prologue just described and some brief dialogue or cinematics, concluding in an actually very spectacular final battle, thanks also to the musical accompaniment of the very famous composer Nobuo Uematsu, who came back specifically to write the above piece and the cloying Comrades sung by Emiko Suzuki. Battlemates, on the narrative front, it serves to explain how Noctis knew he had to go to Hammerhead after his return in chapter 14 of Final Fantasy XV, neither more nor less, and it's a shame because the DLC could have given us the opportunity to better explore the world plunged into darkness and interact more with some characters who instead only act as an extra between one mission and another. In the end, in fact, Battle Companions is reduced to a repetitive grind of missions in which we will have to kill a certain number of enemies, protect an objective or escort a load, in the company of a trio of Angoni controlled by as many players or by a discreet artificial intelligence. The materials collected on missions are used to upgrade or craft new weapons, offering the player a wide variety of fighting styles. The combat system is in fact the best feature of the package: it is basically that of Noctis, but improved in various respects. The controls are more responsive, the animations smoother, and the revised and corrected hitboxes guarantee greater control of the action and dodging. The original magic system has been completely replaced by an intuitive combination of keys that allows you to attack enemies, generate a protective barrier or heal your companions. In short, the combination of the renewed control system and the spectacular action guarantees great fun during the missions, which are never too long and particularly amusing in the company of a few friends, but the problem is precisely that: the assignments last too little and you have the feeling of constantly struggling with the interface of the game and the evident inexperience of the development team in the field of online gaming. The progression is structured in an absolutely questionable way: between one mission and another you have to go through an exorbitant number of very long loading and intermission screens, moreover there is a lack of basic options that allow you to repeat a mission on the fly together with the same players or to reunite the group in a hub from which to start hunting immediately. Each time you have to start the process over: considering that it takes between eight and ten hours to reach the ending, and that it can take some time to unlock each contentre many more, the urge to turn on the console simply passes when you have a few minutes available and have to spend them staring at a loading screen or restarting the game due to some bug. The idea of evoking the feeling of Phantasy Star Online or Monster Hunter in the Final Fantasy XV universe wasn't even that bad, but if Square Enix has evidently worked hard to rework the combat system, it is clear that it has neglected the narrative component , really skimpy, and above all the accessibility of the experience, plagued by endless uploads and annoying bugs and glitches that are not worth looking into for a few minutes of gameplay at a time. Consider buying this DLC only if you have a lot of patience and maybe some friends to go hunting with, otherwise forget it.", "date": "2017-11-20", "grade": null}
