Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. When a development team manages to create a blockbuster, or a title that is downloaded by millions of people around the world, it is not so easy to repeat this success. But the King guys do it on a consistent basis, as it seems that Bubble Witch Saga 2 is also doing great in the charts on the App Store and Google Play. For those who don't know it, this is the second episode of a series clearly inspired by the mechanics of the classic Puzzle Bobble, in which our goal is to shoot colored bubbles trying to match three or more of the same shade. This simple concept, which characterized the puzzle game Taito, has been enriched in various ways in this sequel, through the introduction of four different modes (plus boss fights) that we will find ourselves facing within a campaign that currently counts ninety levels and which is updated constantly and for free. Speaking of free, let's immediately address the issue of the freemium model, given that the game does not adopt a particularly stringent approach: you have five lives available which are recharged every thirty minutes, but the degree of challenge is quite accessible and it is therefore rare to run out all your chances with a single difficult stage, then having to wait to make a new attempt. It is of course possible to recharge lives through the use of hard currency, gold bars, and in the same way you can buy boosts that allow you to quickly solve a mission (through the use of the rainbow bubble or the fiery one ), but once the initially available gold has run out, we will necessarily have to put our wallets in order to have more. From here to say that it is impossible to go ahead without paying, however, there goes: we have seen much worse around, even in the same King-branded products. Bubble Witch Saga 2 is a nice Puzzle Bobble clone: fun, with many levels and quite varied A thousand blue bubbles As mentioned, there are four modes that we will be dealing with during the Bubble Witch Saga 2 campaign. The classic mode will see us eliminate the colored bubbles with the aim of reaching those positioned higher up and detonate at least six of them to successfully complete the level, while in ~free the ghost~ we will have the task of freeing a nice little ghost from his bubble prison. In the ~save the animals~ mode we will have to carry out the same operation, but on several occasions and taking advantage of particular ~explosive~ cells, which alone can free entire rows of objects, while finally in the last mode we will be asked to collect certain ingredients. In all cases, the bubbles available to us will not be infinite and, on the contrary, their number will tend to decrease as we approach the more advanced levels, with a consequent increase in difficulty. Completing a mission using a low number of bubbles will allow us to obtain a rich extra score, because each saved ball will fall into the cauldrons located at the bottom of the screen, in a sort of small pachinko. In short, the formula of the first Bubble Witch Saga has been enriched on various fronts for this sequel, which stands as an accessible, fun and decidedly fresher experience than one would expect from what in the end still remains a Puzzle clone Bobble. The filings to the gameplay can also be seen from the details, such as the possibility of changing the bubble we are about to shoot with the ~reserve~ one, where one color is needed more than another. The touch controls are also confirmed to be almost perfect, also allowing you to score some valuable ~banks~, calculating the trajectories well beyond the hatch which by default makes us understand what the direction of our shot will be. This so solid and tested system can also count on a technical sector that is up to the task, thanks to very pleasant, well-designed and colorful graphics (subject only to some uncertainty when there are so many bouncing bubbles on the screen ), and to a tune that immediately enters your head.
