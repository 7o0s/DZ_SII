{"name": "Spartan - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spartan-recensione.html", "text": "Start the war! Like any game with a minimum of complexity, Spartan also has its tutorials, to be done strictly before embarking on major campaigns to understand how the management of our army will work. The guides available to us cover the gameplay fairly well, even if going further into the game we realize that in what we learned at the beginning there were some holes, as well as in the manual. Once you have learned how to take your first steps, you have to choose whether to take further practice by using the ~free~ map to try out armies and tactics, embark on one of the 8 possible campaigns or challenge another human being in multiplayer mode. Precisely for this last mode Siltherline has created the so-called MSA system (Multiplayer Always Active), whereby if our opponent in multiplayer mode were to go to war against a computer-controlled nation, during the conflict we will be the ones to lead the troops of this last against his own, so as to never remain inactive waiting for the other to finish his battle. Staying on the subject of real-time battle, we are faced with a fairly approximate and poor system, very far from the peak reached by Rome: Total War. Staying on the subject of real-time battle, we are faced with a fairly approximate and poor system, very far from the peak reached by Rome: Total War. Start the war! After initially setting up your army and giving them formation and advance orders, it is practically impossible to change these dispositions during the battle since the only orders that can be given during this are regrouping and retreat, so you are almost limited to being of the spectators, excluding the possibility of implementing particularly complex strategies, not to mention that in this way one completely relies on the game's AI, whose errors thus become incorrigible by the player. The result of all this will be that very soon, instead of choosing the manual battle, the player will prefer to let the computer resolve the clash automatically, concentrating more on the diplomatic-economic side of the game. In the light of what has been said so far, this is precisely the real heart of Spartan's gameplay: starting from a general map of Ancient Greece, it is possible to select the controlled cities in detail and see their buildings through another more detailed shot . Not being able to build villages to your liking outside of the controlled cities, present from the beginning of the campaign, it is essential to accurately manage the production of raw materials, organized between the various urban centers. There are 9 goods to accumulate in Spartan: gold, food, iron, bricks, horses, marble, copper, timber and silver will all be essential for the development of your empire, not only because they allow you to build new buildings and produce new units , but also because once all the goods are sold, they will yield silver, the game currency through which to buy the raw materials we are running out of. Work, always work In addition to the economic system, the diplomatic part also plays a fundamental role in this game: by training ambassadors it is in fact possible to send them to other nations, with the aim of ingratiating themselves with those in charge to obtain an alliance with us, or to obtain important information such as the possible movement of enemy troops towards our borders. In the same way, as the game progresses, we will also find ourselves facing the entry into our territory of foreign ambassadors, who yield 50 units of silver to our coffers in turn but could also play a dirty game, trying to disturb the peace of our nation. In this case, after having decided to expel them, we will also have to decide how to do it, that is, whether to send it back in one piece or not. Another figure present in the game is that of the assassin, through which to kill enemy generals in order to spread discontent and fear among the troops and carry out sabotage missions such as the defacing of temples, a source of happiness for the inhabitants of the city . In addition to what has been said so far, there is also the field of research, through which to improve the various technologies used in one's empire. With the help of 9 ~sliders~, each associated with one of the raw materials mentioned above, we have in fact the possibility of choosing which sector to focus our efforts on, in order to obtain the passage of the technology level for the one we have chosen. The best thing to do is to alternate efforts as needed, depending for example on whether you are in a guerratic or relative peace. 2D? 3D? One of the first things that strikes you about Spartan is the possibility of choosing whether to play the battle in real time with a 2D or 3D view, obviously in order to allow even those who do not have a latest generation PC (but also a penultimate one, given that minimum requirements include a Pentium 366Mhz) to see your own forces fight against the enemy. If this choice is commendable, surely the level of 3D graphics is not: a map limited to only a small battlefield, a very approximate detail and some animations not exactly in step with the times make Spartan pale in front of the classics of its genre . As far as the management method is concerned, we are on discrete levels. a map limited to only a small battlefield, a very approximate detail and some animations not exactly in step with the times make Spartan pale in front of the classics of its genre 2D? 3D? The sound accompanies the action quite well and it is fun to hear your troops responding in Greek to the orders given: not having localized the voices, this is certainly more appreciable than a spoken word in English. Spartan carries a year of old age with him, and it shows. However, it must be said that even if this review had been written in 2004, the 3D graphic detail would have been inadequate if compared not only with Rome: Total War but even with Medieval: Total War, released in the videogame distant 2002. As we have already As we have seen in the body of the review, the real-time battle becomes boring after a very short time, forcing the player to lean towards the automatic resolution of the battle. As far as the management part is concerned, we can certainly say that it is in this area that Spartan gives its best, however not adding anything new to what has been seen in other titles. Probably the real innovation of this game is the setting: in fact, if you have been looking for a management/RTS set in Ancient Greece for years, the time has finally come to join in, also considering that the game is sold at the very respectable price of 19.90 (also in our shop); if, on the other hand, you are looking for something innovative or in any case you feel like a budding general and not mainly a diplomat, the advice is to at least try this title before making the purchase. Pros Good number of playable campaigns Deep management level Cons but with some holes Outdated 3D graphics Lack of strategy during real time fights A bit of history More than 2000 years ago there was a city called Sparta. He had only two goals: to train for war and to fight the wars he trained for. Over time Sparta became famous for its warriors, the most combative and disciplined in the then known world. Its greatest moment was probably in 480 BC, when, at the pass of Thermopylae, a handful of Spartans led by the heroic King Leonidas sacrificed themselves to delay the invasion of Greece by Xerxes and his Persian Horde. What you have read so far is not taken from a high school textbook but from the introduction that the game manual gives to Spartan, finally arrived on our screens after entering the international market about a year ago. Set in the first half of the first century BC, when the Greek city-states were at the height of their splendor, this game gives us the opportunity to relive the events by driving Sparta (at the time known as Laconia) or other centers such as Athens, all through a Total War-style setting, that is, mixing together characteristic elements of management with those of real-time strategy: we just have to find out at this point if, after so many hard trainings, it is worth becoming a Spartan.", "date": "2005-10-04", "grade": null}
