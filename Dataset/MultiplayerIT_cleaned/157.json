{"name": "World of WarCraft: The Burning Crusade - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade-recensione.html", "text": "When one world is not enough Months of press releases and viral campaigns based on films and presentations have now well impressed the slogans of this expansion, but The Burning Crusade does not seem to have any problem in keeping up with the incredible expectations it has generated. Expectations also due to the physiological limit of a game which, despite its abysmal success, has suffered in recent months due to the lack of content that can be used by the majority of users. As a result, faced with an apparently inexhaustible supply of new players, there has been a not negligible hemorrhage of users, disappointed by largely ~elitist~ updates such as Naxxramas, which have done little to keep the attraction alive for those who do not he was willing to spend the 15-20 hours a week inevitably required of a raiding guild in Azeroth. However, despite a few months of delay, The Burning Crusade has come with what it promised to recover the situation, the ideal response to the flood of whiners that infested the forums up until a few weeks ago, now busy leveling their characters rather than complaining about the lack of attention for their favorite class. We have already dealt extensively with most of the new locations, but what we would like you to understand is the degree of painstaking improvement that the new game contents have reached at the end of these months of beta testing. When one world is not enough If World of WarCraft, at the time of its release, set a new paradigm in the MMORPG sector, in terms of cleanliness and attention to detail, its expansion takes it to an even higher level, offering a new continent, three cities and two starting zones really made to art. Every NPC, every spawn point of the monsters, every route to follow to complete a quest, have been conceived, designed and built with precision and balance bordering on perfection. Nothing is left to chance and whether you start the adventure from scratch or undertake the climb to level 70, the rediscovery of the pleasure of ~doing quests~ is instantaneous. The kind of satisfaction and immediate realization that we had by now forgotten is immediately renewed, after more than a year of static instances and very painful grinding in Silithus and in the Eastern Plaguelands. The game therefore comes out absolutely rejuvenated and regenerated, far beyond the simple introduction of new monsters and locations to explore. And it's not just PvE or the new 25-person instances, which bring the game back to a more humane ~collegiate~ usability and reward the game abundantly for a reasonable investment of time. Even PvP, an aspect of the game that has been renewed several times, discussed and criticized for its ~second-order addition~ flavor that it has always kept despite itself, has finally received a turn of the screw in the right direction, discriminating between a competitive environment based real skill of the players in assembling talented task forces and a more familiar grinding however more satisfying than the old Battlegrounds. When one world is not enough The first experiments of Outdoor PvP made in recent months have in fact borne fruit and all the new zones offer game opportunities of this type differing from the classic Battlegrounds for the lack of any cause of tedium, from queues to scores, to times from respect. Seamlessly join or leave battle at any time, depending on what you feel like doing, in a sort of miniaturized version of Dark Age of Camelot RvR. In short, maximum flexibility, a theme that continues to re-emerge from various angles by observing the novelties of the expansion, from the strategic positioning of the quest hubs on the map to the new  fantastic  auto-matching system for creating groups for quests and instances, which it works brilliantly and saves immeasurable amounts of time. Dogs and cats? The Burning Crusade is aimed at two (non-exclusive) categories of users: those primarily interested in ~post level 60~ content - and who will therefore immediately launch themselves beyond the Portal towards Outland - and those eager to replay from a new perspective the now ~classic~ adventure in the world of Azeroth. Trying perhaps those classes so interesting that one had never had the opportunity to deepen due to personal incompatibility with the relative races to which they were associated. In this sense Draenei and Blood Elf balance each other in a game of opposite polarities of rare elegance. Let's take the Elves, positive characters par excellence once belonging to the Alliance, who, following the tragic invasion of the Undead, are on the verge of degeneration.eration and in exchange for power and a chance to survive, they have literally made a deal with the devil. Although it is not initially explicit, the clues, the sensations and the slowly unraveling plot from quest to quest, make the player soon become aware that something is wrong, that under a facade of aesthetic perfection and unshakable determination there is a a race made mischievous and unscrupulous by the misfortunes suffered, by its own insatiable thirst for magic and by the forbidden path undertaken to satisfy it. As descendants of the Night Elf Highborne, who first inadvertently summoned the Legion to Azeroth at the dawn of the world, seeing them now draw upon demonic energies to sustain themselves is like witnessing a years-long narrative arc finally come full circle.  something that any lover of Warcraftian lore can only appreciate. [C] The architecture of the blood elves is unique. a mixture of self-celebration, ostentation and genuine magnificence Predictably, Final Fantasy fans took it out on the ~theft of the Chocobos~ (I would also rightly add...) Flaming eyes staring hungrily at us... the Blood Elves are definitely opening Pandora's box to survive... [/C] In short, although a distinction between good and evil between the two playable factions of World of Warcraft is of little significance, in the light of the sweetening inflicted on the classic stereotype of the Orc and the Undead, the Blood Elves are perfect in role of anti-heroes and in virtually every location in the game where they can be encountered, they are found doing mischief and furthering their own ends at the expense of others, often asking the player to play their part in their own personal xenophobic and anti-heroes. ecological crusades. At the antipodes are the Draenei and not only in terms of aesthetics (large, stocky and muscular as the Blood Elf they are dynamic graceful and worthy of one of those sober Dolce & Gabbana commercials). This alien race doubly exiled, despite the blood bond with Archimonde, Kil'Jaeden and the other demonic generals of the Burning Legion, are instead the definitive champions of universal good, who protected by the angelic Naaru have traveled for millennia in the multiverse and better than anyone other understand the nature of the Crusade against the Legion and the roles of the parties involved. A race aligned with the Alliance and hand in glove with the history of the Orcs (on whose planet they settled and by which they were brutally subjugated) and the Blood Elves themselves, which they oppose due to their tendency to feed on demonic energies before even fighting them. And the feuds do not end there, also considering the theft of their fortress-dimensional ship in Outland and the sabotage suffered to the section that crashed on Azeroth at the end of their escape. Giants as good as bread, therefore, constantly in stoic superhero poses - head up and chest out - but with more than a few well-placed grudges. [C] Draenei Shamans may seem like a stretch, but there is no shortage of quests that somehow justify their presence Obsessed with their Crusade against the Legion, the city is overwhelmed. of the Draenei is; filled with holograms of potential adversaries... Draenei contaminated by demonic energies degenerate to the state of ~Broken~ and ~Lost Ones~. [/C] It is an interesting addition to the fantastic panorama of Warcraft, which with their strange ~mystical~ technology, blue skin and cosmic background, begins to move away significantly from the tedious canons of Tolkien's High Fantasy, to the advantage of originality. Furthermore, the two new races do not rebalance the factions exclusively from an aesthetic point of view, but put an end to the age-old dispute about balancing the respective raids, offering the possibility of exploiting the once mutually exclusive classes of shaman and paladin. An ideal squaring of the circle, which while requiring more than some forcing in terms of plot, removes at the root any potential difference between the Horde and the Alliance both in PVP and in dealing with the instances. A solution that the public, after the initial hesitation, has greatly appreciated, although diametrically opposed to the approach chosen by other developers such as Mythic, which both in Dark Age of Camelot and in the future Warhammer, offer a mix of very different races and classes and deliberately at the antipodes, pointing to the linearity of the Blizzard method as a reason of little depth that undermines replayability. Personally, however, our preference goes to the Blood Elves, not only for their affiliation to the Horde and for their natural predisposition to our favorite classes (they are excellent thieves, maghi and warlocks, strong with a very useful racial ability): their evil paladins are certainly more attractive and justifiable in terms of background than the anonymous Draenei Shamans. And then, let's face it, the new Elves ride around on the back of giant gallinaceous equal to the Chochobo... how can you resist? Conclusions While a ~simple~ expansion, The Burning Crude offers more content and things to do than many MMORPGs that hit shelves as finished products. And it's not just any content, but the result of a development process that is now Blizzard's signature and is still unmatched in its ability to create entertainment free or almost flawless. A word that perfectly exemplifies this concept in English is polished: Blizzard games are refined, perfected and polished like precious stones, to the point that discovering an error or inaccuracy in them becomes more and more like a treasure hunt (or looking for an excuse). Fans have noticed this for years and it is a fundamental element in the reputation of this Californian developer, whose delays everyone is now willing to forgive. If the genre is not your passion or you simply did not like World of WarCraft, this article is obviously not for your eyes, so we will not use half measures in the evaluation. The Burning Crusade is an essential purchase for anyone who treads or has treaded the world of Azeroth in the past letting themselves be captured by its magic. Even if you have stopped playing it, it will know how to regain your interest. Pros Technically and stylistically impeccable Tons of things to do Excellent rethinking of PvP Long-lived like never before Cons Cumbersome activation of the European Collector's Edition Pet bonuses When it's good to be a collector Collector's Editions of Blizzard titles are known to be worth their money (as opposed to others, such as the unspeakable pile of useless junk contained in the collector's counterpart of Neverwinter Nights 2). When it's good to be a collector The Burning Crusade does not escape the glorious tradition, proposing a very rigid and very solid cardboard package of the same format as the version for the original game, containing loot worthy of the final boss of the most classic of dungeons (although to obtain it we will only need to pay around 80 euros - availability permitting). Opening the package, in fact, we will be greeted in order by: A hardcover tome containing the incredible artwork of the game A mouse pad with the map of Outland The DVD containing opening cinematics, trailers and backstory The soundtrack CD Two starter decks of the collectible card game (plus three exclusive cards) Two bonus Pets to activate in the game [C] Straight from the DVD, we finally put a face to the name of Chris Metzen! [/C] The reason for the presence of two pets (a Netherwelp and Lurky the Murloc) instead of just the little dragon, is due to Blizzard's desire to apologize for the dramatic activation procedure of the same, which in the case of the European Collector's Edition, provides for the shipment (abroad and by traditional mail) of your account data, the Collector Reference Card contained in the package and its barcode. The Crusade has begun Finally she came out. The first paid expansion of World of WarCraft arrives with the game still at the top of the sales charts and at the top of the favorites list for online RPGs. If the estimate of 8 million active users is reliable, we are definitely about to see a new sales speed record. However, before going on to read our final disquisition, we advise you, if you haven't already done so, to take a look at the long-winded specials that we have already dedicated to the expansion, which deal in depth with its contents in quantitative terms: Interface and Professions Instances, Regions and Cities", "date": "2007-01-23", "grade": null}
