In almost every fantasy RPG we've had to deal with them. We are talking about the terrible ogres, with their muscular bodies and very inelegant manners, and the slimy goblins, disgusting and full of mystery. Cyanide Studio has decided for once to reverse the roles and catapult us into a world dominated by the tyranny of humans, who become the real enemy, the result is this Of Orcs And Men, an action RPG with stealth grafts that leverages cooperation, proposing a combat system typical of turn-based RPGs set in a dynamic structure. The protagonists of this adventure are the ogre Arkail, a proud member of the prestigious elite tribe of the Bloodjaws, and the goblin Styx, much more evolved than his fellows, an astute and not very recommendable character. The two unlikely subjects find themselves working together to defeat the kingdom of humans by hitting it directly in the heart, that is, killing its emperor. In the meantime we will see them perpetually at the center of an endless series of vicissitudes and alternative missions, such as the disinfestation of a village invaded by angry goblins, to name one, which will only drive them further into trouble. The adventure does not spare itself in the description of these two races through a fair number of cut scenes and illustrations, testifying to how mere necessity can represent a persuasive means of coalition. Arkail's brutal strength, in fact, finds completion in Styx's infiltration ability, in order to make the first a devastating breakthrough center forward, the second a silent assassin hidden from the enemy's gaze. The two can also decide to attack together through a series of combined moves, the choice of the strategy to be applied is up to the player alone. Green is beautiful Right from the start we have the possibility to change the control of the two characters through a special key, while with the upper backbones we open a radial menu with which we can select three specific structures: offensive, defensive and special. The aim is to choose a series of actions that follow in a row of commands that the character carries out in combat. The opening of the interface slows down the action drastically, but does not stop it completely, thus bringing the dynamism of the clashes to life. In essence, we have a system that favors the strategic side, where the various skills that can be purchased along the adventure change both the fighting style and the effects, but which is sunk by a series of questionable choices that compromise its balance. Healing items are completely absent and the only help provided by the characters is to be able to resurrect each other, but everything is afflicted by the cumbersomeness, the confusion of the clashes, the delay of commands and targeting. Furthermore, it is good to understand as soon as possible the importance represented by the goblin in the duo's economy, otherwise you will be in serious trouble in the progression of the game. The very angry Arkail, after having suffered a certain number of hits, enters a berserk phase, where he totally loses control, even becoming dangerous for poor Styx, who finds himself the true balance between enemies capable of draining greedily the energy bar. Particular attention must also necessarily be paid to equipment and weapons, which must be carefully updated to ensure any hope of survival. The structure of the levels is too linear, with a series of narrow and claustrophobic environments, often interrupted by a free zone which takes on the role of hub for the acquisition of side quests and dialogues with NPCs. Exploration is therefore reduced to a minimum, if we exclude the remote possibility of getting lost or collecting some special object in bags and chests scattered throughout the maps. Not shocking but pleasant the use of interactive dialogues, along the lines of Mass Effect, able to change some choices of the story. Unfortunately, this aspect is reduced by the paucity of the script, a jumble of insipid dialogues mortified by a truly belittling trivial jargon, especially in the first part. This is probably an effect desired by the writers and there is a certain irony (at times the game looks like a dark version of Shrek), but the fact remains that the quality of Bioware is only a distant memory. Xbox 360 goals Of Orcs And Men has 45 objectives for the classic 1000 player points, given the nature and length of the game, although single player only, it will take a considerable amount of time to get them all. Don't forget to complete all the sidesquests, not only functional to fatten your Gamer Tag, but necessary to facilitate progression in the main campaign! He is worse than me Technically Of Orcs And Men relies on the graphics engine developed by Spiders to paint a dark and menacing fantasy world, very little epic, with rather mixed results. A precise artistic direction is missing, with characterizations focused on the two protagonists, actually well done, while all the rest is limited to very little aesthetically incisive and poorly diversified extras, closing with a series of very uninspired environments and already afflicted by recycling in the early hours of game. The rendering of the graphics engine is essentially good, rich in effects and textures, even if the image quality is slightly marred by the presence of jaggies, probably attributable to a not particularly aggressive antialiasing. The most relevant problem in the context of the gameplay is represented by the shots during the fights, which often prevent us from understanding what is happening, and the drops in fluidity in the most agitated situations, which aggravate the response to the commands. The menus are not distinguished by their beauty, but rather accuse the PC derivation, often resulting in confusion and awkward to navigate with the pad. The music somehow reconnects with the oppressive and medieval atmosphere of the title, presenting a series of pieces performed with the use of cellos. A choice of this type requires a high quality composition in order not to fall into the trap of boredom, and unfortunately this is not the case with Of Orcs And Men. Also in this sector an ~anti climax~ effect is sought, probably intended, but highly questionable, the songs are rarely able to excite the listener or emphasize the clashes, so much so that on certain occasions they are even disconnected from the action. It's quicker to take them off and put Apocalyptica's Armageddon on. The overall duration of the title settles on 15-20 hours, an excellent value for a title of this genre, a pity that a large part of this time will be spent cursing the combat system and all the problems that afflict Cyanide Studio fatigue. The game is in English with Italian subtitles.", "date": "2012-10-11", "grade": "5.5"}
