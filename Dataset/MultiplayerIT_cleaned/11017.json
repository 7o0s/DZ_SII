{"name": "Alone in the Dark: Inferno - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alone-in-the-dark-inferno-recensione.html", "text": "Premises, results, other premises The emotional path taken with Alone in the Dark: Inferno leads in part to disillusionment: with optimism one trusts the premises, frankly admits the limits of the result, and finally one realizes that the road arrives in a different place from the one where it seemed to lead us. But you know: it's a title full of experiments, and experiments rarely lead to immediate success. What is clear is that that place is genuinely fascinating, and for our part, the head and the heart count and often win over the limits of technique. New York, 2008. We wake up in the body of a mysterious individual, squeeze our thumb on the analog to possess his gaze and rotate it until we meet the first face from which to read an answer to our perplexities, intent on recovering our memory we try to understand what nefarious events we have become involved in as we realize that we are sharing a violent captivity with another victim. A few moments later we hold on with more conviction, trying to climb a flight of stairs, threatened by a gangster who escorts us to the place where he himself will execute us. The sudden manifestation of a ruthless supernatural presence leads to an unexpected liberation, but also to the discovery that at the same time a demonic power is already invading the skyscraper, scarring it and bringing it to collapse, leaving us as the only possibility of salvation to reach Central Park , on which the building overlooks. It is in those gardens that we will find the epicenter and the origin of the evil that is engulfing and corrupting the city. The moment of the first significant revelations will follow shortly thereafter. We will see that our face is that of a new, bold and experienced Edward Carnby, and at the same time we will discover that the problems that previously afflicted the control of the character are finally resolved. The speed in walking is well balanced and adjustable according to the pressure exerted on the analog. Some limited progress has also been made in framing, which can now be managed manually. Carnby's physiognomy follows the same line undertaken with ~The New Nightmare~: age, gray matter and oratory ability undertake an involutionary phase, the physique improves inversely, in line with contemporary needs. As the building's structure is collapsing, we must perform a series of athletic progressions across unstable ledges. These sections, part of the baggage of an adventure title for generations and present in that of Alone in the Dark in a completely expected way, represent the link with the genre as well as symbolize its difficulty in renewing itself, albeit with a different meaning in a title that also shows many unusual traits. However, as mixed with some small puzzles to be solved through the use of physics, they are more varied than in many other titles. Remaining the center of events, always and in any case, enhances our protagonism as actors, but ends up turning into a sentence. The attics await our passage in order to collapse, only the steam pipes that we touch end up exploding and our presence always has the ability to cause incredible events to occur, not even if we had become the favorite victims of the Angel of the Bizzaro described by Allan Poe, but without the privilege of being able to amaze us. Fortunately, Alone in the Dark doesn't have too many pretensions and the extravagant tone, covered by the dark, remains extremely consistent, even resulting characteristic. Carnby's misadventures are reminiscent of low-budget productions, but unfortunately there is no John Carpenter at the direction of the project and so the plot, still presented through messages on PDAs and cutscenes, instead of letting us enjoy his cynical and satirical gaze, does not does nothing but resolve exclusively in embarrassing clichs. We recall the TV serial-style structure on DVD: in fact it was more useful in overcoming unsolvable technical problems, but without a doubt it is a valid addition to be enjoyed, together with the trophies, especially after the conclusion. It's all in your hands We raise our glasses at the developers' choice to rebel against the standard of a mechanical inventory system that in the genre for years has rarely conceded an innovation to the classic menus and icons. What we collect is shown, subjectively, inside the jacket, and the same ability to avoid our emotional separation from events is reserved for managing our state of health, and treating the wounds that appear on our body. The possibility of combining objects together (in Inferno, we will no longer have to do it in a specific order) multiplies the choices available, both in the fight against demons and nel reversal of disadvantageous situations, and makes every environment worth exploring. Even if under pressure we end up botching the long keystrokes required for an action, this system fatigues us with satisfaction, leaving us feeling inventive by getting by. For hours we advance by torchlight, illuminating the darkness even when in addition to being ruthlessly enveloping it decided to become painfully aggressive, alternating deduction with an instinctive reactivity, and we find ourselves suspecting that Eden Games insists on provoking us about some small unconscious perversions . Through a sneaky game of attraction and pleasant guilt, they lead us to viscerally desire to deal with fire and blood, with the excuse of having to survive, let alone. With a discreet simulation of its ability to spread on wooden objects, fire stimulates creative action and a relationship with the environment. During combat, it can keep away any kind of monstrous entity that is intimidated by it or even make it immediately vanish into thin air, if set on fire. In reality, faced with the inevitability of fighting, the approaches to offense are more than we will remember having available and it is disappointing that the ~lock on target~ mechanic is once again characterized by a lack of cleanliness and animations so clumsy. The detailed environments reveal an indecision of the team in finding a choice between freedom and linearity, leaning more towards the second. In interiors, the goal is to sequentially pass the trials that lead to the next evolution of the plot. Discreetly more open, but substantially limited and guided by short-range objectives, is the experience in the park. Finally, the traditional driving sequences are characterized by scripted and linear progression and an outdated concept. If previously we had the impression of moving a glass cube on a lake of ice (but didn't Eden Games have its background in driving titles?), finally now these sections are also refined and are more fluid. However, it will also be possible to drive at other times, with more freedom, darting through hordes of possessed people who will try to drag us out of the vehicle. Perhaps never as in these cases do we realize that more than within a palpable distressing atmosphere that acts above all on our unconscious, the title keeps us in a state of threat that translates into a constant attack on our safety, to be safeguarded by preferring direct confrontation. All of this is certainly amplified by the constant lack of diffused lights and the expressionistic use of shadows, which increase the apocalyptic tone of the scenes. It's just a pity not to have used an ~adaptive~ soundtrack instead of a classic one, that is capable of changing in real time adapting to the events in progress. Comment Although the most obvious problems have been resolved, the merits and limitations remain essentially the same. We also have to ask ourselves if it was legitimate to expect more, if those six months were really enough to substantially raise the quality of the work already done, and even if in a period of severe economic crisis the budget for doing so was really enough to pay wages and cover additional development costs. In the end, going alone into the darkness proves, despite its flaws, an inclusive and at times surprising experience.
