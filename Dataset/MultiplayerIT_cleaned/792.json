{"name": "Elite Dangerous Odyssey - La recensione di un'espansione fondamentale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/elite-dangerous-odyssey-recensione.html", "text": "Elite Dangerous is somewhat reminiscent of the fake bumblebee, which in physics shouldn't be able to fly, but he doesn't know it and that's why he flies anyway. The Frontier game is the antithesis of the modern video game: difficult, challenging, very slow, yet here we are writing the review of Elite Dangerous Odyssey, its latest fundamental expansion with absolute enthusiasm. The space simulator continues to grow, too slowly as we have described in detail in the special that retraces its entire history, but it grows nonetheless, and without worrying about the public and the most absurd requests that would like it to be profoundly different from how it is and from as it always was. We recall, for the uninitiated, that the first chapter of Elite debuted in 1984, almost thirty-eight years ago. Horizons and odysseys Elite Dangerous Odyssey: being able to disembark from the ship in the new orbital and ground stations makes the game much more varied, fun and human! After the Horizon expansion, which allowed us to land in the desolate lands of planets devoid of atmosphere, Elite Dangerous Odyssey is that next step, promised for some time, which opens up the exploration of celestial bodies alive and much more interesting in morphology. in the colors and surprises they will be able to reserve for us. But the most interesting and innovative element of Odyssey is that once we get out of our spaceships we will no longer be limited to the SRV, the agile landing craft equipped with six driving wheels, but we will finally be able to walk on virtual legs, with all that follows. . Elite Dangerous thus discovers another layer of complexity that gives the gameplay new variables and new emotions. However, don't be fooled by the weapon in the foreground, by the possibility of jumping between the roofs of the outposts with agile effectiveness: Odyssey does not betray the simulation aspect at the base of the project and also extends the approach to this new iteration with phenomenal results. Alpha Beta Gamma Elite Dangerous Odyssey: The weapons are all well characterized and like the different suits they can be engineered to make them increasingly reliable, versatile and powerful. There are problems. We noticed that something had gone wrong immediately, after all how can you organize a test phase with an alpha version of the game, if then this has to be finished and distributed in the various digital stores within just a month? Unfortunately what we feared has come true: Elite Dangerous Odyssey has been available for purchase and download for a few days already, but bugs and discrepancies between the game systems make it in fact the very beta that Frontier seemed to want to skip at the foot of the game. But things will improve, they are already doing so: in a few days three hotfixes have been distributed, two quite substantial ones, almost like those real patches that will arrive in any case by return of post. Once this critical phase has been overcome, Odyssey will leave a deep groove between the before and the after, month after month becoming a fundamental purchase both for those who have loved the game since the first hour, and for all those who, thanks to this expansion, will feel irresistibly attracted to this extraordinary game project. First steps Elite Dangerous Odyssey: Starting from scratch has allowed us to experience the experience from the eyes of a new user and while it is always very distracting, Elite has never been friendlier. For the occasion we have deleted our saves starting from scratch and the new beginning is without a doubt the most engaging ever. With the new expansion installed, the adventure begins with a tutorial introduced by Odyssey (which can also be tackled without starting over as we did) which explains in detail all the new functions of the game, subsequently leaving us on a space station where we can continue the learning phase. learning through the ~old~ tutorial that will explain the rudiments of space flight, the latter having already been present for a few years. Once this segment has also been completed, we will finally be free to choose our destiny, losing ourselves in the infinite possibilities granted by Elite Dangerous, with Odyssey more diverse than ever. Driving a ship the game remains essentially the same, like the missions present, and even on land there are quests that can be completed through an SRV, as is the practice from the Horizon expansion onwards, which for the uninitiated It's now free for anyone who purchases or has already purchased the base game. The right dress Elite Dangerous Odyssey: Planets now hold totally new biological secrets. Phenomena that can be studied to earn quite a few credits. Elite Dangerous Odyssey's missions are of a much different caliber, and usually have to do with new outposts that mayemo find on the almost infinite planets of the game. And they are not easy at all: expect to fail over and over again before figuring out how to act and advance in these new situations. Odyssey is not Call of Duty, anything further, and its mechanics make each intrusion an extremely challenging task to complete. At our disposal we will have new weapons, new suits and of course new tools essential to bring home the result and earn enough credits to cover any expenses. There are currently four suits, the pilot one is immediately available to us, while the other three will have to be purchased at a high price and will allow access to tools designed to cover every role: the Artemis Suit is the most suitable for the exploration and is sold together with a DNA sequencer to study the simple life forms present on the planets, the Dominator Suit is instead designed for combat and is the only one to allow the use of two main weapons, finally there is the Maverick Suit dedicated to scavenging and equipped with a welder that will give access to panels of various types. All suits include a Profile Analyzer which, in addition to remotely studying the different NPCs by detecting their equipment, allows you to clone their personal details in order to gain access to initially restricted areas. Another tool that is always present is the Energylink, capable of transferring energy from certain devices to our suit or short-circuiting them, a secondary function that can also be used to silently eliminate an enemy. Space pirates Elite Dangerous Odyssey: some missions will be easier if all the means and tools at our disposal are used strategically. The suits have an energy reserve that will decrease over time, much faster if we use the instrumentation just described or when we activate the fundamental shields to survive enemy blows. We will be able to recharge the batteries through special terminals, or by using portable batteries that can be purchased, exactly like medikits and grenades, in the stores present in the ground bases or in orbit. Naturally this equipment can also be found on site, but the risk of being caught stealing is always very high and if you want to act in a certain way it is better to aim for self-sufficiency. In fact, the rules that manage the AI are subject to many variables, primarily those dictated by our reputation with a particular faction. Even moving through a peaceful outpost needs attention: an NPC could request an inspection and if we don't allow it, stopping waiting for the instruments to do their analysis, this could become suspicious and react accordingly, even activating a compromising general alarm. Freestyle The outposts are divided into several buildings, each with its own clear function. In the last mission we tried to complete, we were asked to steal a given item hidden in an area of the science building. To remain unobtrusive, we landed the ship about a kilometer away on a well-protected plateau and approached from there aboard the SRV, which we parked behind a small hill close to the base. We went to the opposite side of our objective where we shorted some systems with the Energylink, which attracted the attention of a group of soldiers who immediately set about looking for the cause of the malfunction, reactivating the switched off systems and leaving in the meantime the area in which we were called to act was discovered. During this time, we knocked out a scientist with level 3 access, cloned his identity, and gained access to the target building. Upon entering, however, we were caught in the act by another scientist who managed to raise the alarm before being knocked out. The action should have remained anonymous, and the event effectively made the job impossible to complete. Even if the missions do not yet seem to have the variety of those that can be tackled on a spaceship, their course involves many variables, allowing for very creative approaches. I shoot you and confuse you Elite Dangerous Odyssey: cooperating is extremely fun, but the game seems to go out of its way to make the process awkward, difficult. Enemy AI also makes Odyssey's missions so much fun. This is not omniscient like in other games, and will decide what to do based on the last position in which we will be sighted, instead of always unrealistically knowing our position. Not a small detail that allows you to continuously change tactics, to confuse the enemies in order to get around them or to allow us to escape without a scratch, a fine or even worse, a bounty on our heads. In the midst of a shootout it is necessary to stay on the move, making the most of the agility granted to us by the jetpack at our disposal, so as not to be surrounded and shot down in no time at all. The AI knows how to behave and above all how to move: like us, it will soon learn to exploit the roofs of the various structures to have a tactical view of the battlefield or more simply to take us by surprise with a dangerous barrage. However, much more than moving and fighting in an SRV, the day and night cycle will drastically change our approach. Just like in the space gameplay, the geopolitical simulation of the galaxy will be able to trigger conflicts on the planets, giving life to hilarious combat zones in which to take the side of one of the two sides. In these cases, the number of enemies on screen is quite high, putting even the best equipped soldiers to the test, as well as the most armored computers. Lights and colors As you can see, and they certainly don't end here, the additions are different and all substantial compared to the classic Elite Dangerous with the Horizon expansion. Elite Dangerous Odyssey also introduces tons of different materials, items to collect, resell or use to engineer suits and weapons that, just like spaceships, can be improved and improved further. Two steps forward, and one back, were also taken from a technical point of view. For example, the generation of planets has not always led to substantial improvements and once extremely fascinating stars now appear flatter, less mysterious. The lighting has also been revised and although in some situations the improvement is tangible, generally the game appears too dark, to the point that we doubt it could be a choice of the developers but a real bug that afflicts the new shaders used. Nothing to worry about, other planets have acquired an unprecedented fascination, also thanks to the presence of the atmosphere that illuminates the skies once dominated by the black of the universe. For example, we landed on a planet whose atmosphere was 100% oxygen, a place where it is not recommended to light a cigarette but which a perpetual purplish and iridescent glow made unforgettable. And what about the emotion of finding yourself for the first time under a sky of an intense blue, very similar to that of our Earth? Planets with an atmosphere now also have more or less rich vegetation, procedural but based on simulation algorithms that make their presence surprisingly realistic. A foundation for everyone Elite Dangerous Odyssey: Ground Outposts are very different from each other due to their procedural nature. Some will have the appearance of laboratories, others of real service stations for unwary travellers. To combine the contents of Odyssey with those of the classic Elite Dangerous we think the bases, now explorable and usually equipped with a bar (where damn you can't sip drinks), a shop where you can buy weapons, suits and consumables, terminals for missions and a kiosk where you can book a trip on the new taxi system, plus other surprises which we are happy to let you discover. Here, at least in the busiest systems, it is also quite easy to meet other players, with whom to organize expeditions or simply have a chat between one mission and another. All this gives the Frontier game a renewed variety that makes it more addictive and addictive than ever. Being able to go ashore, admire one's ship through this unprecedented perspective, feeling so small, insignificant and fragile, acts psychologically on the user, thus introducing not only unprecedented mechanics, but also actually new, extraordinarily powerful emotions. Near future Elite Dangerous Oddyssey: Where do you want to go and what do you want to be today? A bounty hunter? A key pawn in corporate espionage? An alien biology researcher? Fate, as always, is totally in your hands. With Odyssey, Elite Dangerous finally has all the features it needs to grow freely in every direction. For this reason, in addition to expanding and refining the mechanics introduced with this new expansion, calibrating and balancing the new weapons and the enemy artificial intelligence, it is more fundamental than ever to carry on the project by looking at initially unfeasible functions, reviewing in depth what previously it was not possible to offer in a more interesting form", "date": "2021-05-25", "grade": "8.4"}
