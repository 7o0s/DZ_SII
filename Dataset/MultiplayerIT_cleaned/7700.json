The final battle of Agravain is also the tutorial for Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters and the narrative hub that will kick off the main campaign, which starts immediately after. The Baleful Edict, the spaceship led by Agravain, suffers enormous damage during the battle and is ready to return to Titan for repairs, when it is requisitioned by an inquisitor, Vakir, who wants to carry out research on the system of Tyarteus, where according to her, the evil god Nurgle is generating an army of infected, spreading a disease called Bloom, which then threatens the entire universe. So the player will not only have to comply with the Inquisitor's requests, but also be able to repair the ship during the mission, if he does not want to succumb to the new threat. All with great satisfaction, as you will discover by reading the review of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, a really interesting follower of XCOM. The management part Some Gray Knights deployed Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is divided into two distinct sections: the managerial one, in which you are on the spaceship, the Baleful Edict, and the tactical one that takes place on the battlefield, in which you directly guide the Gray Knights. Let's take care of the first. The primary objective to be pursued is to discover the origin of the epidemic, convincing the upper floors to give us support for the mission. Basically we have to show that the inquisitor's intuition is correct, going around the planets of the Tyrtaeus system and carrying out missions where Bloom manifests itself more strongly. Usually three missions are activated at a time which run out after a certain time, becoming unavailable and marking a progression of the epidemic where we have not intervened. You must therefore choose which one to play by optimizing travel times and upgrading the spaceship to make it faster. There are some small variations during the campaign, but the game structure, from this point of view, is quite rigid and offers no particular ideas. From time to time we are requested to report to the Grand Master of the Gray Knights, to notify him of the discoveries made and to attempt to obtain his support. On these occasions it is also possible to make choices at the narrative level, for example by following their orders to the letter or bypassing them in some way, which determine the improvement or worsening of relationships with the characters who populate the ship, each placed in a specific section. In terms of operations, the player has to perform several before fighting. First he must repair the ship's hull relying on the tech-priest Lunete Ozmarantis, so as to restore all the defensive and support systems for the Gray Knights. For example, some turrets can be rebuilt, which will be useful in the advanced stages of the campaign to deal with certain events, or new lodgings can be built to have more units available that can be deployed on the battlefield, useful when there are many wounded (the units recover by resting for several days) and many losses. The management part takes place on the spaceship Another very important section is that of research, entrusted to the inquisitor Vakir, which allows you to unlock new skills and the so-called Stratagems, powers that can be used during missions that give advantages to the Gray Knights, making them more effective against cultists and other enemies. Some searches are also functional to the progression of the story, because they allow you to better understand the movements of Nurgle. The fundamental section is that of the lodgings, in which the Gray Knights are managed. It is here that the equipment is decided, assigning the weapons requisitioned on the battlefield; skill points are distributed in case of level growth; everyone's conditions are evaluated for the next mission and accessories are decided. Will we be able to stop Nurgle? Here it is also possible to study the differences between the four available classes, each with its own skill tree: Purger, Interceptor, Apothecary and Justicar. Not to forget the editor, which allows you to change the appearance of each knight and more on that later. After completing all the required operations, you must select a mission (or run the time quickly in case there are none available), then you can review the team again, decide if you want to attempt an epic quest to get more loot at the end of the mission (egexample using three units instead of four or avoiding taking a certain amount of damage throughout the mission) and, finally, entering the fray. On a mission Managing the Gray Knights is a key part of the game Once on the battlefield, Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters shows even more its debt to the XCOM series, of which it fortunately takes up the best aspects, especially the tactical ones. The selected Grician Knights find themselves on procedurally generated maps created with the biome of the visited planet, divided into square boxes. The objectives they have to achieve can be different, but usually require the destruction of something, be it enemies or structures. Having taken a look at the area, you can start moving the individual units in the direction you deem most appropriate. Usually the maps are not very large, so it is difficult to get lost, but it is worth studying them for a moment to decide how to approach objectives and dangers, for example by exploiting areas with more cover or elevated areas, which give a significant tactical advantage. The game system is based on the use of action points, which allow you to perform a certain number of moves according to the will of the individual knight. The gameplay is very reminiscent of XCOM So you can travel more or less squares with a single movement, or you can carry out multiple attacks. It all depends on the context in which you find yourself. The units are managed using a classic turn-based system, which first sees the player make all his moves, then the CPU replies by moving his checkers. Each turn increases the Bloom bloom in the level, which causes random adverse effects against the team, such as the arrival of reinforcements or a permanent decrease in Willpower for the rest of the mission. The Gray Knights of them can attack from range, using different firearms, or they can strike blows with their powerful melee weapons. In any case it is possible to apply bonuses, which vary according to the type of unit and its growth (read: how the points are distributed when it has grown in level), so as to make the attacks more effective. In some cases it is also possible to hit the individual limbs of the enemies, to have various advantages, such as stunning them, or disabling some attacks. Maps are procedurally generated As the game progresses, units become specialized and become stronger with certain weapons, also unlocking special abilities that can be used on the battlefield, such as the ~Emperor's Light~ which blinds enemies and gives other penalties, or the ability to give a warp charge to hits. The enemies of them can be of different types. These are usually Bloom-infected creatures, but there are also variously armed cultists and Chaos Space Marines, the latter augmented by the blight. From time to time we also have to deal with big bosses in fights that see us engaged in specially designed scenarios. These are very large enemies with plague-related special abilities, usually very difficult to take down. They're positioned to underscore certain narrative twists and by themselves can slaughter an entire group of Gray Knights if you're not careful. Not only war, but also characters to talk to... about war Overall, the gameplay is very similar to that of XCOM, based as it is on the search for adequate cover and on the study of the battlefield and enemy positioning to decide the next move. The game system is indeed very flexible and allows different approaches to individual missions, so much so that the player can develop his tactics, depending on the units in the field and their strengths and weaknesses. The presence of many interactive points in the levels is interesting, which allow you to take advantage of the maps even in an offensive key. For example, it is possible to detonate certain objects, so as to involve all neighboring units, or it is possible to grab others, throwing them at the opponents. If desired, entire pieces of the map can also be brought down, like columns, over the unfortunate people, crushing them without too much concern. Technical part Technically it's not bad at all Graphically Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is an excellent job, relatively to the genre to which it belongs. There's actually nothing that makes you cry for a miracle, but the units are well done, both the Gray Knights and the enemies (the bigger ones in particular), and the side elements are decidedly effective. In particular, it is impossible not to notice the emphasis placed on certain battle animations, which sometimes give real adren dischargesalina. Perhaps there is too much repetition in the scenarios, but it can be accepted, given the work done overall and the fact that we are always talking about a turn-based strategy game. The management section is also well done, with the various environments of the spaceship which are very well cared for and the movements in space which are underlined by excellent animations. The character editor deserves a separate note. If desired, the player can completely modify the aesthetics of the units, changing the individual parts, including writings and accessories. Some shots can be aimed The cosmetic changes have no effect on the gameplay, but fans of miniatures and customization will be happy to be able to create the Gray Knights of their dreams. All the others will be able to pretend that this feature does not exist at all and live well anyway. To be slightly less incisive is the soundtrack. In terms of effects, the game does its duty, underlining each action with specific sounds and giving suitable voices to the characters, while in terms of music there is not much to note, in the sense that we are faced with the classic tracks put there to accompany the action without disturbing it too much, underlining the most emphatic moments, which you end up not paying attention to after a few hours of play. It's not badly done, mind you, but there's nothing that makes you remember, so to speak.", "date": "2022-05-04", "grade": "8.0"}
