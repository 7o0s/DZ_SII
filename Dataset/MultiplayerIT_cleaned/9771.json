There are, however, more traditional titles and in some ways ~difficult~ to offer in a portable context such as that of the iPhone and iPod Touch. This is the case with SEED: Rise of Darkness and the sequel that we are now reviewing, SEED 2 - Vortex of War, two classic-style RPGs that aim at people who are fans of the genre rather than at the usual ~casual~ users who, however, often makes the fortune of many developers and publishers. The first episode of the series, which became free almost immediately while offering an in-game microtransaction system, was characterized by a mediocre technical realization and a gameplay devoid of particularly original ideas. The release of SEED 2 was therefore awaited with a certain curiosity, which from the very beginning presents itself with a significantly improved graphics sector and with some interesting ideas regarding playability. Unfortunately, the Chillingo product still suffers from what appears to be a less than elegant development phase, and this too is a factor visible from the very first start: by default, the game's graphics splash at a crazy speed, so much so that the animations that represent the ~breath~ of the characters appear ridiculously accelerated (they almost seem to ~bounce~ on the pitch...) and the same control system feels the blow. It almost feels like a PC game developed ten years ago running on a current configuration without any optimizations. The mystery is soon revealed: from the options screen it is possible to adjust the speed of the action to somehow remedy the typical dead times of each RPG. By decreasing this value, the animations return to their normal speed and the controls lend themselves much more willingly to some combinations, but the question arises: wasn't there a better way to remedy such a problem? The pursuit of happiness As mentioned at the beginning, our Litta has settled in the village and lives a quiet life, working as a teacher at the local school. One night, however, a particularly real dream prompts him to leave once again, to visit now desolate lands whose inhabitants need help. The game structure combines typical RPG elements with sometimes original solutions. The story goes on as we complete some quests, which are ~activated~ by interacting with the other characters and whose complexity varies considerably as the hours go by: in the early stages we will find ourselves carrying out really simple missions, for example, how can those in which you collect a certain number of objects or you have to eliminate some creatures. The combat system works in real time and the clashes are not random: when we face a creature, we do it ~live~ and without being magically transported to an alternative place, just like in an action game with a top-down view. And speaking of action games, it must be said that the offensive maneuvers in SEED 2 - Vortex of War can also be quite spectacular, releasing really effective and beautiful attacks depending on the weapon used. Combos can be performed by holding down the attack button, running attacks (by pressing a direction on the d-pad twice) and charged attacks (holding down the button), specializing in three different categories depending on the instrument: the sword is lethal at close range and is tied to the ~warrior~ class; the gun works very well from a distance and is related to the ~ranger~ class; finally, the magic stick is a multi-purpose tool and is linked to the ~magician~ class. The interesting thing is that the development of the character changes according to the weapon we decide to use, also from an aesthetic point of view, and therefore once the game is completed it is possible to play it again by choosing a different tool to be able to observe its evolutions. In short, we have a simple and solid structure, combined with a fun combat system. Does this mean that SEED 2 stands as a reference title in the panorama of RPGs available on the App Store? Unfortunately not, since there are still many uncertainties that undermine the enjoyment of the Chillingo product: the problem exposed at the beginning of the review is really annoying, the graphics seem to have undergone a ~bicubic resize~ so blurry, the music istoo repetitive and the control system (four directions!) does not work as it should.
