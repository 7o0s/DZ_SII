Starfleet Command III recreates the battles of the famous board game Starfleet Battles in a splendid 3D scenario. Compared to the two previous titles where the scenario was that of the Original Star Trek Series, this third title instead is set in the world of The Next Generation... a good thing, a bad thing? Furthermore, the number of tactical possibilities of SFC I and SFC II has been significantly reduced, simplifying the game interface and turning it into something different. Hardcore gamers who are passionate about the realism of the first two SFCs will therefore be disappointed by this choice of programmers, motivated by trying at all costs to make the game attractive to all palates. And these will be the only criticisms leveled at the game on my part, a game, moreover, that defining beautiful is very little. SFC III is a great game, even if it's not exactly what I expected from the sequel to SFC II! The story and the game The alliance between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire represented a turning point in the balance of power of the quadrant, and peace was assured for a long time. But the threat of the Romulans, and the mysterious presence of the Borg risk making useless all the efforts made so far to defend this ~peaceful~ situation. The alliance between the Federation and the Klingons is now also represented by a new space station, whose existence, however, is endangered by the Romulans. The game allows you to play as the commander of a ship of the Federation, the Klingon Empire, the Romulans or a ~classic cube~ of the Borg. So much for the Campaign mode. There are also two other game modes: Skirmish and Multiplayer. Speaking of Multiplayer, it seems interesting to be able to connect to the Dynaverse, choose which empire to join and then play in this persistent (or almost) online universe with your network friends. Graphics, Sound and Gameplay Graphically speaking, the game isn't great. Of course, compared to its predecessors the leap in quality is remarkable but from an aesthetic and detail point of view it could have been improved even more. The sound however is very good. Patrick Stewart's voice is splendid (especially for those who have also seen some episodes in the original language of the series) and the sound effects are really well done. As for the gameplay, as we said initially, the game is simpler than its predecessors, but also more immediate. It's easy to pick up and play right away and immerse yourself completely in the world of Star Trek. However, there are some glaring bugs that could have been avoided. For example, the ~follow target~ command causes you to continue following the enemy ship even when it activates the cloaking device, which, of course, should be impossible. Nice idea instead to be able to improve your crew by ~gaining experience~ during the game. Comment The simplicity of SFC III might disappoint fans of the original board game, but the engaging storyline of the campaigns and the ability to play in the Dynaverse make this title a MUST HAVE for all Star Trek fans! It's also a great product for newcomers to the tactical combat rules of Starfleet Battles! PRO Immersive storyline Possibility of huge battles in the Dynaverse It's simpler than its predecessors It's Star Trek!!! CONS Some bugs Not great graphics It's simpler than its predecessors The return of the Enterprise Being a Star Trek enthusiast I was immediately afraid, as soon as I got my hands on the game packaging, that I wasn't suitable for an objective review of this new Starfleet Command. Actually, in the end I was able to correctly weigh both the pros and cons of the Taldren product and although overall my judgment is very positive, some things ~acclaimed~ by my overseas colleagues left me perplexed, for example the simplification of the game interface... but first things first.", "date": "2003-01-15", "grade": null}
