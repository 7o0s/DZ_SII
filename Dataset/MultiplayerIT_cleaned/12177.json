If, on the other hand, you are here by chance, or there is an element of this game that struck you so much that you wanted to know more about it, a summary is a must for you, and it will be quick and painless: The Forgotten City was a mod for Skyrim , but not just any mod but the best, the most original and one of the most downloaded ever. Far from Skyrim Almost three million downloads later and a prestigious Writer's Guild award never before awarded to a mod script, the authors of The Forgotten City have decided to make the big leap in quality by trying to turn their amateur project into a game real. And it took them some time: the three who hide behind the name Modern Storyteller took four long years to reach the finish line, and to make many much more armored teams eat the dust. By now anyone can get their hands on engines that are as easy as they are powerful, which are the same ones used by the most famous software houses, but being able to create an experience like The Forgotten City in three is truly a remarkable result. Over the years, software engineer Alex Goss and graphic designer John Eyre have managed to build everything they needed of Skyrim into Unreal Engine 4, while writer Nick Pearce has modified and expanded the mod's storyline allowing him to be free from any element related to Bethesda intellectual property. Simply put, The Forgotten City has grown to stand on its own two feet, and now we're going to find out how far it's managed to go. Welcome to the forgotten city The Forgotten City: The faces of the inhabitants are fluctuating but on average better than those of Skyrim, easy considering that the cast consists of practically only a dozen NPCs. Rome, present day. Engaged in archaeological interests on the banks of the Tiber, our alter-ego explores some ruins until, suddenly, the mosaic under his feet turns out to be a trap door with magical connotations. The floor opens, the fall is long, time stops like the protagonist's breath which continues to fall, to fall again. He is found on the banks of a river, next to him is a mysterious woman who, after quick pleasantries, asks him if he can check what happened to his friend and helper who snuck into what appears to be an ancient tomb. There's not much choice but to agree, and so the adventure begins. We have a flashlight with us and it is still functional. With it we make our way through tunnels and large corridors. The white marble, the red drapes, the typical Doric columns and dozens of solid gold statues that seem to have attempted a rambling escape outwards, away from their elegant and imperial supports. An alienating experience that reaches its climax in the encounter with the true protagonist of this game: the forgotten city is finally before us, an immaculate prison with no way out, governed by a single draconian divine law that is about to be broken, but by whom and for what reason? Those who die see each other again The Forgotten City: What do these solid gold statues represent? What if they were the result of a curse? In this Roman outpost built by who knows who, nestled in the depths of the earth where light filters only through a large hole in the rocky vault, the citizens are few and bewildered, and they don't know when and how they ended up here. Everyone knows that we have just arrived, but few will risk asking questions about our adventurous journey since they already know the answer, but no one is aware of the fact that, unlike the others, we come from the future and who knows, we could be the one who succeeds to break this disturbing captivity. We have only one man in power, to challenge him in the next elections another nobleman with opposite intentions, on whom we can rely if our interests coincide with his, but he is the first who will immediately exploit our arrival with a task as surprising as important: someone wants to break the Golden Rule, the only law of the city that promises to kill all the inhabitants if even one will commit a sin, and having just arrived we are the only ones who can be trusted. The rule does not specify what can be defined as a sin and what not: stealing and killing certainly are, but is telling a lie serious enough to make the prophecy come true? In this dystopia, we will have to understand how things work, get to know everyone who survives in the Forgotten City, and in doing so maybei discover a way to escape by returning to the present as well. Just a sinner The Forgotten City: there is some combat in this adventure too, but most of the time it will be better to avoid any danger by relying on the well-aimed kicks of which we are capable. But the rule is destined to be broken even sooner than expected, we will be responsible and we will be responsible over and over again, because only in this way will we be able to rewind the tape and start over as if we had just arrived, but with the knowledge gathered from each attempt . A time loop that recalls the typical rogue-like gimmick, re-proposed here not to challenge us at the tip of the blade, but with logic. Every time we commit a sin, we will be teleported to a dreamlike version of the Forgotten City, here divine souls will shoot magical arrows at the inhabitants which, when hit, will turn into statues. Our aim is to return to the entrance to the city without being hit ourselves, in order to restore events as they were at the origin of our arrival. We are a bit sorry to reveal these details to you, but since they are the basis of the gameplay of this title, it is necessary to do so: one of the most fascinating aspects is in fact that at the beginning you don't know if you can transgress the Golden Rule, you do everything to don't fall for it, then it happens and you think it's something to avoid in the future, until you finally understand that breaking it repeatedly is just what it takes to unravel the mystery surrounding The Forgotten City ... and above all that you are not the only one who figured it out. Break the rule The Forgotten City: Is there a way out of the Forgotten City? It's up to us to find out... The time loop allows us to choose new questions and new answers, to change our behavior towards characters of which we have learned new fundamental details, to anticipate the collapse of a temple to save who we want to save, and punish who we want to punish. Resetting the Forgotten City will allow us to overcome particularly complex puzzles, to collect important new tools, to change events so that all the pieces of the puzzle compose the reality we prefer, a possible keystone that will finally open the doors to one of the four endings possible.The Forgotten City is a game of investigation, deduction, with a predominant role-playing nature, where fights are very few and as much as possible to be avoided, where you will soon get your hands on a magical bow capable of turning even courses of waterfall. There is talk in The Forgotten City, there is a lot of talk, and exploration is no different for a mixture that seems to be placed in the middle of the trio of wonders made up of Skyrim, Myst and the little-known Shadow of Memories by Konami. Rethink and rebuild Even though The Forgotten City has been completely rethought and rebuilt from the original mod, the fact that it was born within Skyrim is still clear in the visual style adopted, especially during the dialogues, and in some mechanics. Graphically and technically it's not the best, but if we consider that it was created by three people, the result is actually incredible. To ennoble the work, as well as its original gameplay, the rather inspired soundtrack takes care of it, but above all the dubbing of the different characters always entrusted to actors of a certain level. The voices of the protagonists help us to immediately take seriously a product which in any case, regardless of the tastes of each of us, deserves all possible respect and above all to be tried firsthand. Maybe find even just a fragment of The Forgotten City in a high-budget title, a game corner where you can put your sword and unsheath your mind, words, but we'll settle without problems for the same concept developed by a team three times bigger, with triple the budget and who knows if we won't really get there, sooner or later.", "date": "2021-07-27", "grade": "7.8"}
