{"name": "Hollywood Star", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hollywood-star.html", "text": "The Sims is one of the most successful video game series of all time, and which are also well represented in the mobile arena. So far there has been no one who has taken up a challenge as complex as that of tackling the EA title on its own turf, but we know that on mobile, things are much simpler and the risks much lower. This is how this Hollywood Star was born, which in terms of structure and ideas clearly refers to The Sims and puts us in the shoes of a young actor who takes a house in Hollywood and finds an agent to pay his dues and climb the ladder of the star system until you reach the top. After creating a character (choosing gender, appearance, clothes, etc.), we will find ourselves in our apartment receiving a call from an agent who looks after our interests and who is trying to propose us for roles. What in The Sims are the basic needs (eating, sleeping, having fun, communicating, etc.), in Hollywood Star take on a connotation more linked to our work interests. This means that we will have to keep an eye on our budget and deadlines, and work to improve our skills and our appearance enough to aspire to some small part in a film. The map shows us the different locations where we can go: the bar, the spa, the office, the school, etc. In each of them we will have to carry out different activities, for example working to support ourselves, training to keep in shape, carrying out beauty treatments and so on. We will be able to talk to all the characters we meet, trying to hit the right topic and maybe establish a friendship. We will come across a scheme that shows a sort of ranking of importance within the star system, and it is clear that becoming familiar with an important name will only make things easier for us. Between one thing and another, we will still have to check the gossip magazines daily and follow the advice of our agent, in order to gradually gain more importance in the environment. The technical realization of Hollywood Star is not great, unfortunately. The locations boast a good level of detail and a good use of colors, and are represented with an isometric view. The latter, however, does not go hand in hand with a control and detection system that does not allow us to go diagonally and that finds obstacles even where there shouldn't be any. The characters are quite recognizable despite their size, but have decidedly mediocre animation. For the rest, we have an essential sound sector and a very simple control system, which sees the joystick responsible for moving the character and the FIRE button for interacting with the environment. PRO Well designed locations Lots of things to take into account It will take quite a while to achieve success... AGAINST ... but that doesn't mean you won't give up first Poorly handled character movement Quite boring and limited", "date": "2007-12-14", "grade": "S.V."}
