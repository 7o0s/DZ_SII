{"name": "Il pianeta delle scimmie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-pianeta-delle-scimmie.html", "text": "Ulysses to the rescue The name of your alter ego is Ulysses (Ulysses in America). You were on a mission in space with other colleagues aboard your spaceship when an accident forced you to make a crash landing on a desert planet that at first sight was uninhabited. Well, would you believe that planet is Earth instead, your very affectionate planet that gave you birth? There is only one small detail: you have taken a leap into the future, what you see is the Earth of 2000 years later, one of your friends who was with you on a mission has passed away and the other two lost their tracks. The question arises spontaneously in your minds: By whom, if it is an uninhabited planet?. Well, for once it is nature, in this case the species of monkeys, that reigns supreme: it is precisely the ancestors of the human being who are the undisputed ladies of the blue planet par excellence, it is up to you to discover the causes that led to this inexplicable event, obviously trying not to die and trying to infiltrate the dominant political system! Graphics and sound Are you ready for the usual pitted on system requirements? The minimum requirements requested by Ubi Soft to bring Planet of the Apes home to you are: P2 300, 64 mb of ram, 3d card with 8 mb of ram, 650 mb of hard disk space, Direct X 8 (mandatory, but if not you have are included, lucky you!) and a decent sound card; according to myself, it is better not to go below a P3/ Athlon 700, at least 128 mb of ram (with what it costs nowadays it is better to abound further! Ed), a nice GeForce 2 Mx (both because it is cheap and because it is optimized for games in Direct X 8, unlike the Kyro II, however very valid, especially with games that run with DX 7), over a gigabyte of free space on the hard disk for the complete installation (to avoid swaps here and there) and any nice Sound Blaster Live to enjoy the sound optimized with EAX. Testing for this review was conducted with a P3 933, 256mb ram 133mhz, GeForce 2 Gts and Sound Blaster Live 5.1, max install; the fluidity of sixty frames per second is unfortunately not stable (yet I certainly don't have a 486mahh Ed), but the videogame created by Visiware Studios for Ubisoft, does not lose frame after frame due to excessive tussle on the screen, exaggeration of particle effects, environmental cubic mapping and bullshit of this type, a sign of a programming that is certainly not excellent. Graphics and sound If at first glance seeing everything superfluid with the resolution of 1024x768 with 32-bit color depth makes you smile, the aforementioned slowdowns annoy a lot, also because the monkeys are not made with a large number of polygons and textures (on my Dreamcast I've seen a lot better, even with older games, despite the older hardware), the special effects range from the already seen (cubed), not amazing the spectum, the player, to the questionable. Non-irresistible backdrops, objects to interact with sufficiently created and, as already mentioned, sprites with a questionable polygonal-textural realization, create decided dissatisfaction in the user who, increasingly powerful and expensive hardware in hand, wants ever more fun, innovative games (such as ' it is right and sacrosanct that it is) but also visual creations worthy of the name, works that bring the videogame product closer to the work of art, leaving miles behind the term ~videogame~, which is still so despised by the mass media, psychologists and pseudo connoisseurs that they are. Ultimately, those who hoped that Max Payne would become an aesthetic goal that all programmers aspired to overcome should think again: at least Visiware Studios didn't even try. The soundtrack of the game is not bad at all, the English dubbing is fairly successful (don't worry, there are subtitles in Italian!) and the sound effects, if you have Sound Blaster Live and adequate speakers, do their duty (often but not always), extolling the positional audio which will hopefully become the standard in the most recent future and not the (very pleasant) exception. A monkey game? The genre of game chosen by the boys of Visiware Studios is the arcade adventure 3d, so we will have platforms to jump, enemies to return to the sender, puzzles to solve and everything that successful franchises such as Onimusha, Dino Crisis, Alice di McGee, Heavy Metal Fakk 2 and Rune. Too bad that Planet of the Apes can't go alongside these unmissable masterpieces for a number of reasons that we are now going to list. First, console fans chand you are still not used to the ~mouse & keyboard~ combination, know that you will not be able to play with the joypad, a very strange choice given that the style of play lends itself well to the use of the peripheral par excellence in the console field. Right from the instruction manual (whose paper quality is one of the best things about the entire packaging, but let's leave it out!) we notice how the game distributed by Ubi Soft is based on 3 topical moments: explore, fight and advance in silence; certainly an excellent idea on paper but decidedly badly made. The game system implemented is not the best but with a minimum of practice (and a little frustration, it should be said), you get used to it, it's a pity that other elements take the field to worsen the already bad opinion that one has of the game: the virtual camera system often misfires, and in a game like this where locating objects is as essential as having a functional view during fights, this is rather unpleasant. A monkey game? We come to the fights: primitive and elementary, given that a key is used for combat, a single key then, the exact same button which, combined with the function key to go back, gives our Ulysses the opportunity to parry enemy blows. Honestly, the ~Stealth~ component of the game seems to me rather useless given the ease described above to shoot down as many fighting monkeys as possible while when it comes to exploring, the fanatics of the aforementioned adventures will be able to breathe a sigh of relief even if in the bad sense of the term : The puzzles included in the Planet of the Apes personal computer tie-in are those solved hundreds of times. Find an object in an area and, coincidentally, to access another location, the door will open with the newly recovered item: nothing too difficult, so to speak. Monkey, go back! We have reached the conclusions, for some they may have arrived even earlier but it is good to summarize in a few lines the qualities (where are they?) and defects (many, alas) of the game produced by Ubi Soft and programmed by Visiware Studios. Graphically we have really gone back in time since the glories of Alice by Mcgee, Heavy Metal Fakk 2 and Rune are not touched in the slightest while the musical accompaniment and positional sound effects are of a more than discreet level. The fun that at the beginning is thought to be present in massive doses gradually diminishes, either due to the mediocre artificial intelligence of the enemies, or due to a slightly drunk camera or a game structure that, in general, struggles to entertain the gamer and is unable, at the same time, to keep up with the times. A mediocre game, if you really want an action adventure worthy of the name, look elsewhere, if you want a good game inspired by the Planet of the Apes well, forget it altogether, unless you overlook serious defects or shortcomings. A famous franchise! In the 2001-2002 film season that began a couple of months ago, one of the most controversial titles was Planet Of The Apes, directed by Tim Burton (director of Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow , Beetlejuice, etc etc). As happens with the most awaited titles (films, video games, music CDs, anime that they are) the public has divided into two opposing factions, those who have madly loved the film in question and those who have regretted the ticket price, both because the film itself was not to their liking, and because evidently the original film Planet of the Apes is still in a well-hidden place in their hearts. In fact, in 1968 the original Planet Of The Apes made its debut in American cinemas, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and inspired by the novel by Pierre Boulle. Ubi Soft, the software house in possession of the license for this franchise (certainly considered profitable), has just released the tie-in of this film for our beloved computers (versions for Game Boy Color and Advance soon), a three-dimensional arcade adventure which incorporates characters, settings and scenes from the late 60s version of the Planet of the Apes, perhaps because it was, of the two, the version that most established itself in the collective imagination of cinema aficionados. So let's jump into the corpus of the review, hoping that the term tie-in (i.e. a videogame that has been converted from a film, anime, manga, etc.) doesn't prelude another videogame bin, as happened in the last 10 days at 007: The World Is Not Enough for Game Boy Color and Men In Black The Series (for more explanations, a jump on the Joypad is at least a must).", "date": "2001-11-12", "grade": null}
