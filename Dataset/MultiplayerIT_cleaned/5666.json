The game arose from the ideas that some industry veterans, with proven high-level experience on triple-A products behind them, have chosen to put into practice through the vehicle of crowdfunding. In the past, the founders of The Molasses Flood - Scott Sinclair and Forrest Dowling - had the opportunity to work as art director and lead level designer on the Bioshock franchise, but other high-profile professionals have also joined the portfolio of this new independent reality sourced from leading studios such as Harmonix and Bungie. The funding criterion adopted for this project has given way to shape an uncompromising product, dedicated to the challenge and based on a game context that requires attention and parsimony. Thus emerged a proactive rogue-like adventure based on the crafting of materials and survival in a context where the journey is placed at the center of the spotlight. A young girl, simply called Scout, has the thankless task of facing a dangerous descent on the rapids of a river in the company of her trusty four-legged friend, while America is experiencing a crisis that the creators themselves do not define as post-apocalyptic , but more precisely post-social. Through this path, the player has the task of learning various survival techniques and carefully managing the resources offered by the surrounding environment, through the exploration of a multitude of islands and outposts that are generated with procedural criteria. The Flame in the Flood enhances the survival and travel theme Traveling on the river The most immediate parallel that arises after observing The Flame in the Flood is that with Don't Starve. Also in this case we face a survival adventure where interaction with the scenario is basic and is supported by the collection of many materials, within a game path that is generated in a procedural way and makes each game different from the others both in terms of exploration and the search for resources useful for continuing the journey. Based on the difficulty level selected, it is possible to decide to restart from the last checkpoint, thus keeping track of the health levels and the amount of resources obtained up to that precise moment, but the more hardcore players are offered the opportunity to set the status of permanent death, through which you are forced to resume the path from scratch whenever the protagonist is unable to survive the events. Finding a way to get in tune with the game philosophy as much as possible is fundamental, although not particularly simple: you have to make a virtue of necessity, making the most of all the resources offered in each of the outposts where Scout can dock his raft. Any action taken during the journey risks concealing lethal consequences and leading to a quick and unfortunate capitulation. This requires a good dose of self-control and strategic management of resources, which hinges on four fundamental statuses for survival. There is an indicator of hunger and one of thirst, flanked by the values that represent the body temperature and the degree of rest in which the protagonist is. Food and water are two key factors, but attention must also be paid to what one eats, because not all the raw materials offered by the river habitat constitute a correct form of sustenance. For example, it is possible to collect rainwater or that present in puddles, but since it is contaminated material it is also necessary to have a filtering device to avoid bacterial infections. At the same time there is both food that must be eaten raw and food that must necessarily be synthesized or cooked on fire in order not to be harmful. Since the current of the river forces you to choose one direction rather than another, the free exploration of any place is not foreseen and at the same time the possibility of carrying all the objects forfeited along the way is also precluded. In summary, a very deep-rooted learning mechanism is established, which relies on experience and the refinement of one's survival techniques, although there is also a good dose of luck to which to appeal from time to time. Resource planning After having ascertained that in The Flame in the Flood the winning approach is inherent in the corcorrect timing management, we need to begin to enter the perspective that the forms of sustenance vary and are closely connected to the biorhythms of the protagonist. It is necessary to drink and eat often, the hours of sleep are used to restore strength to the character but the more you sleep, the higher the amount of calories burned. At the same time it is necessary to avoid remaining exposed to the elements for too long, although shelters are always completely temporary. Contrary to what happens in many other survival-based titles, in which the construction of one's own base or the stop at deliberately safe landing places may be foreseen, in this case there is no place at all that temporarily puts the player out of harm's way. The sensation transmitted by this form of survival is very concrete, unrelated to the presence of paroxysmal or highly adrenaline-pumping situations but instead focused on a multitude of problems to which the player must be able to respond with the correct interpretations. Staying in the saddle of the matter never seems obvious and a trivial error of evaluation is enough to compromise the outcome of the game, consequently reaching a new day or overcoming a problem is greeted by a concrete sense of satisfaction and conquest , while remaining tied to small results. Obviously, in the gameplay economy, the use of the inventory plays a fundamental role and, also from this point of view, there are plenty of restrictions. In the early stages of exploration, the problem arises up to a certain point, but soon the limited amount of available slots makes itself felt, continually forcing you to choose what to bring with you and what to abandon on the ground, not without a growing sense of frustration when you realize, a few miles further on, that that specific resource could have been really useful. This also happens because each single outpost is a separate place and, consequently, it is not said that the resources just reluctantly abandoned can be recovered again quickly enough, especially if some pressing problem has arisen such as a status of poisoning. In any case, the difficulties do not only depend on the continuous management of materials and the maintenance of health, but also pass from the presence of animal threats, such as wild boars or wolves, whose incursions can only be averted through the construction of traps.", "date": "2016-03-06", "grade": "8.0"}
