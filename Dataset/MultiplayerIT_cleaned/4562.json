Developed by a small group of students from Singapore, the title has attracted the attention of Sony, who saw in it one of the many particular indies ready to land on the PlayStation VR catalog. Gattai Games' horror-themed stealth game is in fact available on PlayStation 4 with full support for VR, even if it can also be enjoyed in a traditional way. In any case, in no case are we dealing with an overly exhilarating experience, and it's a real shame because the premises were the best. But let's go in order. Is there anyone over there? The mechanics behind Stifled is only one, and it also seems ingenious: to exploit the relationship between sound and space within a video game, through the voice of the player himself. By connecting a microphone to the PlayStation 4 controller, or by wearing the VR helmet that incorporated it, we will be able to whisper, speak or shout to reveal more or less large portions of the environments. After calibrating the microphone, pronouncing a word in a low voice we will notice that a certain portion of the scenery will materialize, for about a couple of meters around the character. By shouting, on the other hand, we will have a complete overview. There are two problems: firstly, the ~unveiling~ of the environment lasts just a few seconds, then everything falls back into complete darkness. Furthermore, making noise is the only way to see something and continue, but we will also alert the enemies, who will not think twice about lovingly coming towards us. Yes, because Stifled is above all a stealth game, even if seasoned with distressing horror atmospheres. Our task, never really clear in reality, is to continue inside a series of underground tunnels, starting from point A to reach point B in a very linear way, without some disturbing children in a state of decomposition devouring us along the way. Stifled basically shows all of his cards in the first hour of the game (and after three you'll have already seen everything). To support these bizarre and interesting gameplay mechanics there is a very evanescent plot, told in sequences where stealth gives way to a real walking simulator, with some very bland investigative game elements. Moving between the different rooms of our home and an orphanage, we discover that we are playing the husband's role in a couple who seem to have difficulty having children, and we won't tell you more so as not to spoil the little there is to discover. Between distressing environments, flashing lights and a mysterious car accident, even the phases in which you just walk, interacting with the game objects, seem a bit an end in themselves. Worse: they seem like a sort of interlude to digest those dedicated to the real gameplay of Stifled, based on sounds and dark environments. The open ending and the uncertain story prevent you from getting a precise idea about the events. But in truth the title is like this right from the foundations: everything seems sketchy and poorly finished, as if it had been decided to travel many roads at a time, but ill-defined, in which a real genre never stands out. And this without hybridization being able to give a convincing result. Playstation 4 trophies Most of Stifled's trophies consist of secret objectives, which can only be read after unlocking the trophy or by searching on the internet. This for a very specific reason: they are linked to key elements of the already slender game plot. For the rest, it will be enough to interact with objects and collect collectibles to take home the platinum. Oh, and you'll also have to complete a match without making a single sound... we're not kidding. Anxiety (and boredom) in black and white At the basis of every great production there is a great idea: the secret is knowing how to put it into practice. Stifled, quite simply, can't. First of all, it is unable to clarify what it tries to be, between mixtures of walking simulator and investigative title in the standard sequences, and alternations of horror and stealth game in those that use the player's voice to illuminate the environments. And then, secondly, it is the gameplay that is not convincing. The ~novelty factor~ takes care of the first half hour of the game, because basically we had never seen such an idea before; but then it starts to feel a little stupid coughing and talking and whistling to yourself in the living room to see where the hell we're going. The situation does not improve using the controller instead of the microphone: listening to the protagonist repeat the same phrases and coughs ad nauseam leads to madness. The exploratory phases, like quThe most strategic ones based on discretion, require you to always perform the same actions. The exploration itself, then, is really limited: the paths that can be traveled are just a couple, the environments extremely small and most of the time there is simply only one way to reach a certain place. Avoiding clashes with enemies is equally linear: you pick up a stone, throw it far away, the zombie-child runs to the impact site attracted by the noise. At this point we run away in the opposite direction and start over in the next area. A couple of randomly scattered jump scares remind us, every now and then, that among other things Stifled tries to be something vaguely similar to a horror title. Without success, of course.", "date": "2017-11-11", "grade": "7.0"}
