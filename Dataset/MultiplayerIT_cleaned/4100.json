{"name": "F1 2018: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2018-recensione.html", "text": "Speed is a fascination that is difficult to resist, from an early age. It is no coincidence that there are so many cartoons that see cars as protagonists, just as it is no coincidence that over the years films and television series dedicated to the myth of two and four wheels have entered the collective imagination. The video game industry has also long since succumbed to this temptation, of which driving simulations have always been part: if we try to think of the video games of the past that we remember with greater affection, it is difficult that there is not at least one similar to the racing genre. The coexistence of titles with an arcade soul and other more simulative ones has always satisfied all kinds of palates, including those of Formula 1 lovers, the emblem of four-wheeled speed. Old institutions like Grand Prix 2 have given way to what is currently the F1 series in the hands of Codemasters, who have now been working on it for almost a decade. While the real championship is experiencing its moment of summer break, the virtual one is starting right now: we just have to get back on track, to see if F1 2018 manages to reach the finish line. The modalities: an increasingly important Career Having now put aside the misstep made with the 2015 edition, F1 2018 presents itself with the ambition to enrich and improve the scaffolding built with its predecessors. We had the opportunity to take a look at the various innovations a few weeks ago, but at this point it is necessary to put order in this year's proposal by Codemasters. So let's start from the modalities, among which the Career has now assumed a central role: without making distortions, the developers have worked both on the role-playing aspect of the experience and on the technical one, in particular on the research and development section. We start as usual with the selection of the physical appearance of our driver among some predefined models, to then choose the team to join: the choice remains free from the beginning, thus allowing our rookie to immediately enter the teams of aims, however taking into account the ambitions of Mercedes and Ferrari very different from those of those who do not fight for the title. The pressure is bound to increase with the introduction of the figure of the journalist Claire, present inside the paddock to ask us questions between sessions of the race weekend. Our response, to be provided within a time limit, must be well thought out as it can influence the relationship we have with our team. Taking all the credit for a victory without paying due credit to those behind the scenes can, for example, annoy a specific part of the team, which will make things more complicated when we need them to improve the car. Assuming a sporty or grumpy star attitude can also determine the relationship we have with the other stables, thus making them more or less disposed towards us when we go knocking on their door. Further spice is added by the possibility of choosing one's rival among the drivers present in the championship, thus making a sort of declaration of war on the chosen one. Moving on instead to the research and development part, the approach based on experience points remains, which can be accumulated by hitting certain objectives at the wheel of our single-seater. The dynamics governing technological updates have been revised to respond to the diversity of each team, taking into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of each of them in the real world. An aura of uncertainty about progress has been added with the introduction of the so-called ~fog of war~ on research specialization trees, but above all by the changes in regulation which have now become an essential aspect even in reality. At a certain point in the season and in the development of the car, it will be possible that some of the work done will become banned in the following season, so it will be necessary to decide whether to spend resources to adapt it in view of the changes or not. The tactic to build one's prestige therefore also passes from here, bearing in mind that to meet the requests of the players, Codemasters has decided to provide a general way of executing the updates faster. Taking a look at the other modes, we find the Time Trial, the Championships, the Events and the online multiplayer. The latter has been enriched with the ~Super License~ mode, where the most experienced players will be able to compete with each other by finding opponents who come close to their driving skills. The ranking system should also ensure that you compete with people of similar conductto ours. Since the release of F1 2018 in stores has not yet taken place, it has unfortunately not been possible for us to test the sector online. Driving gameplay The racer soul of F1 2018 requires that all the contours mentioned so far be supported by a driving system capable of satisfying the player properly. Starting from an initial arcade vocation, over time Codemasters has been able to make its series suitable for all needs, shining in this sense for its scalability. The driving aids can be chosen from a series of pre-configured levels, which can however be modified to your liking to determine whether to get more or less help when braking and so on. The Halo protection system, placed in front of the cockpit of each single-seater since 2018, can be partially deactivated in order to prevent its vertical element from obstructing the player's view. As far as driving sensations are concerned, the most important changes concern the physics of the suspension and the chassis, which is now able to react in a more complex way than in the past. The work of Codemasters was in fact aimed at giving each curb and each solicitation tangible feedback on the player's driving, particularly appreciable if you have a steering wheel to play with. The normal controller continues to do its job, but to fully enjoy the high empathy factor of F1 2018 it is necessary to have a position that simulates the real driving system as much as possible. For the most demanding players in terms of contact with reality, the developers have also modified the parameters that regulate tire temperature, opening up different tactics for their use in racing. Finally, let's not forget the possibility of manually managing the ERS system, using the special menu available in the race: on the one hand, this adds further contact with reality to F1 2018, allowing it at the same time to count on another element that makes the races more varied and exciting. As in the previous edition, the artificial intelligence performs quite well, being combative at the right point as long as there is the possibility of maintaining the position but still being careful not to end everything in a Destruction Derby game. The graphics: like on television Following the same philosophy applied to the other aspects of the game, the developers have also made tangible, but not particularly revolutionary, improvements to the technical sector of F1 2018. The impression one gets at a glance is that of an EGO Engine pushed to its maximum capabilities, or in any case close to them, obtaining a remarkable visual impact even when the weather conditions are adverse and fog appears. There are so many views available, suitable with their characteristics to satisfy every type of player: with the use of the anti-Halo remedy already mentioned, even the first person view is pleasant, always allowing the player to maintain control of the car even at high speeds. On PlayStation 4 Pro we did not encounter the tearing defects and slowdowns of a year ago, but in the presentation phases of the races we have in some cases witnessed a loading of the textures that occurred a little late. In general, the impression is that Codemasters wanted to give F1 2018 a more cinematic identity, enriching it with elements intended to let us know the interior of the paddock and to contribute to the presentation of each race. It goes without saying that the detail for each car that makes up the current championship has been painstakingly recreated, updating the appearance of the single-seaters and circuits to the most recent ones. The increase in races and the alternation of championship tracks makes us lose the Malaysian GP, returning instead to France at the Paul Ricard circuit and Germany at Hockenheim. The sound effects of the single-seaters are as we expect them from a title that focuses on driving identification. Lastly, for lovers of the past, the fleet of historic single-seaters has been enriched with some novelties, including Niki Lauda's Ferrari 312T.", "date": "2018-08-17", "grade": "9.0"}
