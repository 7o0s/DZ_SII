Even if we beat them with everything that comes our way, shoot them with bullets of all kinds and throw anything at them, the truth is that zombies have a special place in our hearts. The long line that in the videogame field has led to the success of games such as the first State of Decay and the The Walking Dead series by Telltale Games, not to mention a certain The Last of Us, cannot be explained in any other way. A trend that started several years ago now, but is still vital today: the next few months will in fact see the arrival of Days Gone, while The Last of Us Part II is rightfully among the most anticipated games ever. Meanwhile, our love of zombies can be satisfied right now with State of Decay 2, the sequel to Undead Labs' 2013 'sleeper hit', arriving on PC and Xbox One in just a few days. The console version is the one we focused on for this review, in which we can finally tell you everything we think about State of Decay 2, after spending a week in his company. How will you survive? The question that gives the title to this paragraph was asked by the Undead Labs team, which in recent days has released some trailers dedicated to the survivors of the apocalypse that has hit the world of State of Decay. A world populated by zombies, but above all by human beings committed to finding a way to go forward, looking for food and building defenses from the creatures that infest houses and neighborhoods. An approach that we have repeatedly defined as ~The Walking Dead-like~, in which the inevitable zombie carnage is only the background to what happens among the living. If you have read the impressions on State of Decay 2 that we published a few days ago you will already be aware of the fact that this new game is a sequel to all intents and purposes, which therefore takes up the basis formed by its predecessor with the aim of expand it. The good news is that those who have played the first State of Decay will immediately be at ease with the dynamics of this new game, which however are by no means to be underestimated in their complexity. Even for the most experienced players, in the early stages the temptation may be to indulge in everything that State of Decay 2 offers us, thus preparing missions with multiple objectives. The typical example is the one in which we go to a specific structure with the aim of looking for materials crucial for the survival of the inhabitants of our house, taking the opportunity to stop on the way to clean up an infestation and then go and save someone who radioed for help on the way back. The more goals we add, the more likely something is to go wrong. The watchword is therefore to plan, carefully evaluating the risks and benefits of each activity that can be undertaken in a situation that remains constantly in the balance, putting the collapse within the reach of a simple misstep even when things seem to be going in the right direction . A constant state of apprehension, typical of the zombie apocalypse, which State of Decay 2 reproduces perfectly, enriching what was seen in its predecessor. Thinking that you can complete all the tasks is impossible, which is why the game puts us in front of choices. Some of these also test our ethics: what to do with an infected and incurable character? Banish him from the house, condemning him to a slow solitary agony or have mercy on him by ending his suffering? Xbox One goals State of Decay 2 has a total of sixty-two goals, the sum of which makes a thousand points available to players. The most lucrative include the killing of a total of 10,000 zombies and the elimination of all the hearts of the Blood Plague present in the territory, accompanied by the completion of the various types of ~feats~ that mark the end of the campaign. As for the cooperative mode, the only objective dedicated to it concerns the start of an online session, both as a host and as a guest. We are the story The first element of State of Decay 2 is therefore the human being, with all that this entails. Each character has characteristics that make them unique, starting with the skills that are dynamically generated by the game engine. It is in fact possible to find the individual skilled with firearms or the one capable of sneaking under the eyes of the zombies without being noticed, or simply the one able to devote himself to the construction and take care of the house while the explorers are around. Beyond the capacities, the various characters also bring with them separate strandsplot elements, which Undead Labs wanted to make as dynamic as possible in order to ensure that there are not too many points in common between two games. We will find, for example, the survivor who goes on the trail of her missing aunt to then make important discoveries, or the guy intent on investigating the army's activities in the area: it's up to us to choose which strand to dedicate ourselves to, with the knowledge that everything could end anyway in a moment. As in the first State of Decay, also in this sequel the law of permanent death applies: once a character is lost there is no possibility of getting him back, thus letting all his skills and history go with him. It is therefore necessary to take care of those who make up your group, bearing in mind that the first rule to ensure that there are no problems is to satisfy all needs, starting from the very first necessities such as food and medicines up to ammunition for defense and materials to build and enrich the headquarters facilities. The idea of being confined to the safety of the home is obviously unthinkable, and once you leave the house it's not just the zombies we're dealing with: in the surrounding areas there are in fact other groups of survivors, called enclaves, with whom we find ourselves sooner or later to maintain relationships. What type they are is up to the player to decide: from time to time requests for help and collaboration arrive via radio, with the possibility of starting a peaceful cycle of exchanges of goods. However, nothing prevents you from turning into the Negan of the situation, making a clean sweep of all the members of the nearby enclave to take possession of the assets they guard. In this case, it must be borne in mind that hostile actions towards a specific enclave will make us seen as enemies in the eyes of those who compose it: there is no need to take it too lightly, because at a certain point bullets will also start traveling. It goes without saying that gunfire also attracts zombies, with all that that may mean. Zombie co-op Let's not forget at this point our zombie friends, who still remain a fundamental element of State of Decay 2. As in the past, infestations and hordes will begin to invade the neighborhood in which we find ourselves, thus requiring reclamation works from time to time . The presence of the so-called Blood Plague complicates things, making some creatures more dangerous than others as they are able to transmit the disease to human beings: to heal it is necessary to create medicines through the use of infected tissue samples, which can be taken from enemies slain or directly from the heart of the Plague. The latter can be found at a building among those present on the map, requiring an intervention in force to be eliminated: once attacked, it in fact recalls the infected zombies nearby, thus giving life to a kind of horde mode with a duration of a few minutes. Such a situation can typically be the one in which you decide to resort to what is another of the novelties of State of Decay 2: the cooperative multiplayer mode. Those who expected to be able to play an entire game in collaboration with a friend will unfortunately be disappointed, as the dynamics are of the ~drop-in / drop-out~ type that can be activated according to one's will. It is therefore possible to face the game alone, deciding from time to time (but also never) to ask for help via radio, or make yourself available to offer support: once the matchmaking is completed, the guest becomes part of the game with his/her character hosts, with the aim of helping the latter in their quests. In return, once the online session is over, the guest can take the loot collected during the raid with him, plus a bonus of influence points as a reward for the support offered. The guest cannot interact with the base of the host, thus nullifying the possibility of influencing the game of the player acting as host more than necessary. It is almost superfluous to say that such a mode works best if you have friends to play with and communicate via voice chat, thus avoiding being with strangers who have no idea what to do, thus only wasting time. Returning to the zombies, in addition to the types already mentioned, there are the following others: the Howler capable of calling other creatures to the place, the Bloater who, dying, explodes leaving a cloud of poison, the Savage endowed with greater agility and finally the Colossus, a type big and fat from which it is good to stay away to avoid making a bad end. New engine, old problems Even if the game dynamics of State of Decay 2 must be ~in the strings~ of those who have the controller in hand to be fully appreciated, their quality is unquestionable. Conversely, what is a deficient technical sector is questionable, despite the transition from CryEngine 3 to Unreal Engine 4. The latter is responsible for a greater general cleanliness of State of Decay 2 compared to its predecessor, especially in the phases of hand-to-hand combat with zombies, but most of the problems encountered in the past end up coming back to the surface sooner or later. On the basic model of Xbox One (not Xbox One X, to be clear) the visual impact is at a rather low level, almost on the border with the previous generation of consoles. However, the modest quality of polygons and textures fails to avoid drops in the number of frames per second, capable of collapsing downwards especially in the phases in which you go around by car. There is no shortage of more or less visible tearing and pop-in effects, accompanied by various types of bugs: in some cases amusing but harmless, like when we happened to see a zombie flying, but in other annoying occasions like when we couldn't complete a mission because two zombies had decided to merge with the wall of the house that we had to clean up, thus becoming unassailable. We understand that despite the expectation for it, State of Decay 2 is not to be considered on a par with a ~triple A~ title, and the very advantageous price is confirmation of this, but after a few years from the experience made with State of Decay we would have expected a better graphics sector. We're hoping for an update when it comes out, if only for bugs. The sound is normal: mostly you will hear the sounds of the zombies, accompanied by some music and some phrases of the characters, dubbed in English. There are Italian subtitles, as well as the whole interface has been translated into our language.", "date": "2018-05-17", "grade": "8.3"}
