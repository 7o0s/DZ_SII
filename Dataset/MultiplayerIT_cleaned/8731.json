The reason was known: in addition to adding flavor to foods in a unique way, spices and salt were the only valid methods for extending their edibility over time, given the lack of more practical conservation alternatives. Although the average length of the journeys was really important for the time, the distance traveled by the friendly protagonists of Spice Bandits remains truly unparalleled: these funny aliens in fact literally crossed a portion of interstellar space to reach the Earth, in search of the precious spices . In this case, however, it is not the thirst for conquest or the desire to expand their borders that pushes the remote travelers so far, but nothing but hunger, given that their diet is essentially composed of pepper, nutmeg, thyme, marjoram and all the fragrant samples usually well present in terrestrial pantries. Earthling, I'll have your spice! Spice Bandits is a traditional tower defense with enemies in waves, in which the point of view is for once that of the alien invaders: hunger, the primary instinct that moves the invaders, is in fact the only motive that justifies the attack and, in some ways, could be considered as a ~struggle for alien survival~. Of course, Earthlings don't have the slightest intention of helplessly witnessing the defrauding of their precious resources: it is clear that without spices one could still survive, but what would it be like to eat without condiments? Beyond the imaginative premise imagined by Chillingo, everything then boils down as usual to a real carnage of terrestrials, operated by the numerous turrets placed on the available game maps. In Career mode, different geomorphic situations are thus faced in succession, game levels which from time to time favor always contextualized tactical approaches. Obviously the merit of the six types of buildable turrets: starting from that base, to continue with the missile launcher, the electric discharges, the chemical attacks and the gramophone, indispensable for distracting the opponents, to which must be added the effective anti-aircraft. But the extreme tacticalism of the weaponry only fully manifests itself after starting to try out the more than 50 upgrades available for all types of constructions. Precisely the upgrades have an important characteristic: after the first three degrees, in fact, the subsequent steps profoundly and definitively change the nature of the tower, continuing on parallel tracks. To understand the choice made by the developers, it is enough to cite the basic rapid-fire turrets as an example: the first three upgrades simply increase the intensity and range of the attacks while from the fourth onwards you will have to choose a mandatory path, choosing between an immense territorial coverage but with slowed attack rate or conversely a decrease in range, balanced by an intense barrage. However, each weapon presents this kind of crossroads: it will be up to the player to decide which of the available paths should be taken depending on the situation. In Spice Bandits, however, nothing is free: every upgrade, every performance improvement has a precise cost, obviously expressed in the amount of Spices. Spices are needed both to buy new tower evolutions and to improve the performance of existing ones, but finding them is very difficult, due to the small amount that is given away with each victory. Microtransactions and a few more euros to invest can easily remedy this problem, provided, as always, that you morally accept ~cheating~ to win. The situation on ~normal~ money is different, which is the current currency used to erect buildings on the game map: each killing will provide a part, proportional to the value of the enemy killed even if in general this type of resource tends to accumulate easily. However, the real novelty introduced by Chillingo is a complete online mode, almost unprecedented in the Tower Defense field. There is little or nothing to report on the cooperative mode, while the competitive one results in an incredible confusion on the screen: each player sends the same type of troops to the other, with the aim of undermining the defenses; the placed towers will thus relentlessly fire on the opponent's units, blocking their advance. To help the player in difficulty can finally intervene up to 4 disturbing elements of the opponent, ssignaled by as many icons at the bottom right: deafening music, an electric shock, a power capable of immobilizing their movements and the always handy mines, to be placed carefully along the way. Finally, it remains to mention the good work done from a technical point of view, thanks to the beautiful animations with which the troops move (the comics that appear every now and then are also funny) and the excellent general fluidity, slightly dampened only in the case of competitive multiplayer games .
