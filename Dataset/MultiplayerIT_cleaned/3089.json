{"name": "Beyond Blue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beyond-blue-la-recensione.html", "text": "An adventure that takes us to explore the depths of the sea can already count on a great charm, which probably increases even more in a period like the one we are living in right now and that is why we are going with some interest to the review of Beyond Blue. It is a sort of adventure based on narration and exploration, which stages the scuba diving of a researcher engaged in studying the behavior of whales and other marine life forms in a context that takes on increasingly complex characteristics. The game is available right now on Apple Arcade and has been tested on iPad, but will also arrive on PC, PS4 and Xbox One in June. Beyond Blue is basically split into two parts, with most of the time being spent diving in some areas of the Pacific Ocean in search of various marine species, carrying out various analyzes and responding to more or less mysterious radio and audio signals, while the other sections see us control the protagonist inside the submarine, carrying on the narrative substrate through communications with other characters. It is a game that focuses above all on the exploration of oceanic wonders, given that from a playful point of view the interaction always appears rather limited and also the narrative part is not studied as it should be, despite bringing into play various topics of a certain interest. Beyond Blue favors a reflective and relaxed approach, resulting especially attractive in the careful reproduction of the underwater scenarios and the animals that populate them, reconstructed with great scientific attention, revealing itself as a sort of interactive documentary. In this context, the grafts of the story, with the attempts to build a deep and multifaceted figure for the protagonist, seem almost out of tune in the long run with the style that transpires, more devoted to solo swims between coral reefs and schools of fish than to reveal the plot through the dialogues. Not for nothing, the game uses many pieces of real documentaries: footage shot live and taken above all from Blue Planet II, produced by the BBC, which can be viewed between one mission and another from the submarine-hub. However, there are very interesting points in the story of Beyond Blue, which deals above all with the ecological question, leading us to investigate the more or less legal activities of exploitation of the soil and underwater resources, the consequences of pollution and the difficulties faced by scientific missions purely naturalistic in the modern world. The particular figure of Dr. Mirai is also grafted into all of this, who from her solitary home in the science fiction submarine finds herself observing the life of the ocean depths while trying to follow her own too, between difficult family relationships at a distance and between workmates . Between whales and problems We are in an unspecified near future and Mirai, a scientist and underwater expert, must carry out a series of studies focused above all on whales, therefore she finds herself alone inside an advanced submarine which serves as a base for research and from which she regularly performs various ocean expeditions. Supporting her are Andr, an expert marine biologist with a strongly ecological soul, and Irina, a scientist in a pharmaceutical industry who seems to represent the more cynical and insensitive side of scientific research, only to later turn out to be a character with her own problems and well hidden human side. The dialogues between the characters essentially make up the story of Beyond Blue, with the presence of some choices left to the player who can decide how to influence his development with the possibility of focusing on specific problems rather than others, which results in not huge variations but still significant on the narrative front, an area which also includes the frequent dialogues between the protagonist and her sister which serve to reveal something of Mirai's backstory. These bits of story wedged between missions are quite interesting but to be honest they never quite build a full-fledged video game like the developers perhaps would have liked, applying a bit of a piecemeal narrative to a game that could probably just go on with exploration alone. The topics are interesting, but as we have said, little developed to truly bring out a solid narrative line, moreover on this front there is also an Italian translation to add, as regards only the texts, not exactly impeccable. What matters in Beyond Blue, in any case, is the underwater exploration, which yesBasically it is the really interesting and addictive part of the game. The approach used by E-Line Media is purely scientific, one could say practically educational, considering the presence of integrated documentaries, therefore we are far from the most imaginative and romantic interpretations of marine exploration in videogame form seen in the splendid ABZU or even in Subnautica, in its own way. The underwater world, on the other hand, is already interesting enough in itself to be able to fascinate any player even with a simple tour with realistic ambitions, without overdoing that much. From this point of view, here we find everything we need: well-reproduced seabeds, a large quantity of animal species to observe, purely scientific information on the conformation, characteristics and habits of the various species and an excellent modeling of fish and various other living being. It is a pity that on this front, beyond the documentaries and a list of the species found, there are no further materials and insights that lead to further exploration and observation of further animals. Beyond this scientific interest, the gameplay is decidedly limited: we essentially have to follow the various waypoints that emerge from the audio analysis of the seabed and analyze the sources of the sound sources, by scanning and recording videos. In essence, something similar to what we are used to doing in games with a strong exploratory component such as Metroid Prime, No Man's Sky or other, but with practically no other game element beyond simple scanning, so much so that even direct interaction with fish and various animals is practically absent except in scripted moments. The strength of Beyond Blue therefore lies above all in the charm of the underwater setting and exploration and precisely in this respect it must be noted that the test on the iPad is probably not the best way to enjoy what the game has to offer. Although the results are remarkable, there is a strong downgrade of the graphics on a 2018 iPad, with a net reduction of the resolution that leads to evident aliasing and a remarkable simplification of the polygonal figures especially at a certain distance, all elements that may not be present on the gaming platforms, as the materials released by E-Line Media also suggest. The touch screen control system is well implemented and so is the support for the Xbox One controller, obviously, but the idea is that a game that focuses so strongly on the spectacularity of the settings should be enjoyed on more performing hardware and above all on a large screen.", "date": "2020-05-16", "grade": "7.0"}
