Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. Halfway between Lara Croft and Jill Valentine, Evelyn is a skilled mercenary who, in a post-apocalyptic future, agrees to reach one of the cities invaded by zombies by helicopter with the aim to save as many survivors as possible, recover some important documents and, at the same time, eliminate a lot of the living dead. New episode of the GLU series, Contract Killer Zombies 2: Origins adopts the freemium model and can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play. The system used is of the classic type, with two types of currency that are used to purchase weapons of various kinds (pistols, machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenades and more), characterized by different degrees of effectiveness, and whose quantity it can of course be increased by purchasing packages of ~gold bars~ with the outlay of real money. Let's say right away that, unlike other freemium productions, in the new GLU title this dynamic appears anything but stringent: you don't find yourself without ammunition when you run out of money, nor do you have to wait a certain number of minutes to be able to retry a mission after the game over. Most importantly, our skill in the game is effectively enhanced and therefore it is possible to proceed in the levels even without the best possible equipment, relying on our skills and on a touch control system that really surprised us for the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Maximum pain You know well that certain videogame genres suffer particularly from touch screen commands, and the third person shooter trend certainly falls among these, but the developers of Contract Killer Zombies 2: Origins have really been able to develop a slap-up control system, probably the best we've seen so far on iOS with regards to this particular third-person context. How did they do it? Simply by inserting two virtual analog sticks (which are not fixed but repositionable and invisible), very precise and reactive, which control the movement and view (ergo the viewfinder) of the character, with automatic fire as soon as a target is within range and two simple touches, on the weapon and on an icon positioned in the lower part of the screen, to reload and change weapons on the fly (with a useful bullet time that also allows us to think a little). The numerous fights with zombies are therefore very enjoyable and completely lack the cumbersomeness present in different games of the same type. There may be some problems in very short distances, especially when you run out of ammunition and have to take out your baseball bat, but in general the results achieved are amazing and we hope they will serve as an inspiration and starting point for publishers intending to bring their devices with touch screens even franchises of a certain level. In addition to the excellent controls, Contract Killer Zombies 2: Origins also boasts a nice structure, fairly full-bodied (new missions have just been added via an update, for the record) and even replayability-oriented, which alternates between missions in which you have to collect certain items at others in which there are hordes of undead and you have to eliminate them trying to survive, passing through the supply of survivors and skill challenges that involve defending a location for as long as possible. There is also a good variety among the ranks of our opponents, with ~armored~ zombies increasingly accompanying the ~normal~ ones and various types of more powerful than average monsters, such as those capable of attracting reinforcements or those that explode once they have reached us, and so on. The framework described so far is supported by a technical sector of excellent workmanship, perhaps not sensational as regards the complexity of the polygonal models or the animations, but which knows how to remain fluid even in the most agitated situations.", "date": "2012-12-22", "grade": "8.2"}
