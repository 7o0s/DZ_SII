{"name": "Einstein Genial Mente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/einstein-genial-mente.html", "text": "Right from the start, Einstein's Brain Game does nothing in particular to distinguish itself from its fiercest competitors: the game therefore offers two main modes which respectively allow you to undergo a daily training session (complete with evaluation of the results) or to face the individual minigames for the simple sake of aiming for the hi-score. The various tests of intelligence amount to twenty units, and are divided into four categories: mathematics, logic, memory and visualization. Unfortunately, it is precisely these elements, which should constitute the strong point of a production of the genre, that are the least convincing aspect of the game. In fact, the minigames sin of a rate of originality and inventiveness that is really too low, to the point of being able to be singled out as real carbon copies of specimens of similar titles. So here in Einstein's Brain Game we find a section in which you have to count cubes identical to one seen in Big Brain Academy: and it is only the first episode that comes to mind, but the ~plagiarists~ are numerous, even if sometimes slightly disguised . This is the case with another test, in which it is necessary to keep in mind the number of UFOs hiding behind a planet: same soup as Brain Training for Nintendo DS, only that on that occasion the protagonists were little men who they entered a house. In short, Einstein's Brain Game seems to have been inspired too much by his colleagues, ending up totally losing his personality. And it's a shame, because the Disney product certainly doesn't lack interesting ideas: thought goes first of all to the multiplayer modes, which beyond the conventional pass-the-handset and Bluetooth supports, boast an unprecedented Championship section that allows challenge four randomly chosen human players online and then upload their results on a dedicated scoreboard. A decidedly interesting feature, which unfortunately collides with the poor substance of the Disney product, ending up being canceled by it. In short, if only the developers had dedicated the same care given to multiplayer to minigames, the review would certainly have been more flattering...
