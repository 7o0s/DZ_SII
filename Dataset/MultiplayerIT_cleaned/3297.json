The formula is the typical one RPGs with turn-based combat and a practically random battle system: the party moves from one screen to another, without however knowing if there will be any opponents and possibly ending up the victim of sudden ambushes; all by exploring peculiar scenarios, looking for keys, solving puzzles based on the reflection of beams of light and arriving at a clash with as many as five bosses. It is not necessary to know the cartoon and its protagonists to appreciate the title developed by Grumpyface Studios, although this can certainly help to understand the dialogues (interpreted by the original voices in English and subtitled in Italian) which form the glue to the various sequences : no small feat, considering how peculiar some of the ideas behind the show are. You can play using the touch screen or a Bluetooth controller, which is perfectly supported, although in the case of the puzzles, the controls are a bit capricious and you have to grope to guess interactions with objects. Gameplay and structure As mentioned, Unleash the Light is a classic-style RPG, with a turn-based combat system that presents a non-trivial degree of challenge right from the start. The party at our disposal is made up of four out of six total characters; including of course Steven, who however acts mostly as a support unit for his teammates. The team can attack enemies based on star points, selecting the target and trying to press the action key with perfect timing, when indicated, to deal extra damage. Likewise, precise pressure can limit the loss of vital energy when hit. There are standard moves, area attacks and the possibility of managing the position in order to keep certain units safe while exposing others, in the context of clashes with a certain strategic depth. Each victory is naturally followed by the distribution of experience points for any level up, which brings with it the unlocking of new skills. The exploratory phase is managed in a very simple way, with a focus on collecting objects and discovering secrets that however they arise as a mandatory practice: if a level has not been completed 100%, it will not be possible to proceed to the next scenario on the map. This approach, together with the repeated mechanism of collecting the keys and the semi-random fights unfortunately creates a certain degree of repetitiveness, combining Unleash the Light with productions now belonging to the past for the RPG genre. Despite this, the charm of the experience remains strong, especially for those who know the characters and the lore, involving us in a fairly long and demanding campaign, naturally without paywalls or microtransactions as is the norm for all games available on the Apple Arcade platform. The technical realization is in line with the style of the cartoon, and makes use of various visually very pleasing solutions, which give the title a feeling of great attention to detail. The design of the many enemies that we will be able to face, but above all of the protagonists and their ever-expanding repertoire of moves, is very well done. The action is also accompanied by a soundtrack which, even without shining, succeeds in the arduous task of not getting bored after the first few hours.", "date": "2020-01-15", "grade": "8.0"}
