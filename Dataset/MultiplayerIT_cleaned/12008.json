{"name": "Colin McRae: DIRT - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-dirt-recensione_a.html", "text": "The racing pyramid Life, in this case, rather than stairs is made up of the steps of the pyramid that constitutes Dirt's career mode, which is the main one, thanks to which all 46 cars available and all the different liveries are unlocked. The tests are divided into eight levels of increasing intensity, which allow you to tackle all the different specialties included in this chapter, driving all the types of vehicles envisaged. Compared to the past, there is a greater diversification of the offer and the classic timed races and hill climbs often give way to circuit tests, in which up to ten cars are competing at the same time for a certain number of laps. The player's journey to the top of the pyramid is hindered from two points of view, namely that of the points needed to unlock the new trials to be run and that of the dollars needed to buy the cars required to tackle them. When you select a test, you can also choose the level of difficulty which will reward the achievement of the podium with various cash prizes, which will obviously be proportionate to the chosen difficulty. The points obtained, on the other hand, do not vary with the difficulty, and it will therefore be possible to unlock all the tests by running at the simplest level, then collecting the money necessary for purchases, obtaining placements at higher difficulties. This choice rewards the ~easy~ approach that Codemasters has given to the whole product, certainly favoring players who don't get stuck on the simulation at the most extreme levels and who will be able to unlock all the tests in a term that can be estimated at around 10 hours of play. At that point it will be possible to continue playing by improving to the toughest levels, or by tackling the world championships made available in the appropriate mode, and which differ in the number of races they consist of. Unfortunately, as we will see later, the online mode is really reduced to a minimum and is not able to significantly lengthen the longevity of Dirt. Drifting This Codemasters effort is a somewhat particular creature. The behavior of some cars, on some surfaces, is so precise as to amaze. In other junctures, on the other hand, one feels just as if things were somehow not in their place, above all when one realizes that the best way to tackle certain bends is to get there at full speed and then come to a halt in the middle of a probable off-piste and restart ~flat out~ after getting back on track. This sensation is accentuated even more due to the high speed of the game, which gives the same type of emotion as a speedy title, in which a nailed to 200Kmh on gravel cornering has almost no negative results, if done with the right timing . The difficulty therefore lies entirely in learning to trust your co-pilot who gives precise indications to the millimeter and which make reading the small map in the upper part of the screen completely superfluous, putting the player in a constant competitive apnea where, however, the cars sometimes seem to skid over the ground. The generosity with which it is possible to straighten out the most demanding situations somewhat decreases the flow of adrenaline which in any case is one of the most successful features of the game, which is able to captivate for many hours. For the more determined, there are, of course, the higher difficulty levels, which enrages the opponents' AI in circuit races and lowers their times in timed races. However, it is the gameplay choice at the base of Dirt that diminishes the importance of the many settings that can be operated on the cars and of the more careful study of the routes and surfaces on which they unfold, leaving the field open to a series of races to be faced one after the other the other without taking a breath. Also quite unique is the extremely detailed damage system which takes into account any impact suffered by the car and which can lead to a withdrawal from the race. All underlined also by the excellent interactivity of the environments, with rows of vines, for example, which can be shattered with the wood residues that remain on the bonnet of the car, while the blades of grass lash the bodywork, highlighted by the excellent audio sector. Wait for my phone to ring... We've never seen an online mode like that of Dirt. Lobbies open in which up to 100 players gather at the same time and in which it is possible to vote between 6 combinations of a route and a type of car, both of which cannot be modified in any element. The disciplines are only timed races and hill climbs. As soon as you enter the room a countdown starts di one minute, at the end of which the race begins inexorably and all the participants are called to cover the route in the shortest possible time. During the race there is no contact with the other riders, not a ghost that shows us the rider closest to us in the standings. Another eccentric feature is that the countdown cannot be stopped and the race starts in any case even if no other player enters the room (in which case a nice solo race awaits us), or if one of the participants has to be away from the console for a few moments . In addition to this, there is in no way the possibility of carrying out competitions in circuit disciplines with several players on the track at the same time. Between mud and dust Colin Mcrae Dirt cosmetics is one of his greatest strengths. Bonding the whole gaming experience is a genuine and electrifying sense of wonder that assails the player with every test to be run. One could argue about an excessive use of bloom and HDR, which make certain Tuscan countryside and dirt roads in Australia look like huge flaming expanses, but undoubtedly the choice of 30 frames per second, perfectly suited to the type of handling set by the team, paid off with an extraordinary level of detail, especially considering the sensation of speed it is able to return. And then all that remains is to launch yourself at breakneck speed towards some truly inspired settings including Italy, Japan and Australia that simply need to be seen in every detail, to go and discover polygonal stones on the edge of the track, fences that if hit, they tear into pieces and tufts of grass that completely cover the hills up to hiding the polygons that make them up. The work carried out on the reconstruction of the passenger compartments is also noteworthy, which can even be viewed in two different types of internal view. Thanks to the extra time available to the developers, the PlayStation 3 version has a stable frame rate and the occasional slowdowns present in the 360 counterpart have almost completely disappeared. with remarkable care and with a unique style. It could be said that the choice was forced, given that the loading times are really long and that you have to spend a lot of time in front of the screens where all the player's statistics are pitted before each race. No musical commentary during the competitions, but a series of first-rate sound effects. Comment The visual realism of Dirt does not match the same care in the reconstruction of the driving model, which makes the new Colin a title suitable for all players who, to the most demanding simulations, prefer breathtaking experiences that can be perfectly calibrated to their skill. This chapter of the series is fast, fun and embodies all those qualities that can make the Next Gen concept clear to any player in seconds. Over the distance, however, there is a lack of thickness necessary to keep true fans of racing games glued, who will quickly learn everything they need to go through the career mode without excessive difficulty. The picturesque, if limited, online mode is finally the final blow to the masterpiece ambitions of the new title Codemasters, which is nevertheless one of the best driving games of the last year. Pros: Graphically stunning Great feeling of speed Good variety of vehicles Cons: Driving model not entirely convincing Online mode neutered Load times Colin McRae: DIRT is available for PC, PS3 and 360.
