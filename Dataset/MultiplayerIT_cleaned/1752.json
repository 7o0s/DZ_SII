{"name": "Fifa 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2003_a.html", "text": "Upgrade .03 Upgrade: a recurring word for the Fifa saga. In fact, if there is something that fans of the series have always been able to boast of, it is the presence of statistics, squads, tournaments updated each time to the current season. And this year's episode is no exception either. From the introductory movie full of champions showing off their choreographic skills, with Timo Maas' ~Get Down~ playing in the background, you can tell that the music hasn't changed: EA spares no expense to make its main sports franchise more and more palatable to the masses. The prospect of impersonating the favorites of your favorite team, with names and physical characteristics corresponding to the truth, is known to fascinate, and EA seems to know this very well. Venturing through the game menus, with captivating graphics, one realizes that Fifa 2003 has a record-breaking soundtrack, with many tracks all on the wave of clubbin' which is so trendy these days. Looking at the substance, however, we can see the usual multitude of strictly official tournaments and championships available, which allow us to predict a potentially infinite longevity, as per tradition. But it's not from this point of view that a surprise was expected: Fifa has always made these superficial elements its main strength, blatantly sinning in that component which - more than ever in a sports title - is fundamental. We are obviously talking about the Gameplay, the mere playful experience, which has so far been decidedly banal and demeaning. With Pro Evolution Soccer which last year had decidedly undermined the sales (in the West) of the 2002 Fifa upgrade, a critical point had been reached for EA Sports, which had to renew its game in a concrete way in order to keep its leadership intact . Route change It is necessary to declare immediately that in Fifa, this year, something has finally changed. Do you remember when it was enough to ~launch~ the winger on the sideline, carry him with the ball to the end of the field and carry out a cross with millimeter precision to score the goal, with your choice of a spectacular bicycle kick or a more humble header? This was what was called ~pattern-type-1~ of previous editions of Fifa (although in the 2002 version it was already less simple than in the past): absolutely infallible. Do you remember the 11-0 (eleven to zero) at the end of the first half? All this in Fifa 2003 does not exist (finally) anymore. The regulars of the series will initially find themselves displaced by the playful approach proposed, given that the always good strategies until yesterday are quite ineffective. And, incredible thing, by setting the difficulty level a little higher, the matches will be quite difficult to win, without the usual rain of goals. Jubilation will be felt in seeing that the low passes do not always and in any case end up on the partner's feet, but can be directed into the ~empty spaces~; amazement for shots on goal not always at the top corner (have you ever tried in a previous Fifa to shoot from one meter from the goal? here); satisfaction for animations that have assumed a semblance of verisimilitude (the ~skating~ for the field, now, are gone). The game now develops with a ~ball on the ground~: to penetrate the opposing defenses, the old long balls do not pay much, while it is more effective to ~make it spin~, as Sunday fans are used to say. Many short low shots, which can be carried out by pressing the X button, allow you to avoid the intervention of the opponents, now much more intelligent and tenacious in the tackles, embarrass the defense and therefore be able to take a shot. Goal actions are exponentially more varied than in the prequels; the difficulty and the stimulus to challenge have likewise risen, and Fifa can finally be considered a real football game. However, this is distinctly arcade football, as for example the use of the right analog lever for what television commentators like to call numbers, or virtuosity, or the power of the players' shot, which in some cases becomes nothing short of explosive, reminds us. or the automatic trajectories (manual control for crosses and passes is also possible) of the crosses, which describe parabolas a little too broad and precise for a claim of verisimilitude. However, a football not without defects: the artificial intelligence of one's defense, always placed in a bad way, is questionable; the slipped tackle, practically always punished by the referee, turns out to be useless; goalkeepers are too often caught unprepared, while manual passing proves decidedly imprecise. A football that, despite the good news introduced, is not incredibly proffound; or rather, if compared with the aforementioned Pro Evolution Soccer 2, leaving out their opposite settings and focusing solely on the variety of game situations and achievable goalscoring actions, it is clearly defeated, although it comes out of the comparison with its head held high. Technically speaking If Fifa 2003 cannot boast the realism of Kcet's competitor, however it dictates the law from a technical point of view. Decidedly. In fact, the title boasts a respectable graphics engine, and takes first place in a hypothetical competition for the best visual impact in the soccer games category. What leaves us favorably impressed is above all the presence of a multitude of details that could be considered as a side dish, ranging from the highly animated public, to the presence of the referee on the field, the symbols of the teams ~projected~ on the respective half fields before the start , television-style replays and halftime highlights... All elements that ~create atmosphere~, and provide an important added value, that the competitors do not even know about. The sound sector is also excellent, not only as regards the tracklist, which has already been mentioned, but also for the commentary by Bruno Longhi and Giovanni Galli, by far the best, both for the expressiveness in the dubbing and for the variety of vocal samples. The only negative note, quite serious, are the evident slowdowns from which the title suffers especially when speech is enabled. Even deactivating it, however, the drops remain present in phases that are anything but crowded or particularly excited: this would suggest a failure to optimize the code for the Sony machine version. Comment Fifa, in its 2003 version, has finally become a full-fledged football game, after a sad and dark past, which EA sports must absolutely forget. At the current level, Fifa is not yet able to compete with Winning ElevenPro Evoltuion Soccer, which is definitely still many steps ahead (after all, sustaining a similar comparison would not be easy for anyone at all); however there are grounds for Fifa to become a great game in the future. Now it's up to EA to demonstrate whether this evolution was the result of chance or a concrete project, with Fifa 2004. For now, know that buying the new chapter in the EA football series no longer means throwing away sixty euros. At all. Pros +Technical realization +Renewed gameplay +Superlative commentary and audio sector Cons +Less deep and varied than Pes2 +Less simulative than Pes2 +Floppy controls and frequent frame rate drops Punctual, inevitable, ritual. Also this year EA reminds us what its vision of Italy's most loved sport is, thanks to its official licenses and the usual out-of-parameter audio-visual sector. Ps2gen admits to dispassionately support his main opponent, such Pro Evolution Soccer 2 of Kcet, one of the most pleasant pastimes of this playful winter; however we are ready to be amazed by this new version of Fifa, which has established itself as usual at the box office.", "date": "2003-02-17", "grade": null}
