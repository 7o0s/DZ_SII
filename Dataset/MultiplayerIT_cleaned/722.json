The only way to take revenge on the two killers is to climb the ranks of BoS and finally come face to face with them. If the plot undoubtedly has its emotional pathos, it is a pity however that the interlude cut-scenes have been made in a rather ~poor~ way (for the most part, they are rather basic static screens) giving so little that cinematic feeling, increasingly present in contemporary videogame productions. God Money Bet on Soldier starts from a playful structure now quite tested like that of FPS, trying however to engage some innovative element starting with the basic importance of money: right from the screen where we will be able to choose our paraphernalia (over 40 guns all ~ upgradable~ ranging from heavy artillery to edged weapons for close quarters), our armor (which slowly will lead us to almost become a sort of mech) and support troops (we will be able to have up to 4 other mercenaries to whom we will be able to issue orders and which give BoS a small strategic contamination), our possibilities will be based on the money available: think that we will also have to pay for a rescue or to supply energy to the machines designed for these tasks! The way to make money is clearly to complete the various objectives (clearly the clashes with the super soldiers followed by the cameras will be the most lucrative ones) that will present themselves to us from mission to mission, to which we will be able to add the various ~sub-quests~ that they will be given to us from time to time. Bet on Soldier starts from a playful structure that is now quite tested like that of FPS, however trying to insert some innovative elements starting with the basic importance of money Action on TV screens To describe the gameplay of Bet on Soldier, the possible citations of other titles to which it can be compared are really many. One could start from the Conflict series, and then move on to the classic Half-Life and DooM. Going beyond the ~game~ of combinations, we can still say that we are dealing with an acceptable title in terms of gameplay thanks to many variations on the theme and a certain variety in the way the firefights take place but which undoubtedly will not become a new term of comparison for the genre and does not even present particular innovations in the more properly ludic component. A pity then that the code we tested was still full of bugs that we hope will be eliminated by future patches. Action on TV screens Clearly inevitable is the possibility of playing in multiplayer which associates the typical game modes with a betting system on our virtual alter ego which thus maintains the basic characteristics described in regard to the single game even online. Novodex versus Havok In recent months Bet on Soldier has received a certain additional hype on sites and the specialized press because it presents the Novodex physics engine produced by Ageia and which, as you may already know, will also be implemented in the new Unreal Engine 3.0. It is certainly not the case to give definitive judgments given that what Havok does for example in Half-Life 2 is not comparable with almost any other title that used the same engine, but Novodex certainly does not emerge from this first release as a winner given that the physics of BoS turns out to be discreet and nothing more, but decidedly far from the qualitative peaks reached by Valve's masterpiece. Bet on Soldier has received some additional hype in recent months because it presents the Novodex physics engine produced by Ageia and which will also be implemented in the new Unreal Engine 3.0 Proprietary engine The guys from Kylotonn have instead created a proprietary engine for all the graphics. The KT Engine, this is the name of their ~conceived~ proves to be quite performing even with not the latest generation PCs while on high-end computers it manages to satisfactorily manage lights, shadows and the various special effects typical of DirectX 9.0. The visual appeal is undoubtedly the most successful aspect of Bet On Soldier, both in terms of the sufficiently accurate and detailed settings, yesa for the excellent quality of the characters, even if some animation frames leave something to be desired and the color choices were perhaps too repetitive. Absolutely anonymous instead the soundtrack and also the dialogues (all in English) will certainly not be remembered as the most beautiful heard in an FPS ... Final comment Given that being able to emerge in a crowded field like that of FPS is increasingly difficult day by day, Bet on Soldier is a title that tries in every way to get noticed, succeeding only in part. Beyond the somewhat surreal narrative incipit (a reality show that sets up duels between real battles between super soldiers who clash on live TV with viewers ready to bet up to the last savings) and the importance money for anything (including bailouts), the title of Kylotonn does not go beyond a full sufficiency for an acceptable but not brilliant gameplay (also due to the many bugs still present ... We are confident in the arrival of a repair patch) that moves on the classic coordinates of first-person shooters contaminated with a pinch of strategy. The most successful aspect of the game is undoubtedly the visual appeal both in terms of the sufficiently accurate and detailed settings, and for the excellent quality of the characters. Instead Novodex (the physical engine that will also be implemented in Unreal Engine 3.0) has been postponed: if we were to rely only on BOS, Havok can sleep peacefully but it is said that other applications will not use it soon in a more performing way. Pro Appeal Visual Good Some sui generis innovations Sufficient gameplay... Cons .but not brilliant Good number of bugs still present Incipit Narrative a bit too artificial Creative textures That the FPS genre is rather crowded with large productions and outsiders is an established fact. In so little ~living space~ therefore, the French programmers of Kylotonn (they only have the discreet Iron Storm behind them) have decided to give their game a rather particular (although not exactly original) narrative incipit. Put simply, Bet on Soldier tells of a more or less near future in which wars have not disappeared at all and given that the audience of the Mole and the Island of the Famous is no longer what it once was, the inventors of reality shows have seen fit to create a rather ~aggressive~ format: in practice within real battles, some super soldiers will face each other in clashes at ~High Noon~ and the public from home, as well as getting excited like never before in front of the screen, will be able to place bets on the winning warriors.", "date": "2005-12-01", "grade": null}
