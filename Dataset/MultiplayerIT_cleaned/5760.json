First of all, learning the language, and then incurring unacceptable expenses for imported consoles and games, and then still improvising engineers in order to make NTSC systems and PAL televisions communicate with each other. All stuff that will say little or nothing to young people: today everything or almost everything, in one form or another, comes to us, ready to be played without problems. Yet it still happens every now and then that you have to wait a long time to get your hands on a video game. Take The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel, it came out two years ago in Japan and is only now making its way to European audiences. And thank goodness, because otherwise we would have missed a JRPG which, although crude in some parts, is a real gem of its kind. Let's discover a real JRPG pearl that has just arrived in Europe, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel Mittelzemuria As often happens for the longest-running Japanese franchises, retracing the footsteps of the Legend of Heroes saga is almost a philologist's job: it suffices to know that, born in 1989 as the sixth episode of another intellectual property, Dragon Slayer, the series of Nihon Falcom after another game always linked to Dragon Slayer then saw several iterations divided into two trilogies and another strand with two releases; while the first trilogy told the story of the imaginary continent of Gagharv, from the sixth Japanese release - which begins the parallel series of Kiseki - the focus shifts to the equally imaginary Zemuria. Trails of Cold Steel is the first episode of a new trilogy, also set in Zemuria but this time investigating what is happening in the Erebonian Empire, the largest and most powerful political entity on the continent. All this historical-political introduction might seem redundant, but it is actually indispensable, because among the many advantages of this game, one of those that catches the eye after just a few hours is the painstaking, detailed, almost living construction of an entire world with its history, its culture, its traditions. The States of Zemuria, already painted in the predecessors, are imaginative but plausible counterparts of the real States, recalling in particular the Europe of the second half of the 19th century, a continent in full scientific and cultural ferment but on the verge of the great catastrophes of the 1900s . Erebonia looks a bit like the Habsburg Empire of those times, both in structure - a social system that relies on the great aristocratic houses for its government - and in the incredible technological upheavals brought about by the Orbal Revolution, and in the manner of the industrial revolution it has allowed an improvement in the quality of life in particular in the possibility of shortening, thanks above all to the trains, the travel times between one point and another of the Empire. And with its neighbors, Liberl and Crossbell in the first place, Erebonia has relations now of coexistence and collaboration, now of war: in fact, the ~big plot~ of Trails of Cold Steel is an all-political story made up of diplomatic relations, conflicts to be defused, rebel groups painted with astonishing realism and mastery of subject matter. The protagonists move within this large and complex fresco, nine young men enrolled in the first year of the Thors Military Academy where the future soldiers of the Empire are trained. This first episode revolves around Class VII, an experiment of the Academy: for the first time in history, aristocrats and ordinary people will study and work together in a society still based on distinctions between social classes. And just as we will gradually unravel international events, we will also gradually enter the life and personality of Rean Schwarzer and his companions, we will see them grappling with their differences, their vulnerabilities, their transition from adolescence to adulthood in an extraordinarily realistic and mature story, which in no way tends towards the rhetoric and simplification typical of a mass-market product. The mythology, the plot, the characters (including many secondary ones) of Trails of Cold Steel are, you will have understood it, fantastic and complex; the result is a game that is slow in its progression and full of information to collect, for example by talking to non-player characters or reading books and newspapers, but which is immediately engaging and surprising for its realism. A large and painstaking fresco that you don't see every day, and not just in the world of video games. A beautiful tradition In a genre desperately seeking renewal, noNew Legend of Heroes follows a traditional yet rich and complex approach. It is structured in days, set both in the Academy and in other places of the Empire, and in missions, some optional and others mandatory to advance, many of which, unfortunately, suffer from the classic bellboy syndrome and simply require you to help non-player characters. playing to deliver something around. However, consistently, the guys from Falcom find an explanation for this too and it is the NPCs themselves who provide it, in a sort of meta-videogame quotation: only in this way can the protagonists fully grasp the structure and history of the world. Beyond the main quests there are in fact other hidden ones that you can only unlock by talking to everyone, bearing in mind that at different stages of the day the same non-player character, who follows his own routine, will have different things to say and teach. As in Shenmue or Persona, you are invited to slowly enjoy the game world, full of little things to do, even fishing or cooking, but all aimed at gaining experience. An essential element is the time you decide to spend with this or that partner, through a system of Bonding Points, thus strengthening the ties, and this will then affect the fight which, at this point, while remaining fundamental, is not a predominant component , since it is also extrinsic from rather flat and linear dungeons. Not that the battle system is scarce, on the contrary: based on that of the previous Kiseki, it strengthens and fluidifies it at the same time. Traditionally turn-based, however, there are many possibilities and tactical components: Arts and Crafts are special moves, linked to two different statistics, EP and CP, which are recharged in different ways, and while the latter are acquired with experience, the former derive from the Quartz system, which a bit like the Materia of Final Fantasy VII are gems that fit inside the ARCUS, a sort of fully customizable ~magic smartphone~ in the possession of every Class VII student. Then there are the S-Breaks, very powerful moves to use strategically since they consume all the CP, also because in addition to inflicting huge damage they are able to upset the normal progress of the rounds: considering that a particular bonus is often linked to a round, in the most difficult clashes their wise use makes the difference between victory and defeat. And then the aforementioned bonds: two partnered characters will support each other in various ways depending on how strong their relationship is. Here too, in short, things are profound and strategic combat, simply repaid with more experience points at the first two difficulty levels, becomes essential to survive the third and fourth, moreover available only in the now classic New Game + -for incidentally, a real nightmare - which remains the only possibility to see everything that the title has to offer. Playstation 3 trophies 51 trophies in The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel, 38 Bronze, 10 Silver, 2 Gold and the classic Platinum which is obtained after achieving all the others. They range from those you will inevitably come across because they are linked to the story, to those dedicated to hard-core ~completists~ (catch all the fish, cook all the recipes and so on), up to those that reward the most brilliant tactics in combat, several hours of gameplay or the repetition of an extraordinary achievement over and over again, and to those that require you to reach the top of the various rankings present. All perfect? Unfortunately not. Okay we're on PlayStation 3 and used to the wonders of the current generation the impression isn't what it once was, but in many situations Trails of Cold Steel almost seems like a cross-gen... between the wrong generations! Each single element has few polygons, including the protagonists, but if this is justifiable by virtue of the fact that sometimes (but only sometimes) the panorama is very wide, rich in elements, ultimately spectacular and the frame rate is not affected by this, less understandable is the very sensitive pop-up and above all the fact that some textures are very, very dirty and indefinite, in particular for those elements which inevitably cover a lot of the visual field, such as the lawn in a country area, which makes the longer and more numerous sections are not very pleasing to the eye. A sin all the more because the artistic direction is first-rate: an imaginary halfway between history and steampunk, with numerous references to the Central European climate of the late 1800s we were talking about above; just see the soldiers' uniforms which closely resemble those of the Austrian and Prussian armies. The portraits of the heroes, on the other hand, rely on a tr anime styleadditional and well-crafted that, despite the presence of many young and busty female characters, makes a sober and discreet use of the fanservice. The ~itchy~ component could be felt more in what are the stories of the characters and their relationships, but also the dialogues are surprisingly mature and well written, since they never exceed and intelligently leave some aspects to the imagination; in this sense, the gigantic localization work should be underlined, unfortunately, however, only in English, and given the quantity and importance of the text, this is also a factor to consider in the case of a possible purchase. The dubbing then has its ups and downs: the acting is remarkable, but some voices are really irritating and not very suitable for the appearance and personality of the characters. Furthermore, the criterion according to which some parts are dubbed and others, especially relating to Rean, are not understood; an inconstancy that also affects the music, however very varied: some excellent, others decidedly banal and present for long sections. The picture is completed by the possibility of cross-save with the PlayStation Vita version and a longevity which, as you may have guessed by now, is easily between 60 and 100 hours.", "date": "2016-01-22", "grade": "8.8"}
