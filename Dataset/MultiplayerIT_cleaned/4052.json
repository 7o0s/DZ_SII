Despite the problems of recent years, NBA Live's curriculum speaks to us of a career almost a quarter of a century long, which started in the distant 1994 on Super Nintendo, Mega Drive and PC. Especially for those who did not own a console, at the time NBA Live was for years a point of reference for playing basketball on your monitor, before yielding under the blows of the meticulous siege carried out by NBA 2K (here you will find the NBA review 2K19). A competition that has seen the EA Sports series fall several times in recent times, however always trying to get back up: the last resurgence was a year ago, when NBA Live 18 arrived on the market after a year off. The good feedback obtained has boded well for the creation of NBA Live 19, which arrived on time in this month of September which accompanies us to the start of the 2018-2019 season of spectacular American basketball. What better time, then, to find out what EA Sports has in store for us? The modalities: I am The One The last few years have seen an ever-increasing rise for single career modes in sports games. More than just a career, it was in many cases a real story, as FIFA 19 and its The Journey mode also teach us. Without aspiring to the realization peaks seen in the history of football simulation, NBA Live 19 takes us in the role of the chosen one that everyone calls The One, a promise of basketball about to arrive in the world of professionalism. The existence of the mode is certainly not new, but it is in it that most of the innovations developed by the developers in NBA Live 19 are concentrated. The first concerns women's basketball, also introduced in the edition of the year last with WNBA championship teams. Now it becomes possible to create an ad hoc character to take part in The One, then giving rise to mixed teams with male and female players if necessary. The only flaw from this point of view is represented by the lack of The League sub-mode, through which it is possible to play the NBA championship with a male player. In the role of a woman The One is therefore a mode that is only partially complete, even if there is still plenty of fun inside it. In fact, the personalization part of your character plays a fundamental role, together with the matches on the road and in the pitches outside those of the professional league. For this edition EA Sports has decided to include some of the most famous street fields around the world, including the famous Quai 54 which hosts the tournament promoted by Air Jordan. As he progresses in the mode, the player can choose to compose his team with some famous players: the first of them is Joel Embiid, face of NBA Live 19 who in history challenges our ~The One~ on his own home court. The passage also offers the opportunity to introduce the Court Battles, a sort of basketball-themed tower defense where the player must create a squad with the players he has available. The team created here will then be controlled by the CPU in matches against other users, following rules for the current match that can also deviate from the standard basketball ones. From a role-playing point of view, The One offers some dialogues between our character and the members of his staff, without however particularly surprising: the only choice that matters is the one made at the end of the exchange, where to take home a few more hype points or the currency needed to buy customizations in the street uniform. The other modes of NBA Live 19 present few new features: among them we obviously remember Ultimate Team, lightened compared to the mastodon that it has now become in FIFA 19, and the usual Franchise. Playstation 4 trophies NBA Live 19 brings with it a total of thirty Trophies. Together with the inevitable Platinum color award, we find five Gold-type Trophies, as well as ten Silver and fourteen Bronze. To achieve all of the objectives proposed by EA Sports, you need to range a little between all of the modes present in NBA Live 19, including Ultimate Team. The gameplay: fluency in command Once you get down to the NBA Live 19 field, you realize that from this point of view the game represents an evolution of what we saw last year. A common factor in annual sports titles, but given the vicissitudes the NBA Live series has gone through, a sign of continuity can only be interpreted in a positive way. In game dynamics, the main novelty is represented by technologyto Real Player Motion, introduced this year by EA Sports also in Madden NFL 19 after having already made its debut with FIFA 18. What benefits from this introduction is above all the fluidity of movement of the players, characterized by more convincing animations than in the past. There are actually moments in which the fluidity loses a bit, where the player we have on the field does not seem to immediately interpret our commands. However, these are moments that happen quite rarely. The gaming experience always remains halfway between simulation and arcade, therefore without particular claims to realism on the part of NBA Live 19. In these terms, the presence in defense of a button that allows the player we control to move is significant automatically to counter the attacker. Apart from that, there is an evident tendency to make some actions spectacular to give greater satisfaction to the user, above all when dunks and blocks are involved. The artificial intelligence is generally good, even if it needs to be reviewed in some passages: once the weak points of the CPU have been identified, it becomes easy to beat it in the attack phases. The controls in general do not present particular innovations: to shoot, reference is made to a vertical bar, at the top of which leave the button to make the best shot, however taking into consideration the player's position and any tackle. Graphics and sound The visual impact of NBA Live 19 is undoubtedly high, especially in shots from above the fields. The arenas in which we find ourselves playing - whether they are on the street or in the arenas of the NBA championship - show considerable care on the part of the developers, maintaining the quality presented in the filmed introductions even during the actual game phases. The models of the most famous American basketball champions are easily recognizable by those sitting in front of the screen, even if the quality of the model made by EA Sports also decreases with the level of fame. NBA Live 19 also shows off its ESPN license, used properly to give a television cut to what happens on the pitch. The entertainment offered during the interval was less convincing, also due to a rather closed technical commentary. As for the news, things go a little better when we return to the game, finding the new Ed Cohen and Jay Williams to accompany us: since it is a commentary in English, the interest in it is obviously less than the translation made in English.
