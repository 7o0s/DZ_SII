{"name": "Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-gaiden-master-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Ryu Hayabusa is a character who needs very little introduction, just like the Ninja Gaiden trilogy in which he is the protagonist and the Dead or Alive franchise, in which he appears in passing, but remaining linked for one reason or another to characters like Ayane and Kasumi. Anyone who has followed the series knows that the order of the chapters goes hand in hand with the approval rating and, more generally, with the quality of the game: the third is the one that is rightly less remembered, or if it is done it is not certainly in positive terms. It is a sort of spurious child, unrelated to the previous titles and also guilty of having distorted the trilogy by making the weight of the separation between Team Ninja and Tomonobu Itagaki feel. In short, nine years ago (eight if we consider Razor's Edge) ended rather badly a series that had given so much to the genre, despite its antics in the plots and also some flaws here and there in the gameplay, because in any case all that glitters is not always gold. We therefore hope that Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection is not simply an exercise in nostalgia but also the sign of Ryu's rightful return, even if only to right the past wrong. Find out in the review of Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection. The Way of the Ninja at 60fps Two essential specifications to make before getting to the heart of the article. Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection offers the most recent versions of the respective chapters, therefore Ninja Gaiden , Ninja Gaiden 2 and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. It is a choice that could make purists turn up their noses but which, in the end, does not affect the games from a playful point of view. Secondly, we are talking about a remaster: this means that the three titles are the same as you have already known, they change the resolution and the framerate, i.e. 4K at 60fps on PlayStation 5 in backwards compatibility, where we shed tears and curses. Knowing though that Sony's flagship console is still a rather rare commodity, we also did some tests on PlayStation 4 Pro, which confirms 60fps but with a fixed 1080p resolution. Furthermore, beyond the day one patch which would implement dismemberments and beheadings in the first two chapters, it must be said that there is not this big difference between the two versions: the DualSense is not exploited in any way, and if it is we were not able to perceive it, while as regards the uploads there is a gap of just a couple of seconds between PlayStation 5 and PS4 Pro. So if you want to buy Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection for PS4 Pro, do it without worrying about any and all too obvious gaps. The same resolution, despite everything, leaves something to be desired even in 4K but we'll talk more about this later. The way of the Ninja in 2021 Ninja Gaiden , the first boss fight is never forgotten Ninja Gaiden is a series that, with the exception of the third chapter, has made combat a ferocious and frenetic choreography, where every move must be calculated in detail to avoid facing the deaths that will still punctuate your path. Before Dark Souls and when Demon's Souls was still too niche to infect the gaming landscape like its successor, there was Ninja Gaiden to put us in line with its ruthless, but also imperfect gameplay. The so-called ~priority system~, which allowed Ryu to target an enemy based on certain conditions, enhanced his incredibly frenetic action, although he didn't always hit the mark and was above all a bit crippled by a camera (positioned manually behind his back by Ryu) who often got in the way becoming in turn one of the many enemies on the screen. While appreciating the variety of possible approaches thanks to a fair number of weapons, going back to clashing now in 2021 highlights some defects on which perhaps at the time one could turn a blind eye but now clash: from the sudden and logical ineffectiveness of some throwing weapons on certain enemies (explosive arrows that do not explode, or tungsten arrows that bounce away despite having pierced a tank just before), to the fact that the larger demonic creatures are rather indifferent to our shots, making it difficult to insert combos without being interrupted in any way. A similar discourse applies to the bosses, obviously of human size or slightly larger, who receive our efforts almost with a smile and then give us a backhanded blow that makes us fly half dead to the other side of the arena; or else they rob us of the joy of parrying, as most of their attacks break our guard. A set of imperfections that if fourteen years ago, talking about Ninja Gaiden , could be digested because around it there was a valuable combat system and notrue yardstick, today it catches the eye more: it also pushes us to ask ourselves if it really makes sense to re-propose certain games verbatim after a long period of time - even more so considering that the entire trilogy is backwards compatible on Xbox. Ninja Gaiden is undoubtedly a game that raises the bar of the challenge step by step, especially at high difficulties, to be experienced in its variety of weapons, ninpo and techniques, and with which to improve thanks to the extra modes; nevertheless, fourteen years are a long time and replaying it after such a long time, in an edition aimed at polishing its aesthetic aspect and performance a bit, has put us in front of a gameplay that overall still defends itself well, but in some parts of it show the side. The Way of the Ninja remastered Ninja Gaiden 2, Rachel and the passion for firearms The three chapters of Ninja Gaiden are children of their time and despite the progressive improvement, game after game, it is clear that miracles cannot be expected. The work carried out is discreet, especially thanks to the use of blooming and distortion effects that go well with 4K and 60fps, however it is the bare minimum: especially in the films of Ninja Gaiden  it happened to be able to count the pixels on some elements, perhaps a bit too much of an eyesore even for a ~simple~ remaster. Being the oldest of the trio, he naturally suffers the most, but a little more effort could have been made to make it less impactful - in a bad way. Nothing to say as regards the scenarios: they are bare and a bit spartan, but this is really an aspect on which one could not intervene unless transforming Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection into a hybrid as it was for NieR: Replicant. Furthermore, the quality of the level design balances the settings and is still the most important thing. Ninja Gaiden 2 is the one that shines the most in this respect, both because it is an excellent evolution of the previous chapter (with perhaps a little more kitsch settings but also more elaborate), and because it starts from a more refined base: the polygonal models of the characters emerge in all their beauty, also enhanced by the light effects that give their best especially when you use the ninpo arts. We are unable to tell you how much the first and second games explode in a whirlwind of blood and dismemberment because the reviewed version did not include them: they will be available with a day one patch but we have little doubt that they can release both with your head held high. Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is clearly the least inspired title, both in the artistic direction and in the design, however it does not come out entirely with broken bones from an aesthetic point of view. The gameplay is quite another thing but you already know this if you are a longtime fan; if you are not, we refer you to the review linked at the beginning of the article.", "date": "2021-06-10", "grade": "7.0"}
