Unlike the other Omega Force action games, the game is set in the Japanese Middle Ages, between 1467 and 1573, a period that saw the clash between legendary leaders such as Hattori Hanzo, Keiji Maeda, Miyamoto Musashi, Oda Nobunaga and others. The new episode, Samurai Warriors 4, arrives on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, but also and above all on PlayStation 4, after the disappointing Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate (released just a month and a half ago), thus fleshing out the list of franchises produced from Tecmo Koei who made their debut on next-gen platforms. The subject of this review is the PlayStation 4 version of the game, in our opinion the most convincing from a technical point of view if we consider the other musou. A clear sign of the familiarity that Japanese developers are starting to have with the new Sony hardware, and which will undoubtedly bring further benefits in the future, hopefully in the direction of a more varied structure and less repetitive and more interesting gameplay. Needless to say: the feeling of Samurai Warriors 4 is identical to that of the other episodes of the series, ergo if you are looking for something new you will inevitably be disappointed. Samurai Warriors 4 stands perhaps as the best next-gen musou so far, but the road is still long Clash of the titans Having overcome the odious barrier of the initial dialog boxes concerning the game saving methods (which then, at each new start, we will have to load online to support cross-save on the other Sony consoles), a solution that deserves a decisive streamlining, we appreciated the compactness of the available options. From the starting screen it is in fact possible to access the Story Mode, a free mode, the Dojo and the Chronicles mode. The last two items are closely related, as in the Dojo it is possible to create one's own character using a simple editor but not particularly varied in assets, then use it precisely in the Chronicles mode, which compared to the standard campaign provides the possibility of exploring the territories freely and make choices that may lead us to serve one general rather than another. These are extras that increase the overall duration of the experience, but which unfortunately do not introduce any novelty into a mix that would desperately need novelty, and which instead is recycled from time to time. So let's move on to Story Mode, the fulcrum of the Tecmo Koei product with its twelve storylines, most of which are to be unlocked by completing those initially available. Each is generally made up of four missions in which our objective is to conquer the territories on the map and, in particular, eliminate the officers and commanders so that our army can advance towards the next stage. From this point of view, nothing new: there is no conquest of a single sector as the action focuses on human objectives, but the dynamics remain rather repetitive and we are often asked to reach very distant places or to pay attention to the level of vital energy of our companions as, if they were to die, it would be game over. To avoid the frustration of having to repeat a particularly long mission, our suggestion is to set the orders so as never to stay too far from our friends, eventually switching to the control of the second warrior where there are particular threats or an energy level Bass. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-four Trophies present in Samurai Warriors 4 are obtained in a rather linear way, completing the Story Mode in all its parts and then aiming for more complex objectives, such as for example enhancing all the most famous characters up to the maximum level, using certain maneuvers a number of times in battle and dissect the Chronicles mode. New episode, old problems The degree of challenge of Samurai Warriors 4 is relatively low, and this is mainly due to a poor artificial intelligence of the enemies, which also penalizes the boss fight. In fact, it is enough to always perform the same combination to be right even the most cunning opponents, while the standard soldiers almost do not dare to touch us despite always being overwhelmingly superior in numbers. The only complicated situations are created in the stages in which there are riflemen, who by continuously targeting us make it difficult to proceed with their annihilation, but in principle the game over rarely occurs, due tothe killing of one of our companions (where his survival falls within the requirements for completing the mission) or due to a coarse and approximate approach to battle, perhaps the result of low difficulty and fights that never manage to be sufficiently interesting . However, it must be recognized that in terms of impact rendering, physicality and the technical sector, the game shows substantial improvements compared to the aforementioned Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate. Although there are only a few weeks between the publication of the two titles, it is clear that the developers of Omega Force have taken better care of the experience of Samurai Warriors 4, giving presence to the enemies, especially the bigger ones, and making them more resistant to blows , as well as optimizing the engine to minimize the traditional pop-up problems, while pushing the accelerator on the number of characters present on the screen at the same time. The enemies we can hit, beating them by the dozens, are now really many and, thanks to a ~smart~ connotation of the scenarios (always bare and lacking in interactivity, but with some more sophisticated plots than usual), they no longer appear a few meters from our warrior, but are already visible from a certain distance. This is an element that we could consider trivial, but which actually represents a substantial visual improvement for the Musou series, assisted by a frame rate that remains fluid and stable, without dips or slowdowns, even in the busiest situations. Of course, the big problems remain in the management of the view (often we fight blindly because the shot does not follow us in the slightest), as does the repetitiveness of a gameplay linked to the almost infinite execution of rather similar combos, despite the introduction of a couple of unedited maneuvers (see the ~clicks~ between shots). We hope to soon see a rethinking of these aspects of the experience as well.", "date": "2014-10-21", "grade": "7.0"}
