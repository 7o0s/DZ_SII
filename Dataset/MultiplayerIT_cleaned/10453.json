{"name": "Madden NFL 10", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71340-madden-nfl-10-madden-nfl-10.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360But if instead of FIFA the real football game had been called Sacchi FIFA 2010, would the result have come close to the NFL saga made in Electronic Arts? One really has to wonder given that by now there are so many titles in the series and Mr. Madden has left an indelible mark on the world of virtual football. Even for the 2009/2010 season the game is served. Perfection? The EA series dedicated to American football has always been a great success of the publisher, it has never had to suddenly change course as happened instead to the FIFA saga, it has always moved in a clear direction and the product has been gradually more and more perfected, and now making a review is increasingly difficult since the improvements are actually always tweaks, subtleties that only become evident after many hours spent with the joypad in hand. The real novelty consists of the overall setting of the game, which evidently manifests the desire of the developers to get ever closer to reality, to the world of franchises and everything that revolves around them, from sponsors to televisions, and consequently to be able control every aspect of our team. With the new menu EA have chosen to launch the player directly into the game, in an instant you are in the game, being able to start a quick match or an exciting league in Franchise Mode. Gameplay As for the gameplay, as we said in the introduction, the work of the developers has moved by continuing the direction traced by the previous chapters. A continuous refinement of an already excellent job, and the result can be seen. We are probably in the presence of the best football game ever. The tweaks were meticulous, not very evident but perfect for making the game even more realistic and close to the show that enchants millions of viewers around the world. From a graphic point of view, the polygonal models of the athletes are almost perfect and move harmoniously in compliance with the game schemes. The animations have been increased and made even more fluid as well as the much more ~physical~ clashes. Everything that surrounds the playing field is not really perfect, for example the stadiums are well recreated but the public has certainly been created superficially by the developers and all the personnel on the sidelines are absolutely unrealistic in their immobility. The speed of the simulation has been properly adjusted, actually slowed down slightly in order to give the player the possibility to perform evasion moves and ~dribbles~ during runs with a greater chance of success. You must not think that thanks to the slowdown everything has become easier, indeed scrums and turnovers for example are present in an important way in the game. Connected to this is the introduction of the new Fight for the Fumble mechanism and that is the possibility during a turnover to manage the scrum by pressing the appropriate keys at the right moment. Fortunately, this novelty was introduced wisely by the developers of EA and only in certain cases it is possible to decree through the Fight for the Fumble who gets the ball, in short, success does not always depend on our reaction speed in pressing the buttons. As mentioned, the animations of the athletes are a real feast for the eyes, with increasingly real players in their movements, falls, dives and throws. In the offensive phase the feints have now become much more effective and with a little practice you can sometimes make the defenders fall and dash away. As far as the defensive phase is concerned, it is now possible to act more effectively through the right stick, rather than the old system that relied on the bumper. The tackle management system is much improved (simply called Pro-Tak) and the efforts made to make the physicality of the fights between the athletes evident. Impersonating the quarterback now you have a better chance of avoiding blitzes by discarding at least a couple of tackles, a possibility that the purists of the game may not like very much but which is actually highly spectacular. The game schemes have once again been further increased, and now it is also possible to manage the individual programs manually, by drawing them joypad in hand. Bad impressions are ensured if only in online challenges against prepared opponents and fierce defenses, in the single player instead the chances of success increase thanks also to some occasional blunder in the defenses managed by the AI. who leads the opponents on the field. Franchise Mode The Franchise Mode, the true heart of the single player game, has been modified mainly in two respects, orNow the calendar is no longer free as in the past and it is not possible, for example, to set up friendly matches to test the team, one passes from one official match to another. Not bad, the season is long, even if we know that the most perfectionist of you will not be happy with the choice of EA. Even the Hub has changed a lot, we are literally inundated with news on the progress of the league, such as trades, injuries. It is even more possible than in the past to set up one's job as ~lord and master~ of the franchise from one year to the next, also taking into account the Super Bowls and their winners. Everything else has been confirmed, we are in the presence of the most accurate and complete simulation of an American football franchise, controllable in every aspect, from the game plans to the merchandise to the structure of the home stadium. Television appeal is guaranteed within the Franchise Mode by the Extra Point Show, essentially a real sports newscast on what happened on the sports weekend by Fran Charles and Alex Flanagan of NFL Network. Very spectacular even if you will probably skip it mercilessly after a few days. In this new way of approaching the world of the NFL it is possible to see the virtual counterparts of the real athletes, finally without helmets and protections, interviewed by the various television networks. From a graphic point of view not everything is perfect but the show works properly. The possibility of creating your own champion in Superstar Mode has obviously been confirmed. By creating a player it is in fact possible to practice the game, even if we have to admit it the system is not exactly perfect since the practice is endless and above all it does not bring any improvement in the athlete's statistics. Xbox 360 goals There are 29 achievements available to Xbox 360 users, 4 of which are secret, for a total of 1150 points. Completing all the challenges will not be easy and will require many hours of online and offline play. Some goals require you to interact with real NFL stars, one example being intercepting a pass from the great Tom Brady. Online There are two new ways to play online, which we think are really great. The one we consider to be the most successful is the Online Franchise, build a league together with 31 other friends and start a season completely experienced on Xbox Live and on the PlayStation Network. It is obvious that it is not easy to find many who enjoy a game of American football, but now if we consider the ever greater appeal that this sport has in Europe and in Italy, we are confident that it is possible to recover the right number, above all to avoid leaving at the strangest hours due to time zones. Like a real offline league, in this online one it will be possible to exchange players, and manage the draft and if that doesn't seem enough, bear in mind that an iPhone application will soon be available that connects directly to the game and allows you to follow the league directly from the phone. The other modality, very immediate in reality, is the one dedicated to quick online matches together with a partner. The structure works very well and the only real problem is given by the camera framing too narrow, and if this does not hinder the attack it creates too many problems in the defensive phase. However, the satisfaction of calibrating a good launch on our friend who runs in the open field is something truly priceless.", "date": "2009-10-20", "grade": "8.5"}
