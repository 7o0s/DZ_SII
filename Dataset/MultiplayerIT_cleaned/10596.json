{"name": "L'isola del tesoro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/69455-wii-sports-resort-lisola-del-tesoro.html", "text": "The Motion Plus starter was served by Sega and Electronic Arts with Virtua Tennis 2009, Grand Slam Tennis and Tiger Woods 10; products of indisputable quality, but it is evident how the interest of the whole community was projected towards Nintendo itself, and more specifically towards its Wii Sports Resort, as a real indicator of the capabilities of the new device. Now that the most important game of the summer, if not the entire 2009 for the house of Kyoto, has finally arrived on the market, we can put an end to all questions. Sport is good It is a pity that the obligations of logos, preliminary screens, titles and above all endless introductory videos to Motion Plus stand between the player and what is the way in which Sports Resort welcomes him: a spectacular and evocative parachute jump, in which the Wiimote becomes your Mii in free fall towards WuHu Island, and where every slight inclination of the remote determines a change of angle of the character between clouds and crisp air. And while the typical smile generated by a game made in Kyoto is printed on the face, the Nintendo title opens up offering immediate access to the 12 sports available. Therefore, if a good day starts in the morning, the road to the Sports Resort should be all downhill; in reality, in the end, the sensation is that of a title of the highest quality, but which lacks something to enter the Olympus of masterpieces capable of making everyone agree. But let's start with the merits, above all the most important: yes, the game is fun - a lot - and no, it's not a simple Motion Plus tech demo. robust variety of activities; we said that there are a dozen, but for many of them variants capable of offering even more than significantly different experiences are unlocked. The result is that, really, there is something for all tastes; those looking for an immediate and very ~physical~ challenge can throw themselves at Chanbara, the basketball free throw competition or rowing, while those who want something more relaxing can have fun with Frisbee, archery or golf. The latter, together with bowling, constitutes the ~recovery~ of disciplines already present in Wii Sports and in a certain sense recycled on this occasion. The list is completed by water activities such as Wakeboarding and Moto Surfing, cycling, high-altitude sports and table tennis. Making differences or rankings between the activities would be like trying to say which ice cream flavor is better: impossible, because every player can find his ideal dimension within the Nintendo production. The writer, for example, undoubtedly finds the best and most satisfying triptych in table tennis, archery and acrobatic throwing; somewhat disappointing instead Chanbara, which often runs the risk of ending up in a rambling series of random slashes, the shallow wakeboarding - probably the weak point of the whole package - and moto surfing, an all too watered-down version (forgive us for the sad game of words) of the legendary Wave Race. But these are, we want to repeat it, indications that for many may not be acceptable; and it is precisely in this, in the variety, that Sports Resort is able to offer its best. A game with something extra However, it is inevitable to argue that Sports Resort is absolutely and totally a product to be faced in multiplayer; only in this way, in fact, the Nintendo title is able to guarantee that sense of challenge and competition which becomes a fundamental element of its success. And this is because, if played alone, the fun tends to decrease in proportion to the discovery factor; after the enthusiasm linked to the ~first time~, after having unlocked all the different variations of the disciplines, and after having broken one's own records and perfected the technique, what remains for the solitary user is in fact very little. In this sense, it is impossible not to criticize once again the anachronistic choice of the Kyoto house to turn its head away from any type of online mode. If the idea of a multiplayer network may seem science fiction, perhaps a public scoreboard would have been sufficient, so as to offer some further stimulus in improving one's performance. But no, Nintendo has decided to remain true to itself, to the concept that to challenge someone, this someone must be in the flesh in our living room. While waiting for things to change, perhaps allowing the patina of dust now collected on Wii Speaks around the world to be removed, there is no doubt that Sports Resort is one of the most entertaining andrewarding products currently on the market. And this is whether users belong to the hardcore or casual category; there are no distinctions on WuHu Island. The entrance ticket, however, is not cheap: the package with the bundled game and peripheral must inevitably be accompanied by at least one other Motion Plus, admitted and not granted that you already have a second Wiimote and Nunchuck. But in the end, is this Motion Plus really the long-awaited revolution? Well, maybe putting it in these terms is frankly excessive, but without a shadow of a doubt the new Nintendo peripheral adds a further dimension in control via Wiimote, eliminating in one fell swoop the frustration linked to pointing and detection errors that have often and willingly afflicted Wii games. Everything becomes much more natural, to the point that we tend not to notice its presence; or rather, the Motion Plus allows you not to ~worry~ about its presence, thus giving you the possibility to play and perform movements exactly as you would really do by throwing a frisbee, or holding a ping pong racket and so on. Sensitivity is really good, and if we still can't say it's an authentic 1:1 detection situation, we're damned close. Too bad it is necessary to recalibrate the device quite frequently during the games, aiming at the center of the screen or placing the controller on a flat surface for a few seconds. A quick but not exactly painless operation, which becomes quite boring in the long run. Finally, a few lines regarding the technical component, which obviously maintains the minimalist and stylized style, but by no means poor or modest, of the first Wii Sports. An aspect that has now become directly and unequivocally associated with the Wii, a further sign of the very strong personality that Nintendo has managed to instill in its console and its games.", "date": "2009-07-31", "grade": "8.0"}
