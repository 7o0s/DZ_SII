Dated 1997, the Namco Bandai platform was a considerable success with audiences and critics, thanks to an appreciable technical sector and above all thanks to a winning gameplay, based on simple but engaging mechanics. After a sequel for PlayStation 2 - indeed not unforgettable - the series was practically shelved by the Japanese software house, at least until today: here is therefore a nice remake of the first chapter for Wii, suitably updated from a cosmetic point of view. Let's see if Klonoa: Door to Phantomille has aged well or if it doesn't hold a candle to more modern productions. The grove of my fantasy Storyline and character design betray the origins of Klonoa: Door to Phantomille, daughters of a period in which Japanese platformers hardly crossed over from the territory of the ~cute and cuddly~: the protagonist is a kind of cat with very long ears, who lives in the world of Phantomille, a place fueled by people's dreams. Life in Klonoa flows peacefully and carefree, until the day when an airship crashes into a mountain: accompanied by his friend Huepow, our hero decides to investigate, only to discover that two unscrupulous beings, Ghadius and Joka, are intent on stealing a pendant with magical properties. In reality, it must be said that, behind this sugary appearance, there are some aspects of the plot with rather dark tones, which if on the one hand make everything less trivial, on the other hand clash considerably with the generally light tone of the whole Namco Bandai production. The first - and fundamentally only - aspect that differentiates this new Wii version from the original PSX obviously concerns the cosmetic aspect, which has undergone an absolutely noteworthy upgrade. While maintaining the setting of a two-dimensional platform, Klonoa: Door to Phantomille is totally 3D, even as regards the characters, which in the dated 1997 title were instead simple sprites. The graphic system is more than good, and despite being a remake, the Namco Bandai work stands at medium-high levels in proportion to other exponents of the genre on the Nitnendo console. The main dish is certainly represented by quality of the settings, very varied and permeated with a palpable fairy-tale mood: the choreographic movements of the camera only emphasize this aspect, highlighting lush forests, dark caves, flying fortresses and so on, all characterized by a lively color palette and very pleasant. Also noteworthy are the polygonal models of Klonoa and the on-screen enemies, which compensate for a not exactly extraordinary amount of polygons with a remarkable characterization and well-made animations. The only false notes in a technically impeccable picture reside in some facets of the sound accompaniment: if the music and effects do their duty, the speech in Italian sometimes proves to be terribly annoying, with shrill voices reciting (badly) lines of dialogue entirely without thickness. New old school Although the audiovisual upgrade constitutes an important part of this new Klonoa: Door to Phantomille, it was essential to re-propose the play structure unchanged that had received so much acclaim in its original PSX incarnation. Namco Bandai has done its job very well even if, as we will see, it could have dared to do something more. The gameplay rests on the simple foundations that had decreed its success in 1997: controlling Klonoa (by means of the Remote alone, a Classic Controller or the Remote + Nuncuck combo), the user only has to run, jump, collect bonuses and use the own peculiar weapon to get rid of enemies. Taking advantage of a magic ring, our hero can literally collect the various little monsters that populate the levels and throw them not only in the four standard directions, but also in depth: an action that proves indispensable for defeating other opponents, obtaining otherwise unattainable treasures or reaching platforms at beyond the physical potential of Klonoa. These few elements are intelligently exploited during the levels of the adventure, leading the player to always repeat the same two or three moves, but in contexts that constantly stimulate him to small reflections. And in fact level design is one of the most important strengths of Namco Bandai's production, it's just a pity that its potential runs out too soon: Klonoa: Door to Phantomille lasts five hours, characterized by a laughable level of difficulty and the almost total absence of replay value. Very little for a platformer mtoday, and in this sense the developers could certainly have done something more.", "date": "2009-06-16", "grade": "7.8"}
