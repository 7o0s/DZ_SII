{"name": "Nuova citt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93020-driver-san-francisco-nuova-citta-vecchio-driver.html", "text": "Version Tested: Nintendo WiiIt's been eleven years since Reflections made the first episode of Drivers for PlayStation. The initial idea was to combine the dynamics of racing games with a simple mission structure which, more often than not, simply involved moving our car from point A to point B. The development team itself (now called Ubisoft Reflections, after the acquisition by the French company) has recently decided to reinterpret the franchise, to rejuvenate it in a decisive way and to add to the well-known gameplay a series of extra features, including the original and spectacular power called ~shift~. This ability allows the protagonist to do a bit like agent Smith in ~The Matrix~, that is to substitute his will for that of the driver of any vehicle in the middle of traffic, in order to take control of it and generate situations that can give him an advantage over the objective of the current mission. Just download the multiplayer demo for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and realize how much these new features have changed the face of a game that has recycled the same situations for too long, together with a series of really exciting online modes if you play with friends. But the Wii version? Well, beyond the setting and the protagonist, we can say with relative tranquility that on the Nintendo Driver: San Francisco console, on the other hand, it has hardly undergone any changes, avoiding any attempt at innovation with the excuse of the technical limitations of the platform and offering us the same old shit. Once the shift has been removed, what remains? My name is Tanner. John Tanner In a city that has been quiet for too long, all hell suddenly breaks loose: agent John Tanner unwillingly witnesses the killing of a fellow patrolman and swears he would avenge his death. To succeed, he agrees to work undercover to curry favor with the boss Solomon Caine, and coordinates his work with another policeman, Tobias Jones. Through the eleven chapters that make up the story mode, we will find ourselves playing the role of all three of these characters in a sandbox-style context that will allow us to access the missions simply by reaching them on the map, while remaining free to wander around San Francisco in search of hidden objects, ramps and more. A widely tested approach, which however results in missions devoid of originality and bite, spoiled by now worn-out dynamics and even by some small bugs. Certainly the control system entrusted to the Wii-mote / Nunchuk pair does not help, and indeed it is quite traumatic at first, given that it is not possible to modify it in any way or use other controllers. Handling of the car is almost entirely done to the Nunchuk, with the analog stick used to turn the steering wheel and the Z and C buttons respectively used to accelerate and brake. Since the buttons are not analog, the tracking operations (which would require a fine adjustment of the speed) have a really ~old style~ flavor, and this is anything but pleasant. On the right side, the Wii-mote is used to operate the handbrake and any weapons, with the reticle being moved around the screen thanks to the infrared pointer, but the layout of the controls in general is awkward and difficult to get used to. Luckily the physics of the cars comes in handy, and although the front end is always around the corner (literally) you can move the car with a certain agility. Same old story As for motion detection, in the case of Driver: San Francisco it is used little and badly: to ram a criminal's vehicle you have to suddenly move the Wii-mote towards the desired side, but the reaction is far from precise and is preferable to hit the opponent on duty normally, hoping however that the system correctly detects the impact (it doesn't always happen...). To raise the car on two wheels you have to press the A button and tilt the controller to the side, but the top is certainly reached with the activation of the nitro: to perform this operation, you have to shake the Nunchuk downwards as if you were press the accelerator to the floor, but with such speed and force that you find yourself pounding your thighs (or worse: be careful!). All these skills can be enhanced by spending the points earned by completing missions and driving in an ~acrobatic~ way, while as regards the bullet time and the possibility of using weapons, you have to wait for the unlocking as you progress through the various chapters. There are quite a few options on the game's start screen and yesdeceives that the developers have included an online multiplayer mode, unable to compete with what is available on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, but at least to fill an already big qualitative gap. But no: multiplayer is only locally, via split-screen, for up to four players. And the co-op mode sees our companion simply managing his sights and weapons, aiming to make chasing and ramming even easier than they already are. The picture of a disappointing production is completed by the technical sector, which if it manages to get by in terms of audio (thanks to quite apt grindhouse music and decent dubbing) does not do the same in terms of graphics, far from being up to par of the best Wii titles: the polygonal models are excessively simple, there is no shadow of a person on the street (only vehicles!), the drawing distance leaves much to be desired and the frame rate drops as soon as the situation gets a little busier.", "date": "2011-09-12", "grade": "6.0"}
