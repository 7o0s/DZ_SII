{"name": "Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-recensione.html", "text": "Although many fans have taken Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory as a kind of joke in bad taste, we have been keeping an eye on the latest indieszero effort with moderate interest. After all, we're talking about the same developer who signed the two Theathrythm Final Fantasy, exciting rhythm games for Nintendo 3DS and mobile systems that have delighted us for hours and hours on the notes of the most famous music of the immortal Square Enix franchise. The idea of playing something similar in sauce Kingdom Hearts, a rhythm game based essentially on the compositions of the extraordinary Yoko Shimomura, was irresistible. Unfortunately, first the demo and then the final code, whose review you are reading, broke the spell when we realized that the title in question, sold at full price, is a lazy homework that could and should have offered much more. Is the story there or isn't there? For many years, fans of Kingdom Hearts old and new have complained about the dismemberment of the complicated storyline between different platforms and genres, just think of the fundamental information disclosed through a gacha for mobile systems: not exactly the best way to retain a community which, before compilation for PlayStation 4, had to collect the brand on both Sony and Nintendo consoles. In this sense, Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory seems almost an insult, because it represents the real conclusion of the so-called saga of the Seeker of Darkness, the one that began with the first Kingdom Hearts and ended a short time ago with Kingdom Hearts III. The ending of Melody of Memory, in fact, literally acts as a bridge to the next saga, answering the question that everyone asked themselves at the end of the third chapter: what happened to Sora? In short, this chapter is not exactly a spin-off: in the few minutes that the finale lasts, the only unedited cinematic of the package, we discover some details that will be fundamental for the future of the series, such as for example the name of the city in which we met Yozora or the existence of another world where the ancient Masters of the Keyblade would have traveled. Enough material to make us years of conjecture waiting for the next official Kingdom Hearts, but still Tetsuya Nomura has piled it all together in the very last minutes of the game. Until then, Melody of Memory is only a gigantic recap, a ~summary of the previous episodes~ that traces the entire saga from its beginnings through the old kinematics, reworked and accompanied by Kairi's narrative voice. The entire campaign, called the World Tour, takes place in his memories, made up of dozens of stages inspired by the various worlds we have visited in the various chapters of the saga. Each world is represented by one or more stages focused on Shimomura's most famous and appreciated songs. Although it is also possible to choose the order in which to tackle some stages, for better or worse you will have to play them all and in many cases it will be necessary to repeat them several times to achieve certain objectives, also called missions: complete a stage on a certain difficulty, reach the end without missing a note, defeat a certain number of flying or ground enemies, and so on. The completed missions translate into stars, necessary to open the doors that lead to the following stages, for a total of over three hundred missions to be completed to reach the end of the story. Fortunately, the missions not only unlock World Tour progression, but also various collectibles that the game collects in the Museum: illustrations, cards depicting characters and enemies, melodies, cinematics and so on. Lots of music but little GDR By completing stages in the World Tour, you expand the repertoire of the Song Collection mode, where you can replay each stage at the desired difficulty level, also choosing different modifiers to make the experience easier or more difficult. In short, the single player component, between the variety of songs and collectibles to unlock, is quite large and satisfying; in addition, Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory also offers a cooperative mode, locally via split screen, and a competitive mode, to be played online against another player - and the options also allow you to tweak the latency to customize the online experience - or simply against the CPU. If the game modes are not lacking, and the title guarantees a more than discreet longevity even only in single, it must be said that we were still very disappointed by the step backwards that the developer has made on the RPG front, almost completely abandoning the strategic component that made Theathrythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call something dmore than just a rhythm game. In Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory the RPG component is essentially limited to two aspects of the gameplay. The first is the accumulation of experience points: the teams level up and in doing so they earn the VP needed to take more hits when the notes in the stages are wrong. Basically, the more VP a team has, the more mistakes the player can make before going into game over. The teams are four, predefined, and it is not possible to customize them, not to mention that basically nothing changes if you choose one team over another. Occasionally one of the three team members is replaced in certain stages by a Disney guest, for example Aladdin or Peter Pan, but even this does not affect the gameplay at all. It's a real shame, because growing up the characters individually, learning new skills and forming ever more ingenious and powerful teams was one of the best aspects of Theatrhythm that is completely lost here. The other RPG mechanic that Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory ventures into is a kind of craft called Processing. By completing stages and missions, materials are obtained with which it is possible to manufacture consumables - for example the useful Potions that automatically restore HP when they fall below a certain threshold - and collectibles, including cards, illustrations and additional stages. They are extremely bland RPG mechanics, as you can well understand, but it is also true that it is not written anywhere that a rhythm game signed indieszero must necessarily also be a role-playing game: it is just that, deprived of all that management part that so much we have appreciated in previous games by the same developer, this experience results in a monotonous succession of stages for their own sake, designed without any commitment or inventiveness. Playstation 4 trophies There are 45 trophies in total: platinum is unlocked after obtaining three gold, eleven silver and thirty bronze. It won't be particularly difficult, but you will have to work hard to complete the game, pass each stage and defeat tons of enemies, among other things. Music gameplay There's nothing wrong with being just a rhythm game, mind you. Persona 4: Dancing All Night from Atlus also lacked true RPG elements, but compensated for by a much more engaging story mode, presented in the form of a visual novel. Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory doesn't even do that and, unfortunately, leans on an unconvincing level design. Stages or musical scenarios are essentially divided into three categories: Musical Battles, Boss Battles and Musical Leaps Down Memory. The former represent the vast majority of the gameplay and see our team, shot from behind, running towards enemies along a path. The boss battles are the stages that we appreciated for their spectacularity, in which the team faces the bad guy on duty and also has to deal with a series of additional mechanics. The last category sees us fly over a cinematic as we press the keys to the rhythm of the music. They are more or less the same categories into which the internships were divided in the previous indieszero titles, but the quantitative ratio is completely unbalanced in favor of the musical Battles. The gameplay is essentially that of the usual rhythm games, but some design choices make it much more frustrating than fun. You have to press the right buttons at the right time, as always, but the mapping of the commands is not particularly comfortable: you start by pressing any key between X, R1 and L1, then pressing two or three together depending on the number of targets to attack simultaneously . So far, everything is ok: even the scrolling notes for which you need to hold down a key or those that impose the inclination of the analog sticks are more than acceptable mechanics. Then, however, indieszero has well thought of introducing the triangle button for the team leader's special attacks, and also the circle button to make the team leader jump when there is an attack to dodge or to hit a flying enemy, perhaps while also having to press the shoulder keys to strike other notes at the same time. The result is a gameplay that becomes too convoluted and cumbersome already at the intermediate difficulty level, sacrificing the immediacy and intuitiveness that should distinguish the genre. The three-dimensional perspective is also problematic, the shot from behind which spoils the perception of the distance that separates the team from the incoming enemies. The Theatrhythm's horizontally scrolling stages exploited the two dimensions as an additional visual cue that helped players become familiar with the rhythms of the music. In Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory the graphics 3D is, basically, a hindrance. It misleads the player, confuses him with the complicity of the shots - especially when the path curves in the musical Battles - and distracts him with the animated polygonal models that sometimes even cover the indicators or with the background scenarios, bare and not very detailed but continuously movement. Not to mention that the indieszero title doesn't show off who knows what visual power, recycling most of the polygonal models seen in previous games, as well as the old medium / low resolution kinematics, perhaps to seek a nostalgic effect which, however, seems only a listless job .", "date": "2020-11-13", "grade": "6.5"}
