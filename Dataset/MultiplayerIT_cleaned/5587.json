A fundamentally sensible concept given that in fact, whether due to a certain satisfaction of the authors, due to the absence of inspiration after the triumph or due to the excessive self-quotation of some key elements of the predecessor, what has been said occurs with inexplicable frequency. Yet, fortunately, there are exceptions to confirm the validity of the theory, and Dark Souls III is one of them in this sense. Developed by two separate teams at From Software, the game arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC a year after Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin and the excellent Bloodborne, with the apparent goal of concluding the series , which pays homage in a sense with many quotes and technical ideas together with his spiritual father, Demon's Souls. Here's our rundown after playing it for days on PlayStation 4 first with patch 1.01, and then with 1.03 applied. Dark Souls III closes the trilogy worthily with a fascinating, difficult and engaging title Chronicles of Lothric We have already dealt with the story, character classes and all the main aspects of Dark Souls III a few days ago in our review for the PC version, which we invite you to read. In this article we will therefore focus our attention mainly on what are the peculiar aspects of the console edition, specifically the PlayStation 4 edition, limiting ourselves to an exhaustive synthesis of everything else. Dark Souls III opens with a slow sequence which broadly serves to introduce the player into a decadent world where the main protagonist, risen from the ashes and defined as a ~dormant flame~, must restore the five Lords of the Embers to the throne by finding them inside of different settings populated by enemies and bosses that are always particularly aggressive. The rest of the story then unfolds, piece by piece, under the eyes of the gamer progressing in the adventure, provided that he is willing to devote a lot of time to deep exploration of the scenarios, to read and put together the descriptions like a puzzle reported on objects and weapons, listening to other characters, and so on. In terms of gameplay Dark Souls III is obviously a soulslike like its predecessors, that is to say a third-person role-playing and action game characterized by a high level of difficulty, as well as by a layered and complex gameplay where nothing is left to chance. chance, but everything is in the hands of the player and his ability to learn. As per tradition for the series and for those who inspired it, in fact, you have to spend a lot of time studying each enemy, even the most innocuous one, and to analyse, test and evaluate all the resources available in order to then be able to exploit them up to after all, since each of them can be extremely useful. Conversely, haste or approximation is the ~best~ way to push yourself towards frequent deaths. From this point of view, the concept behind the game is very simple: the hasty user, the inattentive one and eager to win to go straight ahead without first stealing every little secret or aspect of an area or its ~inhabitants~, and therefore predisposed to get distracted or to cyclically repeat certain errors, he must be punished with death. It's not sadism, but the will to push the player to operate in a certain way, inviting him to reason and not be afraid to try again and again until he gets to the bottom of the ~problem~. Playstation 4 trophies Dark Souls III offers 43 Trophies divided into 26 Bronze, 13 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. These can be unlocked in different ways depending on the type, thus obtaining the various endings available, eliminating certain bosses such as Yhorm the Giant, collecting all the pyromancies, miracles, rings and other similar elements, discovering the various Pacts and so Street. Die, learn, try again Dark Souls III therefore rewards those who have patience, those who, as mentioned before, ~study~ the paths, statistics, upgrades, behavioral routines of enemies, whose artificial intelligence, for better or for worse, is designed precisely to be functional to the type of gameplay. As in many titles of the past where, with the appropriate distinctions, it was necessary to learn the movements of the opponents in order to be able to eliminate them and progress towards the next area. Moving with circumspection, defending yourself and attacking with the right timing, are fundamental elements for surviving and collecting the precious souls as a prize, essential for buying or repairing weapons, for obtaining new items, spells and more.It is therefore clear that Dark Souls III remains a demanding game, one of those that do not allow breaks, and where the risk of dying is always around the corner, even if the attention to strategy, and the will to maintain a strong link with series, however, have not prevented From Software from making some changes to the gameplay. Starting with the fights, made a little more dynamic and fluid thanks also to a better and more ~natural~ response to the commands of the protagonist than in the previous chapters. In fact, if we exclude a couple of sporadic slowdowns of a technical nature in as many circumstances, the slowness of movement of the character is now more than ever influenced only by his size, the type of equipment and the dress he wears. Then the mapping of the commands on the DualShock 4 is good, with the touch pad used for opening and managing the Menus: pressing the left side with respect to the viewer, you access the gestures one, pressing on the right the main one for weapons, objects and equipment. Then there are the buttons, which are used to perform all the actions, such as the Circle to step back or the X to interact with the environment and the secondary characters, and the R1 and R2 backbones to perform normal attacks or more ~ mighty~, L2 and L1 to sweep or keep guard if you have a shield equipped, and so on. And again, the directional cross is used to quickly select spells, weapons for the right or left hand and certain objects, the analog levers that move the character or camera and, in the case of L3, hook or unhook the targeted enemy. For the rest, another small but significant difference in gameplay compared to Dark Souls II is the introduction of a blue bar positioned under the vitality bar which is used to cast spells and activate some special moves with white weapons. In practice, every time a spell or a so-called Combat Art is performed, i.e. a special attack also correlated to the type of weapon used, a certain amount of AP is consumed on the appropriate indicator, which varies according to the type of magic or weapon. Once the bar is completely finished, you can no longer use any technique until the next refill, which takes place using the Estus Cinereo flasks, a special version of the classic Estus, which are used instead for life points. The dark charm of the otherworld It's difficult to imagine a technical sector worthy of such a well-finished structure, but Dark Souls III manages to be so even from this point of view, despite some small defects and, compared to the PC counterpart, the absence of some filters and a lower frame rate (on a computer it is 60 frames per second although not always constant). On PlayStation 4 Dark Souls III still holds up quite well, running at 1080p and rendering at a native 1920x1080, with good full-screen motion blur and a frame rate almost always locked at 30 frames per second even during fights. We wrote ~almost~ because in reality we must report some sporadic but slight micro-shots in some structurally more complex and crowded areas, such as Fort Farron, and in a couple of fights with the bigger bosses, especially when they make some sudden movements. However, patch 1.03 has significantly reduced the phenomenon, and the above does not negatively affect the overall fluidity or gaming experience. Furthermore, these defects disappear in the face of the atmosphere and involvement that From Software's game is able to give back to the player, who is immediately dragged literally into a dark and varied fantasy scenario, beautifully represented in digital form. The world of Dark Souls III from an artistic point of view is fascinating, albeit terrible, and the graphics engine, the same used in Bloodborne, manages to give shape and life to the fantasies of the From Software graphics and screenwriters, recreating almost perfectly a universe with the most diverse facets, capable of changing without any problem from ice to fire, from water to earth. The intrinsic quality of the settings is truly fascinating, and in the transitory lands of the Lords of the Tizzoni there are some particularly evocative ones, capable of literally leaving the gamer speechless not so much for the presence of ultra-complex textures (there are some decidedly flat up close!), but rather for modeling, style, and the ability to give a sense of magic and amazement. The same care has been placed on the models of the human characters and creatures, which while not making one cry for a miracle, are made with good technical skill and a spot-on design, inspired as always by fantasy orwestern, of which Miyazaki is a fan, sometimes reworked with that typically Japanese taste for the fantastic. Finally, the environmental effects are also noteworthy, such as the refraction of light on water or on armor, the evocative twilight rays previously seen in Bloodborne, and the management of light sources and related shadows. The latter appear well defined and ~soft~, i.e. without any jagged edges, with the right light attenuation near occluded structures and objects thanks also to the good use of the ambient occlusion system, which allows you to calculate the shadows on the elements based on their shape to thus return different intensities and gradations in real time. When compared to Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, which was still a simple conversion from PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, the end result is definitely impressive. To close the technical aspect is obviously the audio, which offers a good dubbing in English accompanied by subtitles in Italian, and music of great variety and atmosphere that increase the user's emotional involvement thanks to a series of tracks that adequately accompany the various stages of the adventure, exalting himself in a particular way during the most dramatic situations and fights.", "date": "2016-04-10", "grade": "9.0"}
