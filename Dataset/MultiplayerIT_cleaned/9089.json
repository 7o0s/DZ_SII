So let's go and see what the winning features of the title are. Cut the limbo Openly inspired by the Little Prince (although it's not clear what exactly), Contre Jour is a product that immediately showcases a series of elements capable of distinguishing it from the mass of puzzle games available for Apple devices. It begins with a graphic style that seems to be indebted to that design masterpiece that is Limbo, albeit free from the negativity that characterized the Playdead work: the game scenario is therefore entirely in black and white - with only a few sporadic concessions to blue and 'blue- composed of silhouettes with the most disparate shapes and suffused backdrops that are lost in a greyish fog. The exceptional soundtrack by David Ari Leon contributes to the creation of a unique atmosphere thanks to the evocative piano notes, while some vaguely cartoonish sound effects ensure that Contre Jour remains perpetually poised between melancholy and carefree, a decidedly original mix and well done. However, to think that the Mokus title is one of those games all form and no substance would be a huge mistake, and even the 60 levels that make up the playful offer would be enough to refute this thesis. However, quantity marries quality, given that the gameplay proves to be solid and convincing, suitable for casual use but which does not disdain some sop for the most refined palates. The main purpose of the game is in fact to lead the funny protagonist (a sort of rubbery ball with a huge eye in the center) to the finish line of each stage, represented by a blue portal: to do this, it is necessary to modify the terrain by creating ramps or gradients to make the character move, and act on a whole series of elements such as ropes, elastic bands, fans and so on. In short, Contre Jour does not invent anything new, borrowing elements from games such as Cut the Rope, Angry Birds and company, but has the merit of being able to mix everything wisely, offering the user a dish with a perhaps not innovative flavor but certainly appetizing. In full respect of the path traced by the titles that inspire it, the Mokus product also manages to guarantee the right balance between immediacy and depth: the control system is precise and hyper-intuitive, the basics of the gameplay are very accessible and for less expert users they're even allowed to skip through those levels they can't figure out. Conversely, for puzzle fans there is always the challenge of collecting all the orbs present in the stages, an undertaking that already becomes demanding towards the middle of the first of the three available worlds. In short, considering the audiovisual values, the successful play structure, the attractive price and the prospect of substantial future updates, Contre Jour is certainly one of the most valid puzzles available on the App Store.
