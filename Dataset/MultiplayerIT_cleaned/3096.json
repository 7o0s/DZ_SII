{"name": "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/oddworld-munchs-oddysee-recensione-versione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "The Oddworld series has somehow marked many days of the owners of the first glorious PlayStation. Also present in various forms on the famous Demo disc when the console was purchased, the puzzle game platformer of the Oddworld Inhabitants boys set school, albeit being forgotten over time by the general public. The history of the franchise, which should soon delight us with a new chapter along the lines of the first horizontal scrolling originals, it has touched various genres over the years, with the proverbial ups and downs. Almost twenty years ago the third chapter of the saga arrived on the market, first exclusively for Xbox and then gradually available everywhere, which for the first time also embraced the third dimension. Today Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee also debuts on Nintendo Switch, a few months after the porting of the other atypical chapter of the series: Stanger's Wrath. Not just Abe Anyone who has played the first two chapters knows how many vicissitudes our flatulent Abe had to face to escape from slavery and save many of his fellow men. Full of charisma and with a marked leadership, the adventure of the meditating alien reaches a turning point with the third chapter. Now outside the structure and flanked by his companion Munch, the two find themselves again grappling with puzzles, enemies willing killing them and lots and lots of subtle humour. Although Abe and Munch join forces, the two speak profoundly different languages, as well as different only their means, an element that allows the game to achieve a fair variety as regards the situations. During the campaign, which lasts about ten hours, you will have the opportunity to experience many of the grotesque and funny situations dear to the series, but never managing to touch the peaks of the first two unforgettable chapters. What is less amalgamated is not so much the narration, but the inability to feel the right empathy towards one's clients, this due to a drastically reduced level of difficulty. The desire to bring the series closer to a wider audience and perhaps the fear of not being able to find the right compromise between the classic gameplay and the totally 3D one, has led to a difficult balance. Half successful gameplay Already at the time of its release Munch's Oddysee had not been able to collect the great success of its predecessors. Certainly the exclusive release on a console at the dawn of its journey did not help the title, but there is no doubt that the transition to 3D has cracked something inside a perfect machine. In addition to the problem already addressed of the degree of challenge strongly decreased, it is precisely the level design and the paucity of the environments to strike in the negative. From this point of view, porting to Nintendo Switch does not help, making the experience usable, fluid and pleasant, but not modernizing anything of the already old mechanics of the time. On the other hand, we are talking about a work that has drastically experienced the transition to third dimension and that, like most of its relatives of the time, collided with a still immature technology. The platforming phases and the liberation of one's companions are not sufficient to hide a series of design ugliness under the doormat that make Munch's Oddysee the least successful chapter of the saga, as well as the most repetitive. In its favor it is certainly possible to cite an even more refined ~gamespeak~ system, which represented a revolution at the time of the progenitor and which is still the basis of a large part of the communication mechanics with one's companions managed by artificial intelligence. Basically it is a command scheme that can be used to give orders or to communicate, thus making the recruitment and rescue work more immersive, but also giving the player a far from ridiculous management of the routines, if you think that we are talking about twenty years ago. Even this mechanic, albeit successful, collapses inexorably in the face of ridiculously simple puzzles compared to the past, which only transform the campaign into a friendly outing, rather than a two-dimensional nightmare. To close a circle that is not exactly exciting and dedicated really only for the great fans, a technical adaptation without infamy and without praise thinks about it, which gives nothing more to the original title and which also gains little from the features of the Nintendo flagship. We would have liked to see some more effort, trying to slightly rejuvenate a stale and very unappetizing formula for 2020. There is no doubt that, in all proportions, the advice to those who are orphaned by Abe and his companions is to play the remake of the firstNew 'n' Tasty, thus recalling why this series is so important for a certain niche of enthusiasts.", "date": "2020-05-15", "grade": "S.V."}
