Let's start immediately by analyzing the technical component of Formula1 2006. Graphically, the work done is more than good, even if in some respects more could have been done to impress our eyes, especially as regards the cars and their detail, and the clipping problems sporadic and management of light effects. It will be that compared to the past year the graphics engine has to manage 22 vehicles and no longer 20, and it will be that the PS2 hardware is rather dated, but the graphic impact is not the same as with a game like Gran Turismo 4. On the other hand, we cannot complain about the always excellent fluidity in all game conditions, the graphic quality of the circuits reproduced very well in every detail, the sufficiently realistic weather effects, and the sensation of speed (also due to the blur effect and vibration of the cockpit) in the views inside the single-seaters. The sound of an F1 game is essentially divided into three fundamental parts: the roar of the engines and the crash of the clashes, the commentary, and the background music of the various menus (since there is no soundtrack in-game). The navigation soundtrack is anonymous and monotonous, it serves just to accompany the equally ~monotonous journeys~ among the menus, but the banality and lack of inspiration of these musical pieces instead of pleasantly accompanying, sometimes tends to be annoying. The commentary is entrusted to Andrea DeAdamich and Claudia Peroni, and is all in all very accurate and effective in recreating television realism; there is also the voice of the pit technician, improved compared to Formula 1 2005, which offers us (un)useful information during the race. Instead, what is really important for us players and lovers of Formula 1 is the roar of the single-seater engines ... remember that the main technical innovation of this world championship is the return to the historic v8 engine, which obviously has a very different sound from that of the v10. In F1 2006 this sound is well reproduced and distinguishable from that of the previous year, but to be picky to the end it is not 100% realistic, it has something ~fake~ to it...but enough to make us feel at ease. inside an F1 car! The sound effects of the collisions are also good, which complement the sound picture of the Sony game with dignity. The arduous profession of the pilot The first thing to do is create an identity for the game profile, you will then have to select the name, nationality, the face (we spread a pitiful veil on the graphic quality, which is very reminiscent of Morrowind) and the helmet ... at this point we are ready starting! Those who are in a hurry will immediately want to start racing, but it is good to first take a look at the Options item in the menu, where, in addition to the various video, audio and control settings, it is possible to choose the aids you prefer for driving assisted. There is the possibility of having assisted steering and braking, stability control, anti-lock brakes, and above all a virtual trajectory that allows those unfamiliar with the tracks to know when to brake and how to move in short, they are the usual aids for beginners, which of course will be deactivated by more experienced players. Once the driving aids have been chosen, we will be ready to start the race, and there are a total of five single-player game modes to choose from that will satisfy all kinds of our desires: the Quick Race and the Timed Trial are for those who they don't like to waste time and immediately want to enjoy the wheel of the single-seater, then there are the Weekend Grand Prix and World Championship modes, which allow you to take part in a single grand prix, or in an entire world championship, in the role of our favorite driver, without however having to give up the free practice and qualifying sessions, and finally there is the highlight of F1 2006, or the Career mode. The latter mode, also present in the 2005 version, does nothing but make us take on the role of a rookie driver who has to make a career in the world of Formula 1. First of all, we will have to wait for one of the teams to be looking for a driver, after which we can contact him to ask to do an audition (which is usually a time trial in a random circuit) so that, if we pass it, the team can be interested in us and offer us a contract. Obviously at the beginning you shouldn't expect to be hired by the Ferrari team, but you will be satisfied with the scarce ones such as Aguri or Toro Rosso... it will therefore be in our interest to win as much as possible so that the following years also the teams most important can offer us the much-loved contract. To make everything even more realistic, there will be the official newsletter in which you can read newspaper-style articles on all the most important events, and the addresse-mail address with which the manager will keep us informed on the progress of our life as a pilot. Single player modes aren't the only way to have fun in F1 2006, and there certainly couldn't be no split screen mode to challenge, and possibly humiliate, our friend on duty. A weekend as a pilot And here we are finally ready to experience the most exciting part of the game, the real Grand Prix! The weekend is divided into two free practices on Friday, one on Saturday, qualifying, warmup and finally the race; however, it is possible to skip the one we don't want to support, and if you want, go straight to the competition. The free trials have the purpose of memorizing the track and testing the car's settings, it is in fact possible to change various car parameters (including fuel, tyres, suspension and camber) in order to adapt it as much as possible to our driving style . For tuning lovers, the possibility of modifying your car is the main fun of a driving game, fun that turns into satisfaction when, thanks to our interventions, we manage to gain a few seconds in our fast lap and F1 2006 does not disappoint under this, given that every small change will have a significant impact on the behavior of the single-seater. However, there is the possibility of leaving this tough task to the technicians of our team, who, through a practice session (Auto Evolution) based on a series of lap tests, will choose for us the most suitable settings for our driving and the circuit. Once the tuning is over, the difficulties aren't over yet, and the most exciting phase of the whole weekend awaits us, namely the qualifying session. Qualifying is divided into three sub-phases, in the first the positioning on the grid from car 17 to 22 is decided on the basis of the times, in the second phase the cars from 11th to 16th are established, in the last phase the decisive line-up is established last 10 cars. Now all we have to do is wait for Sunday for the start of the Grand Prix... the cars are ready for the warm up lap which allows the tires to be brought to the right temperature... after which the GP begins! On the starting grid! The playability of F1 2006 has been significantly improved compared to the previous version, both in terms of the physics of movements and crashes, as well as in terms of realism and difficulty. The first thing you notice is the greater fluidity in the movements of the car, as well as the more realistic rendering when cornering, where it is easy to go off the track if you don't steer and brake wisely on the curbs. Even colliding with other cars has become much more dangerous, as it takes very little to cause damage to a wheel or wing, so try to stay as far away from other cars as possible, and also try to avoid shortcuts and wrong behaviors. because the referees are ready to wave penalty flags very easily. However, what makes the game much more competitive than 2005 is the improvement of the artificial intelligence of the drivers governed by the CPU (perhaps that of the Auto Evolution testers could be improved). The step forward in this respect is quite marked, especially at the difficult difficulty level expect very competitive lap times, expect aggressive driving from the rider in front of you and behind you, in short, expect a game that will give you a hard time even to the most experienced. Compared to F1 2005 there have been some changes, and Sony wanted to make this title a little more simulative, but all in all we are talking about an arcade-oriented game (even eliminating all the aids for assisted driving), which is far from a real simulation in which at the slightest exaggerated acceleration you end up spinning. F1 2006 will still manage to keep you glued to the pad for a long time, thanks above all to the virtually infinite career mode, its competitiveness, and the possibility of unlocking new cars. Formula 1 2006 is a good compromise between arcade and simulation, it can be easily played by beginners, but it is also a valid product for lovers of ~simulation~ challenges. The improvements compared to the predecessor are evident, so it's not the usual F1 game in which only the drivers and teams are changed, but it tries to be more competitive and complex than its progenitor. A recommended purchase therefore for Formula 1 lovers. Pros: Excellent level of challenge Exciting career mode Good dose of realism Cons: Technical aspect that can be improved Online, this unknown We are now almost at the end of the 2006 Formula1 World Championship, a world still to be played and full of dthe emotions. There have been several changes compared to last year as regards the racing teams, and first of all we see the addition of a new Japanese team, the Super Aguri F1 founded by the former Aguri Suzuki driver, which has increased the positions to 22 on the starting grid. Then there are other pseudo-new ones, namely Scuderia Toro Rosso, the Italian heir to Minardi, bought by Red Bull (also owner of Red Bull Racing which debuted last year), and then there is Midland F1, which instead it takes its name from a Russian-Canadian company, Midland Corp, which is the heir to Jordan. The BMW company has also decided to found its own team, BMW-Sauber, probably because it is tired of the role of supplier to the Williams team, which instead has decided to enter into an alliance with the British manufacturer Cosworth in short, a small revolution in the world of single-seaters. All this ~movement~ ignited in me (and certainly also in you) the desire to take part in this world championship in a direct way, obviously not by driving in a real car, but through a videogame ... and fortunately Sony has not missed its annual appointment, and is ready to offer us yet another F1 game for Playstation, updated for this year's world championship. The premises are excellent, the game manages to be a good step forward compared to that of 2005, and tends to satisfy both lovers of more difficult challenges and those who prefer to have fun without committing too much but let's see everything calmly", "date": "2006-10-19", "grade": null}
