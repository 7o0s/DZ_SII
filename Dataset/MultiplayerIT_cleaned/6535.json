{"name": "L'acchiappasogni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145925-imps-in-tokyo-lacchiappasogni.html", "text": "Imps in Tokyo has an atmosphere to spare, and this is evident right from the beautiful introductory sequence, which transports us to a dreamy and nocturnal scenario, which varies according to the missions, with a view to a campaign consisting of fifteen different levels. The story behind the game is simple, and sees a group of Dream Catchers gather and organize their own territory defense activities, because it is at night that dark creatures roam and you must eliminate them before they can harm the unsuspecting inhabitants of Tokyo. The graphics, completely hand-drawn, make a fine show of an interesting design (albeit spoiled by an evident lack of animation), both as regards the ~heroes~ and the opponents they will have to face, following the mechanisms of a gameplay initially a little too dry and anonymous, but which acquires depth in the central part of the story mode and experiences particular situations continuing towards the end, with sections in an endless style or even with a shooter vocation. Often you need to achieve a particular goal to pass the levels, whether it's collecting a certain number of orbs of light or eliminating a certain number of enemies. To do this, we will have to select one of the available Imps at the start and move it across the screen to get in touch with the elements that interest us, being careful to avoid any traps so as not to lose the three little hearts that make up our vital energy. Imps in Tokyo is a nice styled title, full of atmosphere, but the controls leave something to be desired Clumsy touch Imps in Tokyo boasts a charming scenery, a nice style and, as mentioned, a great atmosphere; but it also manages to propose a non-trivial challenge, which often requires several attempts to complete the more complex missions. At the same time, however, the title developed by We Are Vigilantes stands as an open construction site: the challenge mode will be added later via an update, and in the same way an update will be required to be able to use an alternative control system to that by default, sadly bad. Instead of a traditional virtual stick or ~indirect~ touch controls, the game in fact asks us to command our sprite by literally dragging him across the screen, with all the limitations that this approach implies, namely the impossibility of seeing exactly what is happening or to dodge possible pitfalls where they arrive quickly. It must also be said that the differences between the various Dream Catchers are negligible, in the end, and that choosing one over another does not produce substantial changes in the approach to matches, giving rise to a sense of repetitiveness which is then difficult to remove, and which affects the enjoyment of the experience. It's a pity, because with a more interesting initial phase and a better control system, the potential of Imps in Tokyo could have been best expressed, also thanks to a quality musical accompaniment. Let's hope that the already announced updates arrive quickly, therefore.", "date": "2015-02-27", "grade": "6.0"}
