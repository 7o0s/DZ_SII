{"name": "Days Gone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/days-gone-recensione.html", "text": "Let's start the awaited review of Days Gone by immediately writing that, from a certain point of view, the PS4 exclusive is a solid game, one of those typical level products that you would expect from a Sony development team; in this specific case, the downside is an adventure that seems to have been born more to respond to an industry study than from the will of the development team. An unpleasant situation but also, let's face it, not very truthful: Bend Studios, which are the same as the fundamental Siphon Filter, have really done everything to deliver us the best game possible. However, Days Gone is afflicted by various problems: some generated by clumsy planning, others by a certain superficiality in the design phase, and still others by what we could technically define as bad luck, bad luck, bad luck. Let's start. For the masses: an open world for everyone Is it really possible to advise against Days Gone without ifs and buts? Of course not, and in our opinion the public will also end up liking him; perhaps not immediately and without ever going beyond a certain threshold of excitement, but still enough to guarantee him an important and well-deserved second chance. One of the undeniable strengths of this game, which also anticipates its limits for those looking for a more structured experience, is that it can be perfectly described in three words, where ~sun, heart, love~ (remember the very popular meme song?) are replaced by a no less obvious pop trinity: ~zombie, motorcycle, open world~. Days Gone is clearly a chart-topping toy, and it will pay off. After all, you have the wildest Oregon at your feet, a motorbike to customize, and hours and hours (between main and secondary missions there is enough to go well over fifty) of missions populated by very few friends and many enemies. The rather marked violence, combined with unexpectedly good graphics, are then other aces up the sleeve of a game that, just as anticipated at the beginning, simply works. Another arrow in Days Gone's quiver is its very strong dramatic component: the protagonist loses a loved one at the very beginning of the adventure, and during the entire game there are very few flashes of levity. Adding to the mix also Deacon St.John, the protagonist played by the actor Sam Witwer (Doomsday in Smallville, remember?) who digitized here appears as a sort of simulacrum to the more brazenly sexy James Franco and perhaps, and we repeat perhaps, you will have the picture complete with what a war machine this new Sony exclusive is. In Days Gone there is also that survival component that gives you nothing without ever being tedious, in which however the only constant concern is the risk of running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere; and it's actually fun to stop in a quiet place, sheltered from the pouring rain, to tighten a few bolts and check the tank before setting off again towards the next objective, perhaps with the sky clearing on the horizon. Finally here are the zombies, Furious, infected, or whatever you want to call them, running, wriggling, even devouring each other. At night these creatures multiply in numbers and in fury, while during the day they will become less oppressive, while the largest groups may hole up in their nauseating nests to rest away from the light. The problem is that often, especially in the first part of the game, there never seem to be enough Furiosi, and consequently it's rather difficult to enjoy doing suicide gymkhanas with a shotgun on your shoulder while whistling cheerful tunes. But we are equally sure that a certain type of audience will have a lot of fun with Days Gone: now, however, it is necessary to understand if those who read this review are also part of the same lucky group. In fact, every aspect of the game described up to now carries with it a reiterated and therefore perhaps desired lack of depth, which will manifest itself more or less seriously depending on your experience with video games and, more specifically, with the type of product to which Days Gone clearly belongs. Midnight rider: many things to do, a bit generic If you are looking for a narrative as strong as it is dark you will be satisfied, but in telling its stories Days Gone has serious pacing problems. Also, facial animations aren't always of the quality we've learned to take for granted playing all the other Made in Sony products, from The Order: 1886 to Horizon Zero Dawn, up to the Naughty Dog games, and therefore not always at all. height of the task and emotions called upon to replicate on screen. Even worse, for three quarters of the game the plot will seem to go in circles rather than moving forward, however it must be said that this will allow the user to learnto know the Oregon rules of Days Gone with effective calm. Those who, on the other hand, already know how to behave in the face of an unpleasant situation like the one recreated in Days Gone, will have to deal with a long list of missions without particular creative flashes, alternated by a handful of activities which, as in a generic open world, will be repeated in each portion of the map. Deacon St. John will have to deal with Furiosi nests to burn, rejecting the infected who will oppose the destruction of their lair, and medical containers of the mysterious Nero government agency, which can be accessed by reactivating their energy through a generator that is always dry of fuel ; in both cases, once the task is completed, the surrounding area will become relatively safe again, while the Nero containers will also provide an upgrade that will improve a value of your choice between energy, stamina and focus. Hidden on the map, it is also possible to find other surprises, such as the outposts of the Rippers, in Italian called Repugnant: a group of heavily armed and totally insane humans who venerate the Furiosi and the pandemic that generated them. Once the enemies are out of the way, in the outposts managed by this crazy clan there is always a hidden entrance to a bunker where you can find resources and usually also a project to build yourself, therefore without necessarily finding it in the field, a new gadget. Days Gone's crafting is certainly well done, and allows you to create anything in a few simple steps, without imposing pauses on the game but limiting yourself to slowing down the passage of time. Even if this description could make you think of the worst open worlds of the beginning of the generation, the particular subdivision of the missions, which here are collected on the basis of their plot instead of by the type of activity related to it, help Days Gone to move away from the ~to -do-list~ which usually completely drains that indispensable unpredictability necessary to make an open world believable. The trouble is that here the various activities are not so different, especially those related to the missions that we can define as the main ones, almost always divided into clashes with the infected, collection of certain lost objects, and stealth phases to spy on the incursions of the Nero scientists who, not even too secretly, will land from time to time with their helicopters to study the area and prepare some new enigmatic experiment. What doesn't work is that except in certain areas, and not before certain missions, the presence of the Furiosi is far too mild and the shooting never the best; while the rules and artificial intelligence that should make the stealth game's silent incursion shine clearly are not up to the action imagined by a user with more experience on his shoulders. However, it must be said that we did not mind this non-alcoholic stealth, even if in mid-2019 it is really tough to go back to jumping between one bush and another just like in Days Gone. Freewheel burning: relationships and defections To make the game experience more structured, the different outposts distributed in Days Gone take care of it with which it will be possible to slowly make friends, which will allow, among other things, to gain access to the different areas of specialization that characterize these clans . In fact, some outposts allow you to unlock new weapons, while others specialize in new motorcycle parts with which to improve the racing car at your disposal. Even the way of living in this hell is different from camp to camp, as will the treatment reserved for the survivors who, once saved, you can send them in exchange for respect points and, once a certain threshold is exceeded, for that new equipment that so much it makes you hungry. To increase the trust of a field towards Deacon, while earning useful money in the meantime, it is possible to exchange infected ears with them (the value of which changes according to the strength of the former owner) and food to be obtained by hunting the remaining animals and picking herbs and fruits in the woods. But rather than pushing you to a furious collection of resources, the usual boring grind, in short, these elements serve to round off the much more substantial prizes that can be collected by completing the missions that will gradually be offered to you. We do not doubt that, often, hunting for objects in a dangerous and decadent world can also be a lot of fun, but Days Gone's Oregon does not seem designed for this, nor for continued and in-depth exploration. In our gaming experience, on normal difficulty, we rarely found ourselves short of materials to build what we needed, and those few times that happened a short detour was enough tompirci pockets again in no time at all. We must also admit that, after the first few hours of the game, we definitively put aside the exploration for its own sake to focus almost entirely on the missions, and not to close this review as soon as possible but because basically there is nothing particularly interesting to find: not a rare weapon, not a single piece of motorcycle, much less a level environmental narrative, but only a few documents that will enrich an anonymous list of collectibles. Bat out of hell': Beware of the horde Another feature that stands out of Days Gone is its unexpected longevity of over 40 hours: there are many missions, but there are also many downtimes, or journeys that will culminate with two lines of dialogue and a laconic goodbye. But the thing that surprised us most of all, and negatively, is that most of these stories do not revolve around the creatures generated by this new apocalypse: the Furious too often play an almost marginal role. If the most characterizing element of Days Gone is not the motorcycle, if it is not exploration and survival, at least the much-vaunted hordes should be. But no, these huge groups of infected will not appear (at least in their scariest version) until very late, even leading to doubts about their presence. Proceeding in the game, moving towards the edges of the map, however, it is discovered that their number is decidedly high, and that the most hidden ones are also the most lethal, that is, composed of a greater number of infected who can even reach 500 units. Seeing this mass of creatures, dawdling at first and snapping and furious a moment later, run en masse towards us is scary and gives the Bend Studios game that character it seems almost completely devoid of at first glance. But even in this case there is more than one problem: the hordes appear only a few times during the plot, and in the end they will turn out to be more of a side activity to be tackled before and after the credits, rather than a constant element of gameplay. Fortunately, facing a horde with a well-equipped character is a rather fun exercise, which pushes players to exploit every millimeter of the scenario, to use up all their equipment to finally have the upper hand. These groups of infected then have their own daily routine: around sunset it's easier to find them near bodies of water, while the morning is an excellent time to take them by surprise while they rest and feed in their deep lairs. The latter is the situation that most amused us since it allows us to set up a series of traps on which to push the group, decimating it little by little. It is also important to decide on an ideal route towards which to be chased, in order to exploit any explosives scattered along the way. It is a pity that the developers have not managed to give the hordes a more concrete role, and the impossibility of brutally prevaricating a horde is also a pity, perhaps by falciding the infected with the motorbike or with weapons of mass extermination. Days Gone is certainly not Dead Rising, but since it is possible to find elements of many different games inside it, even something from Capcom would not have hurt, on the contrary. Born to be... In Days Gone, the combat itself doesn't present any major problems, although it does suffer from a slight but constant lack of precision. To improve things, there is a concentration mode that allows the user to slow down time and consequently aim and shoot more calmly and effectively. This feature isn't particularly useful against humans, but will become essential in thinning out larger groups of Furiosi. Days Gone offers a good number of weapons, some even with bullets capable of passing through one or more bodies, a possibility that can give rise to rather amusing moments. While it's possible to tempt fate by moving without ammo, we strongly advise against proceeding without a melee weapon. The latter are also present in large quantities, and can also be modified to increase their characteristics: for example, it will be possible to mount a circular saw on a wooden bar, three industrial bolts on a baseball bat that will allow it to split heads with great ease . But against the Furiosi, once you are discovered, the most valid strategy will always remain and only one: divide them, and then kill them individually. As you progress in the game, new types of infected will require greater attention in the approach, consequently making a stealth start more and more important, in order for example to immediately put out of action the most dangerous specimens such as sirens, capable", "date": "2019-04-25", "grade": "7.8"}
