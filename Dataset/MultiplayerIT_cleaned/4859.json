Bringing the precision and immediacy required by this trend to a touch screen was obviously not easy, but Guns of Boom, the latest Game Insight title, demonstrates that in reality it was absolutely feasible. The game, completely devoted to the competitive component with four-versus-four online multiplayer battles, in fact adopts a very immediate but at the same time complete and well-organized layout: on the left and right side of the screen there are two invisible and repositionable virtual analog sticks for movement and aim control, the fire is activated automatically as soon as we have an enemy in the reticle and the 3D Touch is even used to use the iron sight without having to press a different button. The only extra icons to keep in mind during the games, beyond the weapon change, are in fact the one relating to the grenades that of the medical kit, both equipped with a short cooldown and of great importance for the success of a match. The bombs allow you to eliminate opponents ~blindly~ or flush them out from a stakeout, while the energy recharge restores a good part of the health, allowing us to continue exploring the scenarios in search of possible targets without a sword of Damocles hanging over our heads. The stroke is also well implemented: to activate it, just make a small slide upwards with the left thumb, in a completely natural way. Fortress Two Squad Having ascertained the goodness of the basic system, Guns of Boom offers an experience stylistically very close to that of the classic Team Fortress 2, with the same type of cartoonish graphics and characters with exaggerated proportions, but also beautifully designed scenarios, well characterized and equipped of a certain degree of variety. In fact, it happens to fight on the roofs of buildings, moving between mirrored windows and minimal objects, or inside a large farm at night, with the screeching of crickets and cicadas in the background to the shootings. The maps are many and all boast a convincing design, with outdoor areas but also stakeouts, raised positions and so on. However, it is above all the quality of the matchmaking and the netcode that amazes: having spent a reasonable amount of time in soft launch, the Game Insight title can count on a very rich and passionate user base, which crowds the servers and allows find matches in a matter of seconds, possibly joining the clans and completing a whole series of achievements for unlocking objects and equipment. The latter can count on something like fifty different weapons, thus giving the experience a solid progression and concrete reasons to continue playing again and again, without incurring any limit imposed by the freemium format: Guns of Boom can be used in a completely free and the pay-to-win dynamics seemed very vague to us, further confirmation of a research and refinement work that should not be underestimated.", "date": "2017-05-24", "grade": "8.8"}
