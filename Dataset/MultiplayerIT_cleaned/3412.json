{"name": "Grim Guardians: Demon Purge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grim-guardians-demon-purge-recensione.html", "text": "In recent years Inti Creates has repeatedly shown that it knows its stuff, in relation to two-dimensional action platforms. Just think, among the possible examples, of the two Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, able to almost perfectly replicate even the dark atmospheres and that unmistakable retro touch of the 8-bit era of the first Castlevanias. Particularly useful comparison here, among other things, since Grim Guardians: Demon Purge - while moving away from the philosophy of pure metroidvania - retains significant points in common with all the titles mentioned. less than even mentioning himself. And it is therefore possible to immediately recognize the faces of the characters on the cover of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, at least for those who know the main productions of Inti Creates at least. In fact, the product in question is also a spin-off of the Gal*Gun: Double Peace series, of which it inherits only the protagonists. The result is thus the spiritual heir in all respects of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2, but with a more light-hearted narrative and a much more original combat system. As will be seen in the Grim Guardians: Demon Purge review, the mix is ~potentially dangerous~ only in appearance, because in fact it conveys an experience that is not excellent, but certainly balanced and enjoyable. Plot: What a beautiful castle The levels of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge are not entirely bare, but not very rich either The girls dominate the plot of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge: it is the weight of the legacy of the Gal * Gun series, with the annexed recovery of several of its characters. Not all are human. Kurona, for example, is a full-fledged little demon; after discovering the existence of a very suspicious magic mirror, he discovers that it is possible to merge the world of human beings with the demonic one. There are no precedents for such an operation, clearly very dangerous: in the past the demons were limited to small localized invasions, always being driven back. The protagonists, Shinobu and Maya Kamizono, thus find themselves catapulted into the realm of evil: fortunately they are also skilled demon hunters, a profession particularly useful in such a situation. Without asking too many questions, the real climb therefore begins - floor after floor - to the castle in which Kurona is perched, after having scattered more or less dangerous guards and subjects everywhere. The protagonists of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge The main adventure, which can be completed in a matter of hours, is to reach the top floor of the castle and defeat Kurona, saving as many students as possible along the way. In reality, however, none of the secondary proposals is really fundamental: above all by opting for the ~casual~ difficulty (which we do not recommend, because it lacks any form of challenge) it will be possible to shoot and slice every enemy on your way without any problem, consequently reducing the minimum offer. It is therefore appropriate to opt for the ~veteran~ style right away. Perhaps initially you will run into some game over, but not even the presence of limited lives will be able to stop me, once the potential of the gameplay is discovered (as well as the presence of many more lives and health upgrades after the first bosses). Gameplay: Swap that passes you Two protagonists, two different playstyles (and there's local co-op) The most original and interesting element of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge obviously does not consist in the spiritual heritage compared to Castelvania and Bloodstained, but in the basic mechanics linked to the protagonists. Every aspect of the level design and progression does nothing but advise against the prolonged and exclusive use of only one between Shinobu and Maya: to advance, however, it is necessary to exchange them continuously, using the right trigger (ZR on Nintendo Switch).Each of the two has special weapons and a unique fighting style. Shinobu uses an anti-demon submachine gun, which she can then use from a distance, as well as while jumping; Maya specializes in dueling with white weapons, since that gigantic scythe isn't just for style. The secondary weapons also vary (initially one for the protagonist, then expanded): Shinobu can attack diagonally, even in very high points, thanks to the throwing knives; Maya instead summons three defensive sprites for a short period of time, useful both for parrying enemy blows and for inflicting damage on them. Each play area does everything to encourage the constant, sudden exchange between Shinobu and Maya: only the second of the two can crouch down to enter certain crevices; only the former can hit a so gdistance an enemy or container on a distant platform; and then, in general, some monsters take more damage from one or the other sister. But death is always around the corner, also because the two have a personal health bar (Maya's is reduced). If one sister falls in battle, the game resumes with the other from the last activated checkpoint: it will be possible to run up to the point of the restart and try to revive the partner. Obviously it is easier said than done, given that all the enemies present will converge on your position, and with the death of the two sisters one of the available lives is inevitably lost. Progression and limits Among the bosses of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge we also find a nice bat The progression of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is satisfying and fun, but not without its flaws. At least until the boss of the second level, for example, it is undeniable that one advances by trial and error: it is not always clear which weapon inflicts more damage on a specific enemy, or how to wisely alternate the two to advance from platform to platform. Fortunately (or unfortunately, Castlevania purists will note) getting lost is practically impossible, thanks to the presence of an on-screen compass that will always indicate the direction to reach the boss, and therefore also the end of the specific level. Boost doesn't sound great. The protagonists cannot level up, but backtracking encourages the recovery of a whole series of enhancers (health and weapons) which make progression much easier. Apart from these objects, however, there is no real reason to go back to exploring the previous areas, especially considering the levels that are graphically inspired, but also quite bare and - within the same area - extremely repetitive. Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, while offering a sufficient dose of tactics in some sections, actually seems to ask the player ~only~ three things: immediately learn to switch between Shinobu and Maya; take advantage of the alternation to painlessly get to the boss; annihilate the giant monster on duty. Platforms, action and effective atmosphere - the summary of Grim Guardians: Demon Purge The learning curve therefore sees a conspicuous surge in the first hour of the game, to then stop once it is understood how to make the most of the weapons supplied to the two girls. It must also be said that, after all, these were obviously precisely the objectives of the developers, without any pretension of excessive depth, especially in the contents. However, great care has been reserved for the clashes with the end-of-level bosses, these are very well-kept, alternating in various phases and visually memorable.", "date": "2023-02-26", "grade": "7.0"}
