{"name": "007: Quantum of Solace - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/007-quantum-of-solace-recensione.html", "text": "Call to duty for 007 In reality, Quantum of Solace is made up of a jumble of levels that mainly cross Casino Royale, so much so that it is not clear why the game is not called in some other way: the levels dedicated to the film Quantum of Solace are very few. The game is a typical First Person Shooter unashamedly based on the mechanics of the best-seller Call of Duty 4: of course you play as James Bond and have to make your way through dozens of enemies in frenetic shootouts to the death. Nothing new under the sun in fact, but Treyarch has decided to add a feature to make the action more unpredictable, a cover system similar to that seen for example in Gears of War or Uncharted. The idea would, of course, be to take advantage of the environment to take shelter from enemy blows to reload the weapon or wait for the right moment to jump out and unload the magazine on the unfortunate ones. Not everything works as it should, however: the mechanism suffers from annoying bugs and imperfections. The problem is that the stages seem to have been specifically designed around this feature, with multiple points to be exploited for hiding and sheltering... but in reality, many of these cannot be interacted with at all. In fact, it often happens that we want to exploit what is apparently an explicit shelter and then die riddled with bullets because 007 does not fully react to our input. What confuses is above all the excessive presence of similar elements, and consequently the problem of the rhythm of the action is added, fluctuating and often slowed down by the need to exploit these shelters, present in industrial quantities and not always effective. The freedom of action and choice is therefore also undermined in this sense, and the artificial intelligence of the enemies, incomplete and repetitive, also contributes to the static nature of the gameplay: not only are the enemies all the same, but they all behave in the same way, so is that from the first hour of the game you learn to predict its moves with disarming ease. Thankfully FPS sessions are sometimes interrupted by simple mini-games or Quick Time Events, but the amount is sporadic. On the multiplayer front, Quantum of Solace offers various game modes, some of which are decidedly interesting, nothing particularly revolutionary but their originality is certainly an asset. Comment As in the vast majority of tie-ins, no one had particularly high expectations for Quantum of Solace: the game is just enough, but not bad as often happens when famous licenses are exploited for easy money. Treyarch's attempt to add some particular features such as the cover system to such a consolidated mechanic is appreciable, but the entire level design is fake and the mechanics do not work as they should. However, the real problem with Quantum of Solace is its longevity: the game lasts just under five hours, offering no incentive to replay it. The multiplayer mode, as interesting as it is, doesn't offer anything really new and is soon forgotten: there is definitely better out there. Aimed at die-hard James Bond fans or those desperate for an FPS. Pros Captivating gameplay Interesting multiplayer mode It's still James Bond... Cons Cover system to review Not enough AI and enemy variety Very short James Bond: Quantum of Solace is available for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the PlayStation 3 version. My name is Bond um, never mind Technically Quantum of Solace looks like a FPS without infamy or praise. The game looks like a Call of Duty mod in some ways, and that's certainly not a bad thing. The polygonal models are well made and faithful to their cinematic counterparts, the texturing of more than good quality, the fluctuating animations. However, the variety of enemies is very minimal both in terms of aesthetics and animations, practically the same criminals are fought from start to finish. The various locations enjoy a decent level of detail and the apparent complexity offered by the multiple points of cover and the numerous explosions that it is possible to cause and chain together makes it almost seem as if the game offers more freedom than is really at hand. The main problem is the frame-rate, tending to frequent slowdowns in the most chaotic situations and practically always on the occasion of multiple explosions and effects such as clouds of smoke and dust. All in all, the work done was discreet, but in the average of the myriad of similar productions, without bringing any novelty, neither technical nor at least playful, relevant to the genre.", "date": "2008-11-14", "grade": null}
