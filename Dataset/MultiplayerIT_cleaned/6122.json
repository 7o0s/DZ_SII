{"name": "Le dimensioni non contano", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154871-little-battlers-experience-le-dimensioni-non-contano.html", "text": "An exquisitely personal premise is urgently needed, which should help you better understand the target of this Little Battlers eXperience, a Level-5 RPG released a few years ago for PSP and then re-proposed on PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS in a revised and corrected version. The writer is a compulsive collector of ~gunpla~, i.e. those kits for building the various Gundams (the famous Japanese mecha, it's impossible that you don't know it!) that Bandai so generously prints in industrial quantities every year, a hobby reinvigorated especially in the last couple of years thanks to the broadcast of the animated series Gundam Build Fighters, probably conceived with the precise aim of selling even more models than before and conquering the world with plastic. The diabolical marketing operation was successful, relying above all on the collecting and nostalgic side of the more elderly spectators, and well done Bandai. In case you were wondering what this discussion has to do with Little Battlers eXperience, it is easy to say: the aforementioned Gundam Build Fighters is basically a clone of the video game signed Level-5, which preceded it and which in the meantime has spawned a couple of sequels , a manga and animated series that also aired on our TV channels last year. And of course, an avalanche of models to build and customize in pure gunpla style, also produced by the mephistophelean Bandai, in a kind of headache temporal paradox. Considering that, once the storyline of the game was completed, we ran to buy a kit to build Achilles, the robot ~protagonist~ of the adventure, we can already say that Little Battlers eXperience has succeeded in its dual purpose, and that is to have fun... and make us buy even more models. Level-5 strikes again: Little Battlers eXperience is a truly must-have action RPG! Please set your LBX base In reality, it is not entirely correct to define Gundam Build Fighters a clone of Little Battlers eXperience (Danball Senki, in Japan) but the points of contact between the two franchises are really many. Even in the imaginary world of Level-5, the most widespread hobby ever consists in buying kits to build small robots called, precisely, LBX. And so far, there is nothing strange. Suspend your disbelief now: you will need it if you want to immerse yourself in this story without rolling your eyes every three by two. In Little Battlers eXperience, in fact, these little robots can fight in special papier-mch arenas: kids love to beat each other with their mechs, and then customize, upgrade and improve them to get stronger and stronger. It's the staple of every kids series, and as a result our protagonist, Van Yamano, loves building LBXs and playing with his best friends, Ami and Kazuya. It's a hobby that his mother doesn't share, especially since LBX's were invented by Van's father, shortly before he disappeared in a mysterious accident. One fine day, Van receives from a perfect stranger a model of LBX that he had never seen before, and is charged with guarding it with all his strength because the future of humanity depends on it. In fact, our young hero does not know that a secret society, the so-called Supporters of the New Dawn, intends to transform the LBX into real war machines, starting with the prototype that he has come into possession of. From that moment, a long adventure with rather gloomy hues begins for him and his friends: there will be tournaments and fights with more or less extravagant characters and situations that border on the absurd - who would entrust such a dangerous weapon to a teenager? - but Little Battlers eXperience isn't exactly a fairy tale for children, given that we are talking about murders, hitmen, arms trafficking and world revolutions. Level-5, however, touches on those topics with a certain sensitivity, alternating static dialogues with cutscenes that use the good polygonal and cel shading engine (it is now a trademark) with numerous and spectacular cartoon sequences. Those who have played Inazuma Eleven Go will immediately recognize the technical sector, here embellished with significantly better polygonal models and fairly complex and detailed scenarios. The game is dubbed completely in English, although the lip sync leaves something to be desired, while the texts are all in Italian, and follow the western terminology also used in the Italian adaptation of the cartoon. It should be emphasized that the ~campaign~ covers the first forty-four episodes of the anime, so those who have already followed the series on TV could get bored quickly since it takes about twenty hours to complete the story. It is fortunate, therefore, that it can be practically spenttwice as much to collect and customize LBX's. The 3D effect Stereoscopy adds nothing to the gameplay, but it does increase player engagement when fighting in arenas. Furthermore, during explorations it helps the shots to generate a certain depth effect, especially when the camera dynamically follows the protagonist. We advise you to activate the 3D effect: it is superfluous, but well implemented. Battle start! The experience (or eXperienza?) is mainly divided into two parts. The more RPG one is quite traditional: in the role of Van - or one of his supporting characters, depending on the moment in which the action takes place - we will have to explore the city of Pacifica, interacting with the many NPCs that populate it, making purchases in shops and by opening the chests hidden in the less visible corners. It's the most traditional part of Little Battlers eXperience, and mainly serves to progress through the story, so much so that some areas are real ~dungeons~ where we'll even be randomly attacked by enemies and their LBX's. In this phase of the game it is possible to access the main menu and get lost among the numerous screens that allow us to manage features such as e-mail, the list of Van's friends, the history of the events, the canonical game options and so on. Then there's that magical menu, Customize: we have to admit that the first hours of the game are a bit traumatic, because they constantly fill this screen with functions and options, overwhelming the player with information. The game, fortunately, offers practical tutorials that teach the basic mechanics and subtleties of the gameplay, but Little Battlers eXperience is a truly complex title: at the beginning you can play without going into too much depth, but in the more advanced stages of the story, and above all in the ~post game~, it will be necessary to learn to micromanage the various LBXs in every aspect. In fact, the small mechs can be customized practically in everything, in defiance of Level-5's default setups: each piece can be replaced with those found or purchased in shops, in some cases the color of the exoskeleton can be changed and equip different weapons at any time, setting two sets to alternate at a moment's notice during battles. Don't you like the idea of Achilles fighting with spear and shield? Then equip him with a mace, or a nice rocket launcher if you prefer a less direct approach. And who says that Ami's Kunoichi has to be an agile and snappy LBX? Replace those two supple legs with a nice pair of crawlers, and the game is done. Each component increases in level independently, determining the defense, the elemental resistances, the weight and therefore the speed of the robot: this implies a certain ~grind~ of the best pieces, especially if you want to change them for a mere aesthetic factor, but this trend may appear repetitive in the end it pays off, expanding our collection of spare parts and, consequently, of setups that we can choose when we face a new opponent who is giving us a hard time. The various setups can be conveniently saved, however, so as to be able to change them entirely without having to choose each weapon or spare by hand. Weapons also have the same strategic value, whose speed and power vary according to the skill of the mech on duty: the more a weapon is used, the more our LBX becomes good at spinning it, unlocking in parallel the special attacks with which it is possible to turn the tide of a clash, it being understood that even the enemies, just like us, can choose to respond to our attack in various ways, perhaps by dodging it or by counter-attacking, in a kind of impromptu ~quick time event~. As if all this were not enough, the player must also manage the so-called central units, i.e. the microchips which determine the most important parameters of each LBX: like a kind of game within a game, these components must be fitted within a grid, making them match using the available space. On the power of the central unit is based, for example, the consumption of the battery during the fight, the speed with which the indicator that consumes the special attacks, the effectiveness of the weapons and more are charged. This complex but intriguing strategic framework is simply the appetizer of the real fights, during which up to two teams made up of three LBX each can challenge each other. Battle ended! The clashes, in Little Battlers eXperience, can be random, if you are exploring a dangerous area, or mandatory, if the story requires it, and optional. The latter are an almost infinite resource of materials, spare parts and experience points: the majoritymost NPCs living in Pacifica will be willing to fight with us at any time, allowing us to grow our LBX's and try new setups without having to stop somewhere to ~grind~ random fights. The battles appeal to a fair variety of rules, but the basic concept is always the same: you have to beat the enemy until he crashes. The control system clings to action game tradition, assigning one key to attack, one to jump, one to open the inventory when you want to use special attacks or consume healing items, and one last key to sprint. Each action consumes the battery indicator, which recharges over time and which, once dry, ridiculously weakens our attacks, thus forcing us to dose the combos and approaches to avoid having to twirl our thumbs at the most beautiful. With the back keys it is also possible to parry or lock on targets, and some key combinations also allow you to increase the power of the shots of certain weapons, to reload the firearms or to dodge sideways between one shot and another. In short, the combat system is complete and satisfying, undermined only by a certain woodiness in the movements of the LBX which you have to get used to but which never completely goes away. We admit it: the first clashes left us rather frozen. They were slow and repetitive battles, based solely on the exchange of combos in turn and on the escape between the environmental elements scattered across the battlefields, whose conformations depend on the type of scenario, with the urban ones full of buildings that interrupt the lines of fire or those set in the desert, with the canyons that form huge drops and offer perfect spots to ambush or frame the target. Once we got the party together for the first time and started tackling three-on-three fights, equipping different weapons and special techniques on our custom LBXs, a new world opened up: beyond the simplicity with which it is possible to campaign, the battles in Little Battlers eXperience are a blast, and the boss battles are highly spectacular, if perhaps a little too short. Consider that it is possible to challenge up to five other players locally, using your own customized LBX: unfortunately this is one of those contexts that rarely occur in everyday life, but which on balance allows you to immerse yourself even more in the game world. In short, it is a pity that Nintendo has decided to publish the Level-5 title when the kits distributed while the cartoon was broadcast on TV have also disappeared from the shops. Yes, a pity for collectors, and for Bandai's pockets.", "date": "2015-08-19", "grade": "9.0"}
