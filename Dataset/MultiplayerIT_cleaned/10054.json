Was it really needed? From a certain point of view Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West is an unnecessary product in 2010, with most of the shooters already equipped with a solid multiplayer component and some specifically designed titles, such as Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike, which despite the years they can still count on a very solid user base and new recruits constantly attracted by experiences now capable of self-feeding their own legend. After a couple of weeks of playing on the PC version and on the occasion of the release of the PlayStation 3 version on PSN, we can finally sum up the work done by FatShark in collaboration with Paradox Interactive. The hard life of the Wild West The game modes are designed to be enjoyed by a total of ten players, divided into two teams, each of which is able to choose one of the four available classes. We go from the gunslinger, fast and effective from medium-short range, to the sniper, passing through a specialist in the use of the shotgun, also skilled with sticks of dynamite, and from the one in possession of a good weapon just to hit from a distance as well as in mid-length fights. The choices available to the user at the beginning and then during each game therefore refer to decidedly standard models, which however make use of a rather ingenious passive system of upgrades: each class has a specific improvement to its statistics compared to the others , such as increased accuracy or stamina, which can automatically transfer to nearby teammates. In this way - and considering that, always when you are in the vicinity of an ally, you see your energy slowly recovering - you are naturally stimulated to move in unison, composing a single front of fire or dividing into two groups, one more advanced while the second covers the rear. The result, although not very original, is immediate and at the same time profound, a mixture of furious shootings and attention to how you move that mixes well with decidedly spot-on controls and a use of the camera, rather close to the player's alter ego. which combines the needs in the aiming phase and those while on the move. The modes are pretty standard in their core rules going from team deathmatch through to a capture the flag, here revised with a bag of gold, where a single team defends while the other attacks, while the introduction of some barrels from transporting and then detonating at certain points gives new perspectives to what in a nutshell turns out to be a variant of the classic capture of control points, also presented in its more traditional formula. FatShark has therefore worked well, adding to well-known games, whose rules everyone knows, more original elements and specifically designed to stay in the Wild West theme. Is anybody there? Six maps currently correspond to the four competitive and cooperative modes, during which to kill waves of enemies managed by artificial intelligence. The themes are what one would expect from a western setting game with gold mines, forts, border towns, high mountains and wheat fields as a backdrop to levels in several cases very well done, full of alternative passages and equipped with a verticality enhanced by the adoption of the third person camera. The arenas, whether they are symmetrical or not, are perhaps the most valuable element of the entire production and compete without major problems with those of the best exponents of the genre. After several notes on merit, unfortunately, some negative elements must be recorded which add up to the aforementioned little innovation placed in a title that focuses entirely on multiplayer only. The release that took place on Steam, despite good communication, does not seem to have brought important results in terms of sales and this causes a decidedly low online population, which in moments of less activity reaches just a few dozen users. Added to this is the temporary absence of dedicated servers - they should arrive shortly - and the implementation of a net code for peer 2 peer gaming that is far from perfect, often causing a lot of lag when the host of the game is at considerable distances from the user. Graphically the game is quite valid, with the cartoon style that properly masks a non-exciting polygon count and an overall care for the environments and models, which sin a bit of repetitiveness being unique for each class, all in all acceptable considering also the scope dshe production.", "date": "2010-04-23", "grade": "7.5"}
