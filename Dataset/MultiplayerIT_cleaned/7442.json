EPOCH 2 picks up the story where we left off, with the protagonist robot who managed to find Princess Amelia after a long battle. However, the regent is still under the effects of cryogenic sleep, and only the recovery of a series of energy nodes will allow her to awaken. Assisted for the moment by Amelia's virtual conscience, the warrior android Epoch must therefore return to doing what he does best: frame the machines that have led to the destruction of society in his electronic viewfinder and open fire, all through fourteen levels which can be faced not only in ~campaign~ mode but also in a ruthless Time Attack or in ~Iron Mode~, i.e. with much more dangerous and resistant opponents. The game mechanics remain the same, with the character having to move along three or more shelters and shoot the enemies who from time to time lurk in front of him, calculating well the times of each sortie and the values in the field, such as the sensitivity to a certain type of ammunition or the effectiveness of a particular weapon. However, the context is much more dynamic and spectacular, and it is immediately clear how the developers have tried to make the action lively and frenetic, so as to mask its inevitable static (always a shooter on rails, in the end) . To succeed, the focus was decisively on the graphics, driven by the powerful Unreal Engine, here engaged in an absolutely convincing test for detail, fluidity, direction and location design. Perhaps we would have appreciated a heavier-looking protagonist, but it's also true that the Epoch's ~lightweight~ chassis makes his crazy stunts from cover to cover believable. EPOCH 2 is an excellent sequel, a spectacular and fun rail shooter, but with some limitations Let's get active EPOCH 2 is very nice to see, but it is not only in the technical sector that Uppercut Games has made its efforts. The team was faced with a challenge not to laugh at, that is to add thickness and facets to a rail shooter, and thought of achieving this result by inserting a series of extra gestural commands compared to the default ones, for example the slide towards the low for reloading the equipped weapon and a second slide to be performed when an indicator is in the ~active reload~ area, in Gears of War style. This immediately translates into a more complex control system, unfortunately often spoiled by times that do not go well with the speed that is asked of us to avoid unwanted damage. And so we come to the problems of this production, in this case the balancing of difficulty and the presence of an in-app purchase system for a title that is still sold for 5.49 euros on the App Store, therefore a ~premium~ price and certainly not freemium. The two aspects appear evidently connected, in the sense that the missions are a bit too difficult and to be able to overcome them it is necessary to upgrade weapons, armor and special skills. The point is, however, that the currency is released very sparingly, and this inevitably forces us to replay the levels already completed or to put our hands on our wallets, a practice that in this specific case we do not consider particularly correct and which we hope will be reviewed in the short term. Because, we reiterate, in itself EPOCH 2 perfectly represents the concept of sequel and does everything in its power to get out of seemingly insurmountable limits, or those that define its sub-genre.", "date": "2013-11-29", "grade": "7.9"}
