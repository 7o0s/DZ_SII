However, when we review an expansion - but this also applies to any MMO at launch - we don't know how the situation will evolve in the following months: we judge what we have in our hands, of course. For example, at the great launch of Warlords of Draenor we didn't know that Blizzard would be handing the punchline script to a pack of howler monkeys. We didn't know that the Irvine company would forget to update its blockbuster for almost a year, just as we didn't know - but we had a strong suspicion, given the previous ones - that World of Warcraft would lose millions of subscribers within a few months. But when Blizzard announced Legion, we knew it was trying to make up for its mistakes, giving Warcraft fans what they've been craving for years: a ~full immersion~ in the mythology of its universe and a fresh perspective with which to tackle ten new levels at character. Now that we have thoroughly explored the Broken Isles and set foot on the first incursion, the Emerald Nightmare, we can sum up what, you guessed it, is the best expansion for World of Warcraft. Legion is an outstanding expansion that will excite World of Warcraft players new and old Up and down the Broken Isles The leveling phase that Blizzard has prepared this time is one of the most engaging and exciting in the history of its MMORPG. You should know the premise well by now: the ~revived~ Gul'dan is helping the Burning Legion to conquer Azeroth and our hope of driving out the invaders lies in the Pillars of Creation, five relics kept in the Broken Isles. The Alliance and the Horde moved quickly to recover them, but their landing on the Broken Shore resulted in the deaths of the king of Stormwind, Varian Wrynn, and the warchief Vol'jin: each faction blames the other for its loss and this renewed rivalry will emerge in every region of the Broken Isles, intertwining with the vicissitudes of their populations. To fully understand the story it would be necessary to play in both factions, which reconfirms the care that the writers have placed in the drafting of the plot, net of some small oversights that perhaps will be clarified in the future. In any case, the four regions of Stormheim, Highmountain, Val'sharah and Azsuna offer truly enthralling storylines that take up quite a few unfinished business, substantially touching twelve years of stories in a crescendo of discoveries and twists accompanied by a incredible soundtrack and dubbing - in Italian and English - of the highest quality. To make the experience even more interesting from a gameplay point of view is the fact that this time the challenges grow together with the player: the enemies increase in power with each level up of our character, guaranteeing us not only a homogeneous challenge from level 100 to 110, but also the ability to change zones at any time or to play with anyone regardless of their level thanks to a complex algorithm that balances the relationships between players and their targets. Leveling up and completing missions has never been so enjoyable, as both the obstacles and the rewards are always the same height and you feel encouraged to complete each region just for the sake of discovering how the story progresses and what rewards you deserve from time to time. In this sense, the unprecedented discovery of the artifacts has proved to be successful... even if with some reservations. Now players no longer find weapons but earn points with which to upgrade their artifacts - iconic weapons linked to the various specializations of each class - and unlock various bonuses without being forced to follow a precise order: it's a bit like having a talent tree old school, which reinforces the bond that is created between the player and his weapon, thanks also to the possibility of changing its appearance after reaching certain goals. If it is true that leveling up the weapon and customizing it is an idea that definitely renews the leveling of World of Warcraft, so is the fact that the system makes the growth of a secondary specialization particularly frustrating given that artifact points are precious and it's best to infuse them all into your favorite specialization's weapon. Perhaps Blizzard wanted to set specific roles to diversify the community, tutHowever, the players who are most affected by the circumstances are forced by circumstances to change specialization, holding a much less developed weapon: those who play the raids in the endgame will have understood precisely where the problem arises, but the developers have promised that by the end of the expansion players will have managed to max out at least two weapons without too much effort. At the moment this promise doesn't help much, but it's something. The future of PvE on Azeroth As for the variety of missions, we certainly can't complain. In addition to defeating enemies and collecting objects, as usual, we will have to solve puzzles, interpret other characters in real interactive flashbacks, sow destruction from above and so on and so forth. Most of the missions are structured in an ingenious way and make particular use of environmental interaction and the increasingly sophisticated phasing technology that Blizzard has been using full throttle for years now. Exploring the Broken Isles is also a pleasure because, at the moment, you have to do it on foot or riding a terrestrial creature, navigating the complex geometry of scenarios that extend horizontally and vertically between caves, slopes, gorges, lakes and dungeons. The developers then filled each area with treasures and rare enemies to hunt, successfully repeating one of the most popular features of Warlords of Draenor. Once you reach the maximum level, then, you enter Suramar and unlock the world missions. The first is the fifth region of the Broken Isles, an ancient city where the elves addicted to the magic of the Dark Well have segregated themselves. Suramar works a little differently than the other regions of the Broken Isles and of World of Warcraft all: in this area the developer has chosen a vaguely sandbox approach, filling it with missions that can only be encountered by freely exploring every corner (or following some guide on the Internet, although it is much less fun). The progression in Suramar takes place gradually and is intertwined with the storyline of the Dark Exiles, renegade inhabitants who are trying to reconquer the capital that has ended up in the clutches of the Legion: for this reason, many missions will lead us to explore a small masterpiece of level design between camouflages, murders that would make Ezio Auditore envious and breathtaking escapes. It is a pity that Blizzard has linked the progression in the storyline to the accumulation of reputation, even if the choice to slow down the most hardcore players capable of burning all the content within a few days is understandable. This does not mean that, once you reach the maximum level and run out of missions, you just sit idly by: that's exactly the purpose of the world missions, a series of timed tasks that are very reminiscent of the Adventure mode of Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. Once you have completed the mission that unlocks them, you can open the map and search for the world missions of each region: they are tasks that can be completed alone or in groups in a few minutes and which guarantee a large variety of rewards that scale with the equipment owned by the player. In this way, finally, those who have little time to devote to World of Warcraft will still be able to use it productively, without lagging behind the players who can spend hours on the various expeditions. World missions are probably one of the features we most appreciated in Legion, thanks also to their variety and the simplicity with which they can be completed. In a certain sense, between the approach adopted for Suramar and the decision to tread less on instanced PvE, we are quite sure that Blizzard has taken the right path to evolve the dynamics of its MMORPG. The drama of the ~alt~ The fact that Legion is so ~story driven~ and that Suramar is tied to the player's reputation with the Nightfallen, however, casts a shadow on players who like to grow more characters. We have already said that, at the moment, improving a second weapon (and specialization, therefore) is a real feat because at the beginning there are few artifact points and it is better to focus on one weapon at a time. Similarly, raising a secondary character is daunting for the same reasons, and especially because the achievements achieved with the various factions and with the reconquest of Suramar are not shared across the account: this means that a player would have to get by with double - or worse - than world quests, reputations and artifact points, in a truly unsustainable ~grind~. The same goes for the class enclave, the so-called ~garrison 2.0~ whichit supplants the one left in Draenor's past. The class enclaves are characteristic and full of captivating details, assisted by a long series of missions that runs parallel to our adventures on the Broken Isles, deepening certain aspects or bringing back historical characters from the Warcraft universe who, in most cases , will become our followers. Let's say that Blizzard has played much less on the garrison system that in Warlords of Draenor had become the death of the community: now we can no longer use it to accumulate resources for crafting and the reduced number of followers decreases the need to resort to the board of their missions thanks also to the contribution of the official app distributed shortly after the launch of the game, which allows you to manage followers and upgrades even without being connected to World of Warcraft. The fact that Blizzard has almost completely cut the link between the class enclave and crafting perhaps explains why the latter is the aspect that the developers have neglected the most in the making of Legion. Despite the revamp of the various professions, some of which have become almost unrecognizable compared to the past, we have struggled to find most of the items that can be crafted useful, especially when it is possible to obtain equipment of equal quality, if not even better, simply by relying on to expeditions or world quests. The fault is probably also of the economy, now irreparably distorted not only by the relationship between garrisons and crafts that was established during Warlords of Draenor, but also by the consequent diffusion of money that was perpetrated especially in the year in which many players turned their thumbs and spent the time putting aside nabob's nest egg. Too bad, because many ideas - such as entrusting the completion of themed missions with the progression in the new levels of each profession - were really very good, despite the clumsy implementation. An endgame in the making Reached the maximum level, World of Warcraft returns to being the MMORPG we have known for years, despite the small revolutions established with Legion. Players are encouraged to complete dungeons and raids to obtain the best equipment, choosing from different difficulty levels that guarantee rewards of proportional quality. From the point of view of the game design itself, some dungeons seemed absolutely splendid even in their simplicity: our favorite is Maw of Souls, an adventure set entirely in the underworld of the Valarjar complete with bosses to face at board a ship in a storm. Also wide-ranging are the Eye of Azshara, Strong Ravenclaw and the Halls of Valor; the too linear Cave of Neltharion and Grove Darkheart are a little less convincing. To forget Assault on the Purple Fortress, ugly and boring today as it was in the time of Wrath of the Lich King. On the other hand, the Segrete delle Custodi, Arcavia and the Corte delle Stelle are splendid: the latter surprised us with the decision to entrust the last part of the expedition to a sort of game of Guess who. A truly original gimmick, but then most of the bosses offer what are actually small-scale raid mechanics, designed to prepare players for more advanced challenges. In this sense, Blizzard has had an eye also for those who have less time to devote to raids in a big way, borrowing another feature of Diablo III - that of the Greater Rifts - to offer Mythic+ expeditions: basically , you can complete these expeditions on increasing difficulty to get your hands on loot that easily rivals what you can get in expeditions. In this way, the Irvine company has not only offered players who don't like expeditions a less chaotic variant, but has also stimulated competition in the community in terms of PvE, with all due respect to a PvP that always works but which by now it ended up being forgotten despite the revamp to the progression, now marked through a series of ranks that unlock rewards and skills that can only be used in the arena or in the battlefields. We liked the idea of Mythic+, also because it offers players a viable alternative to raids in terms of rewards and effort, while not always rewarding all participants for their efforts. In this regard, although it is absolutely normal just a month after launch, we must necessarily complain about a discreet imbalance between the classes, on which Blizzard seems to be already working in view of the first update", "date": "2016-09-23", "grade": "9.3"}
