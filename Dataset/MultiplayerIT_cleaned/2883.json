{"name": "RPG Maker MV", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rpg-maker-mv-recensione.html", "text": "The RPG Maker MV review does not speak of a game but of a software containing a set of tools useful for all for those who want to try their hand at creating an RPG and therefore give vent to their imagination. The strength of products like RPG Maker is in fact that they allow anyone to create a video game practically from scratch, without having the slightest knowledge of programming and starting from a handful of basic ideas. For these reasons, the landing of this edition on PlayStation 4 (and Switch) curated for the West by NIS America, was awaited with great expectations by many enthusiasts who had already admired it on PC in 2015. These expectations, however, as we will see in the following lines, they risk being partially disappointed after just a few minutes of play. Unfriendly controls The program does not need who knows how many and which explanations: once loaded, the user finds himself in front of a simple and amusing tutorial that explains in detail what to do through some played phases, including the use of an interface full of icons and commands, where to start projects. You can therefore start by taking a ~virgin~ map and use it as a basis for inserting what you think is suitable for your needs, or readapt one by modifying its appearance by removing or adding trees, rivers, woods and villages. At a later time, the user can then worry about carrying out the further steps to give life to a semblance of a complete and playable product. In between, at least for those who are new to this type of software, many tests, various attempts to better fit the various assets proposed and ready, as well as to make the various parameters that regulate the many aspects of a game work. Only when all the pieces are in place can we say we have created something that begins to take on a more concrete form. Because to get to complete even a simple and short-lived adventure, it will be necessary to put together many of these micro-works and dedicate a lot of time to them. A far from simple undertaking not only due to the complexity that programming a title requires, even if as in this case one is helped to the maximum by software, but because to select, modify, use any element for one's project one has to navigate among numerous menu with the help of the pads, much more uncomfortable and less ~friendly~ than a more suitable mouse. The absence (and usefulness) of this peripheral is felt like that of a keyboard, especially when you start working on party members, choosing the classes they will impersonate and, above all, creating the first lines of dialogue . In any self-respecting role-playing game, the speeches between characters are a key element of the product, and obviously there are always plenty of texts to write. Consequently, it is one thing to be able to do it using, in fact, a comfortable keyboard, another to have to do it with the analog stick and the choice of each single letter through a screen. Sure, the program provides for the use of textual shortcuts, but faced with the enormity of certain scripts, there's little you can do. Lots of resources However, the RPG Maker MV interface is rich in content (this edition includes almost all the plugins and resources released over the years through DLC on computers), well organized among them, and it's difficult to get lost while looking for something. And if you overcome the annoyance of having to ~maneuver~ everything, as written before, through a peripheral that is quite inconvenient for this type of product, it is possible to immerse yourself even more in the process of creating a game, refining that structural base we mentioned at the start. Thus the user can devote himself to balancing the statistics of his characters, with those of the monsters he has decided to place on the path of the party, inside an intricate dungeon rather than among the trees of a snowy forest. And again, rethinking the arrangement of some areas and arranging in the key moments of the adventure the events that will perhaps serve to change a phase of the game, to introduce a new hero or enemy or to give life to the classic plot twist, depending on the ramifications of the history. Within RPG Maker MV you can even manage the way in which the non-player characters move or react, as well as the enemies, to whom you can assign well-defined behavioral routines so that they can appear or not in certain moments or environments, how many times do it, the various levels of growth and potency, and so on. There are also many selectable music to accompany the exploratory phases, the dialogues or the combat sessions. In short, you will certainly have understood that this program, net of its ~defects~, is really full of potential and is not aimed at a general public, but at real enthusiasts willing to spend hours and hours in front of screens before making a choice, and specifically to overlook the limitations imposed by the absence of mouse and keyboard.An obstacle that is difficult to overcome for casual gamers.For the record, among the other limitations of the console version compared to the PC counterpart, we point out the impossibility of importing new original resources, and that of creating games that can then be sold on the market. In this sense, creations can only be shared, free of charge, through the Maker Forum.", "date": "2020-09-24", "grade": "6.5"}
