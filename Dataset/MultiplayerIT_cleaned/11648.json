{"name": "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stalker-mobile.html", "text": "As reiterated several times in the preview phase, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is the mobile version of an FPS of the same name released on PC last year, remembered above all for an extremely long and painful development time, which also led to a final product that did not live up to (excessive) expectations. Curiously, one could almost say that this incarnation for mobile phones has repeated - with due proportions - the deeds of the original, arriving on the market without the necessary elements to confirm the grandiloquent declarations of the various press releases. But first things first: the plot of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Mobile is connected to that of the PC version, and sees the user once again taking on the role of a mercenary engaged in carrying out some missions within the Zone, the area that emerged following the Chernobyl nuclear explosion. In addition to the typical shootings of an FPS, the work Qplaze includes various elements taken from RPGs: in particular locations it will therefore be possible to meet friendly characters with whom to entertain multiple choice conversations, which often and willingly will also lead to the sale of objects or the assignment of quest. STALKER. it also boasts a growth system for the protagonist, complete with experience points and level-ups that allow you to increase the attributes of health, strength and precision. A good selection of weapons with a realistic look complete the picture of an FPS whose completeness, unfortunately, stops at appearances. Main problem of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it is not a production defect, but an unfortunate gameplay choice by the developers: the game is in fact a ~on rails~ FPS, consequently it is not possible to move freely, but only to proceed from screen to screen by selecting some very specific hotspots with the pointer. You can therefore only move your gaze, identifying and eliminating the enemies present in the area and then continuing to the next section with the method just described. A truly limiting solution, which certainly makes you miss the classic FPS and which makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. a product with little fun factor. And it cannot even be said that the gameplay of the Qplaze work gets boring ahead of time, given that the adventure is terrifyingly short, with the credits that can easily arrive after just an hour and a half of play. Not even the graphics of the title (always painted as the spearhead of the entire production) is safe from some criticism: on the most powerful terminals the glance is truly exceptional, with extremely accurate 3D scenarios and excellent special effects, but just do one small step down the evolutionary ladder to witness a truly merciless downgrade. The sound, on the other hand, is good, although substantially limited to the sound of the protagonist's footsteps and the noises produced by the weapons. PRO Interesting RPG elements Sumptuous graphics... AGAINST ...but only on very high-profile mobile phones Gameplay too static Longevity at historic lows", "date": "2008-01-31", "grade": "S.V."}
