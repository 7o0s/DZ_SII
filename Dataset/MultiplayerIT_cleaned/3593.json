As illustrated in this review, the developers have managed to recreate the atmospheres of the action adventures of the past, full of fetch quests, backtracking and uploads for each single scenario, also trying to re-propose that way of making videogame transpositions that often led to the birth of titles that are not exactly brilliant. This eventuality was only partially averted in this specific case, if only due to the awareness of a project born with precisely that type of mechanics and that type of structure in mind: undoubtedly outdated elements, which make retrogaming so much and which they invariably trigger the emotions of those nostalgic for a period that accompanied our childhood. In short, a rather daring attempt by BonusXP, which is lost between the pleasantness of some passages, the interesting action interpretation of certain situations and the not negligible limits of an experience imprisoned in the past. Plot and characters Let's start immediately by saying that if you have not yet seen the third season of Stranger Things you should avoid trying your hand at Stranger Things 3: The Game, since the game retraces the events of the series in a rather faithful and close manner, necessarily taking freedom in placing enemies within the scenarios in order to enliven a formula that is otherwise too trivial. Without wanting to anticipate too much, in the introductory phase we witness the experiments of a Russian team who are trying to open the usual door to the Upside Down, after which we proceed to find the protagonists of all time, starting with Mike and Lucas. Armed respectively with a baseball bat and a slingshot with an automatic targeting system, the kids head to the new Hawkins mall to watch a movie, but they need good old Steve's help to take advantage of a little shortcut and get in for free in the hall. The first mission serves to introduce us to the game mechanics, which are actually quite simple and based on the collaboration between two different characters, one of which is controlled by artificial intelligence or by a second user in cooperative mode. Throughout the story it is possible to unlock all the key figures of the show, each equipped with different attack methods and special moves, the latter regulated by an indicator placed above the vital energy bar. For example, Eleven can unleash a powerful shock wave that also involves entire groups of enemies, Lucas can launch a firecracker that inflicts serious damage to targets, Hopper can charge the opponent head-on, and so on. Initially there are areas that cannot be accessed unless using the right character, a bit like in the games of the LEGO series, but knowing the plot of the show we proceed quite quickly. This raises a significant perplexity, however: playing Stranger Things 3: The Game without having first watched the last season certainly ruins your vision, but doing the opposite weakens the albeit modest narrative sector of the game and even some of the its puzzles, leading you to proceed very quickly and complete the adventure within eight hours, if you ignore most of the side missions. Xbox One goals There are 31 Achievements available in Stranger Things 3: The Game. Many of them are obtained simply by progressing in the campaign and completing its levels, or by unlocking the various characters available, while others are linked to obtaining particular objects, such as the garden gnomes scattered throughout the stages. Gameplay and structure Speaking of puzzles, alternating with the command of the characters and ordering the counterpart to follow us or stop represents one of the main elements for solving environmental puzzles, which involve switches of various types, objects to move, platforms to press and possibly notes to memorize. The problem is when the very completion of missions depends on finding objects located in different areas of the map, which means taking long walks to recover the necessary and not forgetting to locate a workbench to then be able to assemble what we need. Even the settings have a retro connotation: these are some scenarios seen in the episodes of Stranger Things, however characterized by fairly small dimensions which, once crossed, automatically lead us to view a world map from which to select the next destination. At least the possThe ability to select the task highlights the goals to be achieved from time to time, and in concert with a loading of the closest checkpoint after a game over it translates into a fortunately non-punitive approach towards errors and failures. The substance of the gameplay, however, is scarce: in practice the fights (against the mice, against the Russians, against some fairly tough bosses), net of all their limitations, have the delicate task of enlivening otherwise really trivial quests, which they simply involve moving from one point to another, collecting or buying items, and then carrying them where needed to progress through the story. Some small strategic aspects, for example the differentiation between the characters as regards standard and special attacks, enrich the experience with a minimum of depth, which of course is more fun if played in a cooperative with a friend, a feature however only available locally . On balance, in short, the miracle did not succeed for the guys from BonusXP, and so Stranger Things 3: The Game gets by but does not impress, it offers something good but also suffers from important defects related to the very nature of the production. It doesn't help a technical sector that makes discreet use of pixel art, but abundantly recycles assets to fill the levels and boasts a catchy but necessarily repetitive electronic soundtrack.", "date": "2019-07-14", "grade": "6.5"}
