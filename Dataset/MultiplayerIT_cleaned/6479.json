One of these is Vietnam '65, a turn-based strategy that takes us in the midst of the massive offensive devised by the United States to give a decisive turning point to the conflict. At the time, the Americans underestimated the dangers of the territory and did not understand the importance of relations with the population, ending up suffering a dramatic defeat. The title branded Every Single Soldier does not allow us to make the same mistake by transforming it into a key mechanic of its gameplay. Vietnam '65 is definitely different from the usual turn-based strategy games Heroes at all costs Vietnam '65 is a turn-based strategy characterized by the fearsome board divided into hexagons. Simple animations and modest graphics complete a picture that could scare more than one player but there is no need to be alarmed. In practice, the title of Every Single Soldier, designed to be usable also on tablets, is satisfied with a few units and a handful of commands that are accessible through convenient radial menus. Basically, in just a few clicks, it is possible to call supplies or bombardments, deploy reinforcements, carry out sequences of orders and ensure that all deployed units carry them out. But the simplicity of the interface doesn't translate into mundane gameplay. The curtain opens on the strategic map of a procedurally generated map. We are in South Vietnam and play the role of an American general determined to defeat the communist rebels. Entered the game we find ourselves in charge of an operational base, three helicopters, a cannon, a bulldozer and some infantry units. On the top left is a number that indicates the opinion of civilians towards our army while on the top right another value indicates our political influence which can be spent calling for reinforcements. To win, a far from easy task, it is necessary to keep an eye on both figures with the first one having to be above 50 points, or the starting value, at the stroke of the forty-fifth round of the game. The empathy of the people towards us grows by clearing mines and keeping the enemies away from the villages while it decreases if the Viet Cong reach the inhabited centers or kill our soldiers. Killing enemies, on the other hand, grants political support which can be spent on reinforcements and supplies. The problem is that this resource decreases in case of losses and is also consumed by supplies and fuel which play a central role in the gameplay. In fact, each unit has a limited number of resources that decrease each turn. To supply the troops you need transport helicopters which in turn have to spend a turn to refuel when they pass from a base. The first thing to do, in essence, is to plan each movement in order to ensure supplies and to do this it can be useful to send our engineers to the front line who can build outposts, create roads and open roads in the jungle. The terrain, on the other hand, is a decisive element that alters the advancement speed of the troops and the possibilities of engagement. The jungle also completely hides the Viet Cong who depend on very different mechanics from those to which the player must submit. Position warfare The rebels can ambush, lay mines and carry out missions against our bases, they do not have outposts and do not depend on resources but they emerge from the Ho Chi Minh path, well hidden by vegetation, whose position changes with each game. If we add to this that an attack can instantly eliminate one of our infantry units, vegetation becomes the real enemy to beat. On the other hand we can only attack visible enemies and since we don't have the possibility to ambush we can only do it in our movement turn. In essence, the Viet Cong can emerge from the vegetation and eliminate an infantry unit that is at a useful distance and can do so without running any risk. Considering that soldiers are vital to winning given the ability to retrieve information on villages and occupy them, it is good to proceed with caution, clearing the jungle around the villages to avoid ambushes. But it is not possible to take it too calmly due to those fateful forty-five rounds at the end of which the game ends. And here are the preponderant helicopters that allow you to move troops in relative safety, move the Howitzer cannon, transport the wounded to the base and transport the Green Berets which are strongeri of the infantry and, very importantly, they can hide from the enemy. Movement is vital, just as it was in Vietnam, especially as the number of units, all of which are essential to victory, is limited by a rather refined regulatory mechanism. The price of reinforcements, in fact, increases proportionally to the number of units of that type already deployed and this makes it impossible to cover the screen with cannons or attack helicopters. Ultimately Vietnam '65 puts some good ideas into play and effectively recreates the dynamics of the Vietnamese conflict but it also stands out for some rather evident gaps. First of all, the campaign, if promotions and medals that are irrelevant to the gameplay can be called that, consists of a single map which, despite being procedurally generated, is composed of a handful of assets that do not guarantee enough variety. The position of the Ho Chi Minh trail, the area from which the Viet Cong gangs emerge, changes every game but this is not enough to significantly vary a gameplay which after a few games, thanks to the continuous coming and going linked to supplies, risks being repetitive. Furthermore, the PC version's interface isn't flawless with the radial menu sometimes malfunctioning and the left mouse button being used for both selecting and moving units. Wrong by a few millimeters in the selection of a new unit can lead us to move the previously selected unit and this in a turn-based strategy can have harmful effects on the gameplay. Finally, the technical sector is decidedly modest and does not look, in full board game style, at the proportions between the units. Yet somehow it all holds up thanks to passable animations and great quality sampling that does its part in setting the right mood. But this is not enough to compensate for an offer which from the point of view of content is decidedly poor and can only stand thanks to a decidedly attractive price.", "date": "2015-03-19", "grade": "7.5"}
