On balance, the Level 5 product was nothing more than a jRPG with a very particular combat system, worthy of the great success that led to the production of various manga and animated series. In Italy, Inazuma Eleven has become a bit the Holly & Benji of the new millennium, so after the broadcast of the anime on our networks and the localization of the first two episodes for Nintendo DS, it was quite obvious to find this Inazuma Eleven Strikers on the Italian shelves. The good news is that fans of the Raimon school will find their heroes in top form; the bad news is that, this time, the target is much narrower. Dragon Balls For the avoidance of doubt, let's immediately clarify a concept: Inazuma Eleven Strikers is not a jRPG like the episodes for Nintendo DS, but a simple arcade with a minimal management component that vaguely resembles that of a jRPG. Level 5 seems to have caught a common thread that binds the various Nintendo consoles in history, or the presence of at least one football video game that is far from likely. We started with Nintendo World Cup on NES (ah, what memories...) and then we moved on to the various iterations of Mario Strikers or more or less isolated episodes like Soccer Slam: here there are no strict rules or simulation elements, but two teams of eleven players chasing a ball and summoning dragons, supernatural entities and God knows what else to send it into goal. Everything is presented in the usual, flamboyant cel shading graphics of which the Level 5 guys are now masters: the image is always very colorful and clean, although the details are not abundant, and despite the somewhat dull textures the fans of the series will immediately recognize all their favorites, animated and dubbed more than discreetly. The cutscenes linked to the secret techniques of the various players are obviously striking, a truly exhilarating fireworks display that makes every goal a special moment... until you realize that they are the only, true way to send the ball into goal and that you can't skip them even after watching Axel Blaze's Explosive Spin for the 327th time. In short, from a gameplay point of view, we are faced with a decidedly essential product: having abandoned the jRPG/strategic structure of the portable version, in Inazuma Eleven Strikers the various players are directly controlled as in any PES or FIFA, with the difference here the controls are damned imprecise and woody, and just hold down a button to load the special shot of the moment and send the ball into the goal, hoping that the goalkeeper is not able to stop it. If at the beginning it can also be quite fun and intuitive, after a short time each game will lose its bite, and the pyrotechnic cutscenes will become nothing more than a pain in the ass. The team of the heart Inazuma Eleven Strikers also distances itself from the Nintendo DS episodes in another sense, the structure: while the portable iterations were real jRPGs complete with a linear plot and ~battles~, in this Wii edition there is no story or a common thread that links the various matches. In fact, two out of four modes allow you to simply choose a team and face the others, perhaps in a sort of knockout tournament. There isn't much imagination from this point of view, and the poverty of game options isn't saved even by a multiplayer mode that allows up to four friends to play together: there's no shortage of options, it is in fact possible to play all in the same team or divide and challenge each other, but always and strictly on the same screen. An online multiplayer mode would have been very welcome, but Level 5 has preferred to omit it in favor of a single-player mode that allows you to train the various players acquired through a series of crazy mini-games. They are extremely simple activities that do not require the pressing of more than a couple of buttons and which allow us to upgrade our players so that they acquire new special techniques and increase their friendship bonds, which with a little luck and planning leads to the acquisition of devastating combined techniques. The game therefore allows you to shape the various players within certain limits, and is probably the only remaining element of the original jRPG nature of the title. This therefore allows you to create your own personal team, ignoring any narrative discrepancies with the mythology of the series: in this sense, Inazuma Eleven Strikers takes on definitivelyente the form of a real ~game fan service~; it is possible to create the most disparate combinations, modify the uniforms and finally import our team and control it in the other game modes... then meeting all the limits described above. It goes without saying that only the most tenacious will be able to unlock everything or train various versions of the same players before they too get bored permanently.", "date": "2012-10-05", "grade": "6.0"}
