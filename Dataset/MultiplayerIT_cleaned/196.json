Phantasy Star Universe presents itself as a classic action / RPG, in which to clear a large number of dungeons, defeat bosses, collect items and gain experience. Immediacy first of all therefore, so much so that the difficulty is all in all low and it will take a few minutes to properly master the control system, which is also comfortable with the pad. As in any self-respecting role-playing game, during the creation of the character you will have to make some choices of fundamental importance. There are three classes available: the warrior prefers close combat while the ranger uses his great aim to hit the target from a distance and the wizard strikes with powerful offensive spells. Instead, four selectable races which, in addition to humans typically valid in every type of offensive technique, are divided into New Humans, CAST and Beasts, each with unique peculiarities and characteristics. As it is easy to see, the programmers have chosen not to introduce anything new from this point of view and playability pays a heavy price for this reluctance: by now accustomed to titles with infinite combinations, in PSU you end up creating characters that are always similar to each other , facilitating the stages of organizing online parties but flattening the experience beyond acceptable. The fights take place strictly in real time and do not allow breaks even when consulting the menus, thus forcing you to pay close attention, while leaving the player the possibility of selecting some ~quick recall~ keys for the most used objects. There are many weapons available, whether they are pistols or rifles, just as it will take several hours to collect all the cards capable of making us learn new skills and spells. Lonely adventure The single player is made up of a dozen chapters, in turn divided into several missions, which are introduced and concluded by some movies that develop the story, sometimes in a confusing way: unfortunately the variety is almost zero and the only activity will be to eliminate every SEED within range. It is not difficult to imagine how repeating the usual raids for over 30 hours, clashing with the usual enemies, is extremely frustrating and gives the feeling of being in the middle of a farming and grinding oriented Korean MMORPG. The funds obtained from completing each task and from the sale of what is no longer useful can be spent in one of the many shops in the space stations, which together with three planets form the setting for the story. Nothing incredible even from this point of view, given that the purchase of weapons and armor suitable for your level is simply required; in short, a race for the most performing equipment. During the adventure you have the opportunity to meet different characters, some of which will join us and can be taken into battle. In any case, the team members play a marginal role, Ethan being almost always sufficient to unravel even the most complex situations. The experience in single, on balance, turns out to be rather lacking in ideas. The criticisms addressed to the Sonic Team by the gamer community for the paucity of this aspect in the previous chapters have resulted in an increase in longevity only but not in the contents, which are too poor compared to other productions. Phantasy Star saga Although it has never had the same success as sagas of the caliber of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, Phantasy Star has become the best ~roleplaying~ series produced by SEGA, above all thanks to the unusual sci-fi atmosphere. Since 1987, the release date of the first episode for the SEGA Master System, to date, this brand has yielded 21 games for almost all existing platforms, PCs and laptops included. The main curiosity concerns an unauthorized remake of Phantasy Star IV, named Wai Xing Zhan Shi, developed by some Chinese programmers but never really finished and excessively plagued by bugs. One subscription too many Playing Phantasy Star Universe online slightly changes the perspective but not the substance. The multiplayer is designed in such a way as to give users the opportunity to meet in outposts, organize parties of up to six people and venture into a series of instances of increasing difficulty. The few classes available and the proposed not excessive difficulty allow you to enjoy this type of experience even if you don't have a lot of time or don't have extreme level weapons and armor. Unfortunately, even more than in single player, there is a lack of a solid narrative structure that motivates our deeds and that takes away the unpleasant feeling of participating in continuous quants.or unmotivated slaughter of SEED. For the moment there are no live events planned, which would allow users to directly influence some folds of the story and gameplay. The bad news, in a rather opaque panorama, is SEGA's request for the payment of a 10 Euro monthly subscription. A choice that is difficult to understand, given that in reality the PSU is not an MMORPG, not having a persistent world to be managed through a server apparatus, which would require maintenance and therefore costs. Phantasy Star Universe vs. Guild Wars Being online RPGs, both mass-produced and not, products that require heavy investment of time, even before money, the writer has seen fit to make a small comparison between Phantasy Star Universe and another game that is in many ways comparable, Guild Wars by ArenaNet, which now has three stand alone incarnations. The title, like PSU, offers a structure of instances, which can be tackled by small groups of adventurers, eight in this case, and is aimed at players of all kinds, not just hardcore gamers, thanks to a campaign that can be carried out with the help of allied computer-controlled bots. What places GW on a higher level is the vastness of the situations proposed: the quests have various objectives, the development of the character goes through hundreds of different combinations of classes and skills and PvP dynamics have been thought of, totally absent in the subject of this review , truly formidable and always enhanced by tournaments and initiatives of the highest order. If you add the lack of a monthly fee to be paid into ArenaNet's coffers to what has been said, it is easy to get an idea of how far there is between these two exponents of the genre. Eastern origins That Phantasy Star Universe is a game designed and developed in Japan, for the Japanese, it is noticeable from the first minutes: the design of the characters is reminiscent of manga, with exaggerated expressions and some somatic features, above all the eyes, really out of measure . The settings are quite varied, so much so that futuristic scenarios such as those of a space station alternate with the wild nature of planets full of life. Unfortunately, from a purely technical point of view, the quality of the work done leaves something to be desired, as there are few polygons and the color palette is too saturated, annoying in the long run. On the other hand, the sound is very good, which thanks to the orchestral music always suitable for every occasion and the variety of effects, proves to be the sector in which PSU best figures. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium4 1.6 Ghz RAM: 256 Mb Video Card: 3D 64 Mb DirectX 9.0c compatible Disk space: 3.5 Gb Player: DVD-ROM Network interface (for games via LAN or Internet) DirectX compatible sound card 9.0c Broadband internet connection Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium4 2.6 Ghz or equivalent Athlon RAM: 512 Mb Video Card: 3D 128 Mb DirectX 9.0c compatible Broadband internet connection Test configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 Ghz HT RAM: 1 Gb Video Card: NVIDIA 7900 Conclusions Phantasy Star Universe is, in short, a title just above the sufficiency, suitable only for newcomers to the genre and for all those who madly love the series. The contents, both online and in the solo game, are superficial, often barely mentioned or extremely repetitive, too far from those shown by other products already on the market, Guild Wars above all, or close to launch, Hellgate: London to mention the most expected. The absurd monthly fee of 10 euros, requested by SEGA and not justifiable by any service offered, takes care of sinking any ambitions of success. Pros Immediate Excellent sound sector Cons Repetitive and poor in ideas gameplay, both in single and in multiplayer Graphically dated It will cost you 10 euros per month Phantasy Star Universe is available for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. The version used for this review is the PC version. Goals 360 The controversial nature of PSU is also reflected in the objectives to be unlocked for 360. The 1000 points, in fact, are attributed by defeating the bosses of the last level, up to the final showdown and can all be unlocked by playing offline and with a little perseverance. When you think about the meaning of PSO for online gaming on consoles, this makes you think a bit Now 19 years old, the Phantasy Star saga has entered the hearts of many fans, who have been waiting for the release of this latest chapter for too long now. The real turning point came in 2000, when Phantasy Star Online inaugurated role-playing games on the Net dedicated to the home console market, until then anchored to rather rigorous single-player logics. With Universe you are not looking forto any truly relevant innovation, concentrating, rather, on further deepening of the aspects most appreciated by the community of gamers, especially Japanese. The plot is linear and presents many of the classic stereotypes adopted by science fiction literature: four races, after a century of battles, find a not too firm alliance, which will be put to the test by the arrival of monstrous alien creatures called SEED, who will try to conquer the solar system by creating their own reign of terror. In the single-player adventure we will play the young Ethan, who, having separated from his little sister during a battle, enlists in the local army with the double purpose of chasing away the invaders and finding his beloved girl.", "date": "2006-12-27", "grade": null}
