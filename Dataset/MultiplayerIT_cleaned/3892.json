{"name": "GRIS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gris-recensione.html", "text": "Gris' review needs an obligatory premise, because often such titles are unpleasantly misunderstood by many gamers, who attribute all sorts of shortcomings to them starting from baseless expectations. Now, take a square, place it at the bottom of a screen and have it shoot at other squares that attack it from above following very precise patterns. You will have a game of squares shooting against other squares. However, if you replace the lower square with the stylized image of a laser cannon and the upper squares with alien creatures, you will have a clone of Space Invaders and the whole gameplay will take on a completely different meaning. Where before there was nothingness, now there is a minimal representation of space, while what was previously a target practice against elementary geometric shapes has turned into an epic and dramatic battle for the salvation of our planet. The debate about the function of representation in video games began with the medium itself. On the one hand there are those who reduce everything to a simple comparison between the mechanics, i.e. the essence of the video game, and the graphics, i.e. its appearance, as if they were watertight compartments that can be easily removed and are indifferent to the rendering of the work itself. It is a vision that we sincerely consider a little too childish, in the sense that it does not take into account the many theoretical acquisitions on the subject that have taken place over the years. Of course, this makes the analysis easier, but at the same time it impoverishes it (if we want we can consider it as the original sin of the sector press). In particular, it ignores the fact that mechanics and representation contribute to determining the sense of a videogame work, generating very strong and inseparable relationships between the different elements, of which the player may not even be aware, but which are nonetheless present and active in the fruition . aesthetic experience In short, jumping into Super Mario Bros. is not jumping into Mr. Nutz and it's not jumping into GRIS, to come to the subject of our review. If this were not the case, it would be so much better to avoid any form of visual processing and only create squares that do things in virtual spaces devoid of any connotation. As you may have understood from the games mentioned, we are talking about a platform game. More precisely a very easy platform game, which anyone could finish, despite the presence of some environmental puzzles. But GRIS is also one of the most visually beautiful video games, in a strictly stylistic/philosophical sense, ever made, one of the few where the aesthetic awareness of the art direction is fully functional to the gameplay itself. Of hers is an immense watercolor that continually invites us to enter the suffering of the protagonist, whose loss of voice has shattered her world. Our goal, going through the levels is to be able to recolor it, that is, to rebuild it. GRIS is a fairy tale that aims to represent pain in a universal way, dosing visionary and psychoanalytic concepts in equal measure, but without its profound meaning ever overlapping the player's interpretation, left free to determine himself within a playful text with many readings. Inside the fairy tale Played as a simple platform game GRIS disappoints, because it only requires you to solve very simple puzzles without ever putting the player in difficulty. Around the levels there are small spheres of light that allow you to automatically unlock passages (each puzzle requires you to have a certain number of spheres to be solved). Each of the stages offers a new mechanic that adds variety and, used in conjunction with the others, makes the final sections of the game slightly more complicated. Be that as it may, dehydrating everything, the mechanics appear bland and extremely simplified compared to the canons of the genre. In this case, however, it is worth asking yourself whether dying all the time or getting stuck would have been good for a title that lives on its flow. GRIS is not just about jumping, breaking crumbling walls or collaborating with funny little animals that imitate the protagonist's movements. GRIS is a fairy tale in the most Borgesian sense of the term. It is falling into very deep wells finding yourself in other worlds, it is losing touch with the sky to find yourself crawling on the earth, it is watching gigantic silent statues of an unknown nature shatter, it is running along deserts that seem infinite, it is seeing large pieces of scenario come alive by changing the conformation of the levels which in their surreality appear very alive, is to listen to the silence of the gods, now dead and incapable of giving consolation. gRIS is therefore a metaphor for the search for oneself beyond the trauma of existence, expressed through decorations and colours, but it is also the joy of the silent story and the ecstasy and satisfaction of its sublime beauty. In the moment in which the protagonist had to jump on the enemies' heads, establishing a pleasant rhythm of the game, or had to repeat some passages innumerable times, the gameplay and the narrative flow would have been profoundly altered and the whole work would have lost part of the its sense, as well as its beauty, ending up shattered just like the game world itself. In GRIS there is not a single graphic element out of place or superfluous with respect to the objectives of the representation, whose sense of unity is guaranteed precisely by the lack of distractions with respect to the game fabric itself. If we want it is, in a broader sense, also an invitation for gamers to detach themselves from the culture of attention prevailing on the internet and social media, to focus on what matters and is essential. But we admit that this could be an overstatement, so you can take it as such. Finally, allow us to applaud Devolver Digital which, by focusing on a difficult product like GRIS, has once again shown itself to be a courageous publisher, one of the few that continues to value and truly respect the integrity of the products it publishes.", "date": "2018-12-17", "grade": "9.0"}
