{"name": "Naraka: Bladepoint", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naraka-bladepoint-recensione-battle-royale-cina.html", "text": "In the 20th century, a narrative vein called Wuxia was born in China, this genre comparable to Western novels based on the ~swashbuckling~ novels tells the deeds of the so-called martial hero. The one who is placed at the center of the events is an upright character, often of a lower class who pursues a line of justice dictated by an order imposed on him since birth. Justice, defense of the weakest and elimination of oppressors are often what moves his actions. This literary genre has influenced a large part of Chinese cinema, comics and even videogames in recent times. Black Myth: WuKong, but also the recent Sword of Legends Online, are some of the examples that rework the concept of the martial hero of Wuxia in their own key. Naraka: Bladepoint is no different. The 24 Entertainment title tries to mix the elements of this genre with battle royale, going to create a particular variant with unique elements that shows the side of a general feeling that the path taken by the game can be improved over time. However, let's go into the detail of what the playful experience of the title offers in our review of Naraka: Bladepoint. Combat and loot Strategy also plays its part in Naraka: Bladepoint Naraka: Bladepoint, as we were able to tell you during the trial of the forerunner beta, is a hard and pure 60-player battle royale that doesn't try like its other ~cousins~ to insert elements that hybridize it in an important way. The setting is very similar to what was seen in Apex Legends for example. Each hero has his own aesthetic but also practical peculiarities. The gameplay is based on the combat system but also on the skills of the heroes. Each of the 7 usable characters has a minor ability and an ultimate. These abilities clearly have their impact but as with Apex Legends rather than the recent Hunter's: Arena Legends, they are a tool in the player's hand rather than a weapon of mass destruction capable of ending battle in an instant. As we said, therefore, the choice of character influences what you can do in terms of specific skills but not the heart of the playful experience, or the combat system. Since the very beginning, 24 Entertainment's will has been to offer a game capable of offering satisfying fights based entirely on white weapons. The possibility of using weapons from a distance was then inserted to give variety to the clashes and to also offer a greater strategic component. The real key, however, remains close combat. Combat management lies on the mouse keys: the left one for basic attacks, the right one for loaded ones and pressing both for the counterattack. The system is clearly lifted from Chinese paper and works like this: Charge Attacks beat Basic Attacks, Counter Beats Charged Attacks, and Basic Attacks beat Counter. Added to this are the possibility of sprinting, dodging and jumping to avoid enemy attacks and better position yourself in the fight. What is added to this structure is a series of combo attacks that can be performed by pressing different attack sequences and also contextual weapon attacks, some always present and others obtainable from some loot of legendary rarity (i.e. the maximum one). Loot and grappling hook from Naraka: Bladepoint The second lung of the experience is therefore the loot. Like any self-respecting battle royale, collecting the best loot is clearly one of the main objectives in the game to perform at your best and have an advantage over your opponents. The loot is obviously found around the map and will be of different rarities with the usual pattern that progresses in crescendo from common to legendary. You will be able to equip two weapons (even two close range or two ranged weapons, it's up to you to decide), an armor, and then a series of consumables that will make you recover life, shield, but above all they will restore the strength of the weapons. This is in fact another peculiarity of the game. As in the Monster Hunter series for example, even in Naraka the weapons will lose their edge (or will have to be reloaded in the case of those at a distance) and it will be necessary to use an object to restore their effectiveness to maximum. Obviously the higher the rarity, the longer it will take for the wire to run out. The loot also includes obtainable objects that increase your strength and your resistance, but also which add special attacks to some weapons (for example a double shot for the cannon). While these items can be found around the map, the best way to get them is by using the black market. In some areas of the mapin fact you will be able to exchange the coins collected from the loot boxes or from the corpses for specific objects. This obviously favors the complexity and strategy of the action. Finally there is a grappling hook. Naraka: Bladepoint offers the possibility of vertical approaches, but does not encourage the abuse of them. In fact, even the grappling hook has uses linked to a consumable and therefore, even in this case, thrift will make the difference. Personalization and talents The enemies in Naraka: Bladepoint are big and dangerous Beyond what is the main experience of Naraka: Bladepoint, i.e. solo or trio matches, there is a side dish of respectable content. There is talk of customization, a talent system and a Battle Pass. Each hero can be modeled with a full-bodied facial editor and can also be customized from the point of view of skins and accessories. Obviously the first is free while the aesthetic additions are obtained with the classic boxes to be opened and by progressing in profile level. Another way is to use in-game currency obtainable through a daily quest system. The model of Naraka: Bladepoint, also given its non-free to play nature, is very well done and manages to avoid the oppression related to constant payments typical of free titles. There is the option to pay, but it's not essential. Even the Battle Pass is nothing out of the ordinary, a classic free route and a richer paid one that unlocks further rewards for you. Naraka: Bladepoint, here's one of the character menus The talent system, on the other hand, is more original. Once you reach level 3 of the game, you will unlock an additional tab on the menu that will allow you to change some percentages in certain stats of your hero. As you level up your profile you will unlock new slots for the so-called Glyphs and you will therefore be able to insert them in what appears to all intents and purposes a tree of upgrades from a classic role-playing game. These glyphs will modify some statistics (luck in loot, damage absorption, increased damage on the first hit) which will allow you to customize your gaming experience. At the same time, this aspect is the most delicate. The possibility of increasing these percentages with game time (the more you play, the more you unlock) can really create an unbridgeable gap between players if not kept under control by the development team with adequate balancing. Technical and artistic level An assault from above in Naraka: Bladepoint The last element to evaluate is the artistic and technical level of Naraka: Bladepoint. What we found ourselves in front of is a title with a very inspired artistic sector. Morus Island, or the map that acts as a theater for the clashes, is really beautiful, full of well-blended biomes. Abandoned wrecks, temples with a classic oriental flavour, giant statues, luxuriant forests, deadly swamps: the idea is that of a map that includes all tastes and that can offer numerous approaches to the action both horizontally and vertically. From the point of from a technical point of view however, the game is very pleasant to look at, but at the same time full of small stumbles. Partly due to an uninspiring camera when locking enemies and partly a wobbled hitbox in larger encounters, the result is a less than perfect game. Nothing that can't be improved, but in any case there is a lack of refinement of these aspects to underline.", "date": "2021-08-20", "grade": "8.0"}
