Two games certainly ~different~ than those of the original series, but equally pleasant for those enthusiasts who had still been able to find in them their beloved creatures and those atmospheres and settings that had contributed so much to sanctioning the enormous success of the past years series from the mid nineties onwards. Both titles, in fact, were yet another variation in terms of gameplay on the facts and characters of Resident Evil. Specifically, we were faced with products strongly inspired by the classic shooter on rails, those that provide gameplay focused on first-person action and on the presence of a viewfinder with which to aim at the enemies to be eliminated. Even if in the case of the two Capcom games the pointing system of the controller is used to move the viewfinder on the screen instead of that of some lightguns, before firing by pressing the appropriate button. The Resident Evil: Chronicles HD Collection, exclusively for PlayStation 3, is a collection that includes the two games mentioned, however with HD graphics, support for Trophies and PlayStation Move (but it can also be played with the traditional pad, even if you lose a lot of the fun). Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles and Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles are available individually for purchase on the PlayStation Store for 14.99, or as a pair within the aforementioned collection on PlayStation Network for 26.99. The Umbrella Chronicles The first game in the compilation features a pattern that follows a CPU-driven progression through a series of scenarios from Resident Evil Zero, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis plus an unedited final section, with a story told through numerous cutscenes and dialogue between characters. In the shoes of some of the most famous heroes of the saga, such as Chris and Jill, just to name a couple of names, the gamer then relives the salient phases of the episodes mentioned above, and the fight against the powerful multinational and its character viruses above mentioned. If you want also with a friend since it is possible to play in two in local co-op. The game begins after selecting the scenario and a second support weapon in addition to the default pistol, which has infinite bullets, but during the action you can pick up machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades and whatnot to help make things easier to the user. Welcome appearances given that the title always provides not only a certain precision in the shots to kill enemies rather than shooting at random, but also an increasing level of difficulty as you progress. But don't be impressed: in general, a certain practice and restarting the level after a possible and premature game over are enough to face the monsters in a more conscious way, above all because their arrangement and their modus operandi do not change. However, each of the stages to be faced involves killing an unspecified number of zombies and other creatures before reaching the end, where there is usually an annoying boss waiting for the gamer. However, there are moments in which the game tries to vary its gameplay a bit, proposing some crossroads along the way or phases in which the player is asked to press a certain button in time to perform an emergency action or to shake the Move to get rid of an annoying opponent (when you don't have to shake it to reload the weapon in use). About the Sony peripheral it must be said that it performs very well in terms of precision, and every slightest gesture made through her is reproduced precisely on the screen. Especially if used in tandem with the Navigation Controller or with the wireless pad, with which it is possible to change the weapon by moving the directional pad Up or Down or by pressing the L1 button, while with the analog stick you can move the view a bit . However, going back to the game itself, at the end of each stage the user's performance is evaluated on the basis of various elements (destroyed objects, recovered hidden files, etc.) and in relation to these a final grade is assigned, the goodness of which determines the number of stars earned. These rewards can then be spent on upgrading weapons at multiple levels, in order to create a personalized arsenal based on the tastes and style of those whohe's playing. The Darkside Chronicles Of the two titles contained in the collection, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles is also the one that many fans consider to be the most interesting, if only for a matter of aesthetics and greater completeness in terms of the playful offer, especially as regards replayability and longevity. Divided into three campaigns, each of which presents about eight scenarios that make up the game levels and which are respectively inspired by the events narrated in Resident Evil 2, in Resident Evil Code Veronica and, finally, by an unpublished ~episode~ set in a remote village in South America, starring Leon and Jack Krauser engaged in the search for a mysterious man connected to the ubiquitous Umbrella Corporation, the title is more durable and replayable than its predecessor. For the rest, however, The Darkside Chronicles is similar to The Umbrella Chronicles, with the player (or with ~the players~ if playing together with a friend) engaged in tackling the various stages proposed in sequence in order to knock down dozens of zombies and creatures of all kinds, unlock all the secrets and collect the money necessary to upgrade the weapons, which here are always higher in number and quality than in the previous game. At the end of each level it is in fact possible to spend the money obtained to increase the statistics of each firearm in various aspects such as power, reload speed and so on, with actual results on the battlefield. All these elements make Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles an extremely enjoyable experience, even if there are some flaws, such as the dynamic movements of the camera which, while being pleasant to look at from the point of view of pure entertainment, sometimes tend to become annoying in some stages of the game. Or the fact that the analog stick of the Navigation Controller or the wireless pad that in The Umbrella Chronicles is used to glance around in the few calm moments of the adventure, here is used to select the weapon, which is initially unsettling and leads the gamer to make some mistakes if he played the aforementioned title first. But still nothing ~serious~ or that can't be resolved after a couple of games. Playstation 3 trophies Resident Evil: Chronicles HD Collection features twenty-four Trophies equally divided into pairs of twelve for each of the two games featured in the compilation. So both Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles and Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles offer the player the following rewards: 7 Bronze, 4 Silver, and 1 Gold. The two platinum ones are missing. To obtain the Trophies you simply need to progress in the adventure and satisfy some requests based on the title played, such as completing a secret stage or bringing weapon upgrades to the maximum level. Technical realization We conclude by taking a look at the technical realization of the product. From what has been described so far, it will be clear to gamers who have already tasted the emotions offered by the two titles it contains, that the Resident Evil: Chronicles HD Collection offers nothing or almost nothing particularly innovative or different from what was originally seen on Nintendo Wii. The only additions compared to the versions available on the latter console actually concern the presence, on PlayStation 3, of online rankings where you can compare your scores with those of other players, and, as already mentioned at the beginning, the addition of Trophies, Move support and a graphical upgrade due to the high definition remastering of the two games. In this sense, graphically, a miracle was certainly not expected considering the type of product and the platform of origin (less powerful than PlayStation 3, although still valid), and the forecasts have been confirmed. As in the best (or worst, depending on your point of view) tradition of high definition remastered products that have often been placed on the market for some time now, the characters and scenarios of the two Capcom games have been reproduced faithfully but without any particular improvements. Of course, the image appears sharper and therefore better defined, the colors are more vivid and in general the overall vision has gained from the transposition of the two products in HD, but certainly the textures remain the original ones, not very complex and quite anonymous , the polygonal models of the characters are certainly not a miracle, even if they are pleasant to look at, and a certain video granularity remains in the various videos. Better, in this sense, the impact returned by The Darkside Chronicles. The improvements over The Umbrella Chronicles are evident, and concern almost every aspect visible on the screen, from polygonal models to animations that appear more fluid and varied, but the scenarios also boast great care, both as regards the complexity of the structures and the amount of details present . Finally, the audio sector is good with the typical sound effects of the saga to dominate, and with a discreet dubbing in English, accompanied by a good soundtrack, to complete the offer.", "date": "2012-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
