Combining roguelike mechanics with the possibilities offered by Ubisoft's free roaming. That is, if you die, you start from scratch with everything to be redone. Intriguing, right? Obviously there is not only this. The first thing that catches the eye is the time limit, we have thirty minutes to get to the extraction point. But what to do, in half an hour? We may spend our time on a variety of small-scale activities such as liberating outposts and hostages or simply trying to improve our karma. The beauty is that all this serves not only to gain additional time but also (and above all) to gain experience, thus unlocking the skills of the two branches. With each new test, the world ~resets~ itself, while our experience remains, like the weapon we are holding at the moment of our death. So figured out how this Escape from Durgesh works? Interesting on paper, this DLC of Far Cry 4, but not really something essential What to do, then? We can therefore give ourselves to ~extreme grinding~ to get very pumped up to the final challenge before the extraction, always doing the same things again, even if as per the textbook in a thousand different ways, or maybe immediately try the impossible challenge of bringing home the DLC in the first jokes armed only with machetes or if we are lucky with an assault rifle with a few shots? Definitely the first hypothesis since in fact every checkpoint is manned by armored soldiers armed with heavy machine guns. The idea is therefore not wrong at all, but on balance, more than a real DLC that should add new content, it is simply a ~challenge~, more suitable for an extra mode than for something more original and fundamentally new , all then for 9.99 euros. Unfortunately, Far Cry 4's exploration, discovery and growth mechanics, which explode in a context of total freedom, are here far too entangled in a continuous ~trial and error~, far too tedious, only useful for reaching a minimum quota of minutes for DLCs. What is the pleasure of building and rebuilding outposts to earn an extra five minutes to maybe have more time to go hunting, to have more weapons, explosives or to collect flowers to build precious syringes? The total randomness of roguelikes is only hinted at here given that missions and outposts are always the same as a result the gaming experience varies only as our arsenal and progression vary. Obviously it's up to us to decide when (and if) to face them and how to face them, but in the long run the procedure is simply not very exciting and not really interesting, it being understood that for all those who have considered Far Cry 4 too easy, here is their bread and butter teeth, at least until you are a practically invincible soldier. Reinforcements arrive immediately, there are mortars generously placed around the map, in short, you die a lot and dying all the time because the game practically imposes it is not exactly the best. We could say that this Escape from Durgesh is a sort of Bignami of Far Cry 4, effective in compacting the best (and worst) of the game's gameplay, but definitely with too little substance to be recommended. In theory we could build such a DLC ourselves, for example forcing ourselves to try the outposts only with throwing knives, without alerting anyone and so on. In fact, game after game Escape from Durgesh becomes more and more similar to a normal trip to Kyrat and not even without the added value of a new area to explore, new weapons or new enemies. In short, a decidedly forgettable extra content.", "date": "2015-01-16", "grade": null}
