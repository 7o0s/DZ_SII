There was a period in which everyone tried to repeat Blizzard's success, launching more or less marked clones on the market that differed just in some detail or in the setting, rarely managing to create a base of passionate users. The mechanics of MMOs are now seen and reviewed, the questing, however hidden it may be under layers and layers of narration, is always the same, as is the development of the character, equipment and activities in the endgame. Black Desert Online was born with the success of the first Lineage in mind, but at a certain point in its development the team decided to take a different path, which transformed the game into something more than the classic MMO where you have to kill something and make something else every now and then. The reason why many are intrigued by Black Desert Online probably lies in its vastness, in the fact that even after many hours you can discover details and nuances that we ignored. However, no matter how innovative and interesting you are, this does not automatically mean that it is done well. At the moment the game for us Europeans is available in two ~buy and play~ versions, therefore without a subscription, but it cannot count on the same implementations as the eastern servers, although the team is working hard to fill the gap. Here is our review of the interesting MMO Black Desert Online! Classes and heroes In Black Desert Online there are six classes, equally divided between melee, caster and ranged characters. The number is less than those we can find in the eastern version at the moment. For some of these we will not be able to choose the gender of our character. For example, a Ranger will always be a vaguely elven-looking woman while a Berserk will always be a male with almost bestial traits. Once we have decided on the class, we will be able to dedicate ourselves to the appearance of our avatar, an activity which, given the hundreds of possibilities regarding facial features, hair, make-up, body size and tattoos, can easily take us an hour. Once we've found the perfect combination, we'll wake up in the game, accompanied by a dark spirit with a particularly annoying voice, who will guide us through the rudiments of the game. What we will soon discover is that Black Desert Online, unlike many MMOs, is only partially based on killing something or someone. Its sandbox nature will often lead us to establish trade routes, to keep a business going and above all to explore. This last activity is undoubtedly one of the most pleasant, given the incredible beauty of the world that spreads out before our eyes, a low-fantasy world that recalls a more cheerful and kinder version of medieval Europe, where instead of a decoy dealer there is a species of anthropomorphic otter and our master swordsman sports branching antlers worthy of a moose. Thanks to particularly successful ambient lighting, sunrises and sunsets nourish our gaze with luxuriant and bucolic panoramas, made up of vineyards, waterways, mountains and meadows in bloom, which act as a counterpoint to the city architecture, the castles perched on the hills and placid fishing villages. Unlike many fantasy MMOs, Black Desert Online doesn't try to amaze us with absurd and fairy-tale architectures, but with the solidity of a possible world, a bit like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Of course, all of this comes at a price in terms of performance. Many components of the scenario will suddenly appear on the horizon, a particularly annoying flaw in larger cities and the optimization of the game is not such as to allow the constant 60 frames per second, especially in the most crowded areas, as long as you don't have in your hands a really very powerful computer. Fortunately there are so many things you can do that in the long run you tend to ignore these small flaws, but if you plan to spend many hours on this game, try to have a PC that is adequate for the needs. The common good One of the most interesting features of Black Desert Online is the Contribution Point system, which is nothing more than one of the many ways in which we can grow our character in a way that is unrelated to the simple accumulation of experience points. Instead of giving us experience, some quests will give us these CPs, which symbolize our contribution to the community and which we can use to rent quality equipment, buy properties of various types, such as a farm, or unlock nodes for trade routes or not.strict production chains. In fact, the game has a very articulated crafting structure, which allows us to set up a real business, hiring non-player characters to trade or collect raw materials on our behalf. Obviously we can also do it in person, but as you can well imagine it is one of the most boring parts of the game, which instead through these authorized bots is transformed into a sort of management system, a miniature Civilization in which we have to organize our resources and make them thrive. Black Desert Online is a title that doesn't like to waste too much time for its users, the years in which we had to look for quests are over: every time we are assigned a mission, just press a button and the character will go there alone, a decision which allows you to streamline the questing phase a little and make the inevitable return to the city less tedious. On the other hand, the game is full of details that aim to make it more realistic: everything has weight, even money, all our possessions have a maintenance cost, the banks are divided into zones and fast travel is not immediate. At least removing the task of having to take the longest walks personally is a necessary concession for us to fully enjoy the thousand activities of the game. A cascade of information Living in the world of Black Desert Online is a bit of a strange experience for those used to classic MMOs: the main story is quite trivial and after the initial tutorial you will feel the desire to explore the world as you prefer and the game will obviously leave it to you Do. If you are looking for a guided experience that takes you to the level cap, you are not in the right place, if instead you like the idea of a sort of great management in which to be a brewer who occasionally dedicates himself to killing monsters then you are in the place Right. With a little organization, Black Desert Online will become a faithful companion to your desktop; maybe you won't play it all day, but you'll keep it in the background just to occasionally check how the trades are going, if your character has replenished the inventory after hours of fishing and so on. The great thing about professions is that they evolve as we get better at it. A fisherman will be able to buy ever larger boats, traders can switch from mules to carts and the same goes for horse breeders, blacksmiths, direct farmers, with a level of complexity such that our sowing will react differently based on to the region we are in. The problem with this enormous amount of activity, data, possibilities and nuances is that, as often happens in MMOs, the baggage of information necessary to appreciate the game is poured on the player like a water balloon of fragmented notions that risk getting lost in the heat of the first hours of play. Imagine a math lesson that goes from simple operations to algorithms in less than an hour and you'll have an idea of the knowledge we'll have to assimilate, often translated into an unconvincing English. This decision risks confusing players who are less patient or accustomed to the game, especially since Black Desert Online may seem like the classic MMO, but it plays very differently. After years of World of Warcraft and its successors, our first few hours of playing the game were decidedly confusing, until we realized we were dealing with something completely different. His non-linear approach risks putting the player in front of concepts and ideas that he would have to face only later, creating a continuous confusion on how to spend one's time profitably. To return to the scholastic comparison, it is as if a teacher gave us the freedom to learn what we want, without telling us that we must study ancient Greece before modern philosophers. Triple Hit Combos! Fishing, farming, crafting, trading, all very nice, but in Black Desert Online you also have to kill the usual barrage of enemy creatures, otherwise what MMO would it be? If you like the classic ~I press a few keys with minimal effort~ combat system you will be disappointed (even if you can use it) but if you are tired of all this and looking for a more lively system then you are in the right place. The mechanics of the clashes are designed to mix mouse clicks and keys, in combos and chains which, all in all, could also be played with the pad, even when we use characters who fight from a distance. The only problem is that the combinations are mapped trying to exploit the least number of keys, so in the fury of the clashes there is the risk of confusing ~key + click~ with ~click + key~ with all the risks that can ensue. To tell the truth, some keys were wrongor it's not a big drama, because Black Desert Online's mobs are probably the least dangerous in the entire history of MMOs. Also in this case we need to free ourselves from preconceptions and see things differently: the most satisfying way to deal with them is not one by one, as we have all learned to do, but to attract at least a dozen and take them for a walk while we unleash our power of fire. A little less RPG and a little more musou or Diablo. Unfortunately following the main quest the Korean soul of Black Desert Online comes out, the one most linked to the grind, to the killing of hundreds of identical enemies and to tasks without great variety which unfortunately remains essential to increase the level of our character. Luckily experience increases when fighting in groups, so by participating in guild activities you can level up quite easily. Unfortunately, if PvE, dungeons and raids are your bread, you will be very disappointed with the endgame of Black Desert Online. Except for some particularly interesting world bosses, there are no instanced areas to deal with with your guild, so all the activities for higher-level players are poured into PvP. In theory, the various guilds can participate in sieges and challenge their opponents to claim their dominion over certain territories, but at the moment we have not been able to test the effectiveness of the system. Both because we are simply not able to compete yet (forgive us, but with all that beer to produce there isn't always time to fight) and because the system has not yet been implemented on the servers at our disposal. For the moment, therefore, we are faced with a great unknown factor, because without the intrigue and challenge fueled by the continuous clashes and formation of different alliances, sooner or later the players risk feeling that they have reached the maximum, even with all the amount of side activities that Black Desert Online makes available.", "date": "2016-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
