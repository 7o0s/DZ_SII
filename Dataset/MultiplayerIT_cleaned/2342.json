{"name": "NHL 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2002_a.html", "text": "WARN YOUR NEIGHBORS After the classic, but a bit short, introduction in CG, we find ourselves catapulted into the introductory menu, where, surprise of surprises and wonder of wonders, a black writing on a red background is the host. If in addition to being expert gamers you are also a lover of technology in general, you should already have understood. Well yes, for the first time ever a title on PS2 uses DTS technology in game!! In fact, never before had something been seen running that had digital audio quality and at the same time used 5.1 sound in active game phases. It must be said that EA had already announced this novelty for some time, even if it is not possible to understand the strange and certainly self-defeating choice not to report anything on the CD packaging, where only the presence of the not very current Dolby Surround. Although it may seem irrelevant to many who do not have a system that can exploit these audio capabilities, it must be emphasized that this is one of the most important steps in videogame entertainment towards its perfection. It's a great feeling to literally feel ~surrounded~ by what happens during and before matches: the roar of the crowd, the muffled sound of the clubs hitting the puck, the excellent interlude music, the good commentary (in English). Everything, absolutely everything, masterfully divided between the five speakers (plus the subwoofer) used by the increasingly popular Home Theater systems. To be honest, on balance this will be the most important new component compared to NHL 2001. But let's go on. The latest production of EA Sport is in fact also characterized by a splendid graphic design. Polygonal athletes, to begin with, show an almost palpable solidity. The use of motion capture is excellent and the contrasts are absolutely realistic. Every detail has been studied in a precise way, from the eyes to the lips, up to the hair: even the facial animations and faces in general seem to have improved. Even the team shirts are very detailed, as are the stadiums, the billboards; in short, every object in the game is very close to photorealism. Another thing to definitely praise is the television-style direction chosen to direct the broadcasting of the matches: particular shots (the wonderful ones from inside the goal in the replays and the new Breakaway Cam in case of a solitary counterattack) and interludes in computer graphics emphasize perfectly goals, uncourteous exchanges between players, discussions with the referee, and going in and out of the locker room. The only detail that disappoints a bit is the audience, as, despite being polygonal in a small part, it is mostly made up of figures flattened like sheets of paper, without having any thickness. LIKE BEFORE MORE THAN BEFORE The most obvious corrections made by programmers to this title are undoubtedly two. First of all, there was a skilful revision of the game engine, which in the previous edition was afflicted by frequent slowdowns that occurred every time a large number of athletes were displayed on the screen. No uncertainty of the frame rate now seems to accompany the matches, not even in moments of crowding on the ice, and not even using the widest views. The second fix concerns the tweaking of the management system for shots and passes. In fact, to serve a partner it will no longer be sufficient to press the X key, but it will also be necessary to calibrate the direction of the support more carefully. The same goes for shooting, as it can now be directed with greater precision. Thanks to these two small but still essential filings, NHL 2002 can therefore count on an almost perfect gameplay. In addition to the possibility of participating in various types of competition, we will be able to select our team from an immense repertoire of formations, including both the clubs of the American Hockey League and all the national teams. It only takes a few minutes to understand that this NHL retains the brilliance of its predecessors intact, now highlighted by a more satisfying control, and undoubtedly destined to make any ice hockey fan happy. It's fast, fun and spectacular. The clashes are many and well represented. The players' response to our commands is faithful and immediate. The artificial intelligence then stands at good levels, for this to be a sports simulation. GIVE YOURSELF TO THE HOCKEY Long-lived, extremely accurate, with a great atmosphere, immediate playability, and as if that weren't enough ~seasoned~ by the innovative interactive DTS audio, NHL 2002 stands as a certain benchmark for any future simulation of this sport. The fact is, however, that whoever bought the previous version at the time could, by buying this CD, find himself in his hands an excellent title, but broadly very similar to the one he already owns. For all the others, the advice is to give, at least, a dutiful look at one of the best audio-video productions made so far on Playstation 2. Pros: finally the interactive DTS! great graphics and atmosphere improved controls all the teams and players of the NHL Cons: could bore those who are not hockey fans manual management of replays a bit awkward only two good views to play too similar to the 2001 version THE WOLF LOSES THE HAIR BUT NOT THE VICE Many manufacturers have ventured into the development of games that represent ice hockey in all the splendid frenzy that few sports like this can convey. However, none has managed to match the levels of excellence achieved by the Electronic Arts series. The last chapter, in chronological order, churned out by Canadian programmers could only be called NHL 2002. Unfortunately, however, the flaw that unworthily accompanies each release of a new version of it seems to recur, certainly this time in a less evident way, even in this title. Let's talk about the fact that EA hardly tends to differentiate and innovate the series of video games it develops at the rate of one a year; in fact, even the modifications present in this CD are not exactly such and so many as to justify another expense by those who already own the 2001 edition. Naturally this does not mean that those who are not part of the aforementioned group cannot fully appreciate the excellent features of what, despite everything, is the best hockey simulation on the market.", "date": "2001-11-28", "grade": null}
