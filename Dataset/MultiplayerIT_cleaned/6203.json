However, five years are an eternity from a technological point of view, memories can be better than reality and it is often better to leave them as they are, rather than discovering the bitter truth of a title that has not stood the test of time. Surely the sensitivity on this aspect varies from person to person, and not everyone has played it at the time, either for having owned different platforms, for lack of time, or - too often we forget it - for lack of budget. The remastered have the advantage of transporting these productions to current systems, updated at least from the point of view of fluidity and resolution and, net of conspiracies and marketing strategies that can invalidate the development of completely unpublished titles, are addressed precisely to the categories of above, often at a price that makes them even more competitive. Those who have already played the original title are right not to spend any more money, unless it was exceptional for them; those who haven't done it have one more chance, the important thing is that they are ready to ~deal with~ a technical component that is not necessarily of the very first hair and a gameplay that inevitably may have some sign of slowing down. In writing this review we had many doubts about how to evaluate the Remastered version of God of War III, doubts that have arisen on the final vote and on some considerations that we share with you. The title is offered at a price of around 40 Euros and is clearly aimed at those who have not played it on PlayStation 3. It has a strong narrative component and begins exactly where the second chapter ends... so why not convert the two previous ones, albeit even more aged from a technical and gameplay point of view? Also since, speaking of the latter, apart from extraordinary cases such as Bayonetta 2, the genre has not undergone major evolutions or upheavals and the God of War series has always shone for involvement rather than technicalities, pad in hand, aspects in which can be said to have aged the most. Among other things, technically the remastering work was quite basic, almost automatically exploiting the increased computing power of the PlayStation 4. Let it be clear that, once these premises have been treasured, God of War III still remains today a very important title in the panorama of action adventure. We tried God of War III Remastered on PlayStation 4, and here's our verdict War of mythological proportions The story of Kratos is centered on remorse, the tireless suffering of the protagonist and revenge against the whole Olympus, with a multitude of nuances that can only be grasped having played the other titles in the saga. His figure is complex, multifaceted and therefore charismatic, he does not know mercy, he is willing to do anything to achieve his goal and he will not rest until I have completed it. The advice is to at least read the background of this third chapter, which represent a big plus because the developers have drawn heavily from Greek mythology, reinterpreting the role of each character as appropriate and tying it perfectly with that of Kratos, for a result full of twists and memorable moments, two of the factors that have strongly contributed to the success of the saga. Elements sublimated precisely by this third chapter, whose initial part can be defined as one of the most exciting ever experienced in a video game: Kratos is found on the back of the Titan Gaia while he is climbing Olympus, accompanied by the other giants intent on recovering what was taken away afterwards the Great War. However, Zeus still has many allies among its ranks: Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, Elio and others, united for a battle that promises to be epic and with no holds barred. In this first hour of the game, the developers indulged themselves by proposing a simply exceptional fight against Poseidon, which develops several times with an exhilarating visual and emotional impact, to the point that the first phase of relative calm allows you to recover from what you experienced previously . The automatic positioning (and only such) of the camera also contributes to the effect, if we want a little anachronistic but counterbalanced by an exemplary direction, able to always offerthe best glimpse and to give away a series of postcard shots. It is absolutely true that nowadays it is natural to think of having full control of the camera for aesthetic and functional needs, but we do not feel like seeing this characteristic of the saga as a defect; rather as an element that is starting to feel the weight of the years and that at least deserves a hybrid behavior, ala Uncharted to be clear. Having said that, God of War III thrives on grievous events and inevitably makes more in these situations, putting on the plate battles that are never trivial in terms of spectacularity, complex in their pace and which really demonstrate how the developers have made the maximum effort with this third chapter in terms of imaginary and characters with whom you interact, to the point that it is hard to imagine how a possible fourth chapter can offer antagonists and events of equal caliber. As for the actual gameplay, ~fortunately~ there is still much that can be improved, since the Santa Monica game rests its foundations on an appreciated formula (at the service of brutality and spectacularity) but not particularly developed in terms of challenge and skill required, although in this third chapter the puzzle sections are better thought out and airy, especially in the second part, while the classic combat scheme offers some variations on the theme. Playstation 4 trophies God of War III Remastered trophies are essentially identical to their PlayStation 3 counterparts, but add to your gamertag and therefore there is no risk for platinum collectors of being ~cheated~. The total is 36 trophies of which 18 are secrets related to the story and the bosses. The others are obtained by completing the game, performing a 1000 move combo (!), upgrading weapons and completing some of the extras. Those who want to try to get Platinum by completing the game only once, must immediately select the highest difficulty level among those initially available. From Game to Remaster Weapons and spells now move in symbiosis with each other, in fact, each weapon obtained is associated with the digital cross, which in turn brings with it a different spell, which can be activated immediately with the R2 key. For example, the blades supplied to Kratos have the phalanx of Sparta, the claws of Hades can release souls of various kinds that attack enemies and so on, and the beauty is that each weapon is indicated for different types of enemies or to have the better of some objects, which leads to vary their use depending on the situation, leaving you free to manage them according to your preference towards one or the other. This great interoperability is also reinforced by the fact that all weapons can be changed ~on the fly~, using the aforementioned digital cross or with the L1 + X combination, which allows you to not interrupt the combos while attacking enemies. Other moves in Kratos' repertoire include a claw grip to headbutt, the ability to ride some enemies to take advantage of their increased attack power, or use others as a shield and run wildly to overwhelm anything, also because the scale of fights has increased compared to the past, and it is also possible to face dozens of enemies on the screen at the same time. To make everything even more dynamic and fluid, in addition to dodging, counterattacks and so on, this third chapter introduces a third energy bar, dedicated to the use of objects that the main protagonist acquires during the adventure. For example, we have the bow, which can incinerate enemies and elements of the scenario that block the way, and then move on to the boots of Hermes that allow you to throw enemies into the air with acceleration while running and reach otherwise inaccessible high places. The quick time events, of which God of War was one of the major supporters after Shenmue, are obviously present and dedicated to the final killing of the bosses and rather difficult opponents, they accompany as always bloody and spectacular actions and also in this case they are have been slightly modified, as the front keys of the pad appear on the four sides of the screen, leaving the focus fully on what is happening. After five years everything remains fun and engaging in the moments in which the game puts bosses and important events on the track, it is also undoubtedly that the greater inclination towards the spectacular rather than the skill with the pad shows some sign of yielding, because the desire to know what happens next takes over the pure pleasure of playing. The extras (described in the appropriate box) are identical to the original title menthree longevity is between nine and ten hours the first time you complete the game; in short, God of War III remains a title of undoubted quality, but it lacks the freshness it could have had five years ago. Let's go back to the present day with the analysis closely linked to this Remastered, starting from the control system: the control scheme has been little adapted to the DualShock 4 nor can it be modified, even if thanks to the less sensitive triggers there is no problem activating the spells with R2 when unwanted; with Start you access the upgrades for weapons and objects thanks to the souls collected following the killings, with the touch pad at the bottom right you get to the options, at the bottom left to the photo mode. The latter - you can appreciate the photos we took in this article - allows you to manage the camera zoom, the glare, the brightness, the filters with their degree of intensity and the frames, for a level of customization lower than other titles such as The Last of Us, but which still allows you to obtain excellent results thanks to the remarkable visual impact that the game still manages to give today. Not for particular merits of this reissue, however: God of War III Remastered runs at 1080p and 60 frames per second, with visibly more defined textures and some more refined post processing effects. Operation that allows you to enjoy a fluid, clean title with excellent response to commands, but with a work that represents the minimum wage compared to the original for PlayStation 3, also affected by the fact that the movies remain anchored to thirty frames per second with the same compression as in 2010, denoting a difference, for the worse, compared to the sequences shown directly with the game's graphics engine. Luckily therefore that God of War III Remastered benefits from a base that was exceptional at the time, with a high production value. We're talking about an important polygonal mass, very varied and detailed settings, a quantity of enemies and objects on the screen that contribute to making the action spectacular. If we add an impeccable and fascinating artistic realization, made up of color-saturated landscapes, a good stroke (accompanied by a rather good anti-aliasing) and a clearly uncommon design of enemies and structures, we have a package that is still very valid today. In short, there are several titles developed for the current generation of consoles that pay tribute to God of War III Remastered, and this is a credit to the production of Santa Monica, but also a demerit for the others who have failed to do better with five more years on the back. Game extras The extras of God of War III Remastered seemed similar to those of the original title and are accessed, with the exception of a part of the making of also available with Italian subtitles, following the first completion of the adventure. It starts from the classic additional difficulty level, up to the possibility of tackling the game again with the hidden objects that are scattered around the settings and which allow you to enable infinite energy, increase the damage inflicted and suffered, access the final combos and so on , bearing in mind however that in this case the trophies are deactivated. Then we have the Challenges mode, which offers several clashes with some specific rules and finally the combat arena, which is unlocked after successfully completing the first mode. Last but not least, there is the possibility of viewing the videos of the game, which unfortunately are identical to the originals, as written in the body of the review.", "date": "2015-07-14", "grade": "8.5"}
