It has already happened in this 2015 with Avengers: Age of Ultron, it is about to happen again in these hours with the renewal of the collaboration between the two companies thanks to Ant-Man Pinball, the new downloadable table for Pinball FX 2 and Zen Pinball 2. After the welcome interlude of Portal Pinball, Zen Studios has in fact decided to take advantage of the release of Ant-Man in American cinemas to further increase the count of pinball machines dedicated to the Marvel universe: even if here in Italy we will have to wait a little longer before being able to see the film with Paul Rudd, the additional content also arrived for us in the game with the usual formula, which sees the possibility of purchasing it individually for the price of 2.99 euros. As usual, we didn't miss the opportunity to become little ants too with Ant-Man Pinball, to see if it's worth buying or not. Don't let the ant size fool you - Ant-Man Pinball is a lot of fun! Pinball FX 2 or Zen Pinball 2? On the last few occasions we've talked about this game, we've always done it under the name Pinball FX 2: finding yourself faced with a different title could therefore confuse those unfamiliar with Zen Studios' pinball machines. This is actually the same game, called Pinball FX 2 on PC and Xbox, while on the Sony ecosystem it can be found as Zen Pinball 2. Previous table reviews were done after receiving a Steam code, while Ant -Man Pinball has been tested on PlayStation 4 - hence the prevalent use of the name Zen Pinball 2 in this article. The littlest hero... The Marvel-branded Zen Pinball 2 tables see the reproduction of the powers of the various superheroes called into question, revisited in view of the type of game in question: we imagine that thinking of something for Ant-Man wasn't very simple, given that the the main ability of the ant-man is to shrink down to a very small size. Compared to pinball machines in the real world, however, the developers can count on the infinite possibilities opened up by the virtual world: in this specific case, the idea was to place the so-called particle ball at the center of Ant-Man Pinball, a large sphere to be hit get points, but not only. In fact, shot after shot, its size continues to be reduced, until it can be used in a special multiball mode, where the blue ball becomes a pinball machine ball to be hit with the classic flippers. A Zen Studios table would not be such if it did not include the whole series of mini-games to which we are now accustomed, to create which, also in this case, the possibility of resorting to technology was exploited to go beyond the laws of physics that dominate the tables Cafe. Thus we find a series of very inspired modes, in which for example you have to shoot certain elements on the pinball machine, fight Yellowjacket or save little Cassie, daughter of Scott Lang, or Ant-Man. In this case, the ball ends up in a subsection of the table, within which the player must move the area left and right to get the ball into the hole at the top. ...for a large table From the point of view of design, in Ant-Man Pinball you notice from the first glance a certain breadth of play, dictated by a reduced amount of elements present on the screen: the comparison becomes particularly evident if you compare this pinball machine to the one dedicated to South Park, just to give an example. In practical terms, all this translates into a game that often goes towards the top of the table, where it is no coincidence that the particle ball is found, which certainly represents the greatest attraction. The way the ramps were built offers a flow of action that is never too frenetic, as you still need to stop and think if you want to unlock all the elements that Ant-Man Pinball has to offer: many elements come out after a few games, thus making a real exploration phase necessary to get to know the table properly before successfully launching towards the points record. The only flaw we found concerns the secondary flap located at the top of the screen: it seemed a bit too difficult to hit the ball to make a valid shot, but it's really about wanting to nitpick in something that however can be mastered with a little training. Ant-Man Pinball also confirms Zen Studios' attitude in the aesthetic field, putting decorations in the middleand little gems that the player can discover with pleasure little by little, all this dominated by the constant presence of the pairing of characters that we will also get to know in the film: Scott Lang, inevitably portrayed in his Ant-Man costume, and Hank Pym, played in the film by Michael Douglas. The sound is also good, accompanied by music that perfectly matches the genre of Ant-Man. Ultimately, this new pinball machine is a valid alternative not only for those who love the Marvel character we will be hearing about in the coming weeks, but also for those who want to continue to dabble with the ideas of Zen Studios, whose members have now become masters of this ageless pastime.", "date": "2015-07-20", "grade": null}
