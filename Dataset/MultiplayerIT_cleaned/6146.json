Made by the famous Croatian software house Croteam, known in particular for the work conducted on the Serious Sam saga, the game has had a very good response from the critics - here is our review - and on the market, prompting the developers to expand the universe with a new piece that deepens some aspects of the plot, shaped again in collaboration with the programmer and philosopher Tom Jubert and the visionary game designer Jonas Kyratzes. We have traveled the ~Road to Gehenna~ with passion and passion, and we can confirm right now that it is a new, memorable experience. Here because. The brilliant puzzles of The Talos Principle embrace new metaphysical concepts The sky in a room Although it is a truly existing physical place, i.e. a valley close to Mount Zion in Jerusalem, Israel, the Gehenna (or Gehenna) mentioned in the title of the expansion refers to the biblical term, synonymous with Hell in the New Testament and ~heap garbage~ in the Old one. In a nutshell, a place that is anything but welcoming, and in fact in the game it represents a sort of prison where the ~children~ who in one way or another have offended Elohim, the ~divinity~ with a thundering voice, are confined protagonist of the original game. The events narrated in Road to Gehenna are parallel to those narrated in The Talos Principle, and the whole plot revolves around the liberation of the aforementioned consciences (and knowledge) in the form of androids. The practical purpose of the player, who plays the messenger of Elohim Uriel, is to enter the heart of the metaphorical prison and solve the various logical puzzles. Having completed The Talos Principle is an indispensable condition to fully enjoy the fascinating plot, whose metaphysical concepts, linked to the end of the world and the act of preserving knowledge, in Road to Gehenna are addressed by interacting with the group of ~outcasts~ who has created a sort of virtual society, fed thanks to a bizarre forum to be consulted through the inevitable and ancient terminals. There are really a lot of texts and in the expansion they play an even more significant role from a playful point of view, given that in addition to the usual stories and philosophical tests that are proposed from time to time, you come across real textual adventures, with lots of of items to collect and bosses to face. The game encourages you to constantly reflect on the theme of true freedom, which is also addressed by going through the famous ~Prisoner's Dilemma~ and making references to myths such as that of Atlantis. The dense network of discussions in the forum, sometimes seasoned with ironic elements, unfolds by freeing the various androids one by one, and each of them has its own vision of the work of the ~savior~ Uriel. By overcoming text adventures or some quizzes, you raise your profile within the forum, thus being able to access exclusive discussions and interact with the most authoritative figures who manage the contents. There is always a solution From a purely playful and technical point of view we are faced with the classic ~more of the same~, given that the basic mechanics and the settings are practically the same as The Talos Principle. Among other things, no new tools have been introduced to solve the puzzles, and the expert player will immediately find himself at ease with the logical dynamics to be implemented. The difficulty of the new puzzles introduced, around twenty, apart from a few upward peaks, is comparable to that perceived in the second half of the main adventure, while the only substantial difference we have noticed is in the extension of some maps. Some puzzles are set in such large arenas that it can be difficult to know if you have all the objects useful for completing them under control, a detail amplified by the total lack of indications. The tools to overcome the individual rooms are the usual laser connectors, cubes, fans, jammers and so on, however, thanks to the experience, the developers have literally indulged themselves with daring solutions in level design. The Crater level, for example, offers a huge arena in the center of the Egyptian hub with a series of barriers to overcome in sequence; Haircut is contained in size but offers a spectacular structureself-propelled in the center of the map, while Harmony requires great ingenuity to complete and offers an interesting strategic novelty. The new levels, which can be completed in a few hours of play, have overall a brilliant design and offer great satisfaction when you manage to find the keystone to overcome them. There are also secrets, quotes and bonus puzzles (indicated by stars) that are very difficult to complete. From a technical point of view, as specified, the setting is the same as Elohim's ~Garden of Eden~, where classical elements such as the Greco-Roman ruins blend with marvelous rural landscapes and futuristic elements such as computers, the same androids and all the tools related to solving puzzles, in an ingenious recipe to support the plot. We remind you that at the moment the Italian subtitles for the expansion are not yet available, even considering that those introduced at the launch of The Talos Principle were anything but satisfying, unable to convey the same expressive force as the original English texts.", "date": "2015-08-03", "grade": null}
