{"name": "Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-recensione.html", "text": "A monkey who rolls around inside a ball collecting bananas, always in danger of falling on deaf ears and with a time limit to reach the final goal. But be careful, the player does not control the ball or even the monkey, but the game board, the entire level, making it tilt carefully in order to push the ball, with the all-important monkey inside, in the chosen direction. This is Super Monkey Ball since it was born: we are in 2001, on the Nintendo GameCube, and it was produced by a Sega that had just left the Dreamcast and world domination behind. And so it can only be this ~new~ game, as you will discover in the review of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania, a package of wonders that includes all the joy of the series, recalibrated and adapted for the audience of the twenty-first century. An immortal banana After all, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is the classic skill game... Let's start immediately from Super Monkey Ball, in short, from the beginning. It was one of the GameCube's launch games and personally the one I bought on the fly along with Wave Race, because Wave Race is the best thing since world peace. Why was it a bomb? Because it was the classic hit from the arcade, where in fact it debuted a few months before the GameCube. It was colorful, actually nice to look at, and its gameplay was all based on the turgid precision of the analog mounted on that pad, without forgetting the large number of levels and the very balanced difficulty. But that's not all: Super Monkey Ball also included mini-games and they happen to be one more fun than the other, stuff that makes you laugh and a lot, and makes you do it in company. Good news: this first Super Monkey Ball, to which I also owe an unforgettable night of fire, is all in here, inside Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. And together with Super Monkey Ball you will also find Super Monkey Ball 2, plus all the levels that were added in the deluxe edition of 2005, as well as several new modes and small but important differences with the past. Bringing Super Monkey Ball back to life was a must, for those who have never had the opportunity to try the game but also for those who basically can't do without it. It will seem strange, given that it is a cursed monkey inside a transparent ball, but this series has seen its crush, it has come out practically everywhere, generating spin-offs of all kinds, and this has been happening continuously for twenty years and for a reason: the brand, its concept, is fun, successful. Analog game Target shooting is one of the mini games we love the most: you have to control the wind, organize your ideas and then launch yourself from the trampoline, opening the monkey ball so that you can then glide to the finish line How could it not be successful after all? Super Monkey Ball is based on an idea that has practically always existed, or rather, has existed for a very long time. The first wooden mazes to be tilted to advance the balls inside them date back to the end of the 1800s, becoming particularly popular thanks to the inventions of the American Charles Martin Crandall. The same concept is back in vogue in the past 40s, thanks to the Swedish company BRIO which had the intuition of positioning the game board on a pin, so that its inclination was no longer managed by hand, but through a lever . It feels strange to describe such a common and popular thing pretending that the reader does not know it, because actually everyone has played these games, even you who are still minors and are thinking that some stuff does not concern you: who knows how many times have you torn up the soul to your parents for a coin to insert in those bar games which, after having brought the ball into the right hole, give you a gift with a multicolor crazy ball and/or some delicious chewing gum, but only for the first thirty seconds seen which then inevitably turns into a wet rag. In some variants, common in Italy, the playing surface is tilted not with a lever but through the steering wheel, with or without the aid of the pedals. Banana centric What party is it, without guests? Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is full of cameos and not just a Made in Sega character To play Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, or the video game version of the same concept that is simply called ~Labyrinth~ in the world, you don't need any of this: no coins, just a pad and its analog lever, the other lever instead will be used to argue with the camera. The rest is all in the hands of the speed of execution and the precision of the user, but in some cases a certain amount of lateral thinking does not hurt, which allows you to invent solutions that are not entirely foreseen by the game, but completelyto valid for the high-score. Although the controls are in all respects identical to its analogue predecessors, Super Monkey Ball cannot however be defined in any way as a labyrinth, while it is rightfully part of an obstacle course. The levels are mainly this: parabolic bends, precipices, deceptions of all kinds, holes everywhere, killer edges, toboggan runs that first calm you down and then at the first bend throw you into the void, and more mobile boxes, launch pipes, ramps and crossroads such as ups and downs. Then there is this strange pleasure in rolling, ending up in mechanisms that between rebounds and slides launch you towards the next challenge of flames, breathtaking bottlenecks and perspective betrayals. All this while you are there with absolute thumb and tongue between your lips to boost perceptions. In Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania there are more than three hundred levels available, an enormity to which are added the special stages linked to the new challenge modes, all fun and almost all banana-centric: in Golden Banana mode you have to get them all, in Dark Banana Instead, you must avoid them. Crazy mini games Among the mini games there is also a billiard table, serious enough and with some crazy rules. Virtually irresistible. It is true that we are talking about decades-old content, but in the outline Sega has worked very well by adding where necessary and leaving intact what should not be touched. With the result that we find ourselves in front of a Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania boastful the right, and full of extra elements, such as the challenges we told you about, the unexpected photomode, the presence of online rankings of all kinds, the heavy customization of all the characters, lots of cameos from other Sega icons (but not only) with which to replace the game's sweet primates. And then there are the mini games, which are twelve but at least eight designed to make you spend respectable evenings in the company of whoever you deem appropriate to invite. Up to four can play against each other in Monkey War, where we will have to knock down the opponent with loose fists, Monkey Bersaglio, where you can take a run up and land by gliding with the ball on one of the proposed targets, Monkey Golf where for once you have to hole, instead of avoiding them. Other mini games are less successful, but the average quality of the ideas is very high. Technically the game runs at 2160p, what we commonly call 4k, and at 60FPS which however also includes some slowdown too much.", "date": "2021-09-29", "grade": "7.7"}
