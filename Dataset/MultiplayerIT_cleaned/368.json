Test Drive writes a new chapter in the history of video games by creating an entire genre unprecedented in driving games. The implementation of the online component had already been addressed for some time. Sega did it first with its ~Link~ for Saturn, with little success, however. Immediately after with Dreamcast and to follow the birth of the ~Live~ of Xbox. The first titles to take advantage of such options were limited only to challenges between users. Much more could have been done. To unite the concept of ~MMORPG~ very dear in PC environments to that of racing, the step was really short. The Atari game can therefore be defined as a ~Massive Multiplayer Online Racing~, as the setting consists of an entire island of Hawaii literally colonized by players from all over the world, who united in clans or simply alone, will compete with blows of doors and upgraded engines. in the console environment, we had never been faced with such a breadth, without obviously inconveniencing the infinite Bethesda RPGs Massive multiplayer online racing The play area is therefore impressive and is designed to accommodate two large servers filled with people from the US and Europe. In the console environment, we had never been faced with such a breadth, without obviously inconveniencing the infinite Bethesda RPGs. Eden Studios has managed to digitally create the largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, which includes cities, towns, roads, lanes and highways, hills, woods, sunny beaches and expanses of palm trees and flowers. The glance is simply gorgeous and effective. It is no coincidence that there is a ~photograph~ mode, on the other hand. Test Drive Unlimited is a game that also works in single player. In practice, we can decide to face the various missions that will be placed on us, to run and turn freely, or to face some other user who will pass right on that road at that moment. Basically it is a perfect hybrid between offline and online game, as we ourselves will decide at any time whether to dedicate ourselves to the ~story~ or to the races. Test Drive Unlimited is a game that lends itself to numerous interpretations, each of them at the same time fascinating and integrated into the other. It leaves complete freedom to the player and in this sense it is truly ~limitless~. It is both a car racing game, but at the same time you can dedicate yourself to single player, increasing track records (and relative online ranking), or earn money with missions and increase your fleet of cars, clothes, accessories , the components for your car. Or you could ~simply~ visit the island by touring it far and wide, taking photos and observing places and streets faithfully reproduced on our TV. As already mentioned, all of this is perfectly integrated and not divided into watertight compartments. Bind Let's analyze one of the most important features of Test Drive, the races. There are four types of modes for you to compete. The first, obviously, is the offline one which sees us as protagonists in facing various duels and battles. However, we can exploit the power of the new Xbox 360 Live by entering a ~room~ of players ready to go and start a race with other people. These meeting points are scattered throughout the map and will not be difficult to find. You can set your own search preferences, of course. Winning the most online challenges is also part of a series of important achievements to unlock, and we assure you it won't be that easy! here is that suddenly any stranger, coming out of nowhere, can challenge us to single combat with blows of the brake and gas Bind While we then wander carefree through the hills in bloom, the groves of Hawaii or along the seafront showing off our racing car, suddenly any stranger, coming out of nowhere, can challenge us to single combat with blows of the brakes and gas. This is how the challenge starts, where we can also decide whether or not to bet money. The peculiarity of these duels is that we will decide the track, marking the finish where we like best. If we lose, the ~revenge~ option is activated, for a quick ~return~ challenge. The last way to compete in Test Drive is to found a Club and go find some rival team. To found one you need a lot of money, and that's why it won't be possible to do it right away. Power is nothing without control! Another important component of Test Drive is the offline component. It's all about the many missions available, ranging from taking people from one place to another, frun errands, take someone's car, or give someone a lift. Exploration of the map is equally important, if only because we will be rewarded with new objectives scattered around the island. It's still a ~racing~ game, so let's take a look at the cars! The list is varied and varied and includes the legendary Aston Martins, Ferraris, Alfa Romeos, Lamborghinis, Lotuses and a long list of super sports cars, up to motorcycles, which are also racing bikes. The driving style and ~handling~ are definitely not great. Perhaps the developers should have focused more on the physics of the cars and their behavior on the asphalt, but evidently most of the work has been done on the playing area. With ~entry level~ cars, i.e. from beginner to medium level (there are five in total), our cars will literally be indomitable beasts of the road. In the sense that it will be very easy to get out of the way after a curve or bump. Cars tend to skid a lot and 'jump' into the air perhaps too unrealistically. The driving model seems to be a cross between that of Project Gotham and Grand Theft Auto, certainly very arcade. being an open map, it is also possible not to follow the official roads but to go through woods and meadows, given the free nature of the game it is therefore easy to get stuck in some ravine or get stuck due to some stone Power is nothing without control! With the more expensive racing cars, the ungovernability effect will gradually decrease as the ~handling~ item increases in the technical characteristics. Being an open map, it is also possible not to follow the official roads but to go through woods and meadows, given the free nature of the game it is therefore easy to get stuck in some ravine or get stuck due to some stone, the programmers loved us by entering the key ~get back on track~ next to the ring of light on the joypad. As mentioned, the actual playability is not excellent and could certainly be improved. Fortunately Test Drive is not a ~pure~ racing game, but as mentioned at the beginning it can be appreciated through various interpretations, and for this reason the defect is less penalizing than a classic Burnout or Need For Speed style Arcade. It must also be said that once you get the hang of it, this control will still be enjoyable. A way to find yourself Given the enormity of the island, pressing the right key of the digital will bring up the very detailed game map. Here the camera will perform a very powerful zoom backwards, thus making us understand, to our amazement, that the map is made with the real graphics engine. With triggers, you can further zoom in and out and call up key points such as dealerships, mechanics, drive-ins (which act as hangouts), opponent cars, and challenge locations. A curious note: the police are present in Test Drive. At the first incident, the warning goes off, at the second they'll start hunting us but it won't be difficult to lose her, while at the ~third level~ of alert, the checkpoints go off with a huge fine. the inspiration for GTA is almost obvious. Even in the characterization of our character A way to find yourself The idea is great and also serves to discourage online users from behaving like they are in ~Carmageddon~ rather than the Atari title. The inspiration for GTA is almost obvious. Even in the characterization of our character. The game begins at an airport, ready for a flight to Hawaii. At Check-in there is a queue of people from whom we can choose our virtual alter ego. Once we arrive on the island, it will be our duty to buy a house (we will need it for the garage too), clothes and accessories to customize the character and immediately rent a car with which to start. In the locker room of the house it is possible to start a very complete character editor that will allow us to modify features and clothes. The polygonal models aren't incredible, but still effective (still a driving game). In the grove of my fantasy Let's talk a little about the technical characteristics of Test Drive. Surely it is a very controversial title, in many respects. The general feeling is that it belongs to that large category of games on which the developers have worked for years and years, but lack a general ~cleanliness~. The polygonal models of the cars are very good, as are those of their interiors visible with the subjective camera. The graphics engine has a few too many uncertainties, though. The frame rate appears to be just under 30 FPS, with numerous ~microshots~ near the most crowded areas such as cities or at road junctions. The detail of the surrounding environment is remarkable: from the birds to the cards that fly to the ground, to the strings of light moved by the wind to arrive at the stupendous groves that seem to have come out from Oblivion, with trees, bushes, grass and flowers.Moreover, approaching a city, near skyscrapers or buildings, it is possible to notice numerous and showy pop-ups. the frame rate seems to be just under 30 FPS, with numerous ~microshots~ near the most crowded areas In the grove of my fantasy Having said that, it is also understandable that a map of this vastness has drawbacks. The glance, however, is always spectacular and atmospheric. The weather conditions are variable and affect the lighting and the wind, the light fades at sunset and is stronger in the middle of the day, creating splendid glimpses of the sea. The feeling of ~living~ on the island is very strong and it is absolutely to be appreciated given the purely automotive nature of the game. Analyzing the sound characteristics, it must be said that the songs included in the Atari title can be listened to on the radios present in the cars. Unfortunately there are only 30 of them and therefore they are often repeated. The sound effects are absolutely normal, even if many of the ~roars~ of the engines seem quite similar to each other. Absolutely to disable the voice that guides the GPS, or the navigation system that we can use at any time to get to a chosen point on the map. The objectives of Test Drive The maximum score obtainable is once again 1000. The objectives are 46 and range between different categories. Many are unlocked by winning online races, club races, and offline races. Others by completing single player missions. Making a car collection is important because we are given achievement points every time our fleet grows. Buying accessories, clothes or spare parts is another way to unlock points. The ~tourist~ objectives, on the other hand, are obtained by traveling kilometers of roads, there are four of them, respectively, over 48, 320, 640 and 1600 km of asphalt. The first 100 points will be relatively simple to achieve and will only take a few hours. Final comment Test Drive Unlimited has so many innovative elements that it deserves special attention from every player. It represents in itself a small dream that many of us have always had: an entire online car racing game, to be played as if it were a Massive Multiplayer together with thousands of other people, simultaneously. The single player component is still strong and exciting. Eden's experiment succeeded in its intentions but less in technical realization, unfortunately. The game suffers from some problems in the graphics engine and in the control system of the cars, whose approximate physics make them too indomitable. However, Test Drive is also to be appreciated for the vastness of the island on which it is set, for the recreated atmosphere and for the large number of game options that make it an enjoyable and complete title. Pros A persistent online world Huge map Lots of missions and challenges Cons Improved control system Some uncertainty in the graphics engine Soundtrack to a minimum Let's warm up the engines Test Drive Unlimited has also just been released in the old continent on the only new generation console on the market: Xbox 360. Announced since the dawn of the Microsoft project, after a long gestation, Eden Studios has finally given birth to its creature. This development team has a fair amount of experience in the driving game sector, having in fact programmed Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed for PSX and the good old V-Rally 3 on the latest consoles. Xbox 360 could be just the ideal platform for the decisive leap in quality: graphics, audio, but above all online are the key factors of this new racing game. Let's find out how far they've come and if they've managed to truly create a ~limitless~ simulation!", "date": "2006-09-18", "grade": null}
