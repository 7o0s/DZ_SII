Yet Everybody's Golf, under its colorful cartoon patina, hides a gameplay that is anything but superficial, mixing for years and years an exquisitely arcade approach with simulation elements that make it much more accessible than other golf titles such as the evergreen Tiger Woods franchise. Now an emblematic brand of every self-respecting Sony console, the Clap Hanz series also makes its debut on the new laptop as part of the launch line-up, perfect bait for old and new players. A flawless plan? With tenacity and grit... The greatest and indisputable value of the Everybody's Golf series lies, as we said, precisely in its accessibility: even the most ignorant golf user in the world can pick up the console and hit the golf ball, when the game manages to be so clear and concise thanks to a series of visual reminders and interface settings that make the experience absolutely painless even for those who may know golf but have never touched Everybody's Golf in their life. And this sixth official iteration of the franchise, if we exclude the numerous spin-offs, is played exactly like the previous ones, apart from some tiny new features aimed at making the experience even more intuitive and customizable. On the golf course, what the player has to do after choosing his alter-ego among the various characters available, the club and the shooting system, is simply to press the same button twice. We're absolutely not joking, playing Everybody's Golf is really that simple: by pressing the button for the first time you can determine the power of the shot (stopping the appropriate indicator) and by pressing the button again at the right moment you will also decide the impact. Shooting the ball into orbit or making it travel just a few meters is all a matter of timing and reflexes, in this sense one of the few innovations introduced in this sequel proves to be quite useful, namely the possibility of aesthetically changing the shot indicator, offering various types for all tastes: an addition that guarantees no advantage other than greater visual comfort. Obviously this concise explanation only describes the superficial layer of a much more complex gameplay than it seems. The most experienced players will in fact be able to take into consideration the numerous data and parameters shown on the screen to perfect their shots based on the direction and intensity of the wind, the inclination of the terrain and its composition, the distance of the hole and any obstacles between it and the player. A myriad of factors can hamper the player's performance and although a novice can enjoy the game without too much paranoia, more determined users will be able to enjoy a simulation aspect that makes the experience even more satisfying. Playstation 3 trophies 15 Bronze, 8 Silver, 4 Gold and the usual Platinum: there are twenty-eight Trophies in total that can be unlocked in this portable version of Everybody's Golf. Doing so may not be easy: while it is true that some Trophies are unlocked simply by progressing in Challenge mode and purchasing the various items in the shop, others will only be obtained by making exceptional shots or by winning all the various tournaments in the game. Spaghetti!! Unfortunately, the list of innovations introduced compared to the previous ones is very short: in addition to the multiple shooting systems, there are no other gameplay additions and most of the features related to the Sony hardware are exploited in a rather superficial way. The touch-screen, for example, is only used to navigate the menus or replace the golf club while the motion sensor allows you to examine the playing field in a decidedly precarious way, so much so that it is preferable to carry out the operation using the traditional stick. The golf courses themselves will not offer great surprises to veterans of the series, given that most of them have been recycled from Everybody's Golf 5 for PlayStation 3, with which Everybody's Golf also shares the well-kept cartoonish, colorful and detailed technical sector . Fortunately, Clap Hanz's game makes good use of the connection capabilities of the PlayStation Vita to offer solid multiplayer both locally and via Internet connection. In the latter case it is FrIt is possible to try your hand at some daily tournaments in an attempt to climb a world leaderboard or it is possible to enter some lobbies by controlling a cute, fully customizable super-deformed avatar. In these nice scenarios we will be able to interact with the avatars of the other players, chatting and organizing matches and tournaments. The interface is very intuitive and allows excellent interaction with other virtual golfers. More solitary users, on the other hand, will find that the single-player mode offers a good amount of content that will keep them busy for a long time: in addition to the inevitable Training mode, it is possible to try their hand at a sort of ~campaign~ characterized by various tournaments of nine or eighteen holes. By winning the various games, the player earns money with which it is possible to buy, in the appropriate Shop screen, a ton of objects of practical or simply aesthetic use: new characters, new caddies, new clubs and balls or simply different clothes and decorations for the various characters, unpublished music and so on and so forth. The Loyalty of the characters introduced in the last chapters of the series also returns: by using some characters more frequently we will unlock special features for our shots. In short, Everybody's Golf is certainly a generous game in terms of activity and content in every mode and represents an excellent business card for the newborn Sony console.", "date": "2012-02-29", "grade": "8.0"}
