We can therefore offer only a partial comment, since we will have to wait for the release of the fifth and final episode to evaluate the work. If you have never heard of The Walking Dead video game, we advise you to read the review of the first episode of the second season. Finally, if you are one of those who can not tolerate revelations about the plot of a story, skip the review and read directly to the final commentary. It is not a nice world in which a pregnant woman has to ask permission to rest for a minute. On the other hand, if you have followed the second season of The Walking Dead up to here, you have already seen worse. Much worse. Amid The Ruins revolves around the urgent delivery of Rebecca, but that is not the focus of the episode, but the long excursion that Clementine takes in the company of Jane, who for many will have become a favorite character of the series. Telltale would have kept its promise to leave the player with the possibility of forging his own narrative if he had allowed him to choose Jane as an adventure companion over the rest of the group. Instead we can only make a wish and watch her leave us. Jane talks about herself, and in doing so she allows us to accept the actions she will carry out during the episode, but above all she introduces what will probably be the main philosophical problem for Clementine: to survive relying only on herself or to continue to choose the company of other beings human beings, exposing himself to the agony he will certainly feel over and over again when he sees them die. Certainly the question is interesting and the trauma of Lee's death could be a good starting point to explore it. If that's the point. The only certainty is that Telltale has a well-defined narrative goal, and is ready to sacrifice a lot to achieve it. We are now openly faced with a story on which we have no possibility of interfering in a decisive way. Kenny, even though we've brought him to a breaking point, suddenly snaps to deliver Rebecca's baby, as if nothing had happened before. Sarah, towards whom the episode tries, but fails, to make us feel a strong empathic link, leaves the scene in a somewhat forced way. Not to mention the exploration of the museum, another passage that made us turn up our noses. Two people searched it up and down and found nothing. Then we arrive in Clementine's shoes and we immediately realize that there are two cases of water behind a semi-lowered shutter. They all rely so heavily on Clementine that she seems like the new team leader. We accept that the little girl who was inside Clementine is dead, but her abilities are still exaggerated. Does that mean Telltale has missed a few beats? Not at all. One perceives that under the succession of events there is something in motion that will explode in the finale. Only, to get there it was necessary to make some tears. After three episodes that punched the stomach, we still gladly allow ourselves a moment of breath. Amid the Ruins asks a difficult question: can one still love when life hangs in the balance? let's get to know each other better Now that we have put our misgivings about the episode on the table, we can appreciate what is good about it, especially if, as we usually do, we evaluate it in relation to what happened before. Continuity with past choices, and their echo, is weak if not absent, but the timing is perfect. Clementine has the opportunity to experience a moment of intimacy with all the characters present, something we have felt the need for a long time. The large amount of dialogues do not lead to moral choices, but rather to exchanges of views that reveal unexpected sides of the personality. Luke in particular impressed us with his unexpected development. Some clues had been sown, but they are taking shape in an unexpected way. We have already talked about Jane. Despite the short stay in the series, Jane leaves an indelible mark, a bit like the Red Viper in Game of Thrones. Indeed, it is precisely her fleeting but incisive participation that makes her emerge as a remarkable character. Meanwhile Clementine records everything, learns to survive even better, and always has her say. There is no conversation or moment of action in which she is allowed to stand aside and give the scene to someone more qualified. Only Kenny stands up to her. The ambiguity of the bond that unites her with Lee's old partner is creating a tension that could lead to violence in the last chapter of the series. Finally, before the final choice of Amid the Ruins, the one that more thanall made us wish we could play the next episode, there's time for even more characters to enter. A predictable turn, like all those present in this episode, but with at least one indigestible character we would like to know more about. As long as someone gets out alive from the mess that has been unleashed.", "date": "2014-07-25", "grade": "7.5"}
