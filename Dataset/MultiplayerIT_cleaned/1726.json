{"name": "Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-3-hoodlum-havoc-6.html", "text": "We need a doctor! To introduce us to the game we find a pleasant computer graphics movie, which stages the rise of the forces of evil, represented by the Hoodlums, while Rayman dozes blissfully in the shade of a plant, unaware of the impending catastrophe. These sorts of nasty bugs are nothing but Lums (magic fruits), who suddenly seem to have lost their minds. ~The epidemic~ expands like wildfire, and the tiny Hoodlums manage, by joining forces, to transform themselves into dark enemies with a vaguely witchy look. Luckily Murfy, Rayman's green flying friend, realizes the seriousness of the situation and runs to arouse Rayman and his historic adventure companion Globox. Thus begins our long fight against the Hoodlums with a tutorial phase, which will cause a naive Globox to have a stomach ache, who will inadvertently swallow one. The search for a qualified doctor to treat the injured person will therefore be the main reason for exploring the 9 ~levels~ that make up the large world of Rayman 3. In addition to helping us learn the basic commands, the Tutorial is full of narrative elements, which they develop above all in self-quotations of the previous episodes, comments on the b-Movie script of the title by Murfy and also observations from the director on our (catastrophic) work. All of course in an ironic key. We don't know if the overabundance of these factors served in the Tutorial to distract the player from the lack of play that these sections inevitably offer. However, various comments and references to previous episodes (for example Globox says: ~in Rayman 2 you were nicer~, and so on), remain present throughout the adventure, and this speaks volumes about the cartoonish nature of the title in question. The characters seem to be aware of their own recitation of an already written script, and behave accordingly, addressing the audience more or less directly, as happens in many ~real~ cartoons. However, it should be noted that the gameplay of Rayman 3 is not affected by these factors in the least, and it is not even a distant relative of Metal Gear Solid 2 and other metagames. This interaction between actors and the public therefore turns out to be limited to the formal-stylistic level, encouraging more than anything else the ~politically incorrect~ attitude that has always characterized the saga. However, wanting to make a direct comparison with what Ps2Gen considers the best exponent of the unofficial Cartoon-Game philosophy on the Sony platform, namely the ignored Sly Raccoon, the latest Ubisoft work would be defeated. Rayman 3 performs very well in terms of atmosphere and characterization, it is useless to deny it, but we found greater structural harmony and stylistic research in the work of the Sucker Punchs, which gave us the impression of living a truly new gaming experience. Ubisoft's effort to introduce elements that make its product as similar as there is to an interactive cartoon is evident; however, in our opinion these are not managed with due skill, so much so that structural linearity, which in a game with a similar concept is almost an imperative, ends up weighing a bit in the long run. Mind you, Rayman 3 is not a soporific or snooty experience, although the ultra-linear level-scheme structure might have made some hardcore gamers suspicious; simply some side elements could have been managed a little better. And on Xbox? As a good cross-platform project, Rayman 3 shows very minimal, if not almost non-existent, differences between the various versions. Technically the game is in line with its GameCube and PlayStation 2 counterparts and offers a solid and satisfactory graphics system, even if it does not excel considering the standards of the Microsoft console. On the gameplay front, we reiterate what was written in the review: the game is really very good, but lacks in innovation, adding nothing new to the inflated world of platform games. However, Rayman 3 is currently the best platformer available on Xbox, and is therefore highly recommended. Gameplay It certainly cannot be said that Rayman 3 will be remembered as a revolution for its genre. The innovations (if they can be considered as such) are decidedly scarce, and are reduced to the renewal of the character upgrade system, based on equipment obtainable by freeing the prisoners of the Hoodlums, who will call for help with a little voice that seemed simply adorable to us. Each equipment (available for a limited time) corresponds to a different weapon for Rayman, which with standard punch throwing does notit can reach some areas or destroy some doors, always placed very close to the places dedicated to the upgrade. The use of these ~wetsuits~ is closely linked to the achievement of an immediate objective, and there is practically never room for the player's free initiative: there are no great alternatives for overcoming a difficulty, which is often linked to a 'only solution that can be guessed with extreme ease. The impression that was had was often marked flatness, also thanks to a design of the levels, of only discreet amplitude, not particularly inspired. Compared to the past, greater importance has been given to puzzle solving to pave the way through the levels; however, the puzzles are almost elementary, and do not cause the player particular difficulties in research. The difficulty level evidently set downwards is, as usual, a double-edged sword: it encourages newbies but decreases the challenge factor, which stimulates the player to continue in the adventure. The control system, intuitive, is noted for a rather prompt response to commands and for an adequate assignment of the keys to the various functions. Pressing X corresponds to a double jump, while pressing it twice makes our pet glide like a helicopter. The square button has the attack function, while the triangle gives access to a subjective view adjustable with L2/R2. Pressing R1 ~hooks~ on the closest enemy and, with lateral movements, it is possible to launch one's shots not only frontally, but also from the sides, so as to be able to carry them out ~covered~ by some shelter structure. However, in the most agitated phases this system involves many difficulties in selecting the desired enemy, so much so that very often the fights are resolved with melee rather expensive for our vital level, which can be viewed with the circle button and can be incentivized by recovering red energy spheres scattered throughout the levels. If the main play structure therefore proves to be rather precarious (from a 128-bit platform it is reasonable to expect more), the ~surrounding~ elements are excellent. Each Rayman action (from the attack to the collection of golden or red coins) in fact corresponds to a score, which if high enough allows you to unlock bonus levels, mini-games (there is even a really valuable 2d version of Rayman), movies; you can also take pictures by pressing L3 and save them on a Memory Card. The levels in skateboard (or something similar) deserve a special mention, in which Rayman has to jump from one platform to another trying to recover as many coins as possible, with psychedelic images in the background and classy disco music, as if to quote the award-winning Rez. Really valuable. The longevity is very good, by virtue of the incentives to replay Rayman 3 several times to unlock all the extras and complete each level 100%. Technique Rayman 3's graphics engine feels very solid. A constant frame rate in practically every situation is combined with polygonal environments of moderate complexity, although they are not too large, as already reiterated. The polygons are expertly covered with textures that cover a range of very vivid and gaudy colours. The shadows seemed to be of excellent workmanship, just as the water and the reflections of the frozen surfaces are visually pleasing. Also taken care of the animations, while the management of the camera did not seem impeccable to us, which in any case will not cause excessive headaches to the players, who can also adjust it with the right stick. The dubbing of the voices and the Italian translation are of high quality; there is also the 50/60 Hz selector: we are therefore facing a respectable treatment. However, it is sad to note that practically only the European Software Houses treat our market in a dignified way. Comment Rayman 3, Hoodlum Havoc is a well-crafted, technically impressive platformer, full of extras and with some interesting ideas, which however has its roots in a dated and rather poor play structure. Those who love its style will certainly not be disappointed and will find several hours of entertainment in this colorful cartoon with a vaguely ~politically incorrect~ tone; those who are looking for innovation, seriousness or artistic content in the video game, better go elsewhere. Pros + Excellent voice acting + Captivating graphics + Many, many extras Cons - Too easy puzzles - Not very innovative - Linearity ends up weighing in the long run After the acclaimed Rayman 2 and the much less exciting parenthesis of the M version (called ~Arena~ in the American counterpart), Rayman is called to ransom on all platforms, and responds to the call without hesitation with ~Hoodlum Havoc~, the third official chapter of the Saga. The various Ratchet and Clank, Sly Raccoon and Jak and Dexter, who beat him to the punch, have a worthy new rival.", "date": "2003-03-13", "grade": null}
