{"name": "Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/169337-senran-kagura-shinovi-versus-piccole-ninja-crescono.html", "text": "Senran Kagura is that franchise whose name was barely whispered just a few years ago. Even the TV commercials pointed everything to its more embarrassing and perverted side, overlooking the fact that it was actually a good title and making potential buyers of the first episode even more uncomfortable coming to us thanks to the Nintendo 3DS. Today the Tamsoft-signed series has definitely been cleared through customs and the publishers XSEED and Marvelous have even decided to convert the first Senran Kagura released on PlayStation Vita in 2014 for PC. And so now even those who have never had the Nintendo portable console or the Sony one can have fun to beat and strip the young and buxom ninja protagonists. The problem is that it would have been better to convert another Senran Kagura... Now even those who own only a PC can play with the beautiful ninjas of Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus Analog clashes The events of Shinovi Versus take place shortly after those of Senran Kagura: Burst, the first episode to be released also in Europe for Nintendo 3DS, and therefore precede the events told in Senran Kagura: Deep Crimson. The story is still a real pretext to stage the clashes between the young ninja protagonists but, as has already happened in the previous episodes, it still manages to convey important messages on friendship, sincerity and the affirmation of one's self: all themes dear to the Japanese, expressed more or less covertly by the walking stereotypes that are the various fighters. We are not stating this negatively, as it is important to understand that the script and the heroines of Senran Kagura have been specifically designed in a certain way to appeal not only to an audience... very specific, let's say, but also to those looking for a plot not particularly complex but still multifaceted. The game tells it to us through very long dialogues and impressive blocks of text completely in English that are more reminiscent of Japanese visual novels: the story is divided into about thirty chapters to which the personal missions of the individual protagonists are added; at any time it is possible to change perspective and choose one of the schools involved in the conflict on the ethics of the ninja. The Hanzo academy returns, of course, together with Homura's Crimson Squad, and the clandestine Hebijo academy and the Gessen Girls school also make their entry into the scene: the game allows us to control about twenty girls, therefore, and each of them wields a specific weapon that differentiates it from the others in the execution and rhythm of the combos. Despite this, in terms of gameplay, not much changes between one fighter and another. One key is still dedicated to the strong attack and another to the weak one, you can jump and dash towards the target both on the ground and in the air, finally you can parry and combine some keys to perform cinematic ninja techniques. Each successful attack fills an indicator and unlocks the parchment scrolls that allow us to use the aforementioned techniques or to stop playing schoolgirls to wear ninja costumes and alter our fighting skills, completely regenerating the health indicator. Alternatively, you can always go into Frantic mode and strip down almost completely to lower your defense in favor of a substantial increase in offense. It's up to the player to choose how to approach a certain mission, deciding the approach each time during the battle itself. Mounted graphics Depending on whether you fight in a ninja costume, wearing a school uniform or stripping naked in Frantic mode, the player scores points in the corresponding Yin, Yang and Flash styles, earning various bonuses that directly affect his performance on the battlefield: with a little skill and good timing it is theoretically possible to ring combinations of a hundred or more shots, if it weren't for two problems which, unfortunately, heavily afflict the smoothness of the game. No, we are not referring to any slowdowns and frame rate drops. Indeed, this conversion from PlayStation Vita consistently maintains the 60 frames per second without faltering even in the most chaotic moments. In fact, the opposite would have surprised us: if it is true that the developer has increased the resolution in general, with an eye to the models of the heroines, we must still admit that the arenas in which we fight are rather tiny, limited and bare of details or particulars. The enemies who attack us, perhaps together with the boss on duty, are practically all the same and show off a significantly lower polygonal count than the protagonists. Unfortunately there isn't much to add on the graphics: the conversion is discreet, buton PC something more could have been done instead of proposing a menu in which it is only possible to change the image resolution and view the game in a window or full screen. In any case, as we said, it is not the technical side that affects the gameplay, but the actual fanservice: not only do the ninja transformations and techniques trigger fairly long cinematic sequences that interrupt the action, but by inflicting a certain number of damage to the opponent, or undergoing it ourselves, we can admire a short sequence in which the clothes are torn, exposing the beauties of the ninja on duty. The cutscene makes you smile, but it repeats itself with annoying frequency during the clashes and, although it is possible to skip it by pressing a key, it still interrupts the flows of attacks and their animations. Which, in a purely action game like Senran Kagura, in the long run gives a lot of annoyance, especially in the more difficult advanced missions where it is necessary to focus more on dodging and on the position of the enemies. The clumsy camera certainly doesn't help and some sudden peaks in the level of difficulty, which can be circumvented afterwards through some level ups, cause a certain amount of frustration in the long run. Furthermore, the structure of the various missions proved to be enormously repetitive, demonstrating a simple truth, namely that Senran Kagura: Deep Crimson, the second episode for Nintendo 3DS that we reviewed last year, was a much better title from the point of view of the gameplay. Perhaps XSEED should have converted that, as Shinovi Versus feels just the weight of the years and the absence of the ideas that Tamsoft came up with later, such as combo attacks and tag battles.", "date": "2016-06-09", "grade": "S.V."}
