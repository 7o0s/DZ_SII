If the car crashes, it's clearly the end of it and you will no longer be able to get an important achievement. Well, forget this rule, because the purpose of You Suck at Parking is precisely to stop as soon as possible, perhaps trying not to explode into a thousand pieces in the meantime. Today, September 14, 2022, Happy Volcano offers a new driving game that requires great maneuvering skills and perfect brake control. You Suck at Parking is available on PC and Xbox (also on Game Pass), while it will arrive in 2023 on PlayStation and Switch. Learn how to maneuver in our review of You Suck at Parking. traffic islands A typical You Suck at Parking level You Suck at Parking challenges us right away, right from the title. It's not a question, it's a statement: we don't know how to park and the Happy Volcano game wants to see if we can deny it. The game is basically divided into levels, collected in thematic areas, in turn organized into islands and archipelagos, which must be unlocked by successfully completing the various challenges. Each level asks us to park our car, usually three or four times, at various points on a course. The rip off? First of all, our vehicle is low on petrol, so we won't be able to take it easy. Furthermore, even if we have an infinite number of cars to use, there is a maximum time within which to place a vehicle in each available parking space. In the beginning, completing the areas will be quite easy, as there are few dangers, but the real goal is not only to complete the level, but to do it without wasting a single car. In fact, to obtain the maximum degree, two, three or more vehicles must be parked in a row in their respective spaces without making any mistakes. This means that if one attempt doesn't end correctly, you have to start over. The stages are thankfully very fast and each attempt will take a minute or two, thus creating a loop of errors and very fast restarts. A region of You Suck at Parking is frozen Initially it won't be complicated, but dangers will be added to each new area, such as guard rails that blow us up, trampolines that throw us, turbos that risk throwing us off the track, mines, homing bombs, giant boxing gloves that throw us push and so on. Every few meters there is something that can help or tear us apart. The variety in this sense is good, with continuous surprises that allow developers to indulge themselves with the structure of the paths. Initially we'll only have to deal with tight curves and a few chasms, but going forward we'll have to do entire sections in flight, trying to land in a narrow space in search of that last parking space. Each area includes various ways to get to rest areas: there are routes in plain sight, but there are various shortcuts, obviously more difficult to follow, to cut short and save time. The levels of You Suck at Parking must be reached by exploring the islands You Suck at Parking offers an average high challenge and is to be imagined much more like a Super Meat Boy than a cartoon version of Forza Horizon. In Happy Vulcano's game, you die over and over trying to learn how to perform that specific movement necessary for victory. Currently You Suck at Parking offers a good amount of levels, which can keep you busy for about ten hours if you try to get the maximum grade from each one. Furthermore, each setting has its own world ranking which is based on the time it takes to finish a course: if you like to compete, you will have to replay each level again and again. Throw yourself away in company There are multiplayer levels in You Suck at Parking You Suck at Parking also offers a multiplayer mode, which pits us against seven other players and asks us to be the first to get to the parking lot. It's a different way of approaching the same gameplay, making everything much more chaotic and more like a party game where you want to laugh more than achieve record-breaking results. In addition, there is a season pass system: by playing the various missions of the single player campaign and by playing in the online multiplayer, you rise in rank and unlock aesthetic contents, many of which are locked after paying the premium pass (11 euros). There is also a shop to buy cosmetic content packs, which currently range from 1.99 to 6.99 euros. It is an economic system that we find a bit forced for a paid game of this type, but we can consider it asa way to help developers support development after the release: You Suck at Parking will, in fact, get new routes over time in a free format. We'll have to see if the content arrives on a regular basis and quickly enough for him to be a permanent fixture of players' weekly matches, but it certainly is a good premise that will entice more players to buy. We will deal with ramps, turbos and trampolines in You Suck at Parking We close by pointing out that the visual side of You Suck at Parking didn't particularly surprise us: a little more character would have helped to satisfy the eye as well. However, the action on the screen is always clear and the interface does its job, which is a good result in itself. The soundtrack is also pleasant, especially the chorus of female voices that endlessly repeat ~you suck at parking~ with a drama that is comical (in a good way).", "date": "2022-09-14", "grade": "8.0"}
