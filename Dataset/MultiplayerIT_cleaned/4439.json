What am I going to correct, redo, fix and what, on the contrary, do I leave unchanged? These are decisions that involve a certain responsibility, also because very often we find ourselves acting on a dated work conceived by someone else; it is therefore necessary to carefully study the creation in front of us and embrace its essence in order to give back to the world a product that is as authentic as possible. Of course, you will notice the original elements and the modern ones but the important thing is to obtain a harmony that is satisfying but faithful. Perhaps this comparison may seem pretentious for any video game but certainly not for Shadow of the Colossus, the great masterpiece of past generations. The team of ~restorers~ who worked on the second title produced by Fumito Ueda and his studio is that of Bluepoint Games, already architects of the remastering released on PlayStation3 in 2011. What has changed and what has remained unchanged? Everything from scratch Although it has been repeated on several occasions by Sony itself, it is good to remember it also in this phase of the judgment: the remake for PlayStation 4 is in all respects the original game released in Europe in 2006. This means that the contents, the story remain unchanged and collectibles because the bulk of the work has been done on the technical side. In fact, the title boasts a complete makeover of the graphic assets and part of the animations but all modernized with the aim of maintaining the same feedback and glance of the original. According to the words of Peter Dalton, technical director of Bluepoint Games, the work done by the studio was more of an addition than a restyle because it is true that the game world was modeled from scratch, but once everything was put back in its place, the team is focused on polishing, adding details and effects that in past versions of the game had never seen before. The work is extraordinarily convincing, except perhaps for the protagonist's face which in some game sequences seems excessively chubby. What amazes in the environment are the light effects which, thanks to a dynamic rendering system, change realistically in favor of the geographical context, giving a precise identity to each area of the map. However, those who have really benefited from this modernization are the colossi, where the new graphic design makes the gigantic monsters surprisingly detailed especially if you look carefully at their fur: this has a precise appearance on anthropomorphic giants while it appears totally different when wet on aquatic monsters or moving on the flying ones. On the other hand, the graphic detail perhaps reveals a little too much paths, grips and weak points of the enemies, making them easier to identify at a glance. The audio sector is also excellent where obviously the soundtrack composed by Ko Otani is still the founding pillar of the experience but all the care dedicated to the sound effects of the environment and fauna should not be overlooked. The rush of water, the song of the wind through the stalks of grass, even the sound of Agro's hooves seems fuller, as well as resonating differently based on the type of terrain being beaten. The result obtained by Bluepoint demonstrates their great mastery on the technical front gained over the years, but what really warms the heart is the delicacy used to make the small changes present in the interface, both commands and graphics. The real difficulty in creating the remake of a game from the past is in fact to compete nine times out of ten with an old title and Shadow of the Colossus is no exception; the biggest problems in the past were certainly rooted in the technical sector but once you got used to the dancer framerate, what annoyed the most were the game controls, complex and decidedly not very intuitive as well as the not always precise feedback. The remake for PlayStation 4 obviously offers the original interface, however, alongside two remappings, one modern and the other halfway between the new and the original. A correct move that greatly raises the degree of accessibility to the title, especially for the younger generations used to leaner and quicker to learn commands. Another change has been made on the graphical interface or the elements that appear on the screen during the game. After all the technical work done to enhance the look of the game, it would have been a shame to leave the health and grip indicators present in the original. For this reason the health bar is less invasive and of a less saturated red while the indicThe spherical actor of the protagonist's grip, in addition to having become a gold color instead of lilac, has a line on the left side; as the adventure progresses, in fact, the protagonist becomes stronger and consequently the duration of the climbing hold increases. In the original game, unfortunately, this meant an increase in the diameter of the indicator, while the addition of the bar allows the extension of this skill without becoming graphically intrusive on the screen. From the game menu you can decide when to display them as well as enable/disable in-game hints and tips. As we mentioned, the title does not vary in content so as to faithfully reproduce even the collectibles present in the original such as the lizard tails or the unlockable extras in the time attack mode. The only absolute novelty of the remake is the photo mode, which allows players to capture moments of action and magnificent views of the landscape in a photograph, then modifying it with a series of filters that can also be applied in the game. And it is precisely at this point that the developers seem to have taken a slip, getting lost in a teacup. Playstation 4 trophies As was to be expected, PlayStation trophies are closely linked to game progress, where each defeated colossus will guarantee a reward, and to the numerous collectible extras in time trials. Shadow of the Colossus is one of those games that gives incredible sensations during the first run and that puts the skills of the most tenacious players to the test in the following ones. Nice, maybe too much As already mentioned, the greatest work was done on the technical component, an operation that was certainly appreciable but which perhaps went beyond what was necessary. The perplexity revolves in particular around the much-vaunted graphic options offered by PlayStation 4 Pro, where players will be able to favor resolution or framerate at their discretion. In fact, it is possible to play by activating one of the two modes offered by the remake: cinema or performance. The first enhances the image quality by offering those who have a screen that supports them, dynamic HDR and 4K, while in performance the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second. Bluepoint has confirmed that this performance will also be achieved on PlayStation 4 (which we were unable to test during the review phase, so we can only trust the developers' statements) but in all this variety of graphic options and customizations of the gaming experience , no one in their enthusiasm stopped to ask themselves the simplest question of all: was it necessary? No, it wasn't, especially considering what was sacrificed. In each of its modes and versions, the game obviously always appears different, but never respecting the original and given that so much emphasis has been placed on the performance offered by PS4 Pro at an advertising level, we address the issue with the right degree of fussiness. The 60 frames per second of the performance mode are certainly welcome but not necessary: those who played the original for PlayStation 2 will remember well the monstrous drops in framerate, 30 granite fps were more than enough... but we certainly can't complain about a technical upgrade. The real problem is that on PlayStation 4 Pro neither the performance mode nor the cinema return the true color palette of the game except by activating HDR. What makes Ueda's works visually recognizable are the precise choice and use of light and colour, in particular for Shadow of the Colossus an opaque and greenish patina was opted for which dampened even the brightest tones. A clever solution given that at the time of release there weren't the means to create a game with a high level of detail, but the decisions made on colors remain so over a decade later. What perhaps annoys more than anything else is to note how this technical drive has favored a realistic graphic rendering in favor of that dreamlike and alienating atmosphere of the original work. Therefore betraying an artistic choice in favor of a technical upgrade made exclusively not because there was the possibility to do so, and certainly not the need, is a slip-up that frankly we did not appreciate, especially after the level of care and love shown in dealing with more thorny design choices. It is right that current productions go hand in hand with the technologies offered, but if it is a title that has already been released, the priority is to achieve the highest possible degree of fidelity and although the game is visually satisfying, there is no resolution, framerate, light, particle effects and dynamic depth of field or other additional graphic improvements that hold if everything does not faithfully return the original atmosphere. The game is awesomeor to see but even the most beautiful panorama seems aseptic, a perfect technical exercise which in its beauty betrays the spirit of the past and favors a hyper-realistic graphic rendering in favor of the more dreamlike style of the original.
