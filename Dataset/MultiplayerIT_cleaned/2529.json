{"name": "Red Alert 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-alert-2.html", "text": "All quiet on the Western Front After the war, Alexi Romanov, an Allied bureaucrat, was placed at the head of the Soviet empire by the Allies. The Soviet threat thus seemed to have been nullified. Secretly, however, Romanov felt a deep hatred against those who had destroyed his country and began to organize his revenge unaware of the Allies, with the aim of conquering the United States. The Soviets carried out experiments on mind control for years and developed powerful nuclear weapons, until once these new technologies were developed, the invasion of the United States suddenly began, penetrating California, Texas and New York (mind control technology actually allows have all civilians line up on their side). Fortunately, the United States manages to organize itself and under the command of President Dugan they manage to gather the troops to arm them with some powerful technologies such as the control of time and the forces of nature, thus preparing for the new clash. How to play? Let's now look at the gameplay. The game that resides on the classic 2 CDs implements both a single player and a multiplayer mode, the second of which turns out to be the most interesting. However, let's start looking at singleplay. If until now you have played at least one of Westwood's strategic games you can start playing immediately without even having to read the manual, in fact the game has game mechanics that are almost unchanged compared to its predecessors, you will almost always end up with an MCV and some escort troops and you will have to start building your base starting from the classic power plants and then move on to the barracks, war factories and refineries and so on. The biggest changes are the elimination of the Silos (now all the resources will flow directly into the refinery), the presence of some structures that can be conquered by the engineers, including the oil wells that will increase the economic resources at your disposal, the hospitals (able to heal troops), the outpost that allows you to repair vehicles and the airport which, once captured at variable time intervals, allows you to parachute soldiers to a chosen point on the map. Another interesting novelty introduced by the game is the possibility for the troops to barricade themselves inside the various buildings on the map, once inside the building the troops will be able to fire on the enemy while remaining sheltered inside it until which is not destroyed. These are by and large the most important gameplay innovations introduced by RA2 as well as a reorganization of the command bar which is now faster and more comfortable to use. As far as allied troops are concerned, the most interesting novelty are the chrono-legionaries, soldiers capable of teleporting over time, you will therefore be able to move them instantly from one part of the map to another and equipped with a weapon that enables them to erase men, vehicles and buildings from time, if used properly they prove to be truly deadly. As for the Soviets, however, the Crazy Ivan who is able to place time bombs on enemy units and structures and Yuri, a soldier capable of taking control of opposing units and vehicles, are interesting. Nothing particularly revolutionary regarding the vehicles apart from the fact that now the Soviet excavators are armed with a small caliber cannon while the allied ones are able once the extraction of minerals is completed, to teleport directly to the base. The single-player game unfolds along a series of increasingly complex missions that are quite unrelated to each other, for example, you will never find a base or units built in a previous mission. In this episode, the possibility of choosing whether to face an objective through several simple missions or a more complex one has also been removed. Overall, the singleplayer turns out to be quite fun, much more frenetic than the previous chapters and interspersed with excellent, really well-acted cutscenes that lead you to continue in the missions to see how the various characters will behave. How to play? As far as multiplayer is concerned, things get decidedly more interesting, the modes are numerous, as is the community that can be found on the Westwood servers. Let's start by analyzing the various modes present. The first is the Quick Match in which the server will automatically take care of finding you a challenger with a similar skill level to yours and with a speed of cadequate connection. Then there is the Custom Match mode that will allow you to chat with other players and create a custom game in which you can choose between the Battle mode in which you can team up with opponents; Free for All where no alliances can be made; Unholy Alliance in which each player starts with one Soviet and one allied mobile construction vehicle, thus allowing players to build virtually all units and buildings in the game; Megawealth in which the only possibility to find resources is the capture of oil wells, in fact there are no minerals; Land Rush in which players start in the center of the battlefield with a mobile construction vehicle and several crates containing bonuses are scattered across the map and with the fog of war absent; Meat Grinder in which only infantry and tanks are available; Naval War in which players start the game on small islands and finally Cooperative in which two players face pre-set computer opponents together in a short campaign. Another modality, taken directly from Firestorm, the expansion of Tiberian Sun, is the World Domination Tour, in which three different theaters of war are present in rotation, North America, Europe and Southeast Asia, the players choose from which side to take, if with the allies or with the Soviets and each game won contributes to expanding the dominance of one of the two factions on the map until the total prevalence of one of the two. A good job From a graphic point of view, a good job has been done, the game is based on the same graphic engine of Tiberian Sun, therefore a mix of two-dimensional sprites and voxels, all however with a much higher detail, especially as regards the landscapes. hardware are however increased accordingly the minimum to play decently is a P2 266 with at least 64 MB of RAM which rise to 128 MB and a P2 450 in the case of multiplayer with more than 2 players, no 3D acceleration is required. The sound is also very good with the unmistakable music by Frank Klepacki, author of the soundtracks of the entire C&C series, all very rocking, and with the adaptation of the now famous Hell March. In conclusion RA2 proves to be a good strategy game, even if originality is not its strong point, so if you were expecting something different from the usual forget the game, while if you are a fan of the C&C series it is a purchase to be made closed eyes. All quiet on the Western Front Perhaps a little quieter than its predecessor Tiberian Sun, Westwood, one of the software houses behind the success of strategy games (the more experienced of you will remember the wonderful Dune 2, progenitor of the series of strategy games released by Westwood) has released Red Alert 2 which is proposed as a sequel to the first Red Alert. The question that all RTS fans will certainly ask themselves is whether Westwood has finally been able to introduce interesting innovations with this new strategy or even in this case has continued to rest on its laurels by always proposing the same historical and tested gameplay. Well, although with some interesting news RA2 can easily be defined as ~more of the same~ (for non-English speakers: the usual heated soup) even if terribly funny, let's now examine the latest Westwood effort in more depth. The story behind the game picks up where it left off in the previous Red Alert, in the first episode, the time travel experiments allowed Einstein to eliminate Hitler before he could prove to be a threat to humanity, the effect of this change of course of events led the Soviet Union to find itself with no one able to oppose its westward expansion, and therefore under the leadership of Stalin the westward expansion began with the clear intention of conquering the whole world. Thanks also to their technological superiority, the allies managed to counter the Soviet expansionist aims, and the battle ended with the victory of the allied troops and the death of Stalin, leaving the Soviet Union to an uncertain fate.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
