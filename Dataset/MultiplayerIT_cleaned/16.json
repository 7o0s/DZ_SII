{"name": "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl-recensione.html", "text": "Memories from the end of the world Having survived a car accident, we are saved by a fence who drags us into his hiding place. When we regain consciousness, we don't remember anything about our past. The only trace of what we were is contained in the memory of our PDA: we have to kill a certain Strelok. From here begins a long pilgrimage that will lead us to explore the area surrounding the Chernobyl plant, where radiation has changed the landscape and changed the local fauna, including humans, into real monsters. Despite the dangers, the area is very populated. Four factions fight to be able to control the areas richest in radioactive artifacts, i.e. objects made unique and very powerful by radiation. The landscape is made up of clearings populated by mutant dogs and other creatures of an unidentified nature, the ruins of many buildings abandoned after the accident (farms, factories, bridges, research centers, up to entire towns) and underground areas full of dangers. In short, there is a lot of geographical variety, although the general style of the different areas (the world is unique, but is divided into distinct areas) is uniform. Never as in this case is representation a game, given that the developers have sought a compromise between the realistic and the fantastic, taking a piece of reality and transforming it by hypothesizing the effects of an atomic disaster. Someone could identify in this scenario a metaphor of contemporary Russia, where opposing power groups raid the corpse of communism. Already at the time of the real events of Chernobyl we are talking about the psychological disaster of the communist regime, as well as the real one, but we don't want to fly too high and here it is better to stay glued to the game. Memories from the end of the world Right from the start it is possible to notice the greater complexity of the game interface compared to the competition: in addition to moving, shooting and changing weapons, in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you need to learn how to manage an inventory and you need to understand how to use a handheld from which you can draw a series of very useful information. Who said it looks like an RPG? Well done, that's right. The inventory allowed the developers to add some features that FPS normally dream of. For example the weight limit for transported objects or the need to eat in order not to starve. Items are found by searching corpses or by opening the various containers distributed across the clearings. The richest containers are those owned by some character and are usually well hidden. To find out the location it will generally be necessary to make the owner a corpse and subsequently interact with his mortal remains, still not decomposed. In this way, the position of his ~treasure~ will be obtained on the game map, which can be viewed on the handheld. In addition to enemy bullets (which we will discuss later), mutants, falls and hunger, there are other dangers that threaten our hero's health: radiation has created unstable zones scattered throughout the areas; go into it because of explosions that hurt a lot. walking around with something to do invites more in-depth exploration of areas that may have been snubbed Memories from the end of the world These critical areas are clearly visible because they slightly distort the surrounding air, but it can happen to end up in them while running away from some enemy or while walking backwards fighting. There are various ways, however, to identify them: by throwing a bolt to make them explode (we have an infinite number of them); listening to the signaller supplied which begins to emit increasingly acute and frequent beeps as we get closer; observing the mutants who, more often than not, end up in it; noticing when the image becomes grainy. The occurrence of the last possibility among those listed means that we have gotten a little too close and that we are risking our lives. Another danger to our solitary hero's health is represented by the radioactive zones. When you enter a highly radioactive area, or when you use an artifact, you suffer its harmful effects on your skin. This translates into the appearance at the bottom right of the classic icon representing the radiation danger (in addition to the growth of a green bar next to the energy) which, based on the color, will indicate how much we have been infected: if the icon is green the contagion was slight while if it tends to red we are in danger of life and our energy will begin to consume very quickly. There are various ways to cure yourself: injecting yourself with a serum that cancels the effects of radiation or drinking alcohol, which also causes a certain instability in the characterThu that will start to swing. Using the PDA and the quest system The handheld that was found with us following the accident shown in the opening video, provides a lot of vital information to be able to survive in an area so overflowing with dangers. How to live without the very useful map where our objectives and the exit points of the different areas are indicated? This precious tool will prove to be vital on more than one occasion, showing us the locations of the characters that are vital to us or, simply, the most interesting ones. In addition to the GPS functions, the handheld allows you to always have the list of quests at hand, with all the various tasks to be carried out in sequence and the time we have to do it. The quests are of two types, as the role-playing tradition wants: there are the main ones, which serve to carry on the story of our protagonist, and there are the secondary ones, which are used to accumulate a little money as well as to change relationships with the various factions. Side missions usually involve killing someone or retrieving a certain item. Unfortunately they are not structured very well and often require going back and forth on the map having to cross multiple zones. Since the loading times between one area and another are quite long and since always running around the same areas is not very fun, we get to try to avoid some quests in order to limit the walks necessary to complete them. It is also true, however, that the possibility of walking around with something to do encourages more in-depth exploration of areas that perhaps had been snubbed, quickly passing by while engaged in other more pressing affairs. The other options accessible from the PDA are: the Stalker ranking, which lists the scores of the best raiders in the square; the list of nearby characters, where you can read their attitude towards us; and, finally, a kind of encyclopaedia providing information on the areas visited. Shoot what happens to you Obviously we are talking about an FPS and shootings will be the order of the day throughout the adventure, despite the possibility of using more stealthy tactics using discreet weapons such as knives and silenced pistols. The weapons available are the classic ones taken from reality: various pistols, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, shotguns, a knife and more. Each of them, apart from the knife, will be loaded with bullets of different bills that will vary the damage caused by a single shot. They can be obtained in two ways: by buying them or by taking them from some enemy after having sent them to graze in the Elysian fields. Already from the first skirmish with some mutant cur it will be clear that we are not omnipotent and that the enemies take little time to send us from the highest; in short, entering a room full of armed and armored men, holding only a gun, means not having understood how combat works in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.; much better to seek cover, lean out of corners and wait for enemies to make the first move in order to catch them by surprise (well, at least you can try). entering a room full of armed and armored men, holding only a gun, means you have not understood well how combat works Shoot what happens to you Really the AI of the enemies is not exactly exceptional and, beyond an accurate and lethal aim, they often behave quite silly. The soldiers of F.E.A.R. in short, they are far away, but it is also true that the amount of information to be managed is much larger. Sure, standing behind a door and waiting for the silly guy to walk past us is a tactic that works a little too often, but it's also true that in some cases we had to carefully study the battlefield to be able to win against fierce groups. The fact remains that the shootings are a lot of fun, exceptional when you get to the advanced stages of the game, but a bitter taste remains for too naive behaviors that could have been avoided ... in short, we would not have minded seeing groups of opponents study a encirclement or use grenades to flush us out, as happens in other titles. Shoot what happens to you We just have to talk about the graphics engine and here are the pains. Make no mistake: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it is beautiful to see, especially being able to take advantage of the maximum detail. Too bad, however, that it is very heavy and that in some areas the framerate collapses dramatically. We talk about the fluidity problems in the hardware box, however know that the textures are very beautiful and detailed, the light effects sono high level, even if you have to enter the first underground tunnel to realize it, and the three-dimensional models are well done, especially those of the characters. The reconstruction of the elements that ~decorate~ the scenario deserves a separate mention: a painstaking work based on photographs and visits to the area, for which credit must be given to the graphics. However, there are some discordant notes: when the characters speak, the lip is missing, which is quite annoying, especially after the direct competition has affirmed this very small feature as a standard; in some cases there were some strange graphic glitches that disappeared after a few seconds; some models of the mutants could have been done better, especially the balls of meat that look like they came out of a cartoon of Hanna and Barbera. The sound deserves a separate note, truly spectacular and with a great atmosphere. The music coming from the stereo devices, the sound of the rain, the cries of the monsters, the voices (in Ukrainian) of the various characters, the unidentified sounds; everything contributes to immersing the player in a realistic and well-characterized world, generating sensations such as anguish and fear that greatly enrich the gaming experience. One last note before leaving the voice to comment: the game is subtitled in Italian and the dialogues with the main characters have been dubbed into our language. I take the liberty of not agreeing with this last choice which turns out to be alienating: hearing Ukrainian and Italian alternating does not have a good effect the voices could have been left in the original language and the translation limited to the subtitles, otherwise everything had to be translated, even the voices of the secondary characters. System requirements Update: given the various bugs present in the game and the fluidity problems complained of by many, Multiplayer.it has published a GUIDE TO OPTIMIZATION of the game. Also go download the first OFFICIAL PATCH that solves some big problems (BE CAREFUL: it makes old saves unusable, so adjust accordingly). This time we also use the hardware box to give some more detailed information on the configuration of the game. Firstly, the system it was tested on was sufficient to run decently with the details set to medium/high. In the more complex levels, however, there were noticeable drops in framerate; we went from 40 to 10 frames per second with just a few steps (normally this happened when very complex buildings were loaded). Even lowering the detail, the situation has not improved, leading to a maximum gain of 2/3 frames per second. Despite the 2 GB of ram, the uploads were still longish and rather annoying. Given the situation, we advise those with the minimum requirements to try the game before buying it, since they seem decidedly unrealistic. Obviously, in a video game where the atmosphere matters a lot, having to curtail all the graphic effects is quite emasculating. Please consider these warnings before proceeding with the purchase. Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or equivalent AMD RAM: 512 MB possibly at 400 MHz Video Card: GeForce 5700/Radeon 9600 with 128 MB Disk Space: 6.0 GB DirectX 9.0c DVD Player Recommended Requirements: Processor: Intel Core Duo E6400/AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200 RAM: 1.5 GB possibly at 400 MHz Video Card: GeForce 7900/Radeon X1950 with 256 MB Disk Space: 6.0 GB DirectX 9.0c DVD Drive Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Conclusions S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl represents the spearhead of videogame production coming from the territories of the former Soviet Union, which is establishing itself for the freshness of the themes and for a search for new playful mechanics compared to those now considered a standard (for example look at the work done with Pathologic). This is an atypical FPS that stands out for the originality of the background and game dynamics. We therefore feel like justifying some flaws and some shortcomings which, in any case, do not affect a product that must be judged for what it is: excellent. All these years of waiting have not been wasted and it can be said without fear of contradiction that it is one of the most interesting and satisfying gaming experiences of recent years, with ups (many) and downs (few). Too bad for the optimization of the graphics engine which leaves something to be desired and which will prevent many from fully enjoying the game. Pros Large and beautifully designed world Exciting gunplay Great atmosphere Cons Graphics engine is heavy Going back and forth between locations can be tiring Long loading times Mainsail dogs", "date": "2007-03-22", "grade": null}
