Names of players that apparently have nothing in common, but which put together undoubtedly bring a nostalgic smile to all fans of the Football Manager series. In fact, these are players who, over the course of the various editions of the football manager developed by Sports Interactive, have allowed the virtual manager on duty to find luck thanks to their performances, perhaps after having bought them cheaply when they were still teenagers Even if reality tells us that their path has not been as bright as in many of our simulations, these are names for which we have all rooted even in real life. Perhaps based on their performance in the video game to buy them even in fantasy football, when some of them played in Italy. It's just one of the many side effects of Football Manager, a series that can now boast a history of over twenty years and a following of enthusiasts who await the release of the new edition every year. A tradition that has invariably been renewed this time too: so let's go and see what's new in the review of Football Manager 2022, to be released for PC (also on Xbox Game Pass) and Mac very soon, on November 9, 2021. The new Data Center Football Manager 2022: One of the Data Center charts One of the innovations presented with greater prominence by Sports Interactive for this new chapter of Football Manager is the Data Center. It is a brand new section, accessible through the appropriate item in the menu on the left of the screen. The Data Center is not available as soon as we take control of a team, as it will be necessary to play a certain number of games to allow the specialized staff members (to be recruited like scouts and trainers) to get their hands on the collected statistics. This is clearly an evolution of the xG (expected goals) statistic already introduced with Football Manager 2021, integrated into a series of broader evaluations that embrace practically all aspects related to the performance of our team on the pitch. Through some easy-to-understand graphs for example, we can learn what is the success rate of shots from outside the area compared to the average of the league in which we find ourselves, or in the same way understand if the amount of dribbling attempted by the attackers has a real beneficial effect on the goal chances created, or instead, it only ends up making us lose possession. From the same analysts who create these graphs we also receive indications on individual performances, also in this case with accompanying visual elements that allow us to better understand what is being proposed to us. In the same way, the evaluation of the opposing teams is carried out, in order to understand what their strengths and weaknesses are in just a few steps. We must admit at this point that we have somewhat underestimated the impact of the Data Center on the announcement of Football Manager 2022, as the reality of the facts says that once we got to know its features better we began to appreciate them and spend more and more minutes inside. In fact, it has proved to be a useful tool for understanding how to modify the team's tactics from time to time, in several cases also seeing real benefits on the performance of a Sassuolo who after a few days floated above the last in the standings, and then leapt behind of Europe. Staff meetings: all in one place Football Manager 2022 Tactics Screen As well as the Data Centre, another aspect that ends up significantly improving the life of the manager in Football Manager 2022 is the regular meeting with the staff. Not so much for the addition of particular innovations inside it compared to the suggestions that were already given to us previously, but for the possibility of collecting in it everything that observers, trainers and other insiders of the company have to offer. tell us. In the past all these elements were in fact mixed with the others in the incoming mail, creating confusion and causing waste of time for those who were not willing to take care of all the suggestions when they were delivered. In addition to bundling all of this together, staff meetings also allow you to choose what their cadence is, therefore giving the player full control over the frequency of interactions. Also in this case we had underestimated the possible impact of this novelty, thanks to which the flow of the game and of the operations appears much more fluid. Too bad for the absence of real news in the proposals coming from the staff, dall similar to those that were made to us in the past. interaction and management Football Manager 2022: the final day of the transfer market In this paragraph, we collect the rest of the management experience within Football Manager 2022, starting from transfers. In this context, the most relevant novelty consists in a review of the last day of the market window, taking part in which one will find oneself catapulted into a bombardment of news that tries to reproduce the real experience faced by the operators of the teams involved in the sale of the cards. In this case, media news is only part of what we have to deal with, being able to count first of all on a countdown that shows us how much time we have to place our shots, together with the list of most recent transfers and the status of our players marked as transferable. In this phase it will also happen to be approached by agents looking for new clubs for their players at the last minute, in order to strike up a quick deal to buy those that attract our attention. As for the other aspects of Football Manager 2022, everything is more or less as we left it a year ago. Interactions with the media and especially those with the players, for example, continue to benefit from the review carried out on body language, however, especially in the case of journalists, abusing the occasions in which questions are asked. Between phone calls, before and after the match and the tunnel in the changing rooms, the temptation to delegate everything to the deputy remains very great, even if we must say that in this edition we have at least encountered more pertinent questions from the media. A similar discourse concerns the tactics of the game, within which the addition of the wide central defender stands out, to allow virtual managers to let their team play like Gasperini's Atalanta or Conte and Inzaghi's Inter. 3D engine and new animations Football Manager 2022 - game action in 3D engine. Let's now move on to the moment when it's finally time to take the field, because even in this case there are new features that are worth dwelling on for a moment. From a graphic point of view, the elements on the screen remain those of Football Manager 2021, with which Sports Interactive had revised the interface of the match screen. With several months of gameplay behind us, we must say that we are now used to the new arrangement of elements on the monitor. Going further we find the new animation engine, also advertised by the developers in the Football Manager 2022 announcement phase. The impact of this novelty can be felt quite quickly once you hit the field. In fact, the players now appear less woody and their movements more fluid, also staging slightly more particular ball controls when they try to dribble. It is clear that complete fluidity still remains a goal to be achieved, but the leap in sight compared to the previous edition was clear to us and bodes well for the future. Good also for what concerns the artificial intelligence of the players, less inclined to launch into actions without rhyme or reason, but above all for the use made of the VAR. Unlike previous editions in which the slow motion on the pitch had already been introduced, Football Manager 2022 in fact makes the outcome of the checks carried out from time to time by the referees less predictable.", "date": "2021-11-04", "grade": "8.5"}
