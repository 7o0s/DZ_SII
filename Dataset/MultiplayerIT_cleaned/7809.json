In fact, the character created by Bram Stoker did not share any trait with the monster hunter stereotype: we are talking about an elderly doctor who knows the nature of vampires and how they can be killed, but who could be anything but a worthy hero. of an action movie. We therefore learn with relative satisfaction that the protagonist of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is not the Van Helsing we know, but his son, who grew up surrounded by all too real legends and specialized, over the years, in eliminating vampires, werewolves, trolls and any other kind of monstrous creatures. The boy has now quite a bit of experience when, together with his ghostly companion Katarina, he reaches the fictitious location of Borgovia. Here he learns of the existence of real armies of monsters ready to destroy the city and decides to help the inhabitants, first going to save the mayor from a group of werewolves, then providing his support to the village alchemist, struck by a curse that prevents him from speaking. Borgovia therefore functions as a hub for accessing the various quests that are offered to us from time to time, and which include extensive exploratory phases crowned by frequent fights. Sword and pistol The introductory sequence is very reminiscent of some sequences from the film ~Sherlock Holmes~, the one with Robert Downey Jr., and together with a very valid musical accompaniment it manages to create the best possible atmosphere to face a title like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. The early stages of the game act as a tutorial for the control system and skill tree, with the latter allowing the protagonist to independently enhance his ability to fight with firearms, ranged, or with sword, in melee. The young Van Helsing is therefore a mix between ~tank~ and ~ranged~, if we want to think in MOBA style, and can switch from one equipment to another by simply pressing a button. The references to the multiplayer online battle arena genre are in fact numerous and are substantially reflected in the controls, which need a generous customization session to be effective during the most complicated situations. The initial configuration is in fact a half-disaster, with the directional arrows determining the direct movement of the character and the various keys for the use of powers or potions at a great distance, on the left side of the keyboard. Van Helsing can move as in the RTS, by clicking on the area of the scenario to reach, but this type of solution proves to be very cumbersome during the fights, therefore one is led to prefer direct control (once the directions have been repositioned on the traditional WASDs) and to exploit the pointer only for the use of weapons, which do not have a lock-on. I chose you, a ghost, as a friend Katarina, the specter that accompanies us in the various quests, plays a very important role during the clashes and also has a set of skills. We can decide whether to let it attack enemies from afar or from a short distance, using its mighty claws, or even transform it into a sort of bonus for Van Helsing's abilities (moreover, its eventual defeat in battle will only involve a waiting period to get back to health, being a ghost). All these decisions can and often must be made very quickly, otherwise the game is over, which reaffirms the absolute importance of a job of customizing the controls. The developers have placed great emphasis on the exploratory element, offering us decidedly large maps full of things to discover, whether they are hidden chests or magical altars, traps or real curses that are just waiting for a victim to rage on. The player is given the opportunity to complete the mission even without dissecting everything that the scenario has to offer, but it is an approach that fans of this genre of games are unlikely to choose to adopt. The point is that the enthusiasm for the many new discoveries can translate, at a certain point, into a relative boredom in the face of very similar situations, which are not supported by a combat system that is up to the situation. In fact, in front of an entire army of monsters, one frequently finds oneself fleeing trying to place a few hits, eliminate the vanguard and then retrace one's stepsto finish the job. Who doesn't hunt in company... The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing campaign can also be played in cooperative mode for four players, even if our experience in this sense has been limited by some technical problems (in the process of being resolved, judging by the frequency of updates) and by the presence of few users in the first days of marketing on Steam. Facing the adventure together with companions makes things much easier, while doing everything alone means spending at least ten hours in the ghostly woods that surround Borgovia, inhabited by a myriad of monsters and full of mysteries that are just waiting to be discovered. be revealed. The strength of the Neocore production is precisely the substance, which succeeds in catapulting us into a fascinating atmosphere thanks to the discreet technical sector, which also moves between ups and downs, and the aforementioned emphasis on the exploratory phase, with many objects that the protagonist can collect and manage in a very simple inventory, so as to use the best possible equipment before launching into battle with yet another horde of demonic creatures. Killed enemies do not reappear and one cannot therefore expect an ~infinite~ experience, nor a particular attention to grinding (which, however, is present and appears well balanced), which inevitably sacrifices replayability together with the lack of classes to choose from . However, we are talking about a game that is sold at a price of 10.99 euros and which for this amount actually offers a lot of fun.
