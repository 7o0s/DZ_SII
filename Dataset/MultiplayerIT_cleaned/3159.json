{"name": "Zombie Army Trilogy per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zombie-army-trilogy-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "The Zombie Army Trilogy review also catapults Nintendo Switch owners into an alternative World War II in which Adolf Hitler, now cornered in the last stages of the conflict, uses the knowledge of the occult acquired by the Reich to bring dead Nazi soldiers back to life and thus create an unstoppable army of zombies to turn the situation around. The only one who can stop the diabolical plans of the Fuhrer is the American sniper Karl Fairburne, protagonist of the mother series Sniper Elite. Received the difficult assignment, the man travels to bomb-ravaged Berlin to figure out what is the deadly weapon Hitler was saving for last, finding himself faced with a seemingly endless horde of undead hungry for living flesh. How to get rid of them once and for all? By shooting him in the head, of course. Structure and gameplay Zombie Army Trilogy is a collection that includes the first three chapters of the Rebellion series, whereas the recent (and convincing!) Zombie Army 4: Dead War will probably never arrive on the Nintendo console. From the start screen you can immediately access each of these titles and the five chapters that make up the campaign, perhaps in a way that is a little too detached from a normal, hard-earned progression. In any case, the experience can be tackled alone or in cooperative multiplayer for up to four participants, both in local wireless and online: needless to say, playing with friends is much more fun and it is possible to set up some interesting strategies of contrast to the advance of the zombies. This is particularly true for the second and third games of the series, which unlike the beginnings use a structure of watertight compartments to organize the waves instead of a completely open map, in which situations appear a little too random. The types of enemies also increase, thanks in particular to the introduction of alternative soldiers and ferocious minibosses that enliven the situation. Finally, the presence of the Horde mode represents an interesting extra for those who love the challenge, thanks to its endless approach. The total duration of the package? Fifteen hours, minimum. The gameplay starts from the solid foundations of Sniper Elite, the mother series, but is completely deprived of the stealth elements and adapted to a highly repetitive action, in which we find ourselves shooting the undead as they approach our position. In each stage there are moments in which a switch must be activated to give life to a real assault by enemies, along the lines of the classic Left 4 Dead, and it is at this juncture that a minimum of strategy in the placement of bombs is useful , explosives and traps that can slow down the progress of the zombies and allow us to thin out their ranks a little without consuming too much ammunition. The gunplay favors precision shots and the X-ray kill cams emphasize the most spectacular shots in a bloody way, highlighting the damage that the bullet inflicts on the already tortured and decomposing bodies of our opponents, but the clashes from a short distance appear substantially less refined and pleasant. The Nintendo Switch version The original Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army was released in 2013 and definitely feels the weight of the years, both from a technical point of view and from that of the mechanics that the developers have subsequently refined, so much so that already in the second and third chapters you can see some important improvements.Unlike the PS4 and Xbox One versions, unfortunately the trilogy runs on Nintendo Switch at only 30 frames per second, and this lower fluidity negatively impacts the controls and the general experience, also because it seems that the authors have not paid particular attention to frame pacing and have limited themselves to insert a block for clear performance needs. The result? An annoying feeling of jerkiness. This lack, in combination with a fairly dated graphics (especially in the polygonal models) and with a control system that suffers from a little latency and dead zones, unfortunately undermines the enjoyment of a gameplay that certainly has its drawbacks. moments, especially when you manage to effectively defend the position through a pinch of strategy. In boss fights, however, poor precision comes at a high price, and it is probably for this reason that we tried to patch it up by also activating motion detection via gyroscope: with the default settings this feature allows you to adjust the aim just enough to remedy the deficiencies of the analog sticks, but obviously we would have preferred not to need it. Nothing to say instead about the sound, thanks to a mix of synths80s and eerie wails manages to create a perfect atmosphere for this kind of experience.", "date": "2020-03-31", "grade": "6.8"}
