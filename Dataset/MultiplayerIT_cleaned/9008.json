Too bad that the first attempt by the developers did not meet with the approval of the fans, to the point of convincing the Californian team to return its focus to solo adventures, stopping to deepen the multiplayer while waiting for more mature times. Well, now that the Future trilogy has finally come to an end on PlayStation 3, and now that the audience of online gamers has increased considerably compared to some time ago, Insomniac, with its new studio in North Carolina, has well thought of taking advantage of it to take a break from the main Ratchet & Clank series and propose an episode where multiplayer is not just a secondary component, but where everything revolves around the cooperative experience. Insomniac's Musketeers Since its announcement, All for One has always been seen as a minor chapter, certainly less ambitious than the past episodes on PlayStation 3, and in fact the fears of the fans were not entirely unfounded. Starting from the funny introductory movie, from the level selection menus and from the very first moments of the game, it is clear that the plot is certainly not the strong point of the new Ratchet & Clank, which uses a simpleton and a bit trivial pretext to deploy on the same side the two heroes, Qwark and Dr. Nefarious. In short, there is a lack of a presentation capable of immediately immersing the player, and for the duration of the adventure, the story sketched out by the guys from Insomniac never offers a twist or a really excited situation. If nothing else, fans of the series will find some characteristic elements of the franchise, starting with fantastic cutscenes in computer graphics which, combined with the comical voices of the characters, almost give the impression of interacting with a Pixar film. Of course, once you are back in command of your alter-ego, the difference can be seen, but even if Tutti per Uno certainly does not stand out for its technical achievement, some scenarios seemed extremely lively and full of details, with ever-changing backdrops and battles with quite spectacular bosses, where the frame drops in the most excited moments are rare enough not to represent a nuisance. Separate discussion for the abandonment of the mobile camera in favor of a fixed one, a drastic choice clearly due to the need to have several players on the screen at the same time but which, if it leaves those approaching the series for the first time indifferent, could distort the nose to that slice of historical enthusiasts now accustomed to using the right stick to freely rotate the view around your character. Playstation 3 trophies In Ratchet & Clank: All for One, 45 trophies are offered, about ten of which are hidden. Fortunately there aren't many that are unlocked simply by progressing through the adventure, but a good portion of these entice players to perform certain actions in some levels or to score a certain number of enemies using specific weapons. In short, those who want to unlock all the trophies will find themselves spending many hours playing and replaying the various levels both in single and in cooperative, using all the characters available. Between merits and compromises At the heart of Ratchet & Clank: All for One is obviously the much anticipated co-op mode for two, three or four players, both locally and online. Each level has been designed to be enjoyable regardless of the number of characters present, and at any time a friend can choose his alter-ego and join a game in progress. Cooperation will happen from time to time, but to tell the truth, the moments when coordination and interaction are necessary to overcome a particular obstacle are quite rare. The game reaches its climax when the characters are asked to navigate a platform to avoid crashing into the traffic of Luminopolis, or when they must coordinate to drive a huge hovercraft through rough waters, or when free-falling down a ventilation duct, they must try to approach and hold hands. The rest of the time is spent almost entirely throwing one's partner on otherwise unreachable platforms or competing for the collection of bolts, which in All for One, in addition to being expendable to buy new weapons and upgrades, also determine the winner at the end of each level.The developers also wanted to stimulate competition between the participants by proposing small speed challenges that give bonuses to those who, for example, get fired first from a cannon or are the fastest to energize a power supply. Those of the Future series who loved the quantity of weapons that Ratchet could obtain and use can breathe a sigh of relief: this time selectable via the right analog stick, the numerous gadgets also contain some exclusive weapons for each character, perhaps allowing Ratchet to create a puppet capable of attracting the attention of enemies, or Dr. Nefarious to become invisible for a certain amount of time. There's so much to enjoy, and even if the various levels almost never stimulate you to have a tactical approach rather than another, the players themselves will want to experiment with various combinations of weapons. It is no coincidence that the emphasis is much more on combat and less on the platform sections, with the various companions who constantly find themselves in the midst of frenetic firefights in which it is always preferable to aim at the same enemy to cause greater damage; a similar speech also applies to the huge bosses, in which most of the time it is necessary to fire jointly at specific trigger points. But how does All for One work in single? Pretty good, we have to admit it: if you play as Ratchet, the player is always supported by a support AI in the role of little Clank, who is activated from time to time to allow you to pass those sections that would normally require the intervention of a other player. In this case, unfortunately, the battles appear clearly 'tailor-made' for multiple players, and you end up missing the frenzy and sense of epicness that Insomniac has always tried to include in the chapters of the main series.", "date": "2011-10-18", "grade": "7.8"}
