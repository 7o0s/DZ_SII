But something goes wrong, and a gigantic explosion fills the Earth's orbit with large asteroids and fragments of space stations. The astronauts of the International Space Agency (ISA) are tasked with identifying those responsible for the catastrophe, who in all probability militate among the ranks of the Moon Mining Cooperative (MMC). The two factions collide, giving rise to an all-out clash (it is appropriate to say it) which is consumed at a great distance from the unsuspecting population of planet Earth. When help arrives, they will most likely find only one group of survivors waiting for them: ISA or MMC? This is the incipit of Shattered Horizon, first person shooter in multiplayer (available exclusively for the Steam platform) which is the first contribution of Futuremark Games Studio to the world of PC video games. In space, no one can hear you chat The game action is strongly characterized by the scenario and its physical laws: in the open space there is no gravity and the members of the ISA and MMC move using the thrusters of their suits, with the possibility, however, of ~joining~ to the closest surface to gain stability and shooting accuracy. Unfortunately, there is only one weapon at our disposal, a rifle equipped with sixty-round magazines and infinite ammunition, which lends itself to two shooting modes: the standard burst mode and the precision one with zoom, cadenced shots and a strong recoil. In both cases, shooting while floating or shooting while ~anchored~ to a surface produces vastly different effects. And it is above all on this that the strategic elements of Shattered Horizon are based: if we move using the thrusters of the suit, we gain speed but the opponents can see us and attack us even from a great distance; walking on a wall or on a rock, on the other hand, means proceeding slowly but at the same time having the possibility of lying in wait and treacherously attacking an enemy. It is also possible to turn off the suit's electronic systems to move in absolute silence, exposing yourself to risks in exchange for near-total invisibility. There are basically two alternative attack maneuvers: the first consists in hitting the opponent in close combat with the blade of the rifle, the second involves throwing a ~smoke~ grenade, with electrical or repulsive noise. There are three different game modes available: Assault, Battle and Skirmish. The first two are based on control points: in Assault our team must take turns attacking or defending their positions from enemies, and at the end of the game the faction that owns the most ~territories~ wins; in Battle, on the other hand, the phases are mixed and therefore there is no fixed rule, it is enough to conquer the greatest number of control points. Finally, the Skirmish mode is nothing more than the classic deathmatch in which what matters is the number of kills made by both sides. In all cases, a maximum of thirty-two players can participate (therefore sixteen per team) and there are several servers with indication of latency and type of game. Let's enjoy the view The Futuremark Games Studio product stands out for its exclusive character (only for PC, only on Steam, only for Windows Vista or Windows 7) which also concedes little from the point of view of the relatively expensive hardware requirements. Despite everything, we were able to test it without too many problems using a good old Athlon64 X2 5000+: keeping the resolution at 1680 x 1050, all the details at maximum and the antialiasing at 2X, the game runs at just under 30 fps. Considering the graphics, however, one wonders how exactly the computing capacity of our video card is used: the four available scenarios are anything but boundless and the background consists solely of the usual pattern of stars, as well as a beautiful reproduction of planet Earth. The weakest aspect however is the design, with the locations all ending up looking alike and a general lack of ideas. The textures are well made but only enhance close-up shots, while a good job has been done with regards to shadows and lighting. There is some excellent music, very ~cinematic~, which however only brightens the menu screens, while during the action the effects remain on an average level, without leaving a particular mark.", "date": "2009-11-09", "grade": "7.3"}
