Taking advantage of the release of the film, which among other things has already been released in America on February 10th, the guys from Grab Games, helped and produced by Starbreeze Studios, those from Payday, have seen fit to quickly develop a sort of tie-in made exclusively for VR, to be precise only for HTC Vive. We therefore approached this John Wick Chronicles hoping not to find ourselves faced with the inevitable ~commercialization~. Unfortunately we were very wrong. Maybe it could have made sense to take advantage of the cinematographic appeal to launch a free to play enriched with some clever micro-transactions on Steam, and instead the developer and publisher have seen fit to distribute an apparently complete title sold for the incredible figure of 19, 99. Before deepening our judgment, however, it is a must to explain in detail what this John Wick Chronicles is. It is a very simple shooting range with a first person view: a shooter where the protagonist, absolutely nailed to the spot, has to shoot dozens of enemies that appear on the screen in more or less choreographed ways and which act as an appetizer for the inevitable boss of end of level. If you have taken a look at Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope or Space Pirate Trainer, you know perfectly well what to expect since it is a genre that has never evolved since the ancient Duck Hunt or Operation Wolf. With the only exception of the increase in engagement guaranteed by the recent introduction of virtual reality. Obviously what makes the difference with the titles mentioned above is the setting which leans, with great savings, on what was seen in the two films. The initial phase of the game, which also serves as a selection menu, is in fact set in the reception of the Continental hotel with an excellent Lance Reddick recreated in an excellent way in the guise of Charon. The player obviously wears Wick's clothes even if these clothes are limited only to his gloves and a handful of weapons that we will be able to take up and which should be based on those used by Keanu Reeves in the cinematic sequel. There are also some small references to the plot of the second film and, halfway through the game experience, a microscopic excerpt from the film but, other than that, nothing else. The practice of tie-ins also reaches virtual reality by taking advantage of the figure of John Wick The game offer Specifically, what will we find ourselves playing once the almost 20 is spent? A tutorial where we will learn how to use Vive's two 3D controllers to shoot and reload, and three levels set in a parking lot, in the external courtyard of a villa and on a yacht. End. Even if you don't want to be particularly experienced with this gameplay, it will never take you more than an hour to finish the game the first time, even by witnessing the microscopic narrative sequences that take place within the Wick suite and which divide the four settings. There is a minimum of replayability guaranteed by the three difficulty levels and by the double game mode available, arcade and simulation (in the latter you have to manually reload the weapon by collecting the magazines and inserting the first bullet in the barrel) but you will hardly pass anymore of an afternoon or evening with John Wick Chronicles. Even the variety of enemies does not help considering that they are practically only more or less armored soldiers, possibly also protected by an anti-riot shield, and by a handful of vehicles to be shot down (an armored vehicle and a helicopter) which act as bosses. Instead, what works very well is the dynamics of the shootings which, exactly as happened in Arizona Sunshine, forces the player to aim using the physical sights of the weapons (there is no graphic pointer to be clear) with a small gem represented by the shotgun sniper where we will be able to experience the magnifying effect by looking through the lens mounted on the weapon. Hitting an enemy on the head also guarantees small bonuses represented by first aid kits (although in reality it is enough to stay repaired for a few seconds to automatically recover vital energy), laser pointers or temporary shields represented by bulletproof vests. Another positive element is then represented by the covers. Taking full advantage of the spatial positioning guaranteed by HTC Vive, although we cannot move in the environment, we will still be able to bend down to take cover behind counters, vases and various furnishings using small openings to hit opponents without risking re-fireback or even shooting blindly from above the cover by only raising the weapons. In the most frenetic moments we must admit that we also had fun for a few seconds by throwing ourselves into plastic poses in order to have very small viewing angles from which to be able to hit the countless opponents. We dedicate the last words to the technical aspect of John Wick Chronicles. Graphically the title is unfortunately insufficient. If we exclude some surrounding elements of the scenarios, the models of the (few) weapons and the aforementioned digital reproduction of Lance Reddick, unfortunately all the rest is bad: from the enemies practically all the same and faceless to the non-existent physics, to the explosions completely devoid of particles. And how can we not mention the incredible and conspicuous slowdowns that occur, in particular, in the parking level despite the low resolution of the rendering and the total absence of noteworthy anti-aliasing. We appreciate the developer's effort in dubbing the title entirely in Italian but unfortunately soon the very few sentences that characterize the indications of the guide voice transmitted through Wick's headset become even annoying so much they are repetitive. As far as the soundtrack is concerned, we can simply say that it hasn't arrived.", "date": "2017-02-14", "grade": "4.0"}
