Just like Opposing Fronts, Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor is also marketed as a stand-alone expansion. This means that you can buy the game even without owning the original title, although having to submit to some limitations such as the rather obvious one of not being able to undertake the missions belonging to the two previous episodes. Short is not beautiful On the single player front, Tales of Valor puts us in front of three mini-campaigns each made up of a handful of missions, for a total of nine, focused on the deeds of valiant (precisely) men who, thanks to their heroic deeds, managed to mark the lives of their fellow soldiers and, why not, to influence the course of history itself. The beginning of Tiger Ace, for example, puts us in control of a famous Panzer Tiger I tank belonging to the 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion, which survived the Russian Campaign to find itself intertwining the path of the British Seventh Division, right during the D-Day, near the village of Villers-Bocage, on the way to Caen. What is remembered as one of the bloodiest and most celebrated battles between heavy vehicles in history, is therefore reproduced by Tales of Valor through a handful of missions that retrace - with numerous poetic licenses, to tell the truth - the entire line of events that led to the important (although useless for the progress of the war) victory of the German armies. In Causeway we will parachute into the Normandy countryside just in the hours following the landing on D-Day and in Falaise Pocket we will return to wearing the clothes of the Wehrmacht in a desperate attempt to stop the advance of the Allies. Ludically, all three episodes are characterized by the fact that they present themselves as experiences that are as short as they are intense. The mix of graphics still in step with the times, combined with the presence of (almost) completely destructible scenarios that boast an excellent implementation of the Havok physics engine, gives life to spectacular and adrenaline-pumping moments to say the least. Not to mention the sub-woofers of your 5.1 systems that will be put to the test. Unfortunately, even at the highest difficulty levels, it will be possible to complete the nine missions in a couple of afternoons of not too intensive play. From this point of view, the fact that the passage between one mission and another ~remembers~ the previously demolished and destroyed buildings is of little use. This takes on more of an aesthetic aspect than not directly aimed at tactics, thus completely eliminating the replayability factor. In a certain way more significant - at least for multiplayer purposes - the introduction of the new direct fire control system. Just as it already happens in Men of War by the unknown Digitalmindsoft, now it will therefore be possible to replace the artificial intelligence by directly taking control of means and units to aim and therefore shoot. Once tested in the field, the system works very well with infantry and less so with tanks. Indeed, in the latter case, given the relative slowness of the turret in aligning itself with the fire area indicated by the mouse pointer, it is practically essential to use keyboard shortcuts to activate the various commands, so as not to divert the aiming of the mouth of fire. Action strategy The Multiplayer counterpart is less stingy, not so much for the exorbitant presence of unpublished contents, but for the introduction of the three new game modes which together with the new units (Schwimmwagene and Staghound above all) manage to revive an already complete title and in the full of his maturity. We start with the Assault mode, perhaps the most traditionalist one, where two enemy fronts collide until one of the two factions manages to destroy its objective. In Stonewall together with three other players (therefore four in total) you will have to face waves of enemy attacks of ever increasing strength, while in Panzerkreig you take command of a single tank trying to destroy, in an all-against-all flavor 80s, the most opponents. As already mentioned, the same direct fire control finds its natural complement in this area. The vaguely arcade and action-oriented nature of the new game modes marry perfectly with the mechanics provided by the new control system. On the sidelines, the fact that the additional units are not usable in the Skirmishes remains rather inexplicable, just as they appeared to us for a momentor exaggerated the 8 GB and broken that you will have to put up with if you decide to buy the game through the Digital Delivery channels.
