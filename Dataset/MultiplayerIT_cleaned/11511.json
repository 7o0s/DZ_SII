{"name": "The Big Con", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-big-con-recensione.html", "text": "Ali is a seventeen year old girl who lives with her mother Linda. The two spend a lot of time together talking and watching movies from the catalog of the video library run by the woman. We are in the 90s, mobile phones are still a rarity (they don't exist at all in the game) and the internet has yet to unfold its full potential. Unfortunately, despite appearances, Linda is very worried: she owes a large sum to a loan shark and if he doesn't repay it within a few days, she will lose the video library. Ali overhears a conversation between her mother and the criminal, leaving her shocked. He therefore decides to do something in order not to lose everything: work to accumulate enough money. The problem is that the jobs available in the city for a young woman like her are few and they yield very low sums. How to find almost one hundred thousand dollars in the short time available? To lead her on the path of crime is a certain Ted, a stranger that Ali meets while selling ice cream. He will be the one to route her towards the theft and he will always be the one who will propose her to take a trip to reach the city of Las Venganza, where to carry out a great coup that will fix both of them. Such are the premises of this narrative adventure which, as you can read in the review of The Big Con, entertains without ever really going to the bottom. The 90s Ali, the protagonist The game begins in Linda's video library, where you become familiar with the multiple-choice dialogue system, in which you press the key corresponding to the parts of the interlocutor's sentence that you want to explore (when possible) and with the peculiar graphic style, studied by the art director Saffron Aurora: everything is drawn and animated by hand to follow the style and culture of the 90s, taking full advantage of many cartoons of that era, such as Doug, Hey Arnold!, Rugrats and many others . Even the soundtrack is composed of songs in line with those years, some of which are very beautiful. The overall effect is truly excellent in its simplicity and gives The Big Con a unique feeling. Traveling around this small world made up of characters with colorful and perpetually angry faces, in which every element recalls those years now the object of veneration by vintage lovers, is pleasant in itself. It's like looking at a postcard from a faded time that brings back fond memories. The player has direct control over Ali, who can basically do three things: talk to other characters, snatch them, and interact with or collect items. Basically, the player must explore all the scenarios, trying to accumulate the amount needed to move on to the next stage. If he wants, however, he can also pursue other objectives, some obtained by dialogue, others by looking around. Be that as it may, the aim is always to make money, but depending on how one behaves, one can accumulate more or less and one can have more or less interesting encounters. If you want, certain objectives can be ignored completely and the adventure can still be continued, reaching the next stage of the journey (more on that later). During his wanderings, Ali will visit his town, a large shopping center, a train, Las Venganza and other places that lead to the grand finale and that we are not going to tell you so as not to spoil the surprise. Snatch In The Big Con, snatching is very easy The gameplay of The Big Con is all about walking around talking to other characters to get clues on how to proceed. Alternatively, you can spend your time robbing the entire map population to scrape together some extra cash. The mechanics of the snatch is very simple: you hold down a key to make an arrow run along a bar. To succeed you have to stop the arrow on the colored part, which shrinks over time. If you are caught, you will lose the chance to snatch the character again and, after three errors, you will have a bigger penalty at the scenario level. In reality, snatching is really easy: consider that for the total four hours that the game lasts we made a mistake only once, a sign that the system is thought of more as a recreational activity to break the pace of the game, than as a way to embarrass the player. In reality, theft also has another function: to allow you to advance without the need to solve the various puzzles ... which, if you like, is also the biggest limitation of The Big Con. Escape routes Unfortunately the characters are not explored much In order for you to understand the main problem of The Big Con, it is worth telling you about what we did in the mall, the second map. Entered the area we started talking to a few characters, snatching chwherever we came within range. We went into shops, found little missions to do and so on. Unfortunately, we accidentally went to the place where Ted was waiting for us. Having accumulated the amount necessary to overcome the area with muggings, the game has seen fit to advance the adventure, without giving us the possibility to choose and without making us carry out the other missions. In the following scenarios you will have more choice in this sense, but the problem is not the freedom granted to the player, but another: snatching seems like a loophole that allows you to pass a large part of the game without great effort. It is practically always possible to get ahead by doing very little of what is required of us. Of course, in this way interesting interactions and recurring characters are lost along the way, who perhaps have mini stories to tell and make us live, such as the aspiring comedian whose lines we can correct throughout the game, or the lover of a woman who he has known only in epistolary form and that he wants to attend live, but the game is not interested. In short, in The Big Con there is a lot to see, but it often seems that it is the game itself that suggests that it is not necessary to delve into it, offering us very comfortable escape routes. The substance is that you can still get to the end without major penalties and without the possibility of failing the main objective, despite having left out a lot. Las Venganza is the biggest map in The Big Con and also the most interesting to explore Just the ending completely disincentives to replay, because it's positive regardless of how you behaved for the entire game. Perhaps it would have been better to foresee the possibility of failure, in order to entice him to redo the (very short) adventure to try to improve. Instead nothing, in the end something happens that solves everything anyway, in defiance of every decision made. Too bad, because The Big Con had great potential, which however at present it does not seem capable of expressing at its best. To make the situation even worse, the writing, really elementary and youthful, with sometimes very poor dialogues, obsessed as they have been since the 90s and with certain formulas that frankly appear false. Not that the script is disastrous, just that it pretends to be a bit too old-fashioned, so to speak, and never really gives space to the characters, who finally turn out to be mere specks... straight out of the 90s , but still flat and, ultimately, empty.", "date": "2021-08-31", "grade": "6.5"}
