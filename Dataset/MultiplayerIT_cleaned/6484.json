It even seems to have shrunk compared to the Early Access version we tried a few months ago, which offered much larger maps. It's easy to describe it: it's a twin stick shooter with zombies where you have to survive hordes of increasing difficulty that attack day and night. In addition to the usual slow moaning chunks of meat, you also have to contend with creatures such as rare steaks, flame shooters, strange and very voracious birds, giant crabs, flying eyes and zombie dogs. The goal is only one: to survive. To do this, in addition to good aim, you need to build a solid shelter. The gameplay is structured around some really immediate dynamics: enemies are killed, metal materials are collected, turrets and protections are built at the end of the horde, then the next horde is faced in the same way, only with a few more difficulties. By gaining experience with a given weapon, those of the next level are unlocked, according to a tree diagram that can be recalled on the screen by pressing a key. Obviously it is vital to be able to have the best weapons when things get more complicated, otherwise you will have no chance of making it out alive, just as it will be important to be able to build the best performing turrets, since the cheap ones will not be very effective against enemies more resistant. Weapons range from pistols and rocket launchers to shotguns, submachine guns, plasma weapons, and so on. Basically Over 9000 Zombies! it's all here. Was a new zombie apocalypse really necessary? For the developer of Over 9000 Zombies yes Many, many zombies There isn't a story to follow, if we don't want to consider the usual plot that tells of the zombie apocalypse, now cloying even to report. There are no levels to overcome, just maps to select at the start of the game (not very many, actually). If you want you can play multiplayer, local or online, but honestly we have not found anyone to share some session on the internet. However, we downloaded some maps from the Steam workshop, just to take advantage of the possibility, even if user-created content cannot work miracles, given the limitations of the base title. Sure, at least you can play in areas bigger than the included mini arenas. The gameplay is classic of the genre. There are plenty of similar titles, some much more complete, even if more expensive. Surrounded by enemies, who appear everywhere, you simply have to shoot wildly while avoiding being surrounded. It is essential to take advantage of the shelter created and collect all the bonuses, including healing ones and grenades, an essential secondary weapon that can get in the way in the most thorny situations. From a technical point of view we are at very low levels. It's true that the micro-tiles that make up the maps didn't allow for much more, but here the minimum wage was really done. We certainly didn't expect the good Loren Lemcke, the man behind Over 9000 Zombies!, to produce some kind of visual design miracle, but it's impossible to deny that we have seen much better free titles of the same genre. Even the soundtrack seems to have been included because after all it could not be there, but it has very little effect on the overall experience, which can be defined as flat without too many recriminations.", "date": "2015-03-17", "grade": "6.0"}
