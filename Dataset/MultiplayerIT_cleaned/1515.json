{"name": "Space Colony", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-colony-2.html", "text": "Gameplay, a direct approach The game certainly won't make you wait long to bring you to the center of the action. From the first mission you will be subjected to the main problems, and put to the test in an iron way by the proposed quests. But how do you move and how is the player involved in the management of the space base? The aim of the game is to satisfy in good time every request that BlackWater Industries, the company we work for, addresses us during the various missions. The base always develops on three key points: the landing platform and material storage, the command center and the accommodation located inside the bio-domes. Each mission will be assigned a precise number of settlers, up to a maximum of 20 characters to manage at the same time. We are not dealing with inanimate and expressionless puppets, but with real characters outlined and personalized with care, who, as we will see later, can boast of a real independent identity. These settlers perform all kinds of tasks within the base and practically every aspect of its management and maintenance is entrusted to their hands. Through the command interface it is possible to jump from one character to another, providing indications on what must be performed by them within the base, which tasks they must perform and in what order. In fact, each character can receive two orders, of primary and secondary importance, which must be carried out in the shortest possible time. Starting from the central command building, up to the machinery for the extraction of minerals and the production of food, everything must always be placed under the control of the operators, who, depending on their skills and knowledge, may or may not bring your own contribution. The command console, located in the main building, allows the management of the three vital functions of the base, namely energy consumption, oxygen supply and management of robots and medical machinery. Each character, as soon as he arrives at the base, will run to prepare his own corner bed (if available), and then go, according to his attitude, to the workplace that best suits him. However, the efficiency of this action is linked to the personality of the settler, who may be more or less inclined to collaborate. Since, as has already been mentioned, each character has a unique personality, you will spend much of your time verifying that each value reported by the graphs of the personal profile correspond with the average values. This is because the degree of efficiency and level of performance are conditioned by character values, which represent the most common aspects of a person's profile. These aspects, defined as ~Needs and Desires~, include the following items: happiness, pay, entertainment, social interaction, hunger, sleep, personal hygiene and health. In order for a settler to be able to regularly carry out the tasks assigned to him, each of these parameters must be kept at acceptable levels. So you will have to worry that everything in the base is in its place, and that every service is accessible to guests. Furthermore, interpersonal relationships will have to be taken care of in order to avoid unpleasant inconveniences, since sudden quarrels between space tenants could trigger dangerous consequences. Not just Freud If that were the end of it, Space Colony would be classified as a life simulator, like The Sims. In truth, the purely managerial aspects are quite different. Just like in all games of the genre, base management is king. If in Beach Life the player's occupation revolved around managing a holiday village, in Space Colony it is the colony that has to be looked after and often almost entirely built from the ground up. As already mentioned, life in the space colony revolves around different aspects. First of all, the economic independence of the base must be guaranteed. Although most of the time you start with a decent nest egg already set aside, it is through good credit investments and optimal management of the machinery already present that you start a colony worthy of note. Trade and autonomy are the pillars of life on the base. First of all, the settlers must be able to feed themselves. For this reason it is possible to synthesize food by collecting particular indigenous plants through the use of particular machinery. But if the planet in question was arid or poor in resources then one can always resort to buying food from other sources. Excessive productions, on the other hand, can be sold for increasesto raise the cash register of credits useful for supporting the base and buying new structures and machinery, as well as, of course, the salary of the settlers. However, the extraction of minerals and the subsequent refining or production of more or less technological derivatives remains the greatest source of income available. Returning to the problems of space tenants, to guarantee a good stay in the cosmos, at peace with oneself and with others, we will also have to take care of leisure activities and all those aspects of daily life not strictly linked to work alone, but also to the care of person. It goes without saying that isolated people billions of kilometers away from their homeland can suffer from all kinds of psychophysical ailments, certainly not mitigated by a strong and characteristic personality. With a booklet of more than a hundred structures and furnishing objects you will have to try to make the base, with its bio-domes, as attractive and livable as possible. It will not be enough to place some decoration here and there, but you will have to make sure that there are sufficient structures capable of extinguishing the main problems that have arisen during the mission. For example, using areas reserved for conversation could solve many interpersonal problems and bring distrustful characters closer together. Recreational rooms of all kinds (among which also stands out a colorful dance floor, in Saturday Night Fever style) and structures dedicated to the most varied motor, intellectual and technological activities, will keep you busy for a long time, helping you in the enterprise of keeping a rabble of often disgruntled or bored settlers. Life on a space colony can be not only tedious but also dangerous, if the planet turns out not to be uninhabited as previously thought, but inhabited by singular and bizarre creatures. Although the indigenous offensive is late in manifesting itself in the course of the proposed missions, you will also have to deal with this eventuality, and provide the basis of an adequate defense system. Conclusion The game modes presented all lead back to the same common type of game, which will always see you subjected to the most varied and bizarre requests. Space Colony is a game capable of giving different gaming experiences, while always remaining faithful to the classic management style from which it fully takes its cue. Proposed in a nice and detailed graphic design, but technically outdated, if not downright inaccurate at times, this title certainly does not claim to be placed on the highest steps of the podium as regards the avant-garde of theology. Nonetheless, SC remains a game capable of entertaining small and large players. The twenty characters proposed, all of different nationalities and with the most disparate features, combined with the cartoonish setting, the presence of bizarre and alien landscapes with funny features and the ironic and playful setting of the entire game conclude the already singular composition of this title . The possibility then to choose not only the standard path of the campaign but also that of the single missions, combined with the possibility of customizing the missions through the integrated editor, finally give a good longevity to this game. In conclusion we can say that Space Colony presents itself with its irreverence and sympathy as an attractive and easily appreciable title. Accessible to all, it becomes part of that category of light but well-finished games that can give happy moments of carefree play to any kind of player. You just have to take the road to the nearest spaceport and leave with the first shuttle. Happy colonization! Pros: Fun and irreverent Many structures available Difficulty level adjustable for each mission Cons: Graphics not exactly cutting-edge Soundtrack a bit repetitive Sometimes chaotic Conquering the cosmos This is exactly what the Firefly guys thought of. What could happen in a hypothetical future in which man will see himself as ruler of space and all its planets? Obviously it will give way to a first timid colonization to then give way to a real conquest. So it could be interesting to step into the shoes of the poor unfortunate colonizers left to themselves, with their own uncertainties and fears to conquer a space hostile to them. The stroke of genius then comes when you decide to go and draw from that past of video games that for years have marked the existence of thousands of fans, resurrecting various genres to give life to a title with a sure effect, which focuses entirely on the ability to have fun right away and to propose theright number of engaging situations. In Space Colony the more elderly players will be able to notice a style of play attributable even to the legendary Theme Hospital, enriched by elements of simulation of the interactions between the characters direct descendants (albeit very lightened) of the game conceived by The Sims. So, if it weren't clear yet, we are dealing with a game that can be traced back to the trend of management simulation. The ironic tone that dominates the entire game right from the introductory movie, then, makes the approach with a title like this even more appreciable, capable of instilling imagination from the first minutes of its launch.", "date": "2003-10-28", "grade": null}
