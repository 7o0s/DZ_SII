{"name": "Syberia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syberia-recensione.html", "text": "Nintendo DS has achieved a success that goes beyond all reasonable expectations, contradicting all those who, when it was presented, did not pay much attention to it. However, there is an objective that he has not been able to achieve, an objective that seemed close, within reach of a stylus: the resurrection of graphic adventures. Since the DS was on the market, the two screens and the touch screen have raised many discussions about their actual playful usefulness; despite the more or less marked differences, all the critics agree that the platform would be perfect for bringing to the fore a genre, that of ~point and click~, which has been fundamental in bringing video games and art closer together. Software houses seem aware of this fact, however most of the titles released are remakes or unambitious adventures (such as Another Code by Cing): Syberia DS, unfortunately, is no exception. PC and DS It's impossible to talk about Syberia for Nintendo DS without also mentioning the original version, released in 2002 for PC. Developed by Microids, under the artistic direction of Benoit Sokal (a French cartoonist), this graphic adventure won many awards and achieved great success with critics and audiences, rising above the crowd thanks to its excellent storytelling, evocative atmosphere and pleasant graphic style used. In (commonly called) ~point and click~, interaction, unlike in most video games, is not at the heart of the experience. On the other hand, all the other aspects are fundamental, often considered pleonastic, such as the sound accompaniment, the shots, the scenarios, elements that assume, at least in this context, functions that influence the content as well as the form, because their value is enhanced storytelling; given the lack of freedom of action, it is essential that the linear path placed in front of the player is well presented and, above all, adequately disguised to seem unpredictable. For this reason the reduction of Syberia on Nintendo DS, because it is a reduction and not a remake, is a challenge that Tetraedge has ~lost~ from the beginning: a graphic adventure should be developed in relation to the possibilities offered by the platform that hosts it , adopting a style that guarantees coherence and aesthetic dignity to the game, not transplanting a title from PC to laptop, however tempting it may seem. It is evident from the very first moments that Syberia was not born, nor has it been redesigned, to be played on the Nintendo laptop: the remarkable graphics of the PC version seem simply excessive on the DS, recklessly opulent, because it takes up space for everything else and, moreover, , is of course worse than the original. We have tried to maintain the same level of detail, not to eliminate elements from the houses, and the consequence has been the lowering of the definition of the image, to the point that it is difficult to identify the small objects above the desks or furniture, often necessary for continue the journey; sometimes it's even stressful to be able to touch them with the stylus, because, in addition to a non-excellent command response, the area that allows interaction with the object is too small. Even the sound aspect has been impaired, so much so that the beautiful music is often reduced to thirty-second pieces repeated non-stop; voice acting has been completely eliminated, and once again the damage is not limited to a single aspect of the game, but extends to the narrative and therefore, inevitably, undermines the whole experience. The worst thing about all these changes isn't the cuts themselves, because those who haven't played Syberia previously won't notice it, but the fact that they haven't been counterbalanced in any way. The game has not been translated with the alphabet made available by the DS, it has simply been filtered by the limitations of the laptop, so the adventure itself is syncopated: even if you haven't tried the original, playing this version of Syberia you feel that they are missing some pieces and many, many details. Newbies Despite the many defects that limit the ambitions of the Tetraedge game, Syberia is still a good graphic adventure, whose narrative plot is still capable of exciting and surprising. The control system is based solely on the use of the touch screen, both in the exploratory phase and in solving the puzzles: as mentioned before, it is not very precise, but it is the tiny areas to be selected that greatly amplify the defects. On a stylistic level, despite the limitations imposed by the DS, Syberia still remains one of the most sought after and refined works in circulation: light years away from the monothematic pop canons that morbidly envelop the videogame world, the creatureby Sokal stands out for its avant-pop essence, which gracefully combines Art Nouveau and fantasy, making them magically seem like one. It is precisely the art direction that keeps the quality of Syberia high, because she is stronger than any cut sub-quest, any eliminated character or ill-adapted puzzle. Taking on the role of Kate Walker is also engaging on DS also because, if the narration has been partially damaged by the lack of power of the laptop, the plot remains interesting: sent from her law firm to a remote village in France (surreal to say the least) to finalize the purchase of a toy factory, the young protagonist soon finds herself entangled with extravagant characters and problems that are impossible to predict. It's not the best version of Syberia, but for those who have never played it, and especially for those who can't enjoy it elsewhere, the DS iteration is still a good alternative. Comment Syberia is one of the most popular graphic adventures of the last decade for the quality of the plot, narration and graphics, but above all for the stylistic cut, almost avant-pop, which combines fantasy and Art Nouveau with grace. The DS version is certainly the worst outing, the game was transplanted to the laptop without the slightest attention, and is crippled in several parts; however, for those who do not have the opportunity to enjoy it elsewhere, it is certainly a title to take into consideration.
