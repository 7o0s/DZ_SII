The Sims 3 : Ambitions will in fact allow us to exploit one of the driving forces that push man to navigate his life towards the achievement of difficult goals in the development of working careers which have a large part in everyone's daily life. Our Simmers are no less and cultivate the ambition to improve themselves in the climb towards professional success, each according to their own aptitudes and talents. But to what extent does this new expansion enrich the simulation gameplay of the third installment of the series? What's new and what is the impact on the game of deepening the existence of which we are the creators and whose success greatly depends on our choices, as absolute divinities of a universe that is anything but limited? ~Is ambition a vice or a virtue?~ So asked Quintilian, famous Latin author who knew a lot about the human soul. If in real life our choices are sometimes difficult and the relationship between black and white mixes in infinite scales of gray often making it difficult to manage the balance between vice and virtue, in The Sims 3: Ambitions we have the possibility to decide the path to take without risking dangerous detours and making ambition a spring that is no longer dangerous but full of advantages for our alter egos and the entire community. In fact, this expansion allows us to have, for the first time in the series, almost total control over the professions undertaken by our Sims, giving us the possibility of accompanying them step by step in their careers. In the original games, as well as in this third chapter of the best-known life simulator in the videogame scene, the working sector has always been an indispensable part of every Sims' daily life. One's contribution to society and above all a more or less responsible source of income have in fact always been elements that could not be ignored, but with a flaw: albeit with some improvements (such as the possibility of deciding how to spend one's working time ) the time our Simmer spent at work was down time for us players. We saw him leave to reach his workplace and at that point we didn't know much about him anymore, it was the only moment in which the creator lost his eye on his own creature. The simmers won't take it (perhaps), but Ambitions has changed things: the new professions allow us to literally follow our character in the workplace who will occupy it with different tasks or with carrying out a series of missions aimed at improve their performance, notoriety and consequently their position in the chosen professional career tree. In fact, we can choose whether to make our Simino go through a ~normal~ working career or whether to opt for the new ~professions~, to be found with the usual systems. The new professions to choose from are Ghostbuster, Private Investigator, Stylist, Firefighter, Architect and Doctor. Each of them can be followed in two ways that will influence relationships with people in our community: we can in fact choose whether to carry out the various tasks characteristic of our professions in a ~good~ or ~bad~ way. Think for example of the investigator: he can decide whether to kindly ask for information from the people involved or extort them by force with obviously very different consequences. A rating system also accompanies our actions and each mission will receive a different score depending on the effectiveness, precision and speed with which we have carried it out, for example by limiting the damage of a fire or by performing precise and colored tattoos. When I grow up I want to be a firefighter! There is little to do, that of the detective remains one of the most fascinating professions, probably also largely due to the figure of Sherlock Holmes, icon of genius, logical deduction, elegance and fair play. One of its main features is that it is not tied to a predefined working schedule, thanks to its extreme independence. No car to pick us up, no alarm clock to set: the advancement of our professional career will not depend on the satisfaction of our employer but on the way and success in which we carry out our investigations. The police station will be our base to carry out dirty jobs, usually unpleasant and prone to the ~dark side~, while instead our main jobale will be to investigate various issues affecting the local community. We'll have to do stalking, rummaging through mail and garbage, spying on houses and, of course, questioning the people involved in the case. There will be no shortage of hacking actions on suspects' PCs and another possibility of earning money is to write reports on cases followed or even to blackmail other people by mail. It is clear that it will be necessary to take care of the logic and perhaps charisma skills of our character. Another profession that we tested is that of the heroic firefighter, another great classic in the imagination of many children, starting with those who remember that little dragon Gris so dear to those who grew up between the 70s and 80s. The qualities of a good firefighter are obviously excellent athletic fitness and manual skills. Every morning a service car will come to pick us up and take us to the station, complete with everything we need to improve our skills. Including a pole from which to slide if the alarm sounds which will make us jump towards the fire of the moment. The aim will be to turn it off in the shortest possible time, to cause little damage to the environment in which it flared up. But we can also choose to devastate everything with an axe, if we feel a bit like Jack Nicholson in The Shining. Just fires? If you think the life of a firefighter is boring you haven't considered the emergency resulting from an invasion of furious gnomes! Those who feel the elastic of their underpants melting in a riot of senses at the idea of taking a tour of Ikea can only be enthusiastic about the profession of interior designer. As in the case of the investigator, it is a profession that can be carried out in total independence and which will see us respond to assignments for refurbishing the premises of community housing. Usually we will see ourselves asked to replace or add specific pieces of furniture to the rooms while staying within a specific budget. The furniture we will choose and the style we will give to the rooms will generate a more or less negative opinion on the part of the client, often based on his traits and preferences which we will therefore have to study. We came, we saw, and we *** him! Without a doubt, one of the most entertaining professions of those included in the Sims 3 through this expansion is that of ghost hunters. It will be because the famous Ghostbusters have taken root in our imagination, it will be because EA has certainly not skimped on quotes, going around accepting assignments in which we are asked to disinfest homes from ghosts and poltergeists is really fun. As long as we are dealing with insentient ectoplasms, the thing remains quite mechanical, but when the spirits of the departed who have decided to find the haunted house very comfortable, it becomes fun, being able to decide to talk to them rather than brutally drive them away, to convince them with by hook or by crook, even to seduce them and become friends. And with a little skill and some tricks even to have children with them. A little pale, slightly diaphanous and with the problem of disappearing when it comes to going to school, but still children. The medical profession has also been updated and although it has not really become a separate career, beyond the traditional work our doctors will be able to visit their patients privately and sometimes even receive emergency calls. The inventors and sculptors deserve a special mention, who will have to express their talent by going to the city dumps in search of spare parts to assemble their own creatures or try their hand at the various materials that can be used to create effigies of Sims or unusual still lifes for sculptors who do not give in to the temptation to hammer the knees of their artistic creatures. Ultimately this expansion is certainly able to add elements of considerable interest in the management of the lives of our Sims, elements that even tend to become focal and, paradoxically, this can be considered one of the main defects of Ambitions. The concentration and identification required to allow your simmini to carry out the chosen professions successfully is such as to largely eclipse the other aspects of the game which can even become secondary. Of course, it is a question of personal choices and style of play, but one problem remains common: the management of households. In the past, in fact, the management of a family nucleus with several elements was balanced by taking care of one Sim or the other during periods of self-management and absence of the partner or his fwhether it was for school or for work. Now being able to manage two sims with two different professions becomes truly exhaustive and requires considerable acrobatics in the balance of one's management of the game, inevitably forcing choices and the use of the anti-aging option that the game offers in an increasingly important. It must also be said that the new careers are so much more engaging and fun than the old ones that going back to them becomes unattractive, which undoubtedly appears to be positive. However, the variety of new professions is scarce, with six different choices that tend to run out not in a very short time but not even in months of play. However, the hope remains that new professions will be implemented in the game store, which would be immensely welcome. For the moment we are ~content~ to undertake our professions which, to be honest, in any case add a degree of depth in the delineation of the traits of our simmers to be really challenging, without considering the addition of objects of all kinds and in particular those created by being inventors or sculptors. The variety and vastness of options can baffle a user not very accustomed to the game, but those more accustomed to managing different family models can only rejoice in the richness that the different professions give to the entire chosen game world, whether it belongs to the areas already known or to the new one introduced by the expansion, Twinbrook, which recalls in part New England, in part Louisiana.", "date": "2010-06-08", "grade": "8.5"}
