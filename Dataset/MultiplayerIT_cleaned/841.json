{"name": "Stella Deus: The Gate of Eternity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stella-deus-the-gate-of-eternity.html", "text": "The Gate of Eternity Solum is a world in crisis: the mysterious mist called Miasma spreads everywhere, disintegrating everything it meets in its slow and chaotic march. In terror, the population entrusts itself to the teachings of the Aeque religion, which preaches the doctrine of inertia: God wants the end of humanity because of its sins, and the salvation of the soul can only be achieved by those who abandon themselves to prayer, awaiting their end without opposing fate. At the same time, a mysterious man, Dignus, builds an empire based on violence and terror: the imperial legions proceed to conquer Solum, subjugating the population and mercilessly killing the Aeque. The protagonist of Stella Deus is Spero, a young soldier of the legions of Dignus, at the head of one of the many teams for the capture of spirits, with which it is possible to feed the powerful technology designed by Viser, the Master Alchemist of the empire as well as friend and almost a father figure to Spero. And it is precisely during one of Spero's expeditions that his loyalty to the empire will be questioned: together with his fellow soldiers and friends Gray and Adara, Spero will meet Linea, the last shaman of the kingdom of Anima, allied to the ruler of the kingdom decadent of Fortuna, Avis, and leader of the resistance who opposes the tyranny of Dignus. According to Linea, it won't be Viser's Alchemy that saves Solum from Miasma, it is actually the destruction of the spirits that increases the volume of the deadly fog: on the contrary, the spirits would be the only ones capable of dissolving the fog, but the The only way to gather a quantity of spirits capable of countering the Miasma is to open the legendary Gate of Eternity. What this ancient device really is, where it is located and what will be the consequence of its use are just some of the mysteries that Spero, Linea and their group will have to unravel, while the kingdom of Dignus and the mysterious Nox sect plot against them. .. Old Style If the plot may appear original and in some ways even innovative (there are very few video games in which the theme of religion and faith is treated in such an explicit and critical way), the same cannot be said of the gameplay of Stella Deus : intentionally, Atlus has created a typically ~old-fashioned~ game, without inventing original and new play mechanics, as Nippon Ichi did with his Disgaea, La Pucelle and Phantom Brave. Stella Deus is a linear strategy, both in progression and in structure: each battle leads to the next, expanding a geographical map in which it is possible to move from one point to another to reach the next objective. The locations cannot be explored, and it is possible to visit a shop and the Guild through a menu, wherever you are. If what can be done in the shop is quite obvious, the Guild deserves an explanation: in it it is possible to accept secondary missions (or ~quests~) to be completed to obtain money and items, and also to access a simple menu through which you have the ability to merge two items to get a new one. The item fusion system is a bit the heart of Stella Deus, but unfortunately it is monstrously limited by the lack of an element of fundamental importance: a database. With hundreds of items fused in pairs to create new ones, it is almost impossible to keep in mind all the combinations and their outcomes, consequently without guides and external advice merging items becomes a frustrating and tedious practice, despite the decidedly high quality of the items that can be obtained through fusion, compared to those that can be purchased in shops. Once our small army of heroes is equipped, it will be time to fight: on the battlefield we control our party member by member, making them perform various actions: attack normally, use alchemy (practically the magic in Stella Deus), use objects . Extremely simple to manage, the fights in Stella Deus feature an important and fundamental tactical element on which the entire game is essentially based: the Action Points. Each character has 100 Action Points, and any action... whether it's a movement or an attack... consumes a certain amount of points: consequently, APs must be managed carefully and allow you to implement unusual and imaginative strategies. You can approach an opponent and attack him twice, you can approach to attack him and retreat to make him spend more AP when it will be his turn to attack you, you can cast a healing spell and get out of range of enemies, you can spend all of your AP to perform a combined attack with your allies (which sometimes results inor spectacular animations)... The possibilities offered by Stella Deus' AP System are probably the main source of enjoyment of any battle, and offer that variety that is lacking in the long run due to the similarity both in graphics and in the AI of the enemies. Old Style Another customization element that makes Stella Deus more strategic and pleasant than it might seem at the beginning is the very large skill set that opens up for each character as you progress through the adventure. Each action performed on the battlefield earns a character not only the classic 100 experience points necessary to level up, but also Skill Points that can be used to increase the psycho-physical statistics of a character or, more simply, to learn special attacks, alchemical techniques and Zone Effects (basically passive abilities that affect one's allies or opponents directly around the character who owns them). It is also possible to increase the ~rank~ of a character by satisfying its requirements, to unlock new skills and considerably increase its power. However, there is a huge flaw that unfortunately penalizes Stella Deus: our party will not always level up in proportion to our opponents, so often we will be forced to increase it before engaging in new battles, and for this purpose it is possible to access the Catacombs of Trial . Each floor has a dozen opponents of a certain level, and once reached it can be accessed directly and at any time; the problem is that not only graphically are the hundred floors of the Catacombs absolutely identical, generating a certain monotony, but the same opponents to be defeated never change, making the level-up process a tedious and forced experience, practically forced if you want to unlock secret characters, which will become available in the last chapter of the story. State of the Art It is already the splendid artwork on the cover that gives a vague idea of the artistic skills of the Pinegrow graphics: the character design in Stella Deus is simply magnificent. The characters are drawn in a delicate way, their costumes are original and classy, the coloring is soft and perfectly fitting. Why give so much importance to artwork, anyway? Because 90% of the narration happens through them: the silhouette of a character, accompanied by the text of his joke and the voice of the voice actor, is what appears on the screen during the narrative phases. The spatial location is entrusted to the splendid artworks that portray glimpses of settings and give us the idea, in fact, of the place where the action takes place. Obviously the particular and very classic narration is based above all on dubbing and texts: in both cases the result is only good. The voice actors are good, but they don't make a miracle cry, some are mediocre but fortunately bound to minor parts (such as Tia, Viper or Jade). On the other hand, the texts in English sometimes leave us a bit perplexed due to the frequent use of slang which does not fit the classical atmosphere and the seriousness of the situations, but it is also true that the slang manages to give an unexpected three-dimensionality to certain minor characters like Grey, who without his foul language would have been a less interesting character. Still on the graphic design, one is simply enchanted by the incredible quality of the locations in which the battles take place: the perfect colours, the numerous details and the originality of some maps demonstrate an artistic direction that is nothing short of commendable, which offers excellent examples such as Turris, the Monto Oros, the Grave of Spirits. In these splendid and evocative battlefields, large and excellently animated sprites collide, embellished by high resolution and excellent lighting effects that make even the most discreet of special shots spectacular. But the real strength of Stella Deus, technically speaking (and not only), is the soundtrack: signed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, it is probably one of the best soundtracks listened to in recent years. The emotional and compositional variety of the various tracks is enormous, and their quality is excellent without particular tone drops, probably the weakest passages of the plot regain great vigor thanks to the musical accompaniment, thrilling especially in the final stages. The traces that accompany the decisive battles remain imprinted, and are difficult to forget. Stella Deus is a very classic SJRPG, both in gameplay and in technical implementation, therefore hardly recommended for those looking for an RPG full of spectacular visual sequences and complex enough to play.fill the next 50-60 hours of free time. Probably the clearest defect of Stella Deus is that of not combining the classicism of the gameplay and the narrative progression in a natural way: the splendid plot (penalized by a somewhat lackluster last chapter), which really makes you think, is what drives the player not to get up from his chair, despite the heaviness of some game phases (primarily the level-up in the boring Catacombs of Trial). Both the combat system and the management of your party are simple and intuitive, a strength that turns into a weakness in relation to the extreme linearity that characterizes the title, which does not offer a sufficiently attractive challenge except in the form of the recruitment of secret characters, or the fusion of the most powerful items. For a fan of the genre, Stella Deus is a gem, enhanced by an exceptional soundtrack and superb graphics, others might instead find a game system excessively monotonous which, however desired, tends to be too far from excellent results obtained with strategic such as Disgaea. Here, if Stella Deus had the gameplay of Disgaea it would have been a masterpiece. Too bad, let's hope for a sequel. Pros: Excellent plot Simple and intuitive mechanics Excellent soundtrack Artistically valuable Cons: In the long run monotonous Too linear Lame ending Lately it's been a rosy period for strategy games, and above all for Atlus, which has churned out plenty of games of this kind, especially in recent months: if the critical and public success achieved with Disgaea and Phantom Brave (developed by excellent Nippon Ichi), this time it is a SJRPG with much more serious and dark tones to come out of the magical Atlus cylinder, by Pinegrow. And it is a SJRPG with an openly and explicitly retro flavor, both in its features (the very classic two dimensions, but in high resolution) and in its mechanics: linear, simple to master and at the same time complex and profound. But there's more to say, even on the flaws that don't make it the masterpiece we could have expected.", "date": "2005-09-14", "grade": null}
