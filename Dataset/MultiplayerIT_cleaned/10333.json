{"name": "The Saboteur", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72721-the-saboteur-vive-la-resistance.html", "text": "Version tested: PlayStation 3Sean Devlin, Irish mechanic aspiring pilot is not a bastard, let alone inglorious. France occupied by the Nazis is his immense playground, where like a mischievous child he enjoys blowing up everything that has a swastika as its emblem. Pandemic's swan song immerses us in the dark but fascinating atmosphere of the Second World War, putting us in the shoes of a recalcitrant hero, initially driven only by his thirst for revenge for personal reasons, but then over time (and missions) he will find himself enmeshed in History, the one with a capital S, embracing the cause of the Resistance, or rather the Resistance (to be pronounced strictly with a strong Inspector Closeau accent), working with the partisans but also with provocative English spies. For home the sky The game refers to the canons of a classic free roaming like Grand Theft Auto, but adding a strong action component to the limit of the platform. Sean Devlin acts in enemy areas, he can't roam the streets freely, whether or not he's holding a weapon from the vast arsenal available. Therefore, his world becomes the roofs, the only areas where he can roam almost always safe, obviously keeping an eye on the dozens of turrets and the various airships that orbit above Paris. This is combined with a strong stealth component: it is not enough just to keep a low profile, but many times it is necessary to approach stealthily so as not to trigger the alarms and silently kill enemies and even disguise yourself as a Nazi to go unnoticed among crowds of troops. All this is extremely functional to a very varied and prodigal gameplay of approaches. In fact, although the main missions are essentially very similar to each other, they all revolve around the canons kill that, deliver this, escort that, the level design in fact guarantees different ways to achieve success. Not only frontal assaults on enemy bases, it is also possible to seek silent infiltration, by land or by means of the power cables that connect the various buildings, or we can take refuge on the roofs to try to clean up the target area, with the weapons in our possession or through the various anti-aircraft batteries that dot the Parisian skyline. Furthermore, since Sean is a pilot, we will also be involved in car races between the various arrondissements of the French capital. The secondary missions enhance Sean's climbing aptitude even more if possible. If the story progresses through the protagonist's encounters with the various characters of the Resistance, to activate the side missions there is no need to talk to anyone, just play the tourist at gunpoint around. Paris and the surrounding areas, which scale regions such as Picardy, Burgundy, Normandy and so on, are dotted with hundreds of Nazi installations, from simple watchtowers to fuel depots, via loudspeakers, radar stations, armored and various deposits. It's up to the player to decide whether to destroy them or not, but above all how to do it, whether to sabotage them with dynamite, blowing up the inevitable red explosive bins, or pulling everything down with grenades or panzerfausts. Taking possession of high points in the city is obviously recommended from the point of view of facilitating the missions, destroying them is even better since the liberation of the city from the Nazi game rewards the player in various ways, both in hard cash and by lightening the weight of the occupation by making the most viable neighborhoods and when an area is particularly inspired by Sean's actions, the spectral black and white, illuminated only by the red of the Nazi coats of arms, will give way to a gaudy color sign of a renewed will to fight. In these areas we will also find more partisans willing to fight in the street when we find ourselves in difficulty. Sean's hidden attributes But the real driving force that drives us to accumulate clouds of smoking Nazi rubble as quickly as possible is money, but above all perks and in general all those skills that improve Sean's saboteur skills. As in Modern Warfare, the fulfillment of particular requirements unlocks some attributes of the protagonist. Initially Sean is not a supersoldier, he is the classic normal person grappling with events bigger than him. The attributes, distributed in ten fields, make up for its initial deficiencies. For example, the second-level brawl bonus allows us to knock out an enemy head-on without sneaking up behind him, useful when a silent infiltration goes down the drain without resorting to firearms, while sabotage and explosives increase the qutransportable dynamite antitative, halving the purchase cost in the meantime, precision instead improves the goodness of our aim with the sniper rifle. The money, on the other hand, in addition to buying more and more powerful weapons that will become available as the game progresses, and the cars are also used for further skills. In addition to improving the effectiveness of our arsenal, it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the partisan support (which can be ~summoned~ after unlocking the necessary prerequisite, as well as a ready-to-use car for escape or an arms dealer) or even buy those max-level perks that you couldn't get in game. To conclude the shopping list we are given the opportunity to buy maps of the Nazi installations of the city, in this way white dots indicate the various locations to be destroyed instead of exploring the French capital a little blindly. This ingenious character upgrade system is the real strength of the game, from this point of view the danger of boredom inherent in the free roaming genre is certainly filed down, obviously not set aside completely though. After a rather bland start, which introduces us to the characters with a flashback and takes us to the dawn of the invasion of France, the game shows all its characteristics and the goodness of its basic system, which although not particularly innovative, actually drawing with both hands from titles such as Infamous and Prototype and obviously GTA, it has immediacy and great fun on its side, even if obviously big-grained. Distracted Nazis Coarse-grained because everything is rather coarse, functional and effective but not as detailed and convincing as in the Rockstar masterpiece. The first discordant note is certainly the artificial intelligence, both understood at the level of individual groups of soldiers, and for the way in which it manages the pursuits in the moments in which you have to leave the alert area by darting or running on the roofs. The level of alertness of the soldiers is rather fluctuating: in addition to the scarce ability to find shelters or to perform outflanking maneuvers often and willingly while killing a single group of Nazis, others in the immediate vicinity remain impaled as if nothing had happened, while two hundred meters further S.S. sniper high he shoots us with his Kar 98 equipped with optics. It is conceivable that a more refined artificial intelligence has not been implemented since you are always surrounded and in obvious and constant numerical inferiority, but all this often makes the game too easy. Consequently playing hard instead of normal can be a good solution to increase the challenge rate. Secondly, escaping searches is all too easy, even at the highest alert levels. The roofs are our home (if it is then destroyed the various turrets and loudspeakers are even more), while the exit and entry from the red research areas is all too sudden. In fact, it is enough to turn the corner of a building on the edge of the search border to be safe and to be honest, checkpoints and pursuers are never a big problem. Another issue that sets the tone for the technical part of the review is the general quality of the staging, including the narration. We are far from the raw realism of the Rockstar works, the tone is much more light-hearted and the Nazis are more ~ operetta ~ than a serious war film. We laugh often, the protagonists are decidedly stereotyped and over the top and in addition the involuntary comedian peeps out many times, more often than in real comic moments. Another critical issue is the way in which the story is narrated, too fragmentary and which wastes the added value given a historical setting that lends itself very well to spy conspiracies, nocturnal ambushes, double and triple games. The various missions carry on the plot in a way that is only functional to the development of the character, in fact the story of Sean and the History are cornered, in short, there is little passion for the fate of the Irish mechanic. Playstation 3 trophies The Saboteur rewards the player with 46 trophies, 15 secrets, 26 bronze, 3 silver, 1 gold and 1 platinum. They are related to the number of side quests unlocked, gold perks earned, how quests are completed, amount of money earned, and so on. Nothing particularly difficult to obtain as long as you spend a lot of time destroying all or almost all the Nazi installations around the map. Paris de nuit From a technical point of view, the game combines good things with other decidedly mediocre ones. The choice of the sharp detachment between the black and white parts and the colored ones is certainly spot on. From an emotional point of view, to fight or infiltrate somethingand base at night, under a pouring rain with a glossy, almost metallic black and white, between lightning and bolts, perhaps standing out against the spiers of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre is a beautiful experience, and brings to mind dozens of noir films and old films of war. Unfortunately, next to a good polygonal modeling and a level design which, in addition to creating a huge map, decidedly consistent with the gameplay and which draws a scale Paris, but with all the monuments in their place, we find a general qualitative mediocrity of the textures. The average level is only sufficient, there are no particular peaks apart from a good use of hdr, unfortunately, however, sometimes you notice decidedly flat and low-resolution textures in the background, barely masked by a blur that hides the farthest parts of the deep field of view. The same thing goes for the animations, well done for those of Sean, especially those relating to the climbing parts, a little less those of the Nazis, limited and not particularly varied. Despite everything, however, the visual impact is certainly pleasant, the style, fortunately for us, remedies certain technical deficiencies in certain rather marked situations. The soundtrack has an absolutely great atmosphere, which changes depending on whether you are traveling in a free area or not, with vintage jazz, swing and bebop songs alternating with martial German tunes. The dubbing in Italian is good, with actors well in part, the quality of the writing a little less, full of rhetorical phrases and jokes often out of context that would like to lighten the dramatic situations but which clash considerably in the general context.", "date": "2009-12-04", "grade": "7.8"}
