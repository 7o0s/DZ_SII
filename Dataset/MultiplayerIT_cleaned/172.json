{"name": "Mortal Kombat: Unchained", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-unchained.html", "text": "Without chains Mortal Kombat Unchained, this is the title of the PSP version of Deception, looks in all respects like its older brother, the story hasn't changed: after the Deadly Alliance formed by the formidable Quan Chi and Shan Tsung, the time has come to fight the final match against Raiden. The evil couple manages to win over the God of Thunder and in search of the supreme power they begin to fight each other, to ensure that one and only one becomes king of the outer world; it is at this moment that Onaga, the previous ruler of the Outerworld, returns from the abyss, ready to take back the throne without too much effort: thus a new alliance will be born between Quan Chi, Shan Tsung and the revived Raiden. The three will not be able to oppose the incredible strength of the old enemy and so Raiden, for the good of the planet, will sacrifice his life (in vain) to stop Onaga's advance. The game begins right here, as the 30+ Mortal Kombat participants begin their long climb to the master of evil, each seeking victory for their own personal cause. Looking at the cast of characters included in this Unchained, one can only be pleasantly surprised by the last-minute additions such as Kitana, Jax, Frost and Blade, not present in the home versions of Deception. Even on the PSP, each character will have different fighting ~stances~ (styles or positions) available to use in battle and with which to carry out shots linked together; at the end of each fight - as per tradition - it will be possible to execute the opponent using bloody fatalities, harakiri and so on. The count of the ~canonical~ modes for any Mortal Kombat ends with the aforementioned tournament, the endurance in which all the opponents that the energy bar will allow will face one after the other and finally the multiplayer in ad hoc mode, that is, with as many players as UMDs. Outside the more classic schemes of the series, however, the puzzle mode is inserted, a real emulator of Capcom's super puzzle fighter, in which, depending on one's skill in a game halfway between columns and meteors, two characters made in super-deformed style they will collide with each other in an exhilarating match to the last forbidden move. The game of chess, on the other hand, is more cinematographic than videogame, in which by mixing the basics of chess that practically everyone knows, one will find himself fighting on the squares of the chessboard when a particular piece finds itself in the position of ~eating it~. another. The list of modes closes with a sort of action game set in the world of Mortal Kombat with fighting game and role-playing game elements, in which Shujinko (the protagonist) will have to - following a pre-established story - strengthen himself and become the most expert fighter of the world. Chained? As much as this Mortal Kombat wants to consider itself ~Unchained~ or without chains, there are many chains that keep it tied and prevent it from taking off, often leaving it in a sea of mediocrity. The problems afflicting this title are due in part to the PSP hardware and to deficiencies in the development phase. The first, macroscopic problem lies in the control system, the only real focal point of all fighting games: unfortunately PSP does not have a control system suitable (or easily adaptable) to technical fighting games, the directional cross is not very precise and the analog stick it is of no help except to move in the third dimension, often there is so much frustration in not being able to perform moves that are simple and essential at the same time. The second defect is represented by the excessive loading times: the game loads at all times, for every slightest stupidity or passage between menus, with times that easily exceed 10/15 seconds of waiting. Furthermore, strong doubts remain about the excessive dispersion of the concept linked to Mortal Kombat, with the consequent creation of a puzzle game, a story mode and a game of chess, all modalities which, however attractive, can only be considered pastimes for a few minutes, incomplete versions of the original and above all an unsuccessful attempt to bring something new to the series. Rather, it is better to focus on the starting material, which to date lacks fresh ideas capable of reviving a franchise loved by many. If graphically Mortal Kombat Unchained can be considered a good result obtained on PSP, the camera and collision problems encountered above all in the story mode are still very serious, problems that still have not been resolved after two years. The English would say ~Flogging a dead horse~ (sferzandor a dead horse), in medical terms it could be called therapeutic obstinacy and Midway could simply call it Mortal Kombat. The series needs something new, otherwise perhaps it would be better to jump on a new product, given that the memory of Mortal Kombat is increasingly faded. All in all Unchained remains a sufficient game, at times fun and with some extra modes capable of providing a good diversion from the usual modes associated with this type of title. The problems remain, partly due to some unfortunate choices in terms of hardware, partly due to the shortcomings of the programmers. Pros: Many modes present One of the richest casts in the series Definitely long-lived Cons: Inaccurate control system Sometimes inaccurate cameras Some modes are simple fillers ~Mortal combat~. If it had looked like this fifteen years ago, probably not so many people would have loved, played and consumed it, probably wouldn't have made movies of it and it wouldn't have had so many sequels and so many clones. Mortal Kombat, on the other hand, deserved all this and even more, succeeding in the incredible feat of bringing Americans to the creation of the ESRB rating system (the PEGI of America) because of its bloody game scenes. Fatality, Babality, Friendship are now all words that in video games indicate precise finger movements, precise sensations, precise images. After all this time, the Mortal Kombat saga has lost its appeal, overtaken by decidedly more modern, attractive and fun fighting games, forcing it to transform a tested and appreciated 2D structure into a 3D one that very little resembles the basis of the series except for the long lists of historical figures now with a permanent job. Two years after the release of Mortal Kombat Deception on home consoles, Midway has decided to dust off one of his most successful chapters of the saga and to transport it loaded with all its extras on the Sony portable console in a strange operation that seems to be halfway between the retrogame and the remake. Is this the typical case of self-induced fatality?", "date": "2007-01-11", "grade": null}
