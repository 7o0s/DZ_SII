{"name": "The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-dukes-of-hazzard-racing-for-home.html", "text": "The hard life of the lonely missionary The game is organized into missions (twenty-seven in total) which vary by objective and therefore also by solution method. The objectives to be achieved can be the most varied: win a speed race, bring the money to the bank within a time limit to pay off your uncle's debts, catch some thieves, escape the pursuits of Rosco and so on, according to a consolidated and stereotyped, emblem of the TV series. The missions are connected to each other by fixed screens that instruct us on the purpose of the same and at the same time the various interlocutors tell the latest events in the County of Hazzard. Thus the game shows a semblance of variety of situations, although always and in any case we will be driving a car and we will have to escape the pursuit of the police. Unfortunately, sometimes it will not be clear how to solve a mission and maybe we will even complete it by pure chance, without being able to explain how. From the Pause Menu, during the game, a very useful map is still accessible, having observed which we will be able to prepare some, albeit basic, strategy. From the beginning, the game will be able to dispense the right amount of challenge and some, inevitable, frustrating situations: it will not be an easy task to complete all twenty-seven missions. ... and a bi bit sky for the roof The theater settings of our raids will be of various types: the city one, the rural one and the semi-desert one; each of them will be characterized in a pleasant and detailed way. The view is from a bird's eye view, therefore from above, with General Lee in the center of the screen engaged in drifts, skids, jumps and chases of all sorts. The tracks are varied and it is pleasant to be able to roam everywhere, even off the road surface, so as to be able to take advantage of shortcuts and slip rash overtaking to your advantage. The cars are well reproduced and recognizable, there are different models and colors, obviously the best are the General Lee and Boss Hogg's Cadillac, moved by a good number of sprites. So, from a graphic point of view the game is worthy of appreciation, but this cannot be said for the sound. There is a single sound tune present only by browsing the menus that mimics the main theme of the series, while the effects such as the roar of the engines, the screeching of the tires, the contacts are so scarce as to be horrifying to hear (in any case not very annoying). The controls boil down to the D-pad to set the direction of movement, A to accelerate, B to brake (and engage reverse), and SELECT to throw dynamite at opponents and obstacles. Indeed, along the tracks we will be able to collect power-ups that will facilitate our task: there is the aforementioned dynamite, nitro to increase speed and the key to repair the damage to the car. The control system is simple and effective and the few available actions are easily manageable. I would like to make a single comment regarding the average road holding of all cars: they will tend to skid too easily when cornering, as if they were on a buttered pan, and even correcting a trajectory will always be an operation to be prepared delicately. Bottom line... er the sums In addition to the main game mode, there are two others: one allows you to replay any previously completed mission, while the other allows you to challenge other vehicles in races and with cars to unlock as you progress through the game. Ultimately, I recommend the game to nostalgic lovers of the series and to those who like to run around happily, but are also looking for a bit of ~strategy~ and a ~story~ (so to speak), some reservations for buying instead for the little ones. Bottom line... er the sums Pros: Good graphics Saves on cartridge Manages to convey some flavor of the TV series Cons: Bad sound Tends to repeat itself and can be frustrating at times Not always clear which method to use to solve a mission This is the ballad of Bo and Luke... The television series starring Bo and Luke Duke, The Dukes of Hazzard, was a favorite of yours truly childhood. Shady intrigues, breathtaking chases, beautiful girls and General Lee with his improbable jumps made up the explosive mixture that decreed the success of the series, so much so that it is still being replicated twenty years later (at least here in Italy) . Characters such as Boss Hogg, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, uncle Jesse, cousin Daisy, Cooter and above all Bo and Luke were able to make themselves loved by the public, thanks to that atmosphere of adventure mixed with light-heartedness that they knew how to transmit through the cathode ray tube, years and years ago. But let's get to today. I honestly don't know the reason that prompted Warner Bros to commission games (for PSX, PC and now GBC) based on the Dukes of Hazzard license after so many years; on the nose, however, I would say to celebrate the anniversary, perhaps the twentieth. I admit that I got my hands on this game with a bit of preconceptions, in fact I knew that the two previous versions, twins, for PSX and PC had been real failures, like any self-respecting tie-in (apart from those licensed Lucas Film), so the axiom that ~good things come in threes~ seemed obvious to me. Fortunately I had to partially change my mind, in the light of a more than discreet technical realization and above all for the charm that this series still knows how to dispense. The story is soon told: Boss Hogg and Rosco are once again plotting behind the Dukes' backs, as usual what they want is to take away the farm from Uncle Jesse, but this time it seems that they are really serious, unloading all responsibility on cousins Bo and Luke about dirty business and crimes of various kinds. Clearly, Jesse's two reckless nephews don't sit idly by and try in every way to foil the plans of the conspirators by proving their innocence. This is it and in perfect line with the script of the typical episode of the TV series. 1", "date": "2001-08-14", "grade": null}
