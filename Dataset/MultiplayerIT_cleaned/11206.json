{"name": "Carnival: Arriva il Luna Park! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/carnival-arriva-il-luna-park-recensione.html", "text": "The particular hardware features of Nintendo's portable jewel make it ideal for the development of new concepts in videogames, ways to make the gameplay innovative and sometimes ingenious, often amusing due to their unprecedented nature and open to any player. Touch screens and double screens have on the one hand facilitated the game interface of these titles, opening the market to groups of people who were previously disinterested, but with mass production they have contributed to the homologation of many titles and the cloning of some genres. One of these is the party game, i.e. those video games made up of a series of small challenges, attractions and tests, to be done alone or in company. Carnival's Luna Park, developed by Take2, is just the latest in an almost infinite series of collections of mini-games that exploit - more or less - those peculiar characteristics of Nintendo DS. As soon as Carnival has started, after a few screens, we have to create our digital alter-ego to run around the virtual Luna Park between one game and another. Having set some parameters (few, to tell the truth), gender and clothes, we are ready to go. The concept of Carnival is simple, and faithfully follows what would happen if we were in a real playground. It's about jumping from one attraction to another, trying to win as many as possible and get tickets that allow us to access the most expensive games. The goal is, of course, to collect as many items, prizes and stuffed animals as possible. Each competition can have four different final outcomes: failure, winning the minor prize, the medium prize or the super prize. Small objects can be gradually exchanged for increasingly large and important gifts, up to the maximum level. The game virtually ends when we have managed to get the most out of each challenge, conquering all the super prizes. All the typical clichs are present, starting from the sorceress who predicts the future, passing through the targets to be hit, up to the clowns to be filled with water. The concept of Carnival is simple, and faithfully follows what would happen if we were in a real playground The real problem is that none of these really manages to capture the player's attention for more than a few games: these are extremely simple and shallow tests, the mechanisms of which can be learned in a few seconds. The replayability and the desire to repeat them is poor, given the extreme ease. Taking similar titles in comparison, we can for example remember the mini-games included in Nintendo's New Super Mario Bros, equally simple but certainly more incisive in exploiting the qualities of touch, stylus and double screen. Take2's work doesn't seem as inspired, and the impression is that often the controls could have been implemented more effectively. The launch of the Frog is a typical example of how a good idea can be realized in a crude way: the cute little animals launched do not have any type of applied physics, contrary to what happened to the shells in the corresponding mini-game present in New Super Mario Bros. , which in this way were easy to control in their trajectory and made the action-reaction fun. Most of the evidence in Carnival can be grouped under the category of ~button smashing~, or the uncontrolled pressing of the keys, without reasoning and without logic. The few who try to exploit the precision of touch controls finally fail the fun goal due to a certain approximation in the design. Thanks to the wireless integrated into the console, it is possible to challenge a friend in some competitions (including the fateful frog toss), using a single cartridge. Multiplayer is always a welcome factor, and the simplicity of some mini-games can be transformed into some moments of healthy hilarity, alongside a friend. Carnival manages to create that ancient feeling we had as children wandering around an amusement park, playing from carousel to carousel until we ran out of tokens in our pockets. The atmosphere is just that of a playground, thanks to its pastel colored graphics, funny characters and cheerful and carefree tunes. Carnival recalls, in many visual aspects, the much more famous Animal Crossing, so much so that it almost seems like a natural extension of it. First of all the commands: the movement of our character takes place entirely through the touch of the stylus on the screen, which decides its movement and direction. Carnival recalls, in many visual aspects, the much more famous Animal Crossing Only the polygonal constructions closest to us are displayed, as the horizon flows away as if we were placed onu a huge sphere. However, the quality and quantity of the polygons is not comparable to the Nintendo masterpiece, as Carnival is made in a much more bland and approximate way. The background music is suitable and cheerful, but does not shine for heterogeneity and sampling quality. However, the sound sector is enriched by a guide voice entirely in Italian, and above all well recited, two factors that are quite rare in Nintendo DS games. Comment The episode of Carnival for DS is a game that could definitely make better use of the hardware features of the small Nintendo console. The various challenges are too simple and the controls imprecise and castrated by an often lackluster design. The idea of the virtual Luna Park, where you can walk and enjoy the attractions, is certainly fascinating and new, and the atmosphere is well recreated by the colorful and sober graphics. The style of Carnival is suitable and pleasant, too bad for the games themselves that undermine the basic goal of entertaining and entertaining. but do not exploit On DS there is better", "date": "2008-09-11", "grade": null}
