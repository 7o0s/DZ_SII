Quickly and well Anyone who has had the opportunity to play the previous Turbo Pizza or any episode of the Cake Mania series will surely know what the latest i-Play is about, given that the substance is fundamentally unchanged. In the role of Rebecca, the user must therefore serve the customers who appear at the counter as quickly as possible, giving them the requested dishes and collecting dollars in spades in order to move on to the next stage. In addition to the sandwiches prepared by the trusty Robert, the restaurant offers pastries, chips, coffee and cotton candy, as well as an electric oven and a condiment to satisfy the cravings of the most demanding New Yorkers. All is solved simply by interacting with the touchscreen of the Apple device: it is sufficient to touch the area of interest to make Rebecca perform a context sensitive action, whether it is to provide a menu to the patron on duty, hand him the desired food, collect tips, and so on. Turbo Subs is evidently a casual game with very simple premises, but this does not mean that the gameplay is resolved in a health walk, on the contrary. New York customers aren't exactly gods models of patience, and must be served before they leave the room in a rage: also considering how it takes a few moments of play for poor Rebecca to be inundated with requests from hungry patrons, it is necessary to organize one's movements well, for example by preparing things in advance like coffee or cotton candy to save time. Not only that, the user is rewarded if he performs combos (i.e. if he inserts two or more actions of the same type) with an increase in the score and in the turbo indicator, which once filled gives Rebecca a short period of super-speed . Compared to the original Turbo Pizza, Turbo Subs offers the beauty of 60 levels in which to sink your teeth, as well as some new gameplay elements: in fact, the sporadic appearance on the screen of some petty thief who will do everything to take possession of the tips left on the counter. Nothing particularly new under the sun, then, but the frenetic gameplay typical of the series never fails to be engaging. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-08-17", "grade": "8.0"}
