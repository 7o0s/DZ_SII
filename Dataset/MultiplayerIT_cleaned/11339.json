Before returning home, however, he must serve a ~punishment~ and help the librarian tidy up the school library: it is precisely there that Luso finds an ancient book, and by reading it he is magically transported into the world of Ivalice. If so far you have had at least two deja-vue it is absolutely normal: there is a bit of The Neverending Story in Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and the incipit is not entirely different from that of its predecessor, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, product five years ago for the Game Boy Advance. The new chapter in the Final Fantasy Tactics saga is part of the Ivalice Alliance project, a cycle of Square Enix games set in the world of Ivalice, created over ten years ago for one of the most famous and imitated video games ever: Final Fantasy Tactics. The return of the acclaimed brand, on Nintendo DS, has been eagerly awaited, above all for the promises of enormous playful depth and extraordinary longevity: you will find out if they have been kept in the next few lines. In the meantime, start opening your wallet. A story to forget, an unforgettable game Don't expect a story worthy of the prestigious progenitor, still considered one of the best ever written for a video game: even Final Fantasy Tactics A2, like the prequel for Game Boy Advance, focuses on the playful part more than on the narrative one, presenting a light and sunny plot for most of the adventure. Of course, there are the classic global threats to be thwarted, but compared to the prequels, the plot appears decidedly more banal and irrelevant: without bringing up the splendid and complex plot of the PlayStation episode, even the banal one of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance has greater depth . In fact, Luso wakes up in a forest, and is immediately attacked by a monstrous creature. It would seem doomed, but sudden help arrives from Cid, head of a ~clan~ of adventurers: Luso joins Cid's clan believing that carrying out the missions proposed by the city guilds could prove crucial in finding a way to return home , and moreover our little protagonist is curious and dying to explore this enchanted world. The absolutely trivial (and quite senseless) incipit immediately leads to the essence of the game: carrying out the missions proposed for the guilds is in fact the main activity in Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and their quantity and variety is truly impressive. As many as four hundred quests of various kinds are available to the player, naturally little by little, and among these every now and then there will be the main ones that represent the narrative process and the real adventure of Luso in the world of Ivalice. The other quests have various purposes, including the recovery of objects or materials, the activation of new Jobs or the recruitment of additional clan members. The mediocrity of the plot thus becomes a less essential defect than it seems, when we find ourselves in the coils of a playfully sublime title chock full of things to do, so much so that it is forgotten while the side quests follow one another, the characters and discover new weapons and jobs. However, a bitter taste remains for having exploited so little such a fascinating world, and a cast full of unexpressed potential: the presence of Vaan, Penelo and Al-cid of Final Fantasy XII does little to improve a plot that struggles to mesh until the end . Job System, 2008 edition Conceived years ago on the occasion of Final Fantasy V, the Job System has become a rather recurring feature in Square Enix titles (even in the RPG Online Final Fantasy XI), so much so that it has been imitated in all sorts of ways by dozens of video games. In Final Fantasy Tactics A2 this mechanism has been exalted to the nth degree and we can safely define it as the best incarnation of a concept that was already extraordinarily effective ten years ago. In fact, each member of the clan can change Jobs at will between one mission and another, depending on whether the requirements necessary to wear the new desired clothes are met. Each race (Hume, Viera, Moogle, Nu-mou and Bangaa, to which are added the unpublished Gria and Seeq) has access to certain Jobs, some of which are exclusive, which follow the now very famous roles of the Black Mage, White Mage, Warrior , Monk and so on; once the Job has been chosen, the player proceeds to organize the skills that that character will use during battles: a set of spells or combat techniques associated with the Job, a second set selectable from those of the other Jobs available for the character, a skill passive (for example the ability to equip shields) and a reactVAT (like counterattacks). Essentially, skills are learned by equipping weapons and accessories that give that particular Job the ability to use the associated ~spell~: battle after battle, the character will gain experience in using that spell or skill, until he learns it and, therefore, also maintains it. replacing the object that gave it. At that point, the player can equip a new item to restart the learning process. Basically, when the player decides to change a character's Job, he can still keep the skills learned in the previous role by setting the relative set of spells and skills, thus creating a combination of primary Job and secondary Job. Job System, 2008 edition In other words, you will be able to bring into battle a Summoner (Evocator) who can heal your companions with the spells of the White Mage as well as summon the elemental deities, and vice versa: the combinations are truly infinite and the depth of customization is nothing short of immense. The impressive quantity of Jobs available contributes to the considerable thickness of the new Job System, in this sense Square Enix has really outdone itself by inserting about forty Jobs, many of which are unpublished and very original. In Final Fantasy Tactics A2 the Job System has been exalted to the nth degree... Job System, 2008 edition In addition to the aforementioned classic and primary Jobs, additional Jobs can be unlocked by completing the special quests offered by the guilds and if Jobs such as Dragoon or Geomancer are already well known, get ready to review your tested strategies for Jobs such as Flintlock, Moogle Knight, Magic Cannoneer or Raptor. Each Job requires the learning of a certain number of spells or skills in order to be activated, therefore the player will repeatedly embark on quests and missions in order to acquire the necessary points: fortunately, when a Job is changed, the experience level is still maintained overall character, keeping the challenge always balanced and never frustrating or boring. Not just battles If the main activity in Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is war, expressed in the multitude of clashes to be faced to solve quests and manipulate the Job System, it must be said that Square Enix has done an excellent job in interweaving it with numerous features of outline, more or less important. The Judges and the Laws are back, an idea implemented in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and decidedly simplified here: each mission has a Law that must not be violated, generally relating to the prohibition of using magic of a certain element or certain weapons. The violation of this Law in this episode does not have particularly harmful consequences: however, it prevents the fallen comrades from being brought back to life and from benefiting from the bonuses relating to the Clan Ability which can be chosen at the beginning of the battle. Among other things, obtaining these Clan Abilities is a parallel process to the quests proposed by the guild, absolutely secondary but certainly very useful and recommended. The same goes for the ingenious Auction System: each movement on the ~paper~ map of Ivalice corresponds to the passage of a day, and every certain number of months there is a limited period in which you can literally play in the auction, against other Clans , the regions of Ivalice themselves. Winning these clashes of logic and money isn't easy, but the benefits are guaranteed: new items in the shops and temporary bonuses until the next auction, to start with. The Auction System is therefore closely linked to the shops that sell the equipment for our Clan and, therefore, the skills that our characters can learn. However, we soon realize that there are relatively few items for sale: to increase the offer in Final Fantasy Tactics A2 we proceed by exploiting the Bazaar mechanics already seen in Final Fantasy XII, in fact, i.e. creating new items, weapons and accessories with the materials obtained during the missions. Once you create a new item, it will be available for purchase, and of course the more quests you solve, the wider the offering becomes and the more powerful the items and related abilities you can buy. Wi-Fi mode Unfortunately, unlike Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions (PSP), a real multiplayer mode has not been included. Players can still connect their Nintendo DS locally to obtain Tickets, which can be exchanged for particularly rare items in special locations. Final Fantasy Tactics... Advance 2 Final Fantasy Tactics A2 has more or less implicit links to the other titles of the Ivalice Alliance. In particular, Vaan, Penelo and Al-cid are an integral part of the story and can be recruited into the Clan, as well as Hurdy, Montblan's little brotherc. The latter can also be recruited into the Clan, and on more than one occasion he will refer to Marche, the protagonist of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Another gem? The librarian Luso was supposed to help... is none other than Mewt Randall, friend/enemy of Marche in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Beautiful to look at, as well as to play Final Fantasy Tactics A2 apparently does not offer a very sensational visual spectacle. Apparently, however: in reality, the latest Square Enix effort is a real audiovisual jewel. Might as well start from the only flaw found: the impossibility of rotating the isometric scenarios around the vertical axis during battles. The fixed camera frames the fight from a single angle, so that sometimes the graphic complexity of the location and the grouping of the characters make it difficult to select targets or manage distances. It's a nuisance that rarely happens and with which you can live peacefully. Graphically we are talking about a really delicious game, with attention to the smallest details. Each location is highly detailed and colorful, some battlefields amaze with their variety and visual complexity, and the pleasant animated backdrop is just one of the many visual elements implemented by Square Enix to make the experience even more enjoyable. The sprites of the various characters and monsters are large, detailed and well animated, some even occupy more than a single ~box~, a novelty for the series that distinguishes the most menacing and lethal enemies. The variety of graphic effects relating to the various spells and abilities is enormous and the results are enchanting: from highly effective light effects connected to even the most trivial spells, up to spectacular three-dimensional effects in the case of the most powerful summons. The detail is really high and the attention paid to this aspect of the game is truly commendable. The decidedly traditional soundtrack of the series accompanies everything, in fact composed once again by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who had already taken care of the musical part of Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The songs of Final Fantasy Tactics A2 therefore resume those of the prequel and of the twelfth chapter on PlayStation 2, as remixes or more or less complete transpositions, with the addition of never invasive unreleased tracks, mainly with a sunny and carefree tone, to make it surrounds the fights or some narrative sequences. Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is an extremely balanced game: you can dissect progressing in relation to the time and effort employed or play it more freely, solving the narrative missions and proceeding without delving too deeply into the splendid mechanics invented by Square Enix for the occasion. A rather remote possibility: it is really difficult not to become addicted to it. It is a pity that the narrative component has been so careless, the playful body is in fact practically free from defects, extremely long-lived and profound, but the gaps in the plot in the long run make the resolution of the quests a repetitive action. And yet there is something for everyone, and fans of turn-based strategy games shouldn't miss out. It could have been the perfect Final Fantasy Tactics, now we just have to wait for a sequel that maintains this extraordinary playful quality by integrating it with a storyline up to par.
