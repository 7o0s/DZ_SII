Just to give you an idea of the harshness of the battle, among the over three million soldiers who fought it, almost equally divided between the Axis forces (Germany, Romania, Italy and Hungary, for the occasion) and the USSR, half lost life on the battlefield, and as many as forty thousand were our countrymen. Beyond the fierce fighting, many of the deaths were caused by the absolutely prohibitive climatic conditions, so much so that of the over one hundred thousand Germans of the Sixth Army taken prisoner by the Russians, only six thousand survived the very harsh winter. Simply impressive numbers. This dramatic scenario has been repeatedly translated into novels, cinematographic works and even video games, among which it is impossible not to mention the beautiful Call of Duty 2 and the recent Company of Heroes 2. Although they had an easier life - so to speak - of the soldiers on the ground and of the poor tank drivers, some of whom were even tied to the controls of their vehicles to avoid desertions, the pilots played a fundamental role in the evolution of the confrontation, and the flight simulator object of our analysis, born within to the famous IL-2 Sturmovik series, it casts the player in the shoes of the brave aviators - both German and Russian - who fought in those terrible months of European history. Rigorous and accurate as per tradition, IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a very pure simulator, able to redeem the half misstep made by the recent chapter Cliffs of Dover, released in 2011. If you want to know why, you just have to continue to read. IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad manages to restore luster to the warplane simulator series Cast lead Officially announced by 1C Company in December 2012, the latest chapter in the series dedicated to one of the most successful and famous Russian aircraft of the time - but not only - was immediately welcomed with interest by enthusiasts, especially thanks to the developers behind the project, i.e. the guys from 1C Game Studios in collaboration with 777 Studios, who had amply demonstrated their talent with the Digital Nature engine in Rise of Flight. After having ~stopped~ for a few months in Early Access on Steam and on the dedicated platform, where we tested it, IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad has recently reached and surpassed version 1.0, which has further expanded the very fierce and active community of players, despite being a niche product. The fundamental difference with the Early Access code that we dealt with a few weeks ago lies in the introduction of the dynamic main campaign, which however left us a little perplexed due to the lack of charisma shown. Divided into five distinct chapters, which explore from the first contacts with the Axis forces up to the aforementioned defeat of the Sixth Army, it represents nothing more than a ~generator~ of single missions, where the player has a very wide possibility of intervening in the configuration of the single fight. The aim, in each chapter, is to accumulate enough experience points to unlock the next one, being able to move freely both between the two warring factions and between the types of missions. If desired, the entire campaign could be concluded using a single aircraft and always carrying out the same tasks, which are in turn divided into six main groups, namely Intercept, Escort, Ground Attack, Ground Support and Bombing. The aforementioned Ilyushin IL-2 Sturmovik, for example, can be used for ground attack or troop support (a bit like the modern A-10), and the tasks often involve destroying artillery positions, columns of trucks and tanks or trains in transit in a certain area of the immense map. By selecting the powerful Russian Pe-2 ser.87 bombers and the German He 111 H-6, on the other hand, more substantial targets can be razed to the ground such as railway stations or cities, perhaps juggling between the various machine gun positions leaving the flight controls on autopilot. Light and fast aircraft such as the Messerschmitt BF 109 F-4 or the Lavochkin La-5 ser.8 are instead suitable for air escort and patrol missions, absolute protagonists of elegant and exciting dogfight. What the campaign lacks, beyond the videos that introduce each of the five aforementioned chapters, is a pinch of narrative that involves and spurs the player, launched into a succession of self-contained missions where the only sensible variations are the airports and airfields involved, as the encirclement of the Sixth Army towards the city of Stalingrad continues. The almost constantly snowy and monotonous setting doesn't help either, which further dulls the feeling of ~advancing~ in the campaign (it is certainly not the developers' fault that the battle took place between November and February in the rigid former USSR). Even the Single Missions have been further enriched with respect to the preliminary code, and now it is possible to range from ground attacks to patrol missions, passing through ~strikes~ during snowstorms (beautiful Ghost in the Snow, also available in a simplified version) or maybe at night. The variety is further expanded by the highly effective Quick Mission editor, where the player can set - and share online - a whole series of parameters involving targets and allied aircraft, but also the climate, the time of day, the presence of wind, turbulence and so on. Although the global offer may still appear canonical and not particularly rich, IL-2 Sturmovik gives its best especially in the highly successful online component, enhanced by the aforementioned community and incredibly solid and realistic flight dynamics. Not a simple game As specified, IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is not a title for everyone, both for the intrinsic complexity and for the patience it requires, and the only way to be appreciated is through a good joystick, as well as the painstaking study of numerous commands that can be given from the keyboard. Unfortunately there is no semblance of a tutorial, an absence that further exacerbates the difficulty of approaching less accustomed players, perhaps eager to approach the genre for the first time. Even selecting the so-called ~Normal~ mode, which provides a whole series of facilitations for the pilot, especially as regards the HUD and engine management, the difficulty curve is quite high and already keeping an aircraft steadily in flight is a moderate success. Like any self-respecting simulator, the ~down times~ spent simply flying to reach and return to the target can be very long, and the aforementioned simplified mode also helps from this point of view, avoiding the player the problems of take-off and landing. landing, as well as placing it a short distance from the so-called ~Action Point~, beautifully surpassing the Waypoints of the flight plan. Played in Expert mode, however, the 1C Company title offers a very high hardcore challenge, where friendly fire is always around the corner - means and targets on the ground must be recognized by sight - and any careless maneuver can cause a disaster. The flight model is deep, realistic and coherent, with the ten available aircraft all significantly different from each other: try a take-off with a fighter and then with a bomber, and you will discover how hard the pilot's life must have been, especially with those climatic conditions between snow on the airfield and strong wind that tried to throw you off the runway. The engine (or engines) start-up sequences, flap control, fuel mixing based on altitude and a whole series of manual commands - more or less complex - must be assimilated and put into practice, if you don't want to finish on fire even before reaching the first waypoint. The planes were built according to the original manuals, and their behavior is extremely faithful to the stresses they could actually withstand: a too fast dive can literally tear off the wings, just as a sharp turn can cause a stall and cause us to enter a horizontal spin with no possibility of recovery. Weight also plays a fundamental role in the physical model, where mounting bombs of a certain weight, as well as rockets or machine gun emplacements where possible, can make the difference in being able to perform certain maneuvers in complete safety. To further amplify the depth of the simulation there is a sublime damage and failure system, with an extremely precise hitbox that can lead to a whole series of problems in flight: from oil leaking from the engine completely covering the glass (terrifying) to parts that they break, block or go up in flames, with all the consequences you can imagine. The pilot can also be injured or killed in flight by enemy shells, which leave realistic punctures on the cockpit. In that regard, forget about games likeAce Combat but also the excellent War Thunder: the number of ammunition is very limited and must be dispensed with extreme rationality, with small bursts aimed at the sensitive parts of enemy aircraft such as the fuselage or wings. Bringing the hides home, even if they have holes in them, after having shot down a couple of aircraft or perhaps destroyed some targets on the ground, gives great satisfaction, also because aiming is far from simple and the evasive maneuvers performed by the CPU complicate everything , although sometimes it lets itself be ~preyed~ easily. The charm and charisma of the fights is enhanced in the online component, thanks to numerous servers where the most passionate players organize from simple fast dogfights to long and complex missions, perhaps based on historical documentation. I light up white From a technical point of view, the latest effort by 1C Game Studios is extremely solid, both for the modeling of the aircraft - truly splendid and very rich in detail - and for the extension of the huge game map. Unfortunately, as pointed out, the scenarios, however suggestive, are all very similar to each other, with the snow cover extending for thousands of square kilometres. Urban areas, such as the city of Stalingrad (modern Volgograd), do not differ in detail from the average of other similar products, nevertheless the realization of some famous monuments is appreciable, as well as the infrastructures most affected during the conflict. On the other hand, the lighting effects are wonderful, which in certain cases offer glimpses of rare beauty, especially at sunset. At night, on the other hand, the beams of light from the anti-aircraft spotlights enliven the scenery, sometimes embellished by the presence of the Volga or by particularly luxuriant forests. As mentioned, the absolute protagonists are the aircraft, characterized by extremely detailed cockpits - the beautiful one of the He 111 H-6, absent in the Early Access code - with high definition textures and perfectly functional instrumentation, although it cannot be managed with the mouse like in other simulators. The Digital Nature engine is quite scalable and solid, and with our test configuration, at maximum detail, we suffered some uncertainty especially when rotating the head inside the cockpit. Too bad that the advanced graphic options on which to intervene can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The audio samples are also very good, with sound effects with good incisiveness and three-dimensionality, while curiously there is no accompanying soundtrack even in the menus.", "date": "2014-12-10", "grade": "8.0"}
