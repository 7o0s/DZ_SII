Time-only exclusive on Nintendo Switch? Regardless of what the commercial agreements are, this is excellent news for the many fans of the visionary game designer, here grappling with a sort of divertissement that brings together concepts and ideas accumulated over the years but never actually used in a video games. The Complete Edition for PlayStation 4 and PC also natively includes the two DLCs released for the game, namely Black Dandelion and Bubblegum Fatale, for an even richer and more consistent experience. Story and gameplay The new introductory sequence of Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, in which the protagonist of another intellectual property by Goichi Suda appears surprisingly, acts as a peculiar preamble to the frenetic scene of the arrival of Badman, determined to take out Travis Touchdown for avenge the death of his daughter. However, the clash turns out to be a little too heated and the two accidentally start the cursed Death Drive MK II console, which sucks them into the virtual world of a video game and puts them in front of a horde of bug-enemies to be faced with blows of lightsaber or baseball bat, depending on the character we choose to control, playing alone or in cooperative with a friend. However, it is only the first of seven different worlds, each characterized by a series of variations in terms of visuals and mechanics, interspersed with visual novel-style sections on the one hand curious and fun, on the other inevitably slow. always what No More Heroes fans know well: a solid and satisfying hack & slash, with a couple of classy touches (the need to reload the weapon after a certain number of shots, pressing the left stick on its axis and shaking the controller) and the gradual release of skills with cooldowns that make the fights more and more multifaceted and interesting, such as the telekinetic launch, the barrier that restores vital energy, the shock that slows down enemies, the bomb or the satellite laser. A rather rich repertoire, which we will have to pull out to get the better of opponents divided into numerous types, each with different attack patterns, resistance and characteristics. The list includes a recurring mini-boss, which from time to time features new maneuvers, and seven bosses proper (which become eight thanks to the DLC), some of which are quite difficult. We are therefore not talking about seven substantially different experiences, although in a couple of settings we will be called to try our hand at drag racer-style ~electronic~ speed races and with stages inspired by the classic Asteroids. Playstation 4 trophies Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes includes 51 Trophies, most of which can be obtained simply by completing the basic campaign and then defeating the final bosses of each stage. However, there are achievements related to finding specific characters within the settings, obtaining all skills, enhancing the protagonists and even using Shinobu and Badgirl. Realization, inspirations and DLC We had already written in the review of Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes for Nintendo Switch that this latest creature by Suda51 was certainly born as a limited budget production, created to relaunch the brand waiting for No More Heroes 3, but it can count on numerous interesting and pleasant findings. The very connotation of the seven worlds and the introductory sequences of the various bosses bring to mind old classics reinterpreted with a deliberately cheap style, an expedient that effectively masks the actual limitations of the game. However, where we proceeded with free rein is in the rendering of the gameplay, expressed in a pure way in the context of the campaign, whether you play alone or in cooperative, as well as in the many citations of other works by Suda, primarily Shadows of the Damned . Of course, you come across artificially slow and repetitive sections, but even those ultimately make sense from the point of view of an experience that is confirmed to be very pleasant, even with all its technical edges, even on PS4. The Complete Edition includes as mentioned, the two DLCs made by Grasshopper Manufacture, the contents of which are added to the main story: we are talking about new missions for Travis Touchdown and above all Badman, an unpublished stage complete with a boss (Killer Marathon) and two new playable characters (Badgirl and Shinobu Jacobs) with related skills. These are not essential extras, but it is nice to find them in the package, anthan for a matter of variety. As for the technical implementation, there are no particular differences compared to what was seen on Nintendo Switch: the resolution is certainly higher, the frame rate is also very stable and fluid here, but the level design appears quite limited and the settings merely act as a backdrop to the action, which fortunately never disappoints. The soundtrack is a different matter, which involves you right from the start thanks to a selection of well-made electronic songs, perfectly in line with the spirit of Travis Strikes Again.", "date": "2019-10-17", "grade": "7.5"}
