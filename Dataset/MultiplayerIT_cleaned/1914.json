Lilith Games manages to do many things well in this title, but in the end it misses the goal of getting away from the usual trick of free-to-play games with a truly deep and original solution, which would be required to be able to truly offer a serious and complete, perfectly usable on iOS and Android devices. It cannot be said that the project has been taken lightly: it is clear how the team has invested in Warpath, which is really pleasant as a presentation, from the 3D graphics on the battlefield to the semi-animated interludes that present the story, but the strategic structure almost immediately claims the free-to-play soul of the game, which is soon channeled into the usual track of progressive and extremely guided growth. Warpath looks like a classic RTS, but the free-to-play mobile game-style grafts emerge immediately In any case, the first steps are promising: Warpath stages an alternative World War II, in which many aspects are reconstructed on a historical basis while many others are simply invented. Thus we find ourselves dealing with units, weapons and vehicles truly taken from those existing at the time, with sides similar to those who faced each other during the war and even some real historical figures, but the unfolding of events, the protagonists of the various missions and also the general geopolitics is all made up. Thus it turns out that the powerful and highly organized army with which we have to fight, although it bears striking similarities to that of Nazi Germany, is in truth identified as the ~Raven~ forces and it also becomes acceptable, in this context, that a tiny handful of handsome heroes and courageous find themselves practically alone in overturning the outcome of the world war, ranging on various fronts from France to Russia, without particular historical connections. What emerges is a Second World War model comic book, well represented also by the 2D graphic style of the dialogues and interlude scenes, which must necessarily be taken with an ironic spirit to support the overdose of warmongering epic and assorted clichs of which it oozes. In any case, it is clearly a game with important production values, which emerge both from the in-game graphics and from all the surrounding elements, as demonstrated by the long live action promotional spot that you can see below. Base management and armed clashes Like much of the mobile RTS, Warpath also divides the game action mostly between base management and clashes with the enemy. This last element is probably the most convincing, developing according to a typical real-time strategic dynamic with the need to move the troops on the map and to indicate the action to be performed and the enemy to be hit, while the actual firefight it then takes place automatically and is resolved on the basis of the type of unit used and the different level of experience and power reached by the troops. Weapons, units and vehicles are taken in a rather faithful way from the equipment of the time and are divided into ground troops on foot (infantry of various types), artillery, armored vehicles (tanks and the like) and even aircraft, including scouts, fighters and bombers. Each of these has different power and resistance and requires more or less long times and an abundance of resources for production, training and enhancement, all elements that depend on in-game loot, rewards and any micro-transactions. The management of the base is perhaps the weakest element of the entire structure: although the construction does not differ much from the historical tradition of the genre, it is excessively guided even after the first phases, with little possibility of customization and specialization. Everything is based on a practically automatic progressive expansion and upgrade mechanic, obviously focused on waiting times and the possession of the right amount of resources, which introduces the possibility of quickly remedying these needs by purchasing in-app elements. In this regard, it must be said that Warpath is quite generous in dispensing rewards for the progression between the objectives, for the conclusion of the missions or even just with the passage of time, therefore the pressure towards the purchase, but this still emerges over the long term and becomes very evident in PvP. The Campaign took usto around different settings, retracing some situations inspired by the events of the Second World War but always filtered by an imaginative reinterpretation. For a long first phase of the game, the missions are extremely guided and simple, opening up to different paths and approaches only later but always remaining rather limited from the point of view of developing strategies. Above all, we find ourselves going from one checkpoint to another following a rather pre-set path, unfortunately, which tends to detract from the breadth and complexity of the maps, which could offer many other possibilities and depth of gameplay. However, the missions of the Campaign are the most interesting aspect, because PvP, which can be carried out within the map shared with the various alliances, is clearly distorted by the possibility of purchasing in-app content, resulting in the most classic of pay-to-win.", "date": "2021-03-26", "grade": "7.0"}
