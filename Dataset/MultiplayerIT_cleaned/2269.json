{"name": "Megarace 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/megarace-3.html", "text": "Nanotech Disaster I immediately asked myself why this bizarre but effective subtitle with such an aggressive air. In fact, on the spot, nothing hinted that the crazy races that awaited me once the game was installed would take place in paths in the order of magnitude of nanometers (1 nanometer = 1 millionth of a metre). This original gimmick has allowed the RenderWare guys to create about twenty absolutely crazy tracks, ranging from the inside of a supercomputer to that of a particle accelerator, to then move on to tracks with a more ~biological~ setting, such as the slalom between brain cells or one between the eggs of a bug-infested hive. In such an eccentric context, the Enforcers that we will have to drive are no less, since they are flying vehicles with strange shapes halfway between hyper-technological and organic, some that wink at those of Wipeout, others are more similar to some small planes, still others that resemble bizarre luminescent insects. The brake, this unknown The physical model of Megarace3 is the quintessence of arcade driving: steering, brake and accelerator will be your only worries while you try to keep the Enforcers glued to the road, which is anything but easy given the hyperbolic tracks that you will find yourself following. So get ready for very long jumps, impossible trajectories and very high-speed stunts that can make you lose your bearings in no time. Among the bonuses that can be collected along the way, we include mines, buffer barriers, smoke screens and a sneaky missile capable of blocking the target's steering for several seconds. Furthermore, there are two different types of energy packs, the first, curative, does not require further explanations, while the second, which serves as a recharge for the Modules, leads us to talk about the peculiar ability of the Enforcers to mount special Attack modules, Defense and Speed. At any time during the race, one of the three modules can be activated by pressing a button, and put into operation as soon as enough energy has been collected along the way. As is obvious, the Attack Module allows you to fire on opponents and knock them out, while the defense module activates an indestructible barrier capable of parrying the opponent's blows and avoiding impact damage against the elements of the path. However, the most useful module remains that of speed, which, functioning more or less like a turbo, allows even the most clumsy of the Enforcers to reach exceptional speeds for a few moments (well, always in the order of nanometers per hour...). The game has three main modes, plus a ~Practice~ option that allows you to familiarize yourself with the driving model and the use of Modules. They are the evergreen ~Arcade~ mode in which you simply have to cross the finish line in at least third position and then move on to the next track. This is followed by the more complete Career mode, in which, among other things, it is possible to customize your Enforcer, choosing which modules to mount before each race. The last mode, called ~Catastrophe~, is undoubtedly the most original, as well as my favorite. It is essentially a series of races against time through dynamic tracks, even more absurd if possible, in which you are required to complete missions, ranging from simple survival to killing the queen bee of a hive , or tracking down and destroying a computer virus that threatens to cause a nuclear reactor meltdown. Graphics and sound: could we have done more? It is not easy to formulate an overall judgment of the graphics of megarace3; the Enforcers are all modeled with care and although they are not rich in details, they have an original and pleasant line. The tracks, on the contrary, are of fluctuating quality: although almost all of them are well playable, most of them are perplexing due to the elementary geometries and the generally low number of polygons, which, on the one hand, ensures good fluidity even on low-powered machines , on the other it grants an absolutely unsatisfactory visual impact. Let's be clear, the originality of the settings grants glimpses of landscapes of rare beauty at times, such as for example immense expanses of neurons, or very high arches made up of pulsating cells of psychedelic lights, but in some cases (rather often in truth) one finds himself walking very long almost two-dimensional ramps, devoid of any spere, suspended in total emptiness, with the background texture as the only decoration Speaking of sound, it's not much happier to be, despite the sound effects of acceptable quality (we spread a pitiful veil over the infamous comment by Lance Boyle, whose presence in the movies represents the heaviest fall in style of this game), but the music is repetitive, not very original and, in a word, disappointing. Summing up Megarace3 is an enjoyable and all in all original title, with various intuitions that could have made it a best-seller of the genre, but penalized by a fluctuating technical realization, by a clearly approximate calibration of the difficulty (the first tracks are extremely demanding, of a simplicity disarming many of the advanced ones) and by an easily predictable artificial intelligence. If you like the genre and are looking for a ~light~ title on which to spend some of your free time, you might as well overlook the technical imperfections and appreciate the good qualities of this game, but you can hardly avoid thinking about this what could have been and what it wasn't. Such a pity. One of the most unforgettable works of the now defunct Psygnosis was undoubtedly Wipeout, a dynamic, adrenaline-fueled title with a hi-tech look, which together with its beautiful sequel literally broke the bank on Playstation, Saturn and PC, bringing the concept of futuristic racing game. Impossible to count the hours spent swaying up and down with the head, following by conditioned reflex every jolt of those very fast floating ships. In Wipeout the involvement was total. It goes without saying that a success of this kind generated a very popular trend, and over the years there has never been a lack of racing games with a futuristic setting, in which a generous dose of more or less gratuitous violence was added to a frenetic driving (with or without wheels) , since the competitors had different types of weapons (generally collected along the track), with which to hinder their opponents in a healthy and unfair competition. Well Megarace3, the third chapter of a long-standing but far from exceptional series, fits right into the fruitful vein of wipeout-style games or, as the back of the box proudly states, in that of ~drive and shoot~ games.
