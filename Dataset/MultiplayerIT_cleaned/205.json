{"name": "Warhammer 40.000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-dark-crusade-recensione.html", "text": "Confirmations Let's start by analyzing what are the characteristics that have remained unchanged in Dark Crusade compared to the previous chapters: scenario and play structure. For those who have never come across Games Workshop's ~toy soldiers~, we can say that Warhammer is an incredibly vast and followed phenomenon in every part of the world where collecting is mixed with artistic skills (if you want to paint your troops) and strategy to be fielded in the board game where you can show your knaves. The ~40,000~ universe was born after the first Warhammer of clear fantasy inspiration and recreates its alchemy in a very distant future where magic and sacred cults (of various orders and degrees) mix with an incredible war technology. In this context, the human race, led by an Emperor who has assumed an exclusively spiritual existence (but with immense power like a God) must confront other species with anything but peaceful intentions, intent on transforming us into ~animals on the way of extinction~. As previously written, Dark Crusade also maintains the playful coordinates of its predecessors or frenzy of action combined with a fundamental tactical component to bring home the ~strategic points~ that we will have to conquer and maintain (also through the construction of fortifications) to have more credits to use in new troops and vehicles. Another relevant element is that each team can be strengthened by new elements but also by more powerful firearms. The updating of the troops, even if quantitatively limited (and different according to the units), therefore makes the action much more continuous and rapid since only if we do not withdraw in time, we will have to send brand new units from our headquarters in the focal points instead of replenishing the already established troops. in Dark Crusade we will get to know two unprecedented groups of creatures: the Tau and the Neocron The differentiation of the races present is also highly confirmed: the peculiarities of struggle and logistics are really very different and therefore leading the orcs instead of the Elders for example will also mean resetting tactics and strategies with respect to the specific characteristics of our cannon fodder. Speaking of the races / factions, in Dark Crusade we will get to know two unprecedented groups of creatures (in the videogame field of course): the Tau and the Neocrons. Mechs and Zombies... or almost... The Tau are a very technologically advanced faction so much so that they resemble mechs in a combat ~uniform~. It is precisely on hi-tech that they try to impose themselves on their opponents, for example by striking from considerable distances with their long-range weapons. They say they fight for the ~greater good~ but to do so they also use the ~Kroot~ mercenaries, bestial bipeds with worrying propensities for cannibalism. The Necrons, on the other hand, present a very different style, a sort of ~space zombie~ endowed with immortality (through resurrection...) and with base-monoliths which, if ~upgraded~ become literally devastating flying fortresses for the opponents of the moment. The small number of soldiers available are then joined by various types of mechanical creatures such as mechanical scarabs used for humbler operations such as construction. The Neocrons don't even need strategic points to produce new units even if the acquisition of the ~nodes~ of interest involves an acceleration in the supply of fresh (not so much...) cannon meat. Everything you absolutely need to know about Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade Dark Crusade is playable in single player ~stand alone~, ie you may not even have Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War (let alone the other expansion Winter Assault) installed on your hard disk. Warhammer 40,000 is only necessary if you want to play multiplayer with the 5 races already present in the other episodes in the new 12 maps (which however are playable with Tau and Neocron without needing the base game). Warhammer 40,000 can be found as a gift (in Game of The Year edition) in the Company of Heroes box. If you don't have both, what are you waiting for? Alternatively, you can find Warhammer and the first Winter Assault expansion together at a very affordable price. For LAN play, only one copy of the game is required. Total Warhammer In addition to the introduction of the two new races, a structural novelty of primary importance concerns the single player experience: forget the campaigns of the previous episodes in which the missions were connected by a storyline (in Dark Crusade the introductory computer sequences graphics aren't even subtitled in Italian for the record...) which, while not too original, gave that extra something of satisfaction in winning a battle. DC is based on everything'another type of setting that can partially recall Total War: in fact we will have at our disposal a tactical map of the battlefield (in this case the planet Kronos) divided into territories. Each piece of land represents a skirmish-style combat map, while where the headquarters of the seven factions are located (we will have to conquer the latter to wipe out the opponents), more articulated and specially designed structures are associated. For each territory conquered (but in some cases we will also have to defend ourselves from enemy attacks) we will earn a greater yield that we can spend on fortifications and troops, useful in case of blitz attempts by the other hated races. With the increase of our domains then, even the heroes of our army will acquire experience and ever better equipment, with more powerful weapons and armor (and also beautiful to look at like the miniatures themselves) and which we will be able to freely choose in perfect RPG style. Undoubtedly the most tactical and profound structure, it gives Dark Crusade exceptional longevity (also because we will be able to face the board with all seven races present!) even if the disappearance of a narrative thread is a bit sorry, at least for whoever is writing this review. In addition to the introduction of the two new races, a structural novelty of primary importance concerns the single player experience Like any expansion, not even in Dark Crusade, the graphics engine has undergone any revolution confirming the visual qualities of Dawn of War. Clearly with almost two more years behind it, the engine is less competitive than other recent new releases (such as The Lord of the Rings - The Battle for Middle-earth 2) but all in all it hasn't aged too quickly given that the production of THQ is capable of managing many units on the screen without excessive frame rate problems even on computers of not the latest generation (as you can read in the system requirements sheet). Moreover, the almost obsessive care with which all the game units have been created with an accurate and ~massive~ set of animations (especially in hand-to-hand combat) still leaves a good sense of amazement. If that weren't enough, there is the possibility to customize all the colors of your units. Making war in Dark Crusade with these so immersive sensory suggestions proves to be truly exciting and frees the most primordial instincts that we all carry within us like it or not better to vent them here than in real life, don't you think?

If we add the exceptionality of its being ~stand alone~, of being able to play in LAN with a single copy of the game, of experiencing the conquest in single with all 7 races, we can only stand up and pay due homage to programmers. The only regret comes from the total absence of a narrative thread that we had come to appreciate in Warhammer and in the first Winter Assault expansion. There is little to add however: if you are not allergic to RTS, Dark Crusade MUST be part of your soft library! Pro Two New Breeds to Discover Tactical map that revolutionizes the single player experience Expansion that can also be played ~stand alone~ Cons Absence of a narrative ~glue~ It can cause habituation and addiction Over the past 2 years, Relic programmers have literally dominated the real-time strategy scene thanks to Warhammer first and then Company of Heroes. Undoubtedly, in a somewhat stale scene like that of the RTS, there was an urgent need for someone capable of finding a ~Hegelian~ synthesis, i.e. of combining the tradition of the genre but at the same time implementing features capable of making one feel a shiver of news for gamers. In the wake of the excellent results obtained, a new expansion for Warhammer 40,000 arrives after the already excellent Winter Assault: this time the time has come for a dark crusade that we will immediately get to know more closely.
