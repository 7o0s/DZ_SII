This is exactly what Roller Drama wants to do. Among late-capitalist dystopian atmospheres, undead cats and the ghost of William Shakespeare there is no shortage of absurdities, but at the end of this adventure you can say that you have discovered, and perhaps understood, a sport almost unknown in Italy: roller derby. This gladiatorial showdown between female skaters (which also has a less popular male version) is a delightfully innovative backdrop to tell the stories of five female athletes and their coach (whose role the player plays) as they struggle to find their place in a society familiar, but not too much. Clearly moving away from realism, statistics and rivalries, the new game from the Italian studio Open Lab Games, the authors of Football Drama, is a clear step forward compared to the previous work both in terms of gameplay and quality of writing. The two faces of Roller Drama, the sports one and the narrative one, are well intertwined and give the coach a central role in the development of the story. The task of Joan ~Jeanne d'Arc~ Galliano (the same surname as the protagonist of Football Drama), in fact, is to act as coach / psychologist / problem solver / romantic consultant and even firefighter for her five girls, always one step away from nervous breakdown. In this Roller Drama review we will try to tell you how this game has managed to make us passionate about an almost unknown sport, but also about its problems regarding the technical (sometimes dancer) and narrative side. The sport Once we understood the basic rules, Roller Drama's roller derby put us to the test and kept us entertained Roller Drama does a great job of explaining what, but more importantly, the allure of roller derby is. We summarize it briefly: two teams of five skaters each have to do everything to lap and outdo each other along an oval track. Four girls act as blockers and one as a jammer: the latter's goal is to overcome enemy blockers and help her teammates stop the other jammer. Each opposing blocker outplayed by the jammer is one point for the team. Roller derby is a contact sport (even quite violent) for which tenacity and resistance are needed to get to the end of a game and the title manages to replicate this experience well by condensing it to challenge those who play. As in Football Drama, you will not control the individual members of each team, but your job as coach will be to decide when the jammer has to accelerate, when the blockers have to defend (and with what formation) and above all use special powers in the form of cards to influence the game and bring you closer to victory. Roller Drama doesn't want to be a roller derby simulator, but to communicate the adrenaline, the frenzy, the extraordinary sweat of the athletes and above all the central role of the coach in keeping the team together. One of the moments that we liked the most, in fact, was that of the ~little speech~. Between one round and another (called jams in English) you can take your skaters aside and choose from a series of sentences to start, continue and end your motivational speech. If you have read the progress of the match and the mood of the girls well, then with the right words you could get a passive bonus that can prove to be decisive during a match. For those who have played many sports titles it will be difficult to abandon the role of the player in favor of that of the coach while those who are passionate about management will feel right at home. At the beginning of each game and between one round and another you will have to decide how intensely the skaters will have to take the field: managing their energy in the best possible way is the key to not losing effectiveness of the defense of the blockers and the agility of the jammers. There is also an autoplay function to skip a round or two of a game, but we strongly advise against using it: in the three game completions (which took between 3 and 5 hours each), each round we relying on autoplay resulted in a loss. History To complete the narrative missions set off the field you will have to interact with the skaters and solve problems together Roller Drama is a game that is as sporty as it is narrative and the story it wants to tell is one of revenge and personal growth. Throughout the game you will be given missions that you, as a coach, can choose how to complete to forge your relationship with one or more skaters. Every member of your squaddra, including you, has a self-esteem indicator that has a direct impact on your performance on the pitch. By treating the girls well and mediating the conflicts that arise, you can preserve the peace, your sanity and the morale of the team. To act as a spiritual guide to coach Galliano, then, there is none other than the ghost (or zombified version) of William Shakespeare who before, during and after each mission gives advice on how to proceed (i.e. what to physically do in the game) and on how to make one character happy rather than another. The setting for the exchanges and research of special objects is the big house that the team has rented and where the 6 sportswomen live together. Here the gameplay can be summed up in one sentence: being in the right place at the right time. Depending on whether an athlete is in her room or not, in fact, you can talk to her or interact with the objects in her room to find stolen, lost, hacked or smuggled things. This is because in addition to the competitions the girls will come across a kind of revolution to bring down the evil twins who control society with their technology company that deals with ~artificial~ intelligence. We too asked ourselves ~wasn't it supposed to be a roller derby video game?~ The answer is no, because, as history has taught us, separating sport from the society in which it is played would mean not having a complete picture. We won't discuss the story any further, but know that there is a lot of discontent in the Colosseum (the stadium where the girls compete). Group meetings before and after each match are crucial for team morale, especially after a loss Where the game has left us a little bitter in the mouth, unfortunately, is in the management of its protagonists whose personalities are not developed beyond the brief description that introduces them. Portia Fort, for example, is the team captain and is described as having the ~heart of a lioness, face of a mouse~. In the game though, she does little other than fall for a dude in five neat panels and set an iPad on fire trying to get it to work. We know even less about Cordelia, with whom we have maybe 20 exchanges throughout the game and the situation does not improve with the other three athletes, Anne, Juliet and Lily. We understand the scale of the project, but it's a shame to see the role of these five girls reduced to just those two and a half personality traits told in the introduction. The other problem we encountered was on a technical level: in the Switch version, in fact, the game tends to crash if a Joy-Con disconnects or you decide to change modes (docked or in hand) canceling even a good five minutes of progress.", "date": "2023-02-09", "grade": "7.0"}
