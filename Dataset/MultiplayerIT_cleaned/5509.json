For the launch of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End on PlayStation 4, Sony has chosen to launch on iOS and Android not a trivial companion app, but a title in its own right which, while exploiting the characters of the main series, offers a mechanic of game and an original graphic style and notably distant from those to which the Naughty Dog series has accustomed us. A gamble or a won bet? Nathan Drake arrives on smartphones in a completely different guise from the one we are used to Puzzles and treasures Uncharted: Fortune Hunter, despite having the good Nathan Drake as protagonist accompanied by his trusty Sully, is in fact a puzzle game: on the other hand it would have been at least unlikely to be able to transport the classic formula on smartphones and tablets, not so much for technical limitations as for interface. We have seen far too many attempts to ~force~ gameplay born and designed for traditional controllers on touch screens, and for this very reason Sony's decision seems to us the most sensible and intelligent. The choice of the puzzle genre, on the other hand, marries perfectly with portable devices, also following the path of a type of product capable of being appreciated across the board by both casual and more expert users. Uncharted: Fortune Hunter is therefore divided into a series of distinct levels, each of which takes place in a single screen on a rather small grid. The different boxes of the grid can accommodate simple trampling ground or rather traps, dangerous artifacts, switches, mechanisms or whatever. The aim is basically to manage Drake's movements by tracing with his finger the path that the protagonist will have to take to reach and then interact with the various elements present. The aim is to reveal and collect the treasure kept in each level, managing to solve the puzzles and at the same time avoiding dying. While finding some similarities with the excellent Lara Croft GO, Fortune Hunter still manages to stand out sufficiently, offering overall balanced and engaging gameplay that pushes you to continue one area after another. Although the difficulty level has been calibrated in such a way as to favor progression (we almost never find ourselves stuck for too long in a single stage), the presence of an additional bonus - a golden key - obtainable by finding the solution within a pre-established number of movements guarantees a good deal of replayability and a more substantial challenge for those interested. The collected keys are used to open special chests offered by Sully, which usually allow you to increase your availability of Coins or Mystical Spheres. These are ultimately the two in-game currencies featured, with a rather conventional solution within Freemium games on mobile platforms. Through them it is possible to purchase various additional costumes for Drake to wear within Fortune Hunter, but probably the element that will most interest PlayStation 4 users is the availability of exclusive rewards, relics and upgrades intended to be activated precisely in the mode multiplayer of Uncharted 4. In the first category there are two weapon skins, two hats and two outfits for Nathan and Sully, while in the second there are bonuses of various types. Nothing to tear your hair out of, mind you, but the integration between the two products is still appreciable, which provides a further incentive to play this mobile version. Which, among other things, is also appreciated for the technical component, or rather for the choice to adopt a different approach, thus avoiding unnecessary and improbable comparisons with the main series. In this case, however, Drake and Sully have been redesigned in a much more caricatured and cartoonish version, with a result that perhaps cannot be defined as unforgettable but which nevertheless gives the game a unique personality and characterization. Considering the many levels available with future updates intended to further increase the number, and emphasizing the choice of a non-invasive freemium formula, the Sony production can undoubtedly be defined as promoted.", "date": "2016-05-12", "grade": "8.2"}
