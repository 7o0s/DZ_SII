These are games in which precision and promptness are essential, because the focus is not so much on the targets we have to hit, but rather on not getting hit in turn, trying to dodge the hundreds of bullets that move at each moment towards our ship. After successfully bringing DoDonPachi Resurrection and DoDonPachi Blissful Death to iOS and Android terminals, Cave decided last year to create an exclusive chapter (apparently temporary) for Windows Phone, i.e. DoDonPachi Maximum, now also released in iPhone and iPad version. This is an important step for the Japanese team, which has therefore started working on new projects rather than continuing to rest on the laurels of a glorious past. The first consideration that came to mind concerns the technical aspect: no more improbable upscaling of games designed for resolutions much lower than those of the Retina display, which systematically limited the spectacularity of the action due to visible pixels and jaggies. However, the curiosity to understand how the developers would relate to this unprecedented challenge was equally great. Maximum power In the light of the facts, we can say that the result can be said to be achieved only halfway, because the graphics of DoDonPachi Maximum are perfectly defined, but the aesthetics of the product (which is presented as a sort of ~virtual simulator~) is far from from the visual richness of the episodes mentioned above, given that our vehicle moves in a repetitive and often anonymous digital space instead of flying over suggestive landscapes that would have benefited the great high definition. One could speak of an ~experiment~, in hindsight: Cave has focused on gameplay and structure, leaving out elements that, we are sure, will be implemented in the best possible way in the future. The novelties are quite numerous: at our disposal there are five spaceships to unlock as we complete the game (two more than the Windows Phone version, if we are not mistaken), each characterized by a different and non-upgradeable fire mode. You got it right: in DoDonPachi Maximum there are no classic power-ups and even the smart bomb (which this time is activated simply by touching the touch screen with a second finger) should not be collected around, but is loaded automatically when we eliminate a certain number of enemies. To promote replayability and considerably increase the longevity of the game, it was thought well to insert a crossroads path, which leads to five possible endings and has a total of fifteen levels with progressively greater degrees of difficulty. The hordes of enemies alternate extremely diverse and sometimes really difficult patterns, and the key to completing each stage is to memorize their moves and their positions, as well as the type of bullets that will be exploded against us. The issue of the only final boss has even been eliminated, because in each boss mission there will be several, to compose the picture of a challenge that is never trivial and which indeed manages to involve us completely. In addition to the graphics, which we have already talked about, the technical sector also has a very well done sound, with beautiful music but sometimes not exciting effects.", "date": "2012-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
