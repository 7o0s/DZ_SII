In the case of role-playing games then, the sequels are generally awaited by fans with palpable anxiety, eager to always try new adventures with their virtual alter egos. And it doesn't matter if the freshness and ideas of the beginnings are slowly diminishing: it is still a new episode, it is the imagination that takes back its rightful place. Zenonia 5 therefore starts with the onerous task of having to satisfy a demanding public, even if the premises, as we will see, are not decidedly positive. What class are you? An indispensable prerequisite for talking about Zenonia 5 is its apparent gratuitousness. Apparent because, unfortunately, on many occasions, the word ~free~ at the bottom of the application logo essentially turns into a decoy. We won't go back to the age-old question concerning freemium titles, whose structure in some cases leads to a choice between absolute frustration or economic bleeding; however, it is clear that the gameplay imbalance created voluntarily by a development team appears to be a not very ethical operation, even if obviously justified by economic reasons. In the specific case, we are witnessing an absolute unequal treatment of game enemies, divided between the ~standard~ ones and the bosses. The former are in fact easily eliminated, even too easily, without using any special skills but above all without the need for expensive upgrades. The bosses, on the other hand, can, in certain circumstances, induce the player to launch the tablet / smartphone from the window. If we exclude this last extreme reaction, there remain two choices to move forward in the story, namely the ~wild grinding~, in order to accumulate experience and strengthen one's character, or shorten the speech (by a lot) and put a hand in the wallet to buy the official virtual currency, called ~Zen~, with real money. The possession of many Zen allows for example the evolution of weapons and armor and the only way to get them for free is to participate in some sponsored event or wait 6 hours (for only 10 pieces!). Even on the events advertised to get Zen bonus there is an important note to make, given that they are essentially advertising banners, omnipresent precisely because one of the fundamental requirements to run the game is to have a permanent internet connection available. In practice, a kind of super DRM without any logical sense. We began the description of Zenonia 5 from the most problematic aspects because instead, tablet in hand, the game is not only very enjoyable but also vast, complex and with a decidedly robust gameplay, which further increases the regret for the form of distribution choice. The simple and intuitive control system, with the analog stick on the left, the action button and quick settings on the right, is practically perfect. You can choose 4 classes between berserker, mechanic or engineer, mage and paladin, each with its own peculiarity fundamentally linked to attacks, always contextualized. The setting is action in the approach but deeply RPG in the management of the inventory and of the characteristics of the characters (the ~crafting~ is even possible), with sometimes truly traditional ~quests~ (in the face of a trivial and obvious story), related to the search for a precise number of objects to bring back to the AI or to the rescue of important characters for the protagonist. Often you will have to return to explore areas already visited, also due to the need to kill as many monsters as possible, and inevitably a feeling of repetitiveness will peep out. However, the numerous and annoying deaths in the presence of the bosses will take care of bringing the movement back, with the dire consequences abundantly explained before. Also noteworthy is the presence of PvP in classic mode and a sort of Horde, called the conquest of the Abyss, in which to face increasingly fierce groups of enemies. At the time of writing, the first scheduled raid since the game was released is also preparing. Finally, the technical sector is also positive, with deliberately ~oriental~ isometric graphics and a decidedly inspired level design, especially in some glimpses.", "date": "2013-01-29", "grade": "7.2"}
