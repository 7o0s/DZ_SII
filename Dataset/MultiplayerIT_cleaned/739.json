{"name": "GUN - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gun-recensione.html", "text": "Wild Wild West From the very first lines, it is evident that Gun is an extremely story-driven title, with a plot that may not be very original but decidedly well written and capable of bringing together the strongest themes of the western imaginary. The title Neversoft tells the story of Colton White, a skilled and taciturn gunslinger whose relatively peaceful life as a hunter is turned upside down during a normal ~work~ day. Embarking on a steamboat with his father Ned to accompany him in the conclusion of a mysterious deal, Colton finds himself in the midst of a violent boarding raid, from which he barely manages to escape thanks to the intervention of Ned, killed shortly after by a terrible explosion. Thirsty for revenge, our hero thus heads towards Dodge City, following the latest instructions provided to him by his elderly parent. The convincing story of Gun develops from these premises, an adventure full of well-defined characters and typical western film situations, all described by a considerable amount of enjoyable real-time sequences. Paradoxically, the storyline turns out to be the best aspect of Gun and at the same time its biggest limitation. Paradoxically, the storyline turns out to be the best aspect of Gun and at the same time its biggest limitation Wild Wild West In fact, the plot develops in a truly impeccable way in terms of number and variety of characters, quality of the cut-scenes, user involvement and amalgamation with the various gameplay elements; but it also has the defect of proving to be too short and at times even hasty, leaving the user essentially dry-mouthed after just over six hours of play. This is enough time to complete Gun following only the main story and caring little about the numerous sub-missions made available by Neversoft. Sub-missions which, although appreciable and capable of slightly varying the gaming experience, turn out to be rather uninspired on balance, as well as almost useless on a practical level (the money and bonuses earned have an imperceptible effect on the progress of the adventure). Not only the subquests, but also various elements such as weapons, objects and even game situations in Gun seem to have been included just to make up the numbers, helping to instill in the user the feeling of being faced with a product that is in some ways incomplete. Fortunately, the quality and intensity of the action contained in the Neversoft product manage to make up for most of these shortcomings. North South West East Grossly described by some as a sort of GTA western, Gun is actually a ~simple~ third-person action game framed in an almost entirely free-roaming scenario and driven by two elements of sure appeal: shootings and violence. Regarding the first aspect, the Neversoft product performs the task in a more than excellent way, offering the user the opportunity to engage in excited firefights based on knives, pistols, shotguns and sniper rifles up to more picturesque offensive tools such as bows and sticks of dynamite. The richness of the arsenal is a reflection of the different combat situations offered by the game, which range from violent frontal clashes to almost stealth passages more suitable for sniping. However, the emphasis is placed on direct comparison, as evidenced by the presence of the Quick Draw mode: armed with his two revolvers, Colton enters a sort of bullet time equipped with automatic aiming, the devastating effects of which are limited by a gauge that fills up by killing. The richness of the arsenal is a reflection of the different combat situations offered by the game North South West East A full-bodied part of the playful experience is then made up of the horse riding sections, decidedly fun and well implemented: the control of the animal is convincing (particularly the presence of a bar representing the energy of the beast is spot on, which therefore cannot be spurred endlessly), as well as the missions that you are called upon to face in this area, the nature of which varies from chases spiced up with frenetic shootings to real western gems such as the one concerning the assault of a running convoy. Solid and sufficiently varied, the gameplay of Gun shows the side in terms of the level of difficulty, which could have been less condescending also considering the brevity of the adventure. The ~extreme~ imprint given by Neversoft to its own representation of the West raises some doubts: in addition to an often completely gratuitous visual and verbal violence, the design of some characters and scenarios and the treatment of some passages of the storyline are not convincing, so above the linesto be ridiculous. Stylistic issues aside, however, Gun's cosmetics performs its task well, without ever impressing: alongside an excellent and vivid reproduction of the scenario there are polygonal models that are a bit angular but realistically animated, both in game and during cutscenes. Thumbs up also for the light effects and the skilful use of ragdoll physics, elements that contribute greatly to making the various firefights spectacular. Finally, the remarkable quality of the sound sector of the Neversoft product should be underlined, with an excellent dubbing in English (fortunately left intact in the Italian edition) and a selection of evocative music, spot on and respectful of the western tradition. Cross-platform Available for PS2, Xbox, Gamecube and PC, Gun proves to be a decidedly democratic product, as it does not present major differences between the various versions. In the console field - as usual - the Neversoft title appears cleaner on Xbox, but beyond this the three incarnations do not stand out for significant qualitative fluctuations such as to justify the purchase of one over the other. The best cosmetic performance is certainly on the most up-to-date PCs, while in terms of control system, Gun can be played well on any platform indifferently. Final comment Gun turns out to be a good title in the field of third-person action games and certainly one of the best videogame exploits of the western genre, however thanks to very little competition. Appreciable but not amazing from a technical point of view and fun but not exciting in terms of gameplay, Gun manages to establish itself as a product of remarkable workmanship (thanks also to an exciting storyline) but also gives the idea of a title not from the all balanced, also penalized by a rather reduced longevity. That said, Gun still remains a highly recommended game for western lovers, and more generally for anyone looking for a solid action game. Pros Fast-paced fun gameplay Engaging narrative background Good technical realization Cons Very short main adventure Low difficulty level Incomplete in some respects It certainly cannot be said that the western genre plays a dominant role within today's television, cinematographic and videogame landscapes. Indeed, if it weren't for some very sporadic releases, one could almost say that the dusty stories of gunslingers and bandits have ingloriously fallen into oblivion. Precisely for this reason, the announcement by Neversoft of its project regarding a third-person action game set in the old West aroused no small curiosity, also due to the particular background of the US software house, universally known for its work on the Tony Hawk series. In light of these facts, the development of Gun has therefore been followed with considerable interest: let's now see if the final product is actually able to meet expectations.", "date": "2005-11-24", "grade": null}
