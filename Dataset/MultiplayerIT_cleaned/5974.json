For a while they were the hit of the moment, the bestsellers, the brilliant idea that broke the market and guaranteed profits and projects that were renewed year after year. Then the curve started sloping downwards: first imperceptibly, ok a few copies sold less, what will it be? then the collapse was almost vertical and no one wanted to hear about plastic guitars and fake drums anymore. Within a few years the star of the music games went on and off like a very bright flash in the pan that probably already exhausted everything it had to say in the first editions, the rest was simply a matter of adding songs and DLC. However, with the new generation of consoles, lovers of the genre can return to hope, both the big names in the sector, namely Guitar Hero and Rock Band, are back on stage to let us once again experience the illusion of knowing how to play a guitar and manage a band. Now let's see if the Harmonix title has the flavor of a good reunion full of nostalgia or shares the sadness with yet another ~best of~ made to raise some change. Are you ready to rock with our Rock Band 4 review? You again? So what's new in Rock Band 4? Essentially the structure has remained identical to that of the previous chapters, only updated to the new generation. The graphics are a little cleaner, the models of the singers still have a cartoonish design, albeit more detailed, but otherwise the game is the same. Harmonix and Mad Catz probably weren't looking for a revolution, but the creation of a solid and well-known platform to develop over time and with which to ferry all the fans of the brand who still buy songs on the old systems to the next-gen. There are three basic gameplays. The first is a quick concert, perfect for showing the game to friends or playing the song that's been in our heads since we woke up. In the Show, on the other hand, we will be able to play with our group, vote for the various songs and always play something new without having to select a song in the menu each time. The Tour is obviously the most interesting part and it is basically the career mode, which will allow us to create our band, give it a name, choose its members and make all the decisions that will characterize its growth, from local group to rock legend. In fact, at each stage we will basically have to choose whether to get more fans and have the possibility to choose our lineup or rely on artistic directors and managers who will limit the choice of tracks but will guarantee more money and free items; in short, the good old dilemma between creative freedom and base money. Unfortunately, an online mode is totally missing, which fell victim to the budget cut and abandonment of the project by Electronic Arts, which forced the developers to make some sacrifices. Another illustrious victim is the Pro mode, which has totally disappeared, and the keyboard: the instruments available are in fact the guitar, bass and drums, as well as obviously the voice. A certain shortage of funds can also be understood from the tracks available at launch. There are undoubtedly some interesting pieces but the truly rock ones are few and perhaps more tracks known to the general public were needed which would have guaranteed the game greater visibility. Furthermore, perhaps it was appropriate to include more female voices, which are in short supply. Lonely men The other novelty of the game concerns the possibility of performing guitar (or bass) solos and the freedom of being able to interpret the track in a different way from the original, while maintaining a certain intonation. The guitar improvisations are undoubtedly one of the funniest parts of the game because, in addition to giving the impression of being able to play a scary riff, they immediately make you understand the difference between who is pressing the keys at random and who is really trying to strike up a sensible melody. In fact, during the solos we will be able to do our own thing and not take any bonuses or follow the instructions on the screen, which will ask us to hold a long note or hit the pick at a certain rhythm or key. The game will then try to translate the pressing of the keys into a sensible melody, but even with all the goodwill it is immediately clear when the guitarist has absolutely no idea what he is doing. Only the best will be able to find sound solutions that are able to mix the notes well for a truly epic moment. It is a pity therefore that the game does not reward those who work harder but limits itself to giving points based on how much we havefollowed the script of the solo. The only defect of these parts is that being able to connect them again with the classic game, in which you press certain keys in time, can be particularly difficult and you will have to memorize the songs well for impeccable transitions. Playstation 4 trophies To unlock all the achievements of Rock Band 4 you have to work hard, because some require a very high skill with the instruments. In addition, there are achievements and trophies that are obtained only by playing in groups, so either we find someone with drums or we will have to buy them and invite someone good enough to play it with skills. Completion freaks be warned! Once upon a time beautiful song Luckily Rock Band 4 is fully backwards compatible, so if you played the title on Xbox 360 you can use the same tool on Xbox One and the same goes for the PlayStation 3 and 4 versions. However, it should be noted that USB tools are not compatible and those for Xbox 360 require an adapter. The problem is that, if we analyze the market trend, many of the owners of the Microsoft console have now switched to Sony. In this unfortunate case you have to buy everything from scratch. If you decide to buy everything again or if it's your first Rock Band you can count on a small reproduction of the famous Fender Stratocaster guitar, which we hope doesn't need too many introductions. The instrument, despite being made of plastic, is undoubtedly very well made and can also be handled by people of a fairly large tonnage or who have too small hands. The guitar also has two sets of frets, one in the upper part of the neck and one in the lower part: this division is necessary to reproduce low or high key notes during solos and if you want you can play using both, if you really are rock dragons . As for the precision of the hardware we were quite satisfied, however it seemed to us that in some moments the guitar decided to ignore the pick strike in some sequences of notes repeated at a short distance, even in easy mode. We don't know if it was due to any Bluetooth interference or something else, however the problem seems to have resolved itself after a few calibrations and a couple of reboots. As far as the tracks are concerned, the matter is identical to the hardware: if you change your system, say goodbye to your collection, however if you have remained faithful to your favorite console manufacturer, know that you will still have to be very patient to recover your catalogue, because the The process is quite long and cumbersome. Furthermore, at the moment some tracks, even if recognized by Rock Band 4, are not available, but will only be available in the future, a future that we hope will come very soon because the list of songs in this fourth chapter did not seem particularly suitable for those who looking for something so exhilarating that he wants to set fire to the guitar immediately after (don't do it, it costs a lot!). Our basic doubt is that perhaps fans of the franchise will prefer to keep an old console with all the songs already installed rather than switch to the new system, which does not offer so much compared to what we have already seen and with which they cannot play online. However Rock Band 4 is here to stay and will be a service supported by tons of songs and DLC: we are sure that sooner or later even the most reluctant fan will make the generation leap.", "date": "2015-10-15", "grade": "8.0"}
