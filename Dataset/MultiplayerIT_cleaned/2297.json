{"name": "Gothic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gothic.html", "text": "POOR IS BORN... Gothic is an rpg-adventure with an exquisitely genuine flavor and, in its own way, real. In the sense that you will have to resign yourself: you will be unquestionably, inevitably, inexorably poor in the barrel. Before being able to buy you a pair of trousers, time will have to pass, and you will have to manage to survive among the miners' barracks, paying a ~bribe~ to the members of the guard to be protected, trying to improvise yourselves as a blacksmith to collect some money, but above all ingratiate yourself with the Shadows, or the caste of warrior-guardians of the old camp. To do this, the best way is undoubtedly to try to complete the quests that will be assigned to you by the various characters that you will find around the castle walls. What is most impressive is the care that has been taken to recreate a setting as real as possible! People live and work, talk around, rest, shop. In the evening everyone goes to sleep, and when it's dark it's better to find a shelter, before someone emerges from the darkness to beat you up. But above all... listen, listen: after years of ramshackle looting activities, Gothic says enough! In fact, it is no longer possible to enter the houses and rummage in the trunks as best we like, since we will be immediately reprimanded by the owner, who will warn us to leave. ...RICH YOU GET WITH EFFORT (PANT PUFF)! In this game you play a character without choosing one of the usual classes we are used to, but along the course of his wanderings, and as the levels go up, you can distribute the skill points as you see fit between the main characteristics (strength, dexterity, health) or try to learn from those who can teach you a series of skills and knowledge that will gradually form the ~culture~ of your digital avatar. Theft and burglary skills, learn to hunt, fight in the arena, become an expert wizard or alchemist or even a ruthless assassin. Continuing on the line of almost total freedom, it should be noted that it is really possible to do and go wherever one wants. Or rather, I correct the shot, it is possible but it is not convenient. While it is true that you can visit places when and how you want, surviving enough is another matter. There are clearings that only allow you to explore if you can withstand a myriad of adversities, and then some things require a minimum character level, such as admission among students of the alchemist's school in the swamp field, for example, only to cite an example. We can therefore deduce that there is a well-constructed and captivating plot, at the same time we are given the freedom to choose which side we are on and where to go, only giving us some small ~door in the face~ and dismissing us with a sort of ~Come back later! ~ when it comes to making things too big for us. INTERFACE: THIS UNKNOWN For two reasons, one pleasant and the other a little less so. First, it's not intrusive at all, on the contrary the view is totally free from any window or menu... so come on! Everything can then be recalled with a few keys, and in general there is no shortage of space. What is missing, at least initially, is a bit of practicality altogether, given that to move objects, barter (eh, yes... it's a semi-wild world) brandish a weapon, you will always have to turn the items and objects holding down the action key in combination with the arrows. Same combination that you will need in combat and to activate objects, climb ladders, and the like. Very amusing is the idea of making the character use objects that may not be needed in the actual game, such as, for example, taking a break by sitting on a wooden bench, picking up the pickaxe and improvising as miners, smoking mystical herbs (ahem, I won't comment... I'm just saying, visit the swamp field as soon as you get the chance and you'll understand even better). In any case, after the first disorientation, it actually turns out to be a more than acceptable solution. I've seen games fail because of a bad interface: don't worry, it's not the case with Gothic. I GET LIGHTS Gothic is graphically very satisfying. Undoubtedly the first thing that catches the eye is the superb quality of the textures of the characters (seeing is believing) that populate this world. The faces, the weapons, the clothes and even the animations make the game really populated by people, i.e. we don't have the feeling of being in the middle of a mass of puppets. As far as the landscape is concerned, we go from verdant nature to rugged mountains, up to the wettest swamps and the deepest mines. The fear of venturing alone for an ambush around the corner makes itself felt, believe me, and you will hardly go around at night tothe woods. Day and night alternate superbly, outlining profiles and shadows as I have rarely seen before. An immersion in the atmosphere of real applause! Moving on to the sound department, it is to be commended that each and I stress each dialogue is spoken as well as subtitled (always in English anyway). And there are not a few dialogues at all, on the contrary! Each person will have interesting things to say! Among other things, with excellent voices and acting! Clap number 2. TIME FOR CHOICES In contrast to the many choices to which you will be called to answer, there is your personal choice: do I buy it or not? My answer is undoubtedly yes. Gothic is a great game in almost every way, and the efforts of the programmers at Piranha Bytes are paying off. A fun and intriguing game, truly fantastic and fantastically real, if you'll pardon the pun. No powerplay for half an hour of play and then I get bored, but a progressive climb in history and character growth. A jewel of singleplay, which in my humble opinion is a candidate for the best RPG of the year. SEMO UNDER AR CUPOLONE Once upon a time there was the kingdom of Myrtana. A once prosperous kingdom, and then ravaged by wars for domination of the lands. After centuries of battles, King Rhotbar II managed to establish a peaceful realm around himself. At least until the orcs of the north come (yes, green and sweaty stinkers never fail!). The unstoppable advance could only be stopped by reinforcing one's stocks of weapons, and to do this one needed iron. Khorinis, the city that mined the most precious ore for battle, magical iron, had to be protected at all costs. The king thus summoned twelve wizards to court, six from the circle of fire and six from the circle of water to create an enormous barrier that surrounded the city and the mines, which prevented the escape of prisoners put to forced labour, which living to enter, but not to leave. Unfortunately, the wizards' miscalculations caused the barrier to expand more than it should, trapping them all and the royal guard, who were soon overwhelmed by the captives. The years passed, and in order to survive, a sort of compromise was created: magical iron collected from the prisoners for food and subsistence goods provided by the king. Different currents of thought, and factions were created. Dividing the area into three large agglomerations. The Old Camp, under the orders of Gomez and his bodyguard, with the collaboration of the fire mages. The New Camp of Lee, a rebel against the will of the king however, was populated by thieves and mercenaries, with the support of the Water wizards. The third camp, on the other hand, was populated by a mysterious sect of holy alchemists, dedicated to religious practices in adoration of their liberator from the slavery of the barrier, The Sleeper. A place of confinement and punishment. A place where delinquents are thrown... and you are one of them, at least until you make a name for yourself in the neighborhood...", "date": "2001-12-27", "grade": null}
