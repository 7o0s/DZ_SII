{"name": "Redemption Reapers: la recensione di uno strategico a cui non serve una storia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/redemption-reapers-recensione.html", "text": "The debate about whether a video game really needs a narrative component has been going on forever. There are titles that base their entire essence on the story and others that use it as a simple interlude between one fight to another. Unfortunately, or fortunately, Redemption Reapers belongs to this second category. This tactical RPG has a synergistic and interesting combat system, but tells a very boring and boring story. Developed by Adglobe and published by Binary Haze Interactive, Redemption Reapers takes much of what has been done well by Fire Emblem, XCOM and Tactics Ogre and remixes it, innovating slightly, in a dark fantasy sauce. The gothic aesthetic is a welcome sigh of relief from the usual paladins in shining armor of the genre but, both visually and narratively, the stereotypes of the JRPG genre drown the non-combat moments almost unbearable. Where this game does very well, though, is in its own take on the classic turn-based tactical strategy mechanics, where the most important element is the positioning of a given character. In this Redemption Reapers review we will tell you the pros and cons of this game, but only you can decide if a title almost completely devoid of interesting narrative is worth your time. The curve is tight The mundane story is an easy hurdle to overcome to enjoy Redemption Reapers' combat system Redemption Reapers follows the story of the Ash Hawk Brigade, a group of five mercenaries called to help some unspecified nations free themselves from the Mort, ugly and evil orcs who for some reason are setting fire to all the villages and cities they meet. Rarely have we seen an enemy so devoid of identity and with such vague motivations that we (almost) lose the desire to intervene to rescue civilians. As the hours go by, a few more elements of the plot emerge, but very slowly and with lots of useless fillers. We haven't had any satisfaction from the point of view of character development either. The five playable heroes and the other characters we interacted with on a character level are flat as boards and merely perpetrate the stereotypes they embody. In short, all the good that is in this title comes from its combat system. Before analyzing the gameplay of Redemption Reapers it is important to make a clarification: it is not a simple game. If you like challenges, there's a lot to match in this tactical RPG, but if you're looking for a more relaxed experience or where you can simply decide the level of difficulty, then better stay away. Already in the first hours of the game we found ourselves repeating the same level even five or six times because the enemies are so many and they hit really hard. Every character and every opponent has stats that determine whether or not they can dodge an incoming attack but sometimes the AI will go after a particular member of your team. Placing a hero in the wrong spot is tantamount to seeing him die and dwindling your hopes of victory. Frustration makes itself felt, but once you get the hang of it, the satisfactions begin to arrive. Now that we've made it clear that Redemption Reapers is a tough game, we can start breaking down its combat system. Tactics without barriers In the Redemption Reapers maps you will find yourself fighting on bridges and bottlenecks where it is essential to watch your back Following a pattern already seen, the Redemption Reapers game flow consists of seeing a cinematic sequence, preparing the characters for battle by assigning them weapons, equipment and skills (active and passive), facing the hordes of Morts and repeating. Structurally each map is made up of a grid of squares, often has uneven levels and has an objective ranging from killing all enemies present, to eliminating a particular boss and can include escorting a non-player character or accompanying the heroes to a particular location. As in most tactical titles, the distance the characters can travel each turn is limited and even a single square can mean the difference between being hit or missed by an enemy attack. Each of Redemption Reapers' five heroes has PA (action points) available to attack, defend, or use special moves that protect themselves or teammates. Each attack (friend or foe) almost always corresponds to a counterattack unless the opponent is defending himself or specific effects come into play through objectsor skill. Each character then has a ~Sip~ available with which to heal, which can be recharged in specific points on the map at the cost of limiting one's movements for a turn. The most fun element of this game's combat is the chain attacks. If an enemy is within range of multiple characters, attacking one of them will trigger a quick time event through which allies can land additional hits against an enemy. Placing your heroes correctly could lead you to attack many more times than your action points allow. We were five mercenaries at the fortress Each Redemption Reapers character has customizable stats, weaponry, and abilities (active and passive). The beating heart of any tactical RPG is its playable characters and Redemption Reapers only has five of them but they embody the different styles of bladed combat well. There is Glenn the swordsman, very strong in attack but not exactly excellent defense. Sara is quick and agile and with her daggers and has an attack at her disposal that is guaranteed to dodge the enemy counterattack. Lugh (read Laf) is a spearman with little resistance and health but who can strike diagonally and from several squares away, positioning him in the best way is the key to making him inflict as much damage as possible and protect his allies. Urs is big, hulking, and full of health, so make him a target for enemy attacks and he'll fight back with his big axe. Lastly, Karren is an archer who can strike even at a distance of 4 or 5 squares while still activating chain attacks. Scattered around the map you will find weapons and accessories with which to enhance the ten stats of each hero (attack, accuracy, dodge , defense, movement, strength, dexterity, speed, endurance and faith) and as you fight you will level up by unlocking skill points to spend in the related skill trees. As you play, the combat system based on these five heroes evolves in unexpected ways thanks to the new moves that are unlocked over time. There is no cover in the maps so forgetting or not having enough AP to defend yourself means risking losing a character and finding yourself at a clear disadvantage. The enemies are many and if you don't get rid of them you could find yourself losing your entire party within two turns. When your chain attacks are multiplied thanks to strategic positioning, however, the satisfaction is very high and even the toughest of bosses will fall on the edge of your blades.", "date": "2023-02-25", "grade": "7.0"}
