{"name": "Saints Row - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saints-row-recensione.html", "text": "Welcome sinners The whole story takes place in Stilwater, a gigantic metropolis where lavish wealth contrasts with ghetto life, a lustful and chaotic scenario so dear to Rockstar Games for its stellar GTA series. It is no coincidence, of course, since Volition, developer of the title, is clearly inspired by this series, presenting eerily similar play mechanics. In other words, it is a clone that interprets the saga from a different point of view, rather than exploiting it cynically. Just like in CJ's adventures, here too we will find ourselves in the middle of a gang war, between disreputable individuals who consider bullets far more persuasive than dialogue, succinct and unscrupulous girls, disturbing criminal bosses. And obviously the neighbors and the machines, ready to indulge in interactions with the protagonist. To allow complete identification, it is immediately possible to shape your virtual alter ego (male only) using a rather satisfactory editor, and see it in action in the initial cutscenes, pleasantly noting how the engine keeps in memory the connotations resulting from our fervent imagination . Our bold young man is immediately welcomed under the protective wing of the Saints, one of the four aforementioned gangs that rage in the city. Each of them is characterized by a specific color, color is really everything in Saints Row. From clothes, to graffiti, to cars, chromaticism is a faith and a lifestyle, so much so that it almost takes on a political value. But in reality it is a functional choice, because in the most agitated shootings there is no time to distinguish allies from enemies. And many will happen right from the start. This element, needless to say, has already been seen in San Andreas, the latest iteration of the Rockstar franchise, but where Volition hits the mark is in the characterization of the stories that distinguish the gangs. The script is excellent, full of key characters, and unfolds along four parallel events, made up of a dozen missions each, which the player can alternate at will right away. It is a crucial element that represents the first step of a product worthy of attention, after a few hours the player already has a large number of destinations on the map, and these concern both the main quest and a very large series of secondary missions. But it's not an aimless playful generosity, the game has a new element, respect, that is to say a bar that must be filled in order to access the various chapters of the story. And to earn it you need to face the aforementioned optional quests. But not only that, it is also possible to work your imagination and take a poor innocent hostage, upset the game's AI for a few seconds and see the bar magically fill up. Or clean up the various strongholds of rival gangs, located in the city. The possibilities are therefore many. Vivisection of a masterpiece The impression one gets from playing is that of a much more permissive and enjoyable GTA, certainly less vast, but which focuses on a more organic gameplay, without getting lost in activities for their own sake. And this feeling will last until the end. An advantage also conferred by the unique scenery. Despite the large size and variety of its neighborhoods, Stilwater remains a much less dispersive map than the three megalopolises of San Andreas, so much so that the game allows the player to travel from one end to the other as part of the final missions . And here two further elements come into play, a dynamic map navigation system, which indicates the best trajectory to reach the interested area with an arrow, and the extreme efficiency of the driving model. Both are fundamental, since the player has a track on the ideal route that can update itself if he takes the wrong road, and reactive cars that don't inhibit walking. The improvement of this system is so evident that one ends up improvising magnificently, taking shortcuts in case the public forces take over. The impression one gets from playing is that of a much more permissive and enjoyable GTA, certainly less vast, but which focuses on a more organic gameplay Vivisection of a masterpiece The police, yes. Another detail that undergoes yet another, efficient filing in Saints Row. Carrying out crimes, killings or barbarism only relatively increases the bar of the ~law~, if away from prying eyes, otherwise the degenerate is obvious, with the inevitable army and FBI trucks. In Saints Row you always have a chance to escape, perhaps by taking refuge in a shady placeconscience washing center, and warding off all danger (obviously not for free). And if he too goes badly, the protagonist would wake up completely unharmed in front of the hospital, as we are already used to, but with all the weapons instead of him. Basically, therefore, the game is much more benevolent and accessible than its inspirer, a double-edged sword, however, which makes most of the experience all too easy. The protagonist can eat to recover his strength, but this is an action that is scarcely necessary, since his energy is automatically restored after a few seconds. Furthermore, in case he recruits allies from his own gang, he is also able to resurrect them, making them effectively invincible. The greatest challenge instead comes from the last missions, which require lightning times and sudden actions, so as to border on frustration, but we are still far from the difficulty of Gta. Saints Row is simply made of another pasta, it wants to make the hours spent in this bizarre town pleasant and fun, and it succeeds very well. It takes beastly physics Technically the work Volition arouses mixed impressions. The game engine, always streaming from disc, is a big step forward compared to the previous generation, with impressive atmospheric effects, quality textures and elaborate polygonal modeling, which does not leave even the unsuspecting passers by. But the real trump card is represented by the exploitation of physics, which allows gruesome scenes such as bodies thrown out of cars, incredibly realistic explosions, and much more. On the other hand, fluidity does not always respond to the appeal, with a decidedly unstable framerate during the most chaotic scenes. And there is an annoying V-Sync, i.e. a lack of synchronicity that breaks the image into two parts. The audio, on the other hand, is amazing, with a large number of famous voice actors and a stellar soundtrack, which alternates hip hop songs with frenetic rhythms, listenable not only from the cars, but also via the practical digital walkman that the protagonist always carries with him. The title fully supports Xbox Live, both for additional content (a pack with new clothes is already available) and online multiplayer. The latter is implemented in a rather creative way, alternating the classic deathmatch with other more original modes. However, it did not fully convince us, both as a type of game and for some too many problems with the connection. Saints Row remains a title strongly oriented towards the single player. The gang of targets Getting points in Saints Row is a rather challenging task, most of the objectives can only be reached in the late game, while to get the juiciest ones you need to conquer the entire city of Stilwater, i.e. complete the game. Even after this, however, it will be possible to collect other points by completing the various submissions, completely independent of the main story, or by trying your hand at the online multiplayer modes. To conquer the 1000 total points it is therefore necessary to deepen Saints Row in all its parts. Comment Can a clone be funnier than its inspirer? Saints Row stimulates us to delve into the question, and find a less obvious answer than expected. Volition has taken all the elements that made Tony Vercetti and CJ great, right from the graphic identity, but the result seems to be a work more moved by respect rather than a shameless desire for easy money. A sincere and highly enjoyable product, but which does not invent anything new and which will probably always remain as ~the shadow of GTA~. In the meantime, however, we can easily stop for a few days in Stilwater. It's absolutely worth it. Pros Good technical realization Very funny and varied Script well done Exceptional soundtrack Cons Very violent and vulgar, not for everyone A little frustrating in the final stages Graphic engine not very fluid It does not add anything to the GTA formula The protagonist of Saints Row has no name, he is simply called Player, a nobody who came from nowhere, but who will become the absolute master of an entire city. Obviously not without the help of our pad.", "date": "2006-11-03", "grade": null}
