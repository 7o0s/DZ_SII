The reason for this apparent laziness is obvious: the Wii edition unfortunately adds absolutely nothing in terms of content compared to the Ps2 version which, released on the market a few months after the original, had brought with it a handful of interesting extras. Therefore, in addition to the main quest featuring Leon Kennedy in search of the president's daughter, a victim of a kidnapping, a short parallel adventure is also included in which you take on the role of Ada Wong, thus observing the development of events from her point of view. of sight. As for the graphic component, the engine is the Gamecube one (better overall than the Sony counterpart), but with the addition of real 16:9 and progressive scan. The Wii version is therefore the best version ever, but that doesn't mean that the past years haven't left their mark: while still stylistically fabulous, and although the atmosphere has remained intact, it is indisputable as the advent of the next-gen you are forced to look at Resident Evil 4 differently. And so if the variety of settings, the polygonal models and in part the animations can still be considered current, a different story must be made for the textures, which especially when viewed on an HD TV show all the limits of low resolution. It therefore leaves a little bitterness to note how, despite all this, we are faced with one of the most aesthetically valid games available today for the Wii; we are therefore still waiting for productions that exploit the technical potential of the made in Kyoto platform to a greater extent. That's all. If you think more could have been done, well, you're right; offering owners of the new Nintendo console some exclusive content would certainly have delighted fans of the series, making this edition even more worthy of attention. As a partial excuse, it must be said that Capcom had the honesty to publish this Resident Evil 4 for Wii at a reduced price... and so for less than 40 euros it is possible (re) to get your hands on a game that is still capable of exciting today and to involve like few others with the novelty of a control system which, in a way that is not at all obvious, finally turns out to be better than the original and capable of adding something to the overall experience. Of course, inevitably the innovative and revolutionary nature of Mikami's creation is no longer perceived, but it is not a big problem we assure you. Resident wiimote If from a graphic and content point of view, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is nothing more than a summation of the best of the editions that have already appeared, it is in the control system that the Capcom production brings something new and specifically designed for the console on which it runs. As already mentioned, in fact, the scheme adopted marries excellently with the wiimote + nunchuck combination, proving to be superior to the original one linked to the classic pad. In practice, in nunchuk it is used to move Leon, using the analog stick. The Wiimote, on the other hand, is used to shoot, pointing it towards the screen and pressing the B key; the laser of previous versions has been replaced on this occasion by a sight, freely controlled by the remote control. This solution provides a much higher level of accuracy, allowing you to quickly hit exactly the spot you want. This undoubtedly makes things slightly easier, but the naturalness gained in managing this aspect makes the final result more than acceptable. Even performing the slashes with the knife becomes a much more immediate practice, since it is sufficient to perform a similar movement with the wiimote. Likewise, the ~QTA~ sequences, such as escaping from a rolling boulder, have been redesigned on the basis of the new controls, making everything very fresh and fun. On balance, therefore, the programmers have done an excellent job in this respect; even if some features, such as the need to stop to shoot, seem a bit anachronistic today, the use of the peculiar control system of the Wii constitutes a novelty that goes beyond the pure exercise of conversion, improving in a concrete and sensible the original experience. Comment Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is undoubtedly the best and most complete version of Capcom's masterpiece, capable of combining the graphic quality of thethe Gamecube edition and the Ps2 extras, including 16:9 and progressive scan. Furthermore, the control system redesigned to take advantage of wiimotes and nunchucks is really successful, proving to be able not only to overcome the classic scheme via pad, but also adding something to the enjoyment of the adventure. That said, the absence of any Wii-exclusive content leaves a bad taste in the mouth, despite the reduced price at which it is sold in shops. An obligatory purchase for those who have never played one of the best video games in recent history; the others must instead evaluate their willingness to repeat an experience already lived, where the only real novelty is enclosed in the wiimote. Pros Gameplay still outstanding Great atmosphere and storyline Very good control system Cons No new content Graphically identical to the GC More than two years have now passed since a Gamecube now directed towards the sunset avenue welcomed that authentic masterpiece called Resident Evil 4; Shinji Mikami managed to combine sincere creative ecstasy with considerable courage by rewriting the gameplay of his most famous and appreciated series from the ground up, thus going to sign again an indelible page in the history of video games. After the obvious conversions for Ps2 and PC, today Resident Evil 4 finds its definitive place within the Nintendo Wii offer, with what can be considered without fear of contradiction the richest and most complete version.", "date": "2007-07-08", "grade": null}
