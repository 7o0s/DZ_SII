The complete series consists of six English-language episodes. The cost of each single episode is 4.99, the complete package 27.99. The following text is reasonably devoid of anticipations. It will be because compared to many other players we were a little disappointed with the first two episodes of this series, but after the third episode the enthusiasm pervaded us, and now we consider it one of the series best created by Telltale, second only to the first season of The Walking Dead. The merit is certainly not of the technical sector. Even if the third episode had seemed more polished, now we're back to feeling the limits of an old and poor graphics engine. As we repeat from the beginning, it's a shame because the idea of applying a brush effect to images to make them look like moving paintings is perfect for the game's content. If only the developers had taken care of this game as they did with Tales From the Borderlands, the events of the Forrester house would seem even more epic to our eyes. The strong point of the series is therefore not the look. The merit is to be found rather in the dense network of connections that bind the characters together, making sure that everyone has the fate of the others in their hands and in turn is at the mercy of their decisions. Mira must protect the family's business interests from distant King's Landing without leaving his head on a pike, Gared has the difficult task of finding the mysterious North Grove, and at the same time redeeming his honor before the Night's Watch, who they consider a traitor. Asher, on the other hand, is engaged in a war of liberation in Meereen, from which he hopes to return with an army of mercenaries to be deployed in defense of the Forrester castle, but has to deal with the unpredictable Beskha and the wrath of Queen Daenerys. The actions of Rodrik weigh on all of them, Lord wounded in body and pride, forced to play a game of chess with the Whitehills that could lead to a bloodbath at any moment. This tangle of conflicts and irreconcilable desires is the driving force of George Martin's novels and we find it intact in the Telltale series. In fact, we have to say that the writers did a great job with the original material. On the one hand they intertwined the Forrester plot with the global one of the novels, on the other hand they staged the historical characters of the saga demonstrating a great knowledge of their personalities. Cersei, Tyrion, Daenerys  they all speak and act in line with their character. If George Martin had written this episode, we are convinced that the difference would not have been noticed. Act forcefully but choose carefully, for Sons of Winter punishes any mistake with death Family portraits The four playable characters can be distinguished from each other by the degree of control we have over each one. Mira and Gared have always been the ones that convinced us the least, because the developers deliberately left their characters ambiguous to allow us to choose who they really were. The player therefore has the task of making them act coherently so that they do not seem like lunatics without a remedy. Even if this choice continues to make us turn up our noses, the roles that the plot has carved out for them give them enough depth to make them much more than simple puppets in our hands. Gared in particular has become the focus of several conflicts and movements in the story, as well as having found his place in the game world in the Night's Watch. Asher instead stands a step above Mira and Gared. His personality was defined early on, but the light-hearted nature of his temper allows for some swings that the player can fit into. Rodrik dominates over all, the best character in the series. Not only has it been drawn in a very solid and precise way, but it also embodies all the qualities of a main protagonist. He is the charismatic center of the series and probably the character with whom it is easier to identify, since we know his desires well and can therefore side with his struggles. In fact, the most serious decisions always weigh on his shoulders, and in Sons of Winter he has to make several of them. Never as in this episode have we been on edge every time we had to make a choice or pronounce a word. The scene of the confrontation between Rodrik and Lord Lull, full of references to the Red Wedding, was the culmination of an episode that does not allow respite. However, the script requirements and the nature of the saga do not allow the writers to remain focused on Rodrik all the time, although he abhave been able to turn this need to their advantage. Moving from one point of view to another, they were able to alternate different narrative styles, giving life to an episode that has not a single weak moment. There is room for the dangerous gossip of Mira in King's Landing but also for the bloody infiltration of Asher in the fortress of Meereen. Furthermore, thanks to the fact that in every scene we know how high the stakes are, even the mundane and worn-out interactions during fights go unnoticed. For once it's okay to press keys on command, as long as the story goes on. And now give us two more episodes like this. Then we will be ready for the second season.", "date": "2015-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
