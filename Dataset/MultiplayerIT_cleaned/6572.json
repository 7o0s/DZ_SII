It is not a very recent title, and fans of the genre will probably already know it, since it was released at the end of 2013. We decided to review it because you have repeatedly reported it to us when talking about other visual novels, so here we are, ready to immerse ourselves in the sea of text it is made of. It tells the story of Eri, a sixteen year old girl who lives alone with her dolls. The student collects them to combat the deep sense of loneliness that grips her following the loss of her grandfather, who died a year before the story told in the game begins. Unfortunately her parents, while alive, are no comfort to her, since they work at sea and she never sees them. One morning he discovers in spite of himself that the much loved dolls have come to life, becoming human beings in flesh and blood. And what human beings! From that moment the dolls will become more than just imaginary friends and will make Eri experience new situations and sensations, which she would never have thought possible, as well as obviously causing her a lot of problems, since it will be really difficult for her to explain to her friends and acquaintances why and how he started living with five strangers. Don't worry, because we have only revealed a small part of what is a very long story with many facets and unheard-of implications. What is meant by otome? The term ~otome~ generally refers to visual novels dedicated to a female audience, centered around romantic relationships. The typical otome has as its protagonist a girl, usually of high school age, who has to choose who to risk a romance with between various boys (it is not always the case, but let's say that as a general rule it is quite valid). Hidden darkness First of all, it is right to highlight some differences with its predecessor, the aforementioned Dandelion. Some will find similar themes playing Nameless ~The One Thing You Must Recall~, but the similarities stop there, since Dandelion integrated advanced dating simulator mechanics, while Nameless is a pure visual novel, i.e. mostly story which does not require intervention by the player except to scroll the text. Of course, there are choices to make, but it is the classic selection between different items of a text menu, so nothing striking from a playful point of view. Not bad, actually, because the branches still allow you to replay Nameless several times so as to experience all the possible stories and evolutions of the plot. On the contrary, let's try to be more specific: to really understand Nameless you have to replay it several times, trying to get to know all the characters better. We must exhaust all the branches of the story, including those without happy endings, so as to have a broader overall picture and, above all, so as to unlock the chapters and secret characters that give access to the true ending, the one in which we get to understand the tragedy of Eri's life. It is clear that to do this you need to want to read all the texts, even for many hours, fighting against the discouragement caused by some delays actually present (in some cases the Koreans can be more verbose than the Japanese). It's really the only way to enjoy Nameless as it deserves, beyond the otome veneer. In fact it is easy to be deceived by the delicate stroke of the drawings and by some comedy situations present in the initial stages of the story. However, the reality is different, given that Cherizt's title hides many more secrets than what it suggests at a superficial glance. The dialogues unlocked by accessing one of the endings, some unexpected situations with a particularly dramatic and dark flavor, together with the more tense and exciting moments, create a narrative mixture of great intensity that deserves to be experienced, capable as it is of developing an interest in the viewer which goes far beyond that of passion for the genre. Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~ is a must-discover visual novel for girls Too bad about the translation The narrative stratification is probably the key to the love that many feel for Nameless, given that it is not easy to find other visual novels, especially here in the West, equally capable of modulating tones and situations, passing from light moments to other more adults with incredible naturalness. The same drawings help to create the right atmosphere for the narrated facts, thanks to warm colors with never excessively saturated tones and the milky white complexion of the characters, which manages to convey the sense of restlessnessdine that pervades them. It's a pity only for some backgrounds of fluctuating quality, which in any case are little noticed, enraptured as one is by history and its evolutions. Even the music that makes up the soundtrack and the use made of it help enormously in the characterization of the gaming experience, with the tones modulated in intensity according to the emotional strength of what is happening on the screen. We also recommend not turning off the voices of the characters, because they enrich them a lot, despite being in the original language and difficult to understand by our local audience. Unfortunately Nameless also has some problems. Besides the aforementioned fluctuating quality of the backgrounds, the most noticeable is the strangeness of some texts. We don't dare to judge the translations, because we don't know Korean, but it is clear that some sentences have been rendered in bad English, a not insignificant defect given that reading some somewhat awkward sentences breaks part of the narrative charm. Probably the translators have tried not to distort the meaning of some original expressions and have remained faithful to the source text. The fact remains that the false notes are felt, although they do not bring down the overall quality of the title.", "date": "2015-02-12", "grade": "8.8"}
