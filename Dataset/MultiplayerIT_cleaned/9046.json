If football Konami has so far presented on all the ~major~ platforms an experience of the same quality, the same cannot be said of the EA Sports counterpart ... at least until today. Loudly announced by developers and producers, the long-awaited ~draw~ between the PC and console versions of FIFA 12 has in fact arrived, the latest edition of a product that our review has already rewarded with a resounding nine and a half . There are no official reasons behind the differences that have characterized the Electronic Arts sports series on HD gaming systems (let's call them that), but it is reasonable to think that the Californian publisher has simply taken into account the enormous difference in terms of sales between the console versions and FIFA PC, concluding that the revision work needed to bring the new engine to the Windows platform would not pay off. The approach in itself has led to a further decline in popularity of the franchise on personal computers, and despite the efforts made last year to equip the game with at least the same cosmetics available on PS3 and Xbox 360, the current situation is all uphill and starts from the less than one hundred thousand copies sold by FIFA 11 on PC against the almost nine million units placed on consoles. Will the draw obtained with FIFA 12 be enough to balance the situation and provide an additional boost to the franchise? It is not yet known, however it is certainly a step in the right direction, towards a future perhaps made up of cross-platform challenges and ~unified~ features. And revolution it was The fundamental reason why FIFA has long since surpassed PES lies in the ability of EA developers to put themselves in the game year after year. Indeed, rather than implementing conservative strategies, David Rutter and his team have continued to modify the experience so that it truly reflects their idea of a football simulation, without ever stopping to reason like ~the team that wins, you don't change~, despite the great success so far. A risky approach, there is no doubt, but which has so far borne fruit and for courage and innovation has literally tore up the competition, which specifically, after the changes made last year, has once again sat on its laurels, search for optimizations that are undoubtedly useful but which are not able to produce the improvements that users now expect from each new edition. FIFA 12 offers quite a few new features, both in terms of structure and in terms of gameplay. As for the first, the strong ~social~ connotation that surrounds the heart of the product is immediately noticeable and adds various layers that can be discovered and explored or ignored, depending on how we want to ~experience~ football EA Sports . Thinking about the needs and expectations of the most diverse players is a big point in favor of the game, which takes the ~numerical~ reasoning beyond the squads, players and teams, to the benefit of variety and therefore of the final longevity. It starts from the EA Sports Football Club, a new all-encompassing system that stores our data and those of our friends with a view to obtaining experience points that improve the characteristics of our ~virtual player~ as well as our favorite club, complete with a world leaderboard divided by category, and continues with the native implementation of Ultimate Team, a sort of ~fantasy~ that bases its appeal on the statistics of clubs and players and which allows those who already have a team to import your data in seconds, thus promoting the continuity and elasticity of the experience. Even the online modes are enriched in content: in addition to the classic friendlies, it is in fact possible to access the so-called Head-to-Head Seasons, real championships that take into account the results of our ranked matches and interpret them from the perspective of a series of ~divisions~ which also lead to cups and tournaments, thus adding an important element of progression where, previously, there was only impromptu entertainment. Attack and defense FIFA 12 is therefore ~reinvigorated~ from the point of view of the side modes, but as previously mentioned, the changes made to the EA Sports title also and above all concern the gameplay, and exemplify the speech made at the beginning about the courage of the developers and the their desire to continually get involved. How to define two differentlycomponents like Tactical Defense and the Impact Engine? The first succeeds in the arduous task of adding thickness and bite precisely to the defensive phase, traditionally characterized by suffocating ~choral markings~ which invariably translated into the conquest of the ball for a quick restart. It is still possible to order our companions to tail an opponent by pressing the right back button of the Xbox 360 controller (a questionable choice in terms of comfort, actually), but this maneuver leads to different results compared to past editions of FIFA. The one-on-one confrontation then takes place according to almost completely new dynamics: by pressing the left trigger of the pad we can ~hook~ the ball carrier, but at that point stopping his advance with a tackle becomes a matter of observation and timing , given that in practice there is only one useful opportunity to stretch out the foot (by pressing button A) and take possession of the ball. If the action fails, our player is in fact unbalanced or out of position, and the opponent can take advantage of this to fly to the net or make a winning assist. However, it is the rendering of these dynamics on the screen that leaves us amazed: the footballer who goes empty does not ~stuck~ in an unnatural way, in fact, and his debacle produces the effects that we would expect from a similar action during a match true, that is, it is simply a matter of moments and centimeters to determine the effectiveness of the defensive maneuver. Then when anxiety and imprecision take over, and the lunge is carried out with decision, the effects of the Impact Engine are revealed, capable of reproducing reactions as realistic as possible based on the direction and extent of the impact. Matter of feeling And speaking of impact, it is appropriate to open a parenthesis regarding the physical rendering of the ball during shots and passes, a factor of enormous importance in terms of user ~satisfaction~ and which over the last few years has allowed Pro Evolution Soccer to hold its own against FIFA despite the aforementioned immobility of the Konami franchise. Well, the ~weight~ of the ball in FIFA 12 is still not fully convincing, the player who takes advantage of a rebound in the area to kick first does not produce the ~hit~ we would expect and even the strongest shots are spoiled by an annoying sensation of ~slowness~. This sensation, moreover, exacerbates any shortcomings of the goalkeepers: a double stop of the ball with the fists at short distance does not appear as spectacular as it should, and at the same time watching the goalkeeper who gives up chasing the ball as it slowly rolls into the net, behind him, he inevitably drops his arms. Things work differently for passes, much more influenced by the ~loading~ that allows you to choose the recipient of our throw, while the importance of the through balls seems to have been definitively scuttled by an AI that systematically intercepts them, depriving us of strategies which until a couple of years ago were the most popular in football simulations. In any case, the degree of customization of the gameplay appears so vast and widespread that it is in fact possible to ~correct~ these problems and design the experience according to one's needs and tastes. It is therefore possible to adjust the sprint speed of your own players and those controlled by the CPU, increase the power of the shots to obtain results closer to reality, determine the frequency of passes and crosses and so on. In the face of so much freedom, perhaps one remains a little stunned and the feeling that prevails is that we should be the ones to adapt to the vision of the developers and not the other way around. But in the end this too is a bit of a revolution, isn't it? Let's spend the last words for the technical sector, which is also in line with the offer of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but enriched by the possibility of using higher resolutions than the classic 1280 x 720. The graphics engine remains light as usual and there it allowed us to play on the test configuration at 1600 x 900, with all effects maxed out and v-sync engaged (without it tearing is sadly noticeable), with a generally constant 40fps frame rate. The most evident improvement in visual terms concerns the animations of the players, also due to the implementation of the Impact Engine, while the similarity with the real counterparts still leaves much to be desired when going from superstars to less famous athletes: in this respect PES remains ahead and the boys of EA Sports must certainly try harder. The sound appears decidedly more ~full~ compared to the 2011 edition, with more evident audience participationand realistic, while the commentary by the Caressa / Bergomi duo now feels the weight of the years and a few new sentences are not enough to change the cards on the table: it should be completely re-recorded.", "date": "2011-10-03", "grade": "9.5"}
