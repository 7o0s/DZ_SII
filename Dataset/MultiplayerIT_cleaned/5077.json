In reality, there is something to dig well, but the genres with which the Games Workshop universe has been most exploited are action and derivatives. Evidently many people like the scenario more than the game itself. The developer Straylight Entertainment thought of filling the gap, who with Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach wanted to create a pure turn-based strategy game, with very simple rules, but with different layers of complexity given by the characteristics of the battlefields and units. The game stages the eternal conflict between orks and space marines, in this case the Space Wolves legion, which this time takes place in the Sanctus Reach system. The Orks, led by Grukk Face-Rippa, attacked the Sanctus Reach and took control of all the planets that compose it, except one: Alaric Prime. Losing the last bastion of the human race would mean definitively losing the entire system, for this reason it must not be allowed. In game terms, this translates into two large campaigns for solitary players, consisting of twenty missions the first and twenty-five the second, in which various objectives must be achieved, indicated from time to time in the initial briefing phase. In reality there would be three campaigns, since there is also the tutorial one, but the latter is really short and only serves to learn the basic rules of the game. However, the single player content does not end here, because if you want it is possible to take part in skirmishes on procedurally generated maps, of which many parameters can be defined such as the size, the size of the armies in the field, the limit of turns and so on; or you can use the included editor to create your own campaigns. Finally there is the multiplayer mode, which allows you to take part in skirmishes against human opponents, played asynchronously. We reviewed Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach, an excellent turn-based strategy game for PC The basic rules Starting to play Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach is really very simple: each unit, made up of one or more soldiers, has a certain amount of action points that it can spend to move, attack or guard. The maps, completely three-dimensional, are divided into square boxes, with the various objects of the scenario acting as obstacles and covers. The typical turn sees the expenditure of a certain amount of action points for the positioning of the units, therefore, based on the equipment, it is possible to choose how and who to attack. For example, whoever has melee weapons must get close to an enemy unit to use them, while, to make another case, whoever carries grenades must be careful not to involve in the explosion, which spreads over several boxes, even the friends. In case you have no enemy units in sight, or if you implement a more wait-and-see strategy, you can warn the units, making them shoot if an enemy enters their range. Does it seem too simple to you? Don't be fooled, because it's not like that. Indeed, Sanctus Reach is a very difficult title, with missions that take a long time to complete. As we mentioned, the level of complexity of the game increases exponentially when advanced units take the field. Each of the armies has a large number of troops, often very different from each other, which must be purchased at the beginning of most missions with the points accumulated in previous ones. Obviously the best units are those that cost the most, so you are always torn between quantity and quality, i.e. between creating a large army made up of weaker units, or a drier one made up of more resistant troops. In any case, experience must also be considered, because with the level growth the units unlock skills that can come in handy, regardless of the initial values. In short, there are many factors to take into consideration and the planning phase, although not very long, is crucial. Space marines and orks have a total of thirty unit types each, including Dreadnoughts, Rhinos, and Gorkonaut. The leaders, i.e. the commanding units of the army, all equipped with special abilities, make their own story. Among those of the space wolves, Krom Dragongaze, Ragnar Blackmane and Jarl Logan Grimnar stand out, while the orks can count on the aforementioned Grukk FaceRippa and Mogrok from Mangla. goof off Three factors make Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach an excellent turn-based strategy: the aforementioned variety of units; the agile and well-studied interface, which allows you to perform every action with a few clicks (at the beginning it can get a little confusing with deselectingand units, but you get used to it in a few minutes of playing); and artificial intelligence, which in some circumstances really gives a hard time. Of course, playing against a human is another thing, but the CPU also knows how to exploit the weaknesses of those in front of it with a certain acumen... even if it must be said that it often plays in clear numerical superiority and that in some situations it gets stuck in a sensational way, especially in front of the checkpoints. We'll talk again. That said Sanctus Reach also has several problems. The most obvious is the detachment of campaign missions. Not that we expected cutscenes or other narrative decorations in a similar production, but here we exaggerated a bit: there is an almost complete lack of a plot that links the different missions, with the latter being for the most part procedurally generated skirmishes. Very nice situations come out and the variety is excellent, but more than a real campaign it feels like playing a series of missions stuck together as best as possible. We know we have to defend the planet and that's about it. Another problem of the game, which largely derives from the one just described, is the lack of variety of objectives to pursue. In particular, it annoys the massive use of control points to be captured and maintained for several rounds, which return in many maps, moreover creating imbalances in artificial intelligence. What rebates? Well, sometimes he'd rather direct units to capture one, even if he's running out of time to win, instead of destroying our already weakened troops. It doesn't always happen, but you notice it, especially when you manage to win without deserving it. From a technical point of view Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach betrays its production level with bare scenarios devoid of details. You can see that the bulk of resources have been spent on unit models, which look nice when zoomed in, but that's all. In short, from a technical / stylistic point of view, don't expect anything exceptional.", "date": "2017-01-25", "grade": "8.0"}
