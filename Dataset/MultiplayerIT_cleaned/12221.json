{"name": "Robo 2 Saving Eny", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robo-2-saving-eny.html", "text": "Oh yes, Robo's adventures continue; after avoiding all the pitfalls and dangers of the military base, our robotic hero discovers that his beauty, Battery Eny, has disappeared. This is the simple plot of Robo 2 Saving Eny, yet another game made in Herocraft to reach our mobile phones. The title of Russian birth is a strategic puzzle game developed in a completely two-dimensional environment and which will see us face the traps of each setting with the strength of our cunning. We will move the little robot up to the arrival ~den~ which is defended from natural obstacles such as boulders, and artificial ones such as lasers. We will be able to modify the beam and the direction of the lasers by moving the mirrors that we will meet on our path. Similarly, we will be able to move the boulders or place bombs to modify the trajectories of the deadly rays or to stop them completely. The laser cannons are able to kill Robo effortlessly, but our hero will be able to use them to destroy the other defenses of the lair and to detonate the bombs we will encounter. As anticipated, the mirrors reflect the laser beams by 90 degrees, by being clever we will be able to use them in the best way. It will always be a question of choosing the ideal moves to make with Robo and often there will be no turning back. The 30 settings constitute a good dose of challenge even in the most savvy player, certainly often frustration will get the better of it since we will have to start over. An element that didn't particularly convince us is the lack of variety from one level to another, the action is a bit too similar throughout. The pleasant novelty is characterized by the possibility of building one's own personal internships on the Herocraft website, which can also be shared with friends. It will also be possible to download more than 100 levels via the web from the manufacturer's website, making Robo's adventure almost endless. From a graphic point of view, the engine of Robo 2 Saving Eny is quite successful, colorful sprites and nice animations of the character make it pleasant without however making one cry for a miracle. A praise must be made to the complete localization of the title in Italian, both during the game and in the in-depth guide present in the initial menu, all the dialogues have been adapted and translated into Dante's language.
