Texas-style poker has recently been enjoying a newfound popularity, thanks to the numerous television broadcasts on national networks and the great media coverage that perhaps this ~sport~ has never had in our nation. The Texan variant, one of the most popular and played in the world, has already been dealt with on Xbox 360 and always through the Live Arcade digital delivery service, but never with the tone and light-heartedness of this brand new Full House Poker. This new title makes simplicity, speed and frivolity its strengths and differentiation from the classic Poker made by long faces and slow and cumbersome hands. No more long waits, sad faces and seriousness, in Full House Poker our Xbox 360 Avatars are used directly, who sit at the game table just like animated digital alter egos and able to gesticulate, make decisive or timid movements, trying to wrong-foot your opponents with basic psychological and gestural assumptions. Simplicity and speed It is basically a poker game dedicated to everyone, ironically intended for young and old. The generous tutorial and explanatory in-game interludes introduce us to the (few but strict) rules of the Texan game, after which we are directly projected into a virtual environment that reproduces a gaming room, complete with an American bar, aquarium and Avatars who chat and laugh in company, reproducing a relaxing mini-habitat that truly inspires to sit back and enjoy the cards. Full House Poker is the cheerful and colorful version of Texan Poker, a sort of variant of the variant in short. The use of the Xbox 360 Avatar allows the game to be able to exploit a minimum gestures and animations of the character for gameplay purposes: in fact, we can slam the chips on the table with conviction and presumption or with shyness, attitudes that we can associate with a relative objective situation or a bluff. By selecting a rival in front of us on the table with the right analog, we can observe him in detail to try to catch suspicious movements or particular gestures. These are a few animations that can be activated simply by holding down the right or left trigger when confirming the bet, it is simply a hinted game element that will perhaps be little used in the long term, but at least Full House Poker is one of the few (if not the only one, by heart) that allows a certain gesture at the table. The fact that this title is intended for a wider range of audiences means that the material remuneration of the winnings is mainly made up of rewards unrelated to money: new liveries for the gaming tables, clothes for the avatars, decks of cards and so on . In any case, the game score essentially remains our ~bankroll~, i.e. the account from which we draw to enter the game. It is possible to observe the table from various angles and views that can be modified in real time with the left analog, even if all slightly distant: a closer shot, almost subjective, would certainly have been appreciated as observing the opponents is part of the intrinsic gameplay of Full House Poker. The single player mode is supported by many options and possibilities to customize the gameplay that help to give this title a lifeblood above the norm; but it is in the multiplayer, of course, that it finds its strong point. Xbox 360 goals Like any digital delivery game downloaded from Xbox Live Arcade, Full House Poker also puts the canonical 200 points ~on the table~, to be unlocked through 20 objectives (and another 50 points via DLC in the future). All objectives are obtained by sweating a lot on the table because they are linked to the achievement of particular levels or online victories. Fortunately, there are no objectives linked to certain rare combinations of cards, a factor which therefore links the points to be obtained to personal skill rather than luck. Table of ten Multiplayer obviously consists of offline and online game sessions via Xbox Live, organizing tables with a minimum of two participants up to ten. During the game, some simplified icons show the action of the opponents and make us understand immediately if they are raising, calling or closing the hand, and we have the possibility to preset the action before our turn arrives in order to save time and make the smoothest and fastest ride. The tendency of CPU-controlled opponents is always to be very cautious and it will be very difficult to bluff and try to bring big money to the table. Artificial intelligence, in fact, often tends to do ~fold~ to our minimum raise and really risking the minimum necessary, so much so that in tables of ten players, making a small raise on the first hand most opponents fold immediately leaving us with one or at most two contenders. Fortunately, it is obviously possible to challenge human opponents, much more fun and unpredictable, through ranked or player-customized matches. There is also the possibility to play 1 vs 1 with ~big champions~ preset by the CPU, or to play freely without the stress of always having to look at your ~bankroll~. In short, Full House Poker is not only a sweetened version of the famous card game, but it is also a title full of options and methods, very accurate and polished in every component that aims to capture the attention of players for a long, long time.", "date": "2011-03-21", "grade": "8.0"}
