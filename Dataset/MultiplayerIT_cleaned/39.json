And here we are at the most controversial part of Race: the graphics. The title collides with its older brother GTR 2, offering us an unclean graphic framework. In practice, even setting it to resolutions such as 1280x1024 with antialiasing, you notice a general ~dirt~, especially in terms of texture. At certain moments it almost seems like seeing a game from a few years ago on which the programmers have only made an effort to reproduce the machines in the best possible way. These are generally well modeled and communicate a certain solidity, but still appear devoid of reflections (in real time) of the environment that surrounds them. Even the visual model of the damage should be forgotten: crashing into a wall at 200 km/h is already a lot to lose the bumper. Agreed that the damages are not the strong point of the Simbins, but something more had to be done, especially considering that GTR 2 is already superior. A note of merit instead for the internal cockpits of the cars, as always very detailed and faithful to the real counterparts. The rain was also good, of a superior quality than the previous title; this together with the powder is very well made, producing credible reflections on the asphalt. The circuits, on the other hand, enjoy a fluctuating realization: in addition to the aforementioned lack of graphic cleanliness, we find textures of a certain level that clash with other rather bad ones. An example of this is the Macau circuit, which at times recalls titles from the past due to its rough design. At the expense of the graphics, the fluidity gains, given that the game is less demanding in terms of hardware requests. Conclusions Race: The WTCC Game comes from those Simbins creators of the GTR series and GT Legends, who seem to be slightly understated here (is it due to the fact that the game was developed at the same time as GTR 2?). The lack of graphic cleanliness and the deficient damage model partially undermine the general picture, but the latter still enjoys the wealth of options and parameters that only the Simbin productions are able to offer. It is interesting to be able to buy it on Steam at a reasonable price, let's say from a semi-budget. The difficulty factor has been scaled down slightly, and the available aids allow even casual gamers to hit the track without too much frustration. Those who have played GTR 2 will notice an uneven comparison, but after all, the two titles want to be distinguished from each other. For simulation enthusiasts it is an enjoyable game, which we can consider as a complement to the GTR series. Pros New FIA-WTCC license Some completely new circuits Great variety of simulation options Cons Subpar graphics compared to GTR 2 Lack of damage model Little used official license Attention Steam! Attention! The game can also be purchased via Steam, the digital delivery platform created by Valve for Half-Life 2 and activation of the product via the internet is required in any case which, if not performed, does not allow you to play. WTC extension Thanks to the Simbins comes a refreshing license to the world of driving games: that of the World Touring Car Championship. Although it is not among the most popular competitions, it offers some interesting variants in terms of challenge, with often extreme maneuvers between the pilots and races characterized by a short duration, but no less exciting for this. Racing enthusiasts will find around ten circuits in which the fact that some are completely new to this type of game stands out. An abundant thirty cars present which, as per the championship, offer ~normal~ cars modified for racing. So no exaggerated cars, but sedans tuned for the occasion. They range from the Alfa 156 to the BMW 320, passing through the one-make championship of the Mini Coopers. In addition, it is possible to compete in the '87 league, with a couple of historic cars (who said Alfa 75?); this last part is certainly the least well-finished: no informative data, only two cars and circuits unchanged compared to those of the present. no exaggerated cars therefore, but sedans tuned for the occasion Simulation with reservations We could define Race as the little ~style fall~ of the Simbins: the game seems to have been packaged in a hurry, showing some not just limitations. First of all the graphics, in some ways inferior to the first GTR of the same authors. The use of this new championship-licence seems to be exploited to a minimum, offering us nothing more than a certain number of cars and tracks to race with. No cutscenes (apart from the opening one), no introductory notes on the WTCC. Seen in this way, the title could seem like an expansion pack for GTR 2. Of course, all the simulation features to which the programmers have accustomed us are always present, but everything is offered on a slightly meager plate, especially considering that recentlythe sequel to GTR has been released, much more complete. The driving model is satisfactory and diversified from its older brother, with maneuvers and physics faithful to the reality of the championship. There is no shortage of tests, qualifications and above all telemetry, with which hardcore players will get married! To top it all off, the game supports Logitech racing wheels like the G25 for complete immersion. Noteworthy as always the excellent AI, which is more daring than usual here: the WTCC is in fact famous for its last gasp manoeuvres, with overtaking and not very clean chases, something the CPU doesn't spare itself on! It will not be uncommon to see some drivers overtaking in a corner while you are slowing down, or to witness crashes of opposing cars after daredevil maneuvers. The sound sector is average with good environmental effects. The engines of the cars are a little subdued (some quite similar). For the rest we find the various comments of the judges and our team. As always, the music accompanying the menus is exceptional. [C] In the WTCC it happens often The rain is insidious...

It is possible to compete with 26 opponents at the same time, but very fast connections are obviously required. At the moment the game suffers from frequent lag, especially in games on foreign servers. We hope for a patch soon. As always, the level of challenge is very high, and the satisfaction of competing with so many ~real~ drivers is priceless! Too bad for the usual malpractices who think they're going to pay the bills, but these are a common evil in the Great Web. By creating a server we find a myriad of options available to configure the races in the best possible way, including the possibility of inserting bots controlled by the CPU. One cannot fail to be satisfied by the completeness of the multiplayer section.", "date": "2007-03-12", "grade": null}
