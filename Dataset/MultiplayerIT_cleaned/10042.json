Inevitably it suggests images of massive multiplayer, with 3D graphics, in which it is possible to carry out quests, chat with other people while their respective avatars walk around the screen and perhaps interact with emotes. Make groups or ~party~ of friends or random players with whom to go to face instances and dungeons with maps, monsters, loot and final bosses. Growing characters by collecting XP, improving equipment, stats, skills. All this (and much more) is now also possible on Apple devices thanks to Pocket Legends, which manages to perform the miracle and bring the gaming experience of its traditionally older brothers to our small screens, albeit with some limitations. played on PC. Destined to be legend Spacetime Studios had already announced its ambitious project some time ago, but no one had given it too much credit considering the general skepticism about the possibility of offering a real MMO on a mobile platform like that of the iPhone and iPod Touch. Upon its release, however, most of the denigrators were forced to change their minds when they found this Pocket Legends in their pocket which, albeit with some need for tweaking, really manages to surprise. From the very first moment the taste of a ~massive~ title is clear, right from when one is asked to create an account and a verification email is sent for its activation. Once the easy procedure has been carried out, you are connected to a patch server which checks the version of the installed client and eventually updates it. The next screen allows us to access one of its available game servers and create one or more characters (for a maximum of two) with three classes of our choice between wizard, archer and warrior. You immediately notice the lack of character customization options and the cartoonish graphics that make the game less serious. Choosing first of all to visit the ~Towne~, that is the meeting point of all the players, the graphic impact is immediately excellent, completely in 3D, with more than discreet textures and polygonal backdrops. Everything flows smoothly and smoothly even with a ping of the high server, which is close to 280ms. For less performing devices it is however possible to deactivate the high quality of the textures and the anti-aliasing. The interface is quite clear and usable: directional as usual in the lower left, potions in the lower right and in the corner the basic attack icon that you can choose whether to activate in a single shot or in auto-attack. Above it, on the right side of the screen, you will enter the skills that will be earned by advancing in level. At the top left there is the character's status bar below which those of any other party members will be displayed. Finally, the balloon icon appears next to the main status bar which allows you to send predefined messages or write customized ones. The character screen, reachable by tapping the name of your avatar, allows you to access six different tabs through which you can add points to the stats earned by leveling up, manage the inventory, assign points to the various skills earned and equip them, access the store in-game, manage a friends list and finally access the main menu of the game. To avoid being forced to travel which could have been tedious on Apple platforms, it was decided to allow access to the heart of the game, i.e. the missions to be carried out in schemes instantiated in parties, through a menu from which it is possible to choose whether to create a game , join an already created one or even host ~closed~ ones, accessible only to friends invited by us. The missions involve the cleaning of a series of areas in open spaces or hack & slash-style dungeons with the relative drop of objects to upgrade the characters' weapons and armor as well as the collection of experience points necessary to advance in level. And here we come to the only really sore point of the application, which is free but allows you to continue only until you reach level 12. In order to proceed further, you need to purchase other missions in the in-app store, at the price of 1.59 Euros each, which are the only way to be able to advance in the game. Four additional campaigns are currently available, for a total of 6.36 euros spent which in any case is a good price for a product in this range. However, we would have preferred that it was advertised upon purchase rather than discovering it after playing a certain number of hours. A number of non-mandatory power-ups can also be purchased in the in-app store. The game, in shortesi, offers rather long-lasting entertainment with truly varied and profound contents and above all it appears technically very well done in all its aspects. If you are willing to spend just over six euros to have a real MMO on your devices you will have several hours of guaranteed gameplay, certainly made more enjoyable in the event that you have friends to play with. Otherwise it is always possible to test the game extensively to see if it suits your taste, at least up to level 13. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-04-28", "grade": "8.5"}
