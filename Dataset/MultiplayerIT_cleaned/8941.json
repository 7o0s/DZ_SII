It was therefore foreseeable that, with such a level of expectation, being able to meet the expectations of the fans would not have been an easy undertaking for Capcom, considering among other things the amount of content and the quality of the gameplay of the second chapter. And indeed, if anyone objected to the launch of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was precisely the audience of aficionados, who on the forums and social networks spared no more or less harsh criticism of the poverty of irons in the fire, pointing the finger above all towards a roster of fighters almost halved and a mode very poor solo. A handful of months after the launch, the Japanese developer thus launched an Ultimate version on the shelves which, at least on paper, aimed to correct the main defects of the game and to introduce completely new fighters. Referring to the review of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for a more general opinion of the game, let's see here if the novelties of Ultimate are sufficient to justify the distribution of a completely new game instead of a more comfortable (and less expensive) DLC. We are a very strong team Just insert the disc into the console and start the game to immediately find yourself in front of the first superficial changes introduced by the developers: Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom welcomes the player with a totally new start screen, designed to give the feeling of browsing a superhero comic rather than navigating through a simple menu. Clearly this is only an aesthetic tinsel, and it is only by accessing the new roster of fighters that the most important novelty of the game can be appreciated. To the thirty-six fighters from the original Marvel vs. In fact, Capcom 3 adds another twelve, six for each of the two factions, a figure that still does not equal that of the second episode but which at least is able to satisfy the fans, among other things giving space to unlikely or extremely fanservice heroes. In particular, the Marvel team seemed to us to be the one that received the greatest boost: Hawkeye and Ghost Rider are lacking in melee combat but are particularly annoying from a distance thanks to a whole series of attacks with bow and whip respectively. Dr.Strange, on the other hand, is a very powerful character both in combat and as support, but our favorite is probably the little Rocket Raccoon, difficult to hit and as dangerous as it is fun to use, with all his arsenal of traps and explosive weapons. Interesting new entries also from the side of Capcom fighters, with a Frank West that is not very easy to use but decidedly competitive. More accessible to the less shrewd player is the massive Nemesis, a behemoth that compensates for its slow pace with a series of devastating attacks, including a powerful bazooka blast from range. On the other hand, Phoenix Wright seemed less successful and effective, an extremely funny and likeable character, but whose continuous tumbles and poor indirect attacks give the impression that his purpose is only to please the fans and not to be competitive in combat . Excluding Strider Hiryu, all the other characters introduced in the roster are making their debut in the series, while the new graphic division in the selection of characters is to be commended, more orderly and which clearly separates the Marvel heroes from the Capcom ones. Playstation 3 trophies Given the lack of additional modes beyond the classic Arcade and online challenges, the developers have tried to arrange to offer quite varied trophies. The vast majority of challenges therefore consist of performing a certain number of times a certain combo, playing a certain number of online games, finishing the arcade with all the characters or neutralizing a given number of assists. ...and the substance? One of the critical points of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was undoubtedly the bad balance of several characters, an aspect that in a heavily fanservice fighting game, in which a fighter's skills are primarily linked to his background, is very difficult to avoid. This Ultimate version was an excellent opportunity for Capcom to fix some particularly unbalanced heroes, although many of these have remained almost unchanged: several characters belonging to lower tiers are still extremely weak, but at least we have noticed that some among the most powerful, such as Akuma or Magneto, have been rebalanced and rand in some cases slower or able to cause less damage. The same work was obviously also done with assists, although in some cases we have noticed some easier to neutralize than others. As mentioned, there are exceptions, and Phoenix is still able to eliminate an entire team of enemies without problems, while new combos and special techniques have made characters like Ryu and Doom even more competitive. Even the controversial X-Factor, a technique that allowed you to enter a sort of berserk mode, quickly regenerate and amplify your damage, has obviously been weakened, although it is still able to overturn the outcome of a match in just a few seconds. The rest of the news, at least the most evident ones, concern the online multiplayer component: the impossibility of actually entering a match did not allow us to verify any improvements in terms of netcode, but in addition to having improved the interface and made it more intuitive the creation of challenges, the developers have finally implemented the Spectator mode, thanks to which to assist the online fights of other players. No trace however regarding the Heroes and Heralds social option, much advertised by Capcom but which presumably will be distributed with a subsequent DLC of the game, leaving at the moment with a lot of disappointment, considering above all that it would have been the only additional mode introduced by Ultimate marvel vs. capcom 3.", "date": "2011-11-15", "grade": "8.0"}
