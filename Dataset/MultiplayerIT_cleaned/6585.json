With the release of Shadowmatic on the App Store, Triada Studio has finally realized a project that had been in the pipeline for over a year: this is already a positive sign that suggests development times compatible with a quality level worthy of the name. The origin of the team behind him also contributes to increasing the curiosity towards Shadowmatic: it is in fact a company based in Armenia, founded in 1993 and specialized in production and post-production in 3D computer graphics, at its first release in the realm of video games in the strict sense. Is it therefore possible that such an atypical pedigree and such an exotic country of origin for the video game market give life to a product of excellent quality? Shadowmatic is a puzzle game with a zen flavor and excellent quality Relax Shadowmatic starts from a very simple, yet fascinating and in some ways ~magic~ premise: the projection of shadows. By placing a light source behind an abstract figure, this could in fact give life to the silhouette of a real object on the opposite wall... provided it is positioned correctly. This is essentially the very understandable concept behind the Triada Studio title, but it is obviously in its development that the game gains consistency and credibility. Each of the over 70 levels that make up Shadowmatic, in fact, offers the player one or more objects suspended in mid-air, to be manipulated by rotating and moving them within a pre-established area. These are bodies without any defined shape, which therefore do not offer any kind of clue in the three dimensions on the result of their correct projection: touching the screen with one or two fingers changes their positioning, thus trying to find the exact combination such to determine the appearance of a concrete form: a dog, an hourglass, a wrench, a pram, an anchor, a sparrow, a rudder and so on. If levels with a single object to manipulate can be considered simple after all, things change when you find yourself faced with 2 or even 3 forms to manage: in that case, in fact, each ~piece~ is destined to compose a part of the result final, so it is necessary not only to find the exact location of the singles, but also their alignment and correct positioning with the others. To switch from one to another, simply touch a virtual button at the bottom of the screen, which then allows you to move all the objects together if held down. A hint system was then integrated into the game, which is based on points that are earned by completing levels and which can then be spent precisely to obtain clues in case you find yourself unable to solve a puzzle . It goes without saying that using this type of shortcut takes away much of the pleasure, and our suggestion is therefore definitely to avoid using it. For the more desperate, however, the points can also be purchased via the in-app, but this is a really unnecessary eventuality and that in no way affects the quality of the product. Shadowmatic is therefore configured as a relaxing and at the same time stimulating experience, with slow and reflective game rhythms: while being able to distinctly perceive the inspiration from titles such as Zen Bound and Blueprint 3D, the final result is in any case unique and peculiar. The technical component undoubtedly contributes to supporting such a pleasant mechanic: the graphics, created on the basis of a proprietary engine, offer an excellent overall performance, with a realistic style supported by high-level textures and an excellent lighting system. The presence of 9 different settings, which divide the objects represented thematically, contributes to guaranteeing a certain aesthetic variety. Even the ambient soundtrack is worthy of attention, and Triada Studio wanted to give it the right weight within the economy of the gameplay: the 11 songs that compose it, also available in an album that can be purchased on iTunes, are in fact perfectly appropriate and accompany the development of the levels in a precious way.", "date": "2015-02-06", "grade": "8.5"}
