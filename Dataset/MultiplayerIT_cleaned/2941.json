{"name": "No Straight Roads", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-straight-roads-recensione.html", "text": "The review of No Straight Roads puts us in front of the debut title of the development team founded by Wan Hazmer and Daim Dziauddin, respectively lead game designer of Final Fantasy XV and concept artist of Street Fighter V. Both with an immense passion for music, they wanted to build a game around it that now finally makes its debut on PC and console. The result is an experience full of absolutely successful and exciting ideas, characterized by an artistic direction worthy of a great triple A production, from a absolutely amazing soundtrack and a narrative that captivates right from the start, catapulting us into the streets of Vinyl City in less than no time, a metropolis controlled by an unscrupulous record major. History In the world of No Straight Roads, sound is power, and NSR artists exercise it in an unscrupulous way, strengthened by the solidity of an empire built on the most commercial musical projects imaginable (from DJs to virtual idols, from boy bands to children prodigy). However, a duo of rockers, Mayday and Zuke, decide to challenge the system and make the voice of their instruments heard, a guitar and a pair of air drumsticks. At the command of the two components of Bunk Bed Junction, with the possibility of passing from one to the other at any time or to face the missions in local cooperative together with a friend, our goal will therefore be to dismantle the castle built by the evil Tatiana one piece at a time, challenging its top artists to a duel, liberating the neighborhoods they control and trying to return power to the people. Unfortunately, Mayday and Zuke's attempt to win on a regular basis, participating in the talent show organized by NSR, fails: the judges say no to the band despite the enthusiasm of the public, banishing them from the city and barring the doors to success. Hazmer and Dziauddin's criticism is very clear and even ferocious towards the current international music scene, which rewards a specific genre of electronic productions and leaves little room for everything else. In any case, the two protagonists do not give up: after having reached the margins of Vinyl City, they promise to change things with the strength of their talent and we are there to bear witness to their commitment, already at this point aware of having to deal with a game that is very different from the usual, narrated like a cartoon of the good ones. Too bad for the lack of dubbing in Italian in addition to those in English, Spanish and French: it would have been the icing on the cake for a project that makes storytelling its favorite tool. Structure The No Straight Roads campaign is organized in two distinct phases. On the one hand we have an exploratory component focused on collecting objects and discovering secrets, which remain unsolved even after completing all the missions and therefore require our return and the unlocking of new skills in order to access everything they have to give us , while at the same time extra modes and higher challenge levels become available. On the other hand there is the actual action, represented in practice by a sequence of increasingly more complex boss fights, which progressively introduce distinct sections in which one must pay attention to low-level enemies before confronting the artists of the NSR: there are six of them in all, and each one gives life to a different clash in terms of rules, mechanics and prerogatives. You can overcome them by continuing after any defeat but thus accepting the assignment of a low score, or memorize their patterns and be able to beat them by ringing combos and maneuvers of great impact, so as to gain a greater number of fans. More than money, in fact, it is glory that counts in the world of No Straight Roads: once the Bunk Bed Junction headquarters is unlocked, in the city's sewers, we will be able to use the objects collected and the fame obtained up to that moment to unlock new skills, assign stickers with specific perks to the two characters, furnish the base with the trophies collected around, modify the set of special moves available to the band and finally take stock with our strategist to activate the next objective. Completed the setup, we will be able to return to the surface and enjoy a splendid walk through the districts of Vinyl City that we have freed from the influence of the NSR, use the double jump and the aerial dash to find hidden clearings and balconies to climb on, areas to be accessed only after boosting our ability to transform objects and extra boss fights like the challenging but exciting one with rapper DK West. Gameplay How exactly is the gamNo Straight Roads eplays? It is basically a mix between a traditional action and a rhythm game, although the latter element is actually optional: some mechanics are based on rhythm and we can make the most of them using the right timing, but if you want you can proceed even without this kind of pressure and still get to the end of the story after about six hours. Playing alone, you can freely switch between control of Mayday and Zuke, exploring the city as already mentioned and collecting energy, items and collectibles until you reach the boss next fight. At that point you enter a sort of arena and it is finally possible to also resort to the attacks of the two protagonists, with an upgradeable combo that is performed with the Square key, the possibility of firing homing projectiles at flying targets by acting on the R1 backbone (but only after collecting some ammunition) and to perform the special moves assigned to the triggers, some of which also allow you to recover some life energy. We mentioned that each boss fight has different rules and situations. At this juncture we will get to know several basic enemies, mainly robots that hit the ground to the rhythm of music, generate annoying shock waves, but also turrets that target us from a distance and various traps scattered along the way. The yield of impacts could be improved, there is a bit of slipperiness and collisions are not always perceived correctly, but the system works and can count on a fair variety. The problem, more than anything else, is represented by some errors largely avoidable: beyond the management of the cooperative, to which we have dedicated a special box, there are moments in which our characters have to go back without being able to look where they are going because the view at that moment is blocked. Furthermore, the rhythm element seems to be implemented in an unconvinced way, in some situations imprecise: these are aspects which, together with a price that is perhaps a little too high, prevent No Straight Roads from earning an even better evaluation. The cooperative mode No Straight Roads can be played solo or in local cooperative for two players, but the system introduced for the occasion is not of the drop-in / drop-out type: you have to choose from the starting screen if you want to proceed with the co -op and choose one of the two characters. Once in the game, however, the problems begin: the camera only follows player one, it does not expand or divide and it therefore happens that the second player gets lost, giving life to quite annoying and cumbersome episodes. The same happens in the middle of boss fights, although the more collected context helps a little. It feels like co-op was added to avoid controversy over its absence in a game where there are always two characters on screen, but it needs some work to fix - as it stands it's immature to say the least. Playstation 4 trophies No Straight Roads Trophies are mostly obtained simply by progressing through the campaign and defeating all the bosses, but several achievements are related to performance and can be unlocked, for example, by finishing a fight without being knocked down, or as part of a special mode . There is also a focus on collectibles, of which the scenarios are full, and on recruiting new allies. Technical realization We have already mentioned the excellent artistic direction of No Straight Roads, and this aspect of the production obviously intertwines with the technical realization of the game, in many ways impeccable. There really are moments during the campaign where it feels like we're dealing with a big-budget project with lots and lots of talent behind the scenes: this last thing is certainly true, while we have doubts about the actual resources at hand. disposition of the team. However, a brilliant job has been done and Daim Dziauddin can take much of the credit, as he has designed some amazing characters. We didn't really like the solution adopted to make them ~talk~ during the static cutscenes, we would have preferred completely still images at that point, but there is very little to complain about in front of the world that the Metronomik guys were able to create. And the scenarios? Although they are basically backgrounds without interactive elements and with a great abundance of invisible walls, the neighborhoods of Vinyl City are absolutely splendid and invite you to explore them even for the simple pleasure of strolling through those streets, which refer very clearly to some areas of Tokyo. The presence of some pop-up effects and some incluckily the stability of the frame rate does not affect the beauty of the settings. Naturally the soundtrack deserves a separate discussion, given that together with the narration it is the main protagonist of No Straight Roads. It's truly extraordinary, composed of songs that immediately remain in your head, with an exceptional quality: listen to it using a good pair of headphones or an adequate system, because it really deserves. Equally valid is the dubbing in English, subtitled in Italian: the cast chosen for the occasion has been able to give the various characters a surprising depth, and that is no small thing.", "date": "2020-08-25", "grade": "8.0"}
