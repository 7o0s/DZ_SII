Unfortunately, in the adaptation phase, substantial improvements were certainly not made to the major flaw of Final Fantasy V which, incredible to say, is precisely the plot: in fact, the plot sees a heterogeneous group of heroes (which includes a princess, a young adventurer, a pirate and a forgetful old man) come together almost by chance to face a dark entity that threatens the Crystals of power that give life to everything. The link between the four protagonists is not immediately clear but it is revealed in the twenty hours of duration of the main-quest in a series of decidedly predictable twists and turns. The new adaptation makes some dialogues much more convincing, especially those in which characters like Faris or Galuf are involved, and the plot is clearer, despite the linearity of the adventure and the lack of all those psychological and narrative implications that made the subsequent chapters undermine the general interest aroused in the player, involved mostly by the remarkable characterization of the four heroes. However, it is not the plot that keeps the players glued, but the actual game mechanics, simple but at the same time decidedly profound: the Job System present in Final Fantasy V is still today considered by many to be the best made of all Final Fantasy who use it. We agree: as the adventure progresses, more and more Jobs are obtained that party members can undertake, ranging from the classic Black Mage to the more sophisticated Ninja, passing through the four new Jobs designed specifically for this edition (Necromancer, Gunner , Gladiator and Oracle, unlockable together with a new secret dungeon). The trump card of the mechanism consists in the possibility of combining the skills of two previously learned Jobs in a single class, called Freelancer: essentially, it was with Final Fantasy V that Square embarked on the path of ~level grinding~ (now a component of almost every new game with RPG elements), which in a sense forces players to develop as many combinations of levels, characters and Jobs as possible to create an ultimate custom class. The freedom granted by the system, which in any case encourages players to make the most useful combinations to overcome the frequent random fights, and the intrinsic longevity are a winning combination in a Final Fantasy that would slip away too quickly, even with its considerable quantity and variety of dungeons, monsters and bosses. Old style, almost modern Final Fantasy V is certainly not a title that shows the weight of the years: indeed, even today it is technically of a freshness that rivals much more recent titles for the latest Game Boy. The bright colors and the general visual sharpness are particularly convincing, which Square Enix has expertly reworked for this edition: the considerable size of the sprites in combat, of heroes and enemy creatures, and the simplicity of the various graphic effects linked to spells and special attacks silhouetted against colorful and detailed backgrounds. It's not the exceptional detail of Final Fantasy VI or Golden Sun, but Final Fantasy V holds up very well, except when exploring cities, dungeons and the outside world: the pixility of the mini-sprites and the simplicity of the design remind at that point that this game comes from the 16bit era, despite the various improvements of the case. In the transition from PlayStation One to Game Boy Advance, the sound quality of the various compositions also seems to have diminished, certainly due to the hardware itself: some pieces of music by master Nobuo Uematsu are thus less convincing despite their enormous melodic quality, the soundtrack it is in fact one of the most sought after in the series, and does not look bad in this porting anyway. From SNES to PSOne, finally here we are on Game Boy Advance to complete the historical hexalogy of the Square saga together with Final Fantasy VI: Final Fantasy V gets a well-deserved version that does justice to the quality of the title, decidedly excellent from a playful point of view. A little less technically: despite the performance on par with many other more modern titles of the genre, at least in battle, Final Fantasy V shows the weight of the years on various occasions, especially graphically, and they are certainly the excellent Job System and the various unpublished goodies to make the plot less insipid, decidedly more linear and obvious than the standards to which the Japanese softco has accustomed us. A recommended purchase, therefore, for RPG lovers, despite that retro flavor which, however, is part of its undoubted charm. Pros Excellent Job System Despite its age, it is an excellent alternative to more modern products Interesting unpublished features Cons Dull plot Technically a bit retro Final Fantasy V was there'last Final Fantasy not to be translated into Western language: clearly, everyone will remember the success of Final Fantasy VI and the previous episodes released in America with the title sometimes changed (for example, the same Final Fantasy VI for SNES became Final Fantasy in the West III). One might think that it was the poor quality of the fifth final fantasy that convinced Squaresoft to confine it to Japan, but in reality the game immediately enjoyed considerable success and is still considered, from a playful point of view, one of the best episodes of the series. In the West, however, Final Fantasy V arrived there, in the Final Fantasy Anthology proposed for PlayStation One, however penalized by a decidedly mediocre translation and adaptation work. This new Game Boy Advance port almost qualifies as a remake, with a series of technical and playful features that have significantly improved its overall quality: but after all these years, is the fifth Final Fantasy still competitive?", "date": "2007-05-23", "grade": null}
