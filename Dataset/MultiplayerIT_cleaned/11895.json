{"name": "rFactor - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rfactor-recensione.html", "text": "Customize, control, connect rFactor has been on the market for some time now, and has always been distributed via digital delivery. Then came Koch Media, who, realizing the potential of the title, decided to create a packaged version and sell it in stores, just like the direct competition (GTR, GT Legends, RACE 07 and so on). rFactor is specially designed to be able to reproduce any four-wheeled vehicle with a good degree of realism, whether it's a Formula 1, a rally Ford Focus, a Fiat Punto or a Bigfoot. As already mentioned, playing a simulation like rFactor undoubtedly requires a much higher average commitment than that required for other games. The level of attention, especially with certain categories of car, must always be very high, or there is the risk of never being able to finish a lap without having made an accident. It goes without saying that by activating the driving aids, the sense of having bought a simulation is completely lost and the game itself is distorted: for this reason, those who do not like such a demanding driving model should move towards less realistic titles. Customize, control, connect Similarly, a good steering wheel is essential (recommended Logitech DFP or, for the more wealthy, G25), because trying rFactor with a joypad or keyboard is truly unthinkable. From the point of view of pure simulation, rFactor can count on a tire simulation model that has very few rivals, and is certainly superior to the Pacejka, used in many other titles of the genre. While recalling the assumption according to which a real perfect simulation is still impossible to obtain, we can say that physics and aerodynamics in general are also complex and reproduced in a rather convincing way. In the single player mode you will be able to face races and championships for points, but during the apprenticeship period it is recommended to only use the ~time attack~ mode to practice the controls, become familiar with the vehicle and, absolutely essential, get to know the slopes. Multiplayer what a passion One of the strengths of rFactor is represented by an online multiplayer equipped with a very advanced netcode, which allows 30 players to compete simultaneously without particular latency problems. In addition to joining or creating a quick session, true rFactor enthusiasts continuously organize tournaments, leagues and various competitions, accessible through the various forums and amateur sites. By connecting it is impossible not to find dozens and dozens of servers that are always quite crowded. There are even virtual drivers who organize real driving courses for less experienced players, and the level of competition in online races can get very, very high. rFactor's multiplayer system includes an integrated friends list, management of favorite servers, a native voting and ban system as well as numerous security checks to prevent any improprieties. Among the online competitions we point out Formula Simracing. The most loved (and modified) The most surprising thing about rFactor is the community it has been able to create around itself: an undergrowth so vast that it cannot be compared to that of any other title of its kind. Homemade mods and add-ons, whether they're tracks, cars, skins, or full mods, pop up like mushrooms and are often of top-notch quality. The reference site for downloading new material (and possibly sending your own creations) is certainly rFactor Central, a real hotbed of content where you can also find the various software to make your changes. The following mods are particularly recommended: F1 1979 v2.0, Gallardo Challenge, Formula BMW, Megane Cup. Also unmissable tracks such as the old Estoril 88, Nurburgring, Mugello and Misano. In the following image you can see our personal modification to the livery of a Lamborghini Gallardo, dedicated to the TV series ~The Sopranos~. The livery was created with Photoshop and then imported to rFactor thanks to special software. Graphics and sound While failing to compete with certain titles recently seen on PC and consoles, one above all Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, rFactor can still boast a respectable graphic design. The visual goodness/performance ratio of the DirectX 9 native engine (but also scalable to 8 and 7) is certainly good, so much so that the ISI-branded simulator manages to run very well even on slightly dated PCs and at the same time make a good impression . In our particular case, with the configuration that you can see in the appropriate box, rFactor runs smoothly at 1920x1200 with all the details and filters attivated without ever dropping below 50 FPS. The ~basic~ graphics can also be improved by downloading the appropriate high-resolution texture sets for the tracks, which in many cases really make the difference (in others they make things worse). The sound is very well done, and the roar of the engines, a real gripe of most driving games, is absolutely realistic and convincing. rFactor is completely localized in Italian, from the ingame menus to the manual.

To be enjoyed to the fullest it requires commitment, a certain period of apprenticeship and also a particular hardware, i.e. the steering wheel. And passion, otherwise we won't move forward. But for lovers of driving simulations it perhaps represents the best choice among the various offers on the market, being able to boast a solid and rather realistic driving model, a respectable graphic design and, last but not least, a frightening number of enthusiasts who churn out improvements, new circuits and new cars at an industrial pace. Adding to all this a very good implementation of online multiplayer, complete with tournaments, leagues and various competitions, rFactor becomes simply unmissable.Pros Accurate and deep simulation Good online multiplayer Huge amateur support Cons Challenging beyond the tolerance threshold of the average player Graphical sector not up to date with the best current productions rFactor is available for PC. rFactor is a driving game as seen practically only on PC: within the limits of current computing power, a real car driving simulation, without too many compromises. Like its colleagues NetKar Pro, GTR 2, RACE 07 or Live for Speed, rFactor aims for realism, and this invariably translates into a difficult driving model to master and which not only requires a lot of learning, but also a good steering wheel.
