{"name": "Guns", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guns-wheels-madheads.html", "text": "The idea behind the new Qplaze product has already been used several times in video games, and the most representative series from this point of view is undoubtedly Twisted Metal (first on PSone and then on PS2). On mobile, however, it is perhaps the first time that such a title has appeared, moreover using completely polygonal graphics. A risky experiment, due to the technical limitations that still afflict most of the terminals, which nevertheless hides a considerable depth: two game modes (Career and Survival), seven different weapons, six usable characters (each with its own vehicle) and the beauty of ten arenas in which to set the battles. The developers have tried to make Guns, Wheels & Madheads as immediate as possible. Career mode allows us to face all opponents in all arenas, in a crescendo of difficulty that will make us unlock all vehicles and all locations, while Survival will see us engaged in endless combat, with the aim of establishing a survival record. Once the mode has been selected, we will choose our character / vehicle from those available and finally we will launch ourselves into an arena, with a variable number of opponents who want nothing more than to destroy us. You start with a basic weapon that is not very powerful, but very important power-ups will appear cyclically around the arena to get the better of your enemies. In the absence of anything better, obviously you can use your vehicle to cause damage, ramming the others after taking a good run ... but always keeping an eye on your energy bar. As you win the races, the game provides new vehicles and new locations to reach the numbers mentioned at the beginning. On a technical level, GW&M is perhaps not as spectacular as a highly detailed and optimized 2D title, but it cuts a fine figure: the polygonal models of the vehicles are well done, and even if the arenas are extremely blocky and poorly defined, the presence of numerous light forgives this drawback. The fluidity with which the polygons move depends on the power of the mobile phone: on mid-range terminals, the frame rate does not deviate from 15 fps, thus reaching the minimum necessary for everything to be playable. And speaking of playability, the Qplaze product uses an essential and immediate control system, which uses only the joystick and the FIRE button (or 5) to fire the equipped weapon. Sadly, most phones have a joystick that isn't very good at pressing more than one direction simultaneously, and Guns, Wheels & Madheads sadly doesn't have an option for auto-throttle. This means that you have to push the joystick forward to accelerate and backward to brake, as well as left and right to steer.
