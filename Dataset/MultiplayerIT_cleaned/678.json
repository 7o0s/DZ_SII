Captain Harlock comes to mind [/C] Prince of the Universe... Honorable mention to the audio department regarding the soundtrack! X3 offers a multitude of tracks that are well suited to the ~space~ atmosphere. We mainly find new age songs, but we also pass into techno and orchestral music. Some songs are also superb and good thing, they are in MP3 format in the game folder, so you can listen to them whenever you want! As for the voices, the acting is at good levels (the speech is in English) even if, sorry to say, that of the on-board computer (a female robotic voice) is mortally boring and irritating after a while. The sound effects, on the other hand, are normal, with the noises of the various weapons clearly distinct and each sound in the right place (note that in space you can't hear the sounds but that's not a good thing). It approaches that little moon It's not a moon! X3's graphics are absolutely astounding! Never had such an accurate reproduction of space been witnessed! Asteroid fields, (rotating) planets, huge installations not to mention ships: ranging from small fighters to battleships, for a total of two hundred (!) types of vehicles and bases. Everything is made using the latest inventions: pixel shaders, light effects and reflections, ultra-defined textures; a real taste of the next generation, which will make you spend a lot of time admiring the view. The lighting then makes the shadows dynamic, depending on the light sources we will be more in the dark or vice versa, so bright as to reflect a planet! It's almost like watching a NASA documentary, the environment is so realistic! Particle effects aren't far behind either: explosions are gorgeous as are lasers or debris. Precisely to enjoy this splendor, various cameras have been introduced which, in addition to being useful for looking around, allow you to zoom, turn, observe everything from every possible angle. Absolutely spectacular then certain stations in their immensity and architecture: the positive thing is that the world of X3 is not satisfied with drawing from science fiction productions (read copying from Star Wars or Aliens) but offers different types of design that shine for originality and variety ( after a while it will be easy to distinguish the ships of the various races, all with their own particular style). The interface is more than discreet and does its job decently; it is also possible to display customizable monitors (read picture in picture) in order to have certain information at hand. Everything that is seen in-game appears more than cared for, while what disappoints are the cutscenes. These prove to be absolutely subdued as quality: characters that look like mannequins, practically expressionless faces (and with the ~lost eyes~ effect like dolls), zero involvement. Not that there are many but it is a real jarring compared to the rest. Speaking of required power, it should be noted that on the usual mid-range PC (P4 3 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, 6600GT 128Mb, AA4x, AF8x) the game struggles, disabling the filters it's already better. The problem lies in managing the huge universe, made up of continuous calculations, price changes, enemy AI. If desired, excellent compromises can be reached, which however will be to the detriment of the wonderful setting... Final comment X3: Reunion turns out to be the best space simulation ever seen (also due to the lack of strong competition). The fantastic graphic sector perfectly recreates the ~void~ (which is not empty) of the universe and the enormous variety of settings, ships and structures offered fills it up to capacity. Too bad for the plot, ruined by bad movies and subdued moments (you can really avoid it if you want). A title in any case not quite up to everyone, given the abandonment to itself in which the casual player will be involved. Too bad because if there had been a proper excerpt of tutorials, even casual gamers could have fully enjoyed it, instead of spending hours and hours just figuring out how to run a trade. Recommended unreservedly to all fans of the prequels, others know that there will be a lot of work (even if now you can count on a community full of advice and help for beginners). Pros Taste of next generation Tons of ships, structures, environments Excellent longevity Cons Very distracting Some bugs No tutorials May the thread be with you! A mention to the official game thread on our forum! Here you can find a lot of useful information and news, as well as some guides (in iEnglish) that our valued users have posted. Definitely a valuable help for those who want to approach this type of game without being frustrated by the non-existence of tutorials, which would soon lead to a ~what should I do???~. At least a look is recommended! Click here! Fight to know who you are Talking only about the AI of the enemies would be an understatement. Reunion offers a pulsating universe of its own life, in which anything can happen, even outside our jurisdiction. This involves a considerable workload on the CPU which is advisable to be accompanied by a lot of RAM. The whole world is divided into over a hundred sectors, each with its own peculiarities (administrations, free zones, trading areas). Basically the whole thing is ruled by various races, the main group of which is part of the Argon federation. Some of them are more inclined to ~trade~, others to the sole destruction of everything (the accursed Kha'ak are back, born to kill anyone), still others exist to create problems in society (the pirates and the Yaki). The interesting thing is that by acting for/against certain races you will earn a reputation, which varies depending on them and this will determine whether or not you can trade or access certain areas (and particular quests). Therefore, the ~friendship~ factor becomes very useful and can be increased or decreased (up to actual hostilities) depending on our behavior in the field. Does a species use a particular good for its purposes? Become its major supplier! Or else appropriate their possessions! This will result in an increase in income and one's skills. To this end, new ships and upgrades can be purchased, which are especially useful in war zones or infested by hostile races. The amount of customization is very high, and can often make all the difference. Missiles, turrets, engines, special weapons, advanced technological tools are just some of the offerings. It is even possible to buy components to launch into illegal activities (the flytrap to capture protected species!). Everything from drugs to fuel can be traded, as long as you have the funds to get started; obviously with the increase in activity and reputation we will be subject to attacks or looting attempts and therefore the fight will in any case be a constant. Furthermore, we must not forget that there are companies and businesses that operate autonomously in certain sectors; the interference or worse the assault could involve the local police forces or the intervention of the means of defense. Alone in the universe... In terms of human players, yes. Reunion is a single player game which however does not make us regret the lack of other opponents of our ~race~. In fact it will not be only us who trade, we will often run into someone who will try to steal our work or the ~tips~ that have reached us. We will be able to try to counter it in various ways, launching ourselves into the action or possibly having our employees do the dirty work, perhaps commanding a small fleet to attack! Interface management allows you to command a team with basic orders and also leave our autopilot engaged in combat. Of course human intervention is always recommended, also because despite the AI getting along, the enemies can easily get the better of us. In some cases, escape will become a necessity... Space Flies: Bugs! Fortunately the version of X3 released by us is already patched; release in other countries saw the first release full of problems. The most serious is certainly the one related to auto docking, automatic docking. In most cases it didn't work even giving an error screen in calculating the trajectory between the ship and the station. Fortunately, a new patch is out that should fix most of the bugs and make it practically free from major defects. Having said that, it is always possible to dock manually ... it remains to point out the lack of some words in the subtitles, which disappear off the screen, affecting the reading a bit ... X3: Reunion turns out to be the best space simulation ever seen A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away X3: Reunion continues the story of the X universe, a world of trade, war, alliances, piracy, alien forces. A well-established background that with this edition perfects the concept of space simulation. For beginners we can say that it is a game that combines different genres, from strategy to simulation, through combat and resource management. The player is put in the shoes of one of the four main figures who, if desired, can be avoided to start a personalized game in whichwe will decide particular objectives. From this point of view, the title offers various possibilities, first of all that of abandoning the plot to literally mind one's own business. We are here to get rich! Unlike X2, this time there will be multiple ways to earn without excessive effort, and slowly it will be possible to build an empire that bases its profits on simple trade or indiscriminate battles. In this sense, piracy is not recommended since it requires powerful means and is mainly based on randomness. On the other hand, the management of stations, the buying and selling and the transport of goods allow for gradual enrichment which at certain times could increase thanks to particular occasions. An example is the ~milk run~, commercial sectors where with strategic precautions and a moment of attention it will almost always be possible to make a profit. But nothing prevents us from working for others, from being bounty hunters or simple cargo couriers. The freedom offered makes X3 a sort of GTA of space but with a greater depth. The other side of the coin lies in the total absence of tutorials: a user new to this genre risks premature abandonment of the game due to its immensity of action. Navigating the dozens of commands and myriads of options isn't easy, and the learning curve requires a lot of patience. The manual makes up for this shortcoming in a minimal part, limiting itself to indicating some basic examples and the characteristics of the fundamental elements (it is still a nice swag but what is missing is in-game training). The advice is to arm yourself with good will and to use the amateur guides available in various internet forums (including ours!).", "date": "2005-12-22", "grade": null}
