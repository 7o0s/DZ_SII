{"name": "Ratchet & Clank", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratchet-clank.html", "text": "The bolt what a passion Although largely equipped with platforms and related jumps and hops, in reality the Sony production cannot be defined as a simple 3D platform given its marked tendency to offer adventure elements, even in massive doses. For example, the high growth factor of the main character, Ratchet, is fundamental, who with the succession of levels comes into possession of objects that expand his ability to interact with the settings; in this sense, the need to retrace the various worlds several times appears evident, in order to reach areas perhaps only a few moments before out of reach. However, the acquisitions of objects as the game progresses are not limited to providing Ratchet with new movement capabilities, but also amplify the arsenal at his disposal to get the better of the enemies present. This feature, which has always been underlined by the developers, represents an excellent incentive to the variety factor of the Insomniac title: the differences between using a simple blaster rather than a research rocket launcher are evident both on an aesthetic and on a purely practical level. Nonetheless, so much variety of offensive tools gives way to a less than excellent balance of the same, which leads to preferring the use of only 3-4 weapons during the vast majority of the adventure. Beyond the offensive characteristics available to him, Ratchet's real task lies in tackling a whole series of more less complex missions within the planets that make up the universe conceived by US programmers; although the feeling of deja-vu subtly but constantly pervades the entire unfolding of the events, the excellent game mechanics and the excellent response to the protagonist's commands make the gaming experience decidedly enjoyable, even in the long run. The only major flaw in this sense must be found in the management of the camera, whose movements struggle to follow the character in the best way and which therefore often requires manual correction. In any case, the variety of settings and situations offered always remains on a level that encourages the continuation of the adventure: among these, some appreciable mini-games such as hoverboard races should be highlighted. The puzzles related to the opening of some doors, however, are not too spot on, interesting but probably out of place and guilty of breaking the rhythm of the game. The -rare- sections in which the player is called upon to control the faithful robot Clank instead of Ratchet are also subdued; the resulting excessive simplification of the gameplay clashes enormously with what is offered by the rest of the adventure, and the inclusion of the interaction system with the other robots struggles to capture the most savvy users. Spyro I don't admire you From a technical point of view, Insomniac Games is confirmed as one of the best teams currently working on Ps2: Ratchet & Clank in fact demonstrates how capable Sony hardware is by offering very rich settings in terms of level of detail, with excellent fluidity only on very rare occasions questioned by some slight slowdown. Nonetheless, the care taken by the graphics of the American team is evident from every point of view, both as regards the settings and the characters themselves. In relation to the latter, however, so much quantitative abundance does not seem to respond to an equally qualitative abundance; in particular we refer to the character design, certainly not among the most inspired of the genre. Ratchet, the unidentified anthropomorphic beast protagonist of the Sony production, struggles to enter the player's heart by representing more of the classic ~cool~ character already seen and revised; similarly, even Clank appears unable to get rid of the appellation of simple sentient gadget, and the aforementioned solo sections do not have enough weight to appease this feeling. Not even the exchanges between the 2 characters, quite frequent during the interlude scenes, manage to instill the ~soul~ in the digital creatures designed by Insomniac. The Italian adaptation, valid as regards the texts, appears to be of good quality also as regards the speech, although it is probably too academic in relation to the original one. Comment Ratchet & Clank succeeds in the difficult task of establishing itself as the best platform-adventure title for Ps2, thanks basically to a very solid game mechanic combined with a good pace during almost the entire adventure and a top-level graphic design. Nonetheless, the Insomniac Games production does not reach the reputation of a masterpiece basically due to a rather massive presence within itor classic clichs of the genre and a character design certainly not worthy of being remembered in the annals. Sony production is therefore on balance able to excite and amuse practically every type of player, provided you are not looking for originality at all costs. Pros: Enjoyable and fun Good level design Excellent graphics rendering The best of the genre on Ps2 Cons: Lots of deja-vu Chara design just enough Some sections subdued The desire for 3D platforming seems to be one of the few fixed points of the console market in recent years: the trend, born from that masterpiece that responds to the name of Super Mario 64, has practically never stopped producing more or less valid titles until the days ours, to the delight of the numerous enthusiasts scattered all over the globe. Obviously, Ps2 cannot be an exception to this trend, this time thanks to the effort of Insomniac Games which responds to the name of the long-awaited Ratchet & Clank.", "date": "2002-12-10", "grade": null}
