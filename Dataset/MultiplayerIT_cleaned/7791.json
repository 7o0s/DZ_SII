Normally there is a pit in which geometric shapes of various types fall which are associated in different ways depending on the proposed mechanics. For example, in the aforementioned Tetris you need to be able to close entire rows of blocks by fitting the tetrominoes together, while, to make another case, in Bejeweled the gems are all already found on the map and you need to be able to align at least three of the same color to score points. In short, you should be aware of the genre, which over the years has become almost synonymous with casual gaming. With Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe, Adult Swim Games releases another of its titles of disarming simplicity, but capable of overturning a genre by transforming it into something else. This is not a new operation for this publisher, who moves with agility between browser games, PC games and mobile titles. Already in the recent past we had been delighted by gems like Super House of Dead Ninjas or Robot Unicorn Attack. Developed by Andrew Morrish, Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe is not what it seems from the screenshots. Wanting to describe it, it is natural to call it an action platformer, rather than a puzzle game. Driving a funny yellow character, initially selectable from a shortlist of eight of which seven must be unlocked first, the player must destroy the blocks that fall from above to accumulate as many points as possible. Blocks of the same color that come into contact can be destroyed at once by hitting only the most exposed one (obviously they require more attacks than single block). The larger the pile of identical blocks destroyed, the more crystals are obtained which yield experience points, useful for leveling up the weapon being wielded (different depending on the character used). Mom, why does everyone want me dead? Each stage in which the game is divided (six in total) follows the basic scheme described above. Apart from unlocking them, the stages can be tackled in any order. Each of them has characteristics that make it unique. Usually these are different enemies or some variant in the conformation of the level itself. In general we can say that the further you go, the more the danger increases, represented by enemies of various shapes (missile launchers, rotating spiked clubs, ghosts and so on), from the bottom of the map, occupied by lava or sharp spikes, and from the speed of the blocks themselves, which hurt if they fall on their heads (actually they kill only if you haven't leveled up, otherwise they just degrade the weapon forcing you to quickly hunt for new crystals to re-power it). In short, despite the simplicity of the game scheme, Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe is anything but a health walk. Indeed, to be honest, it is really difficult. Playing it only makes sense if you are hunting for the highest score, so it is useless to tell you that to obtain at least decent results you have to work hard with the proverbial fifteen goat wool shirts worn all together in the summer under the beating sun of an African beach. while an Italian immigrant throws coconuts at you, making fun of you. We reiterate the concept for the less receptive: it's damn hard ... but also incredibly engaging and satisfying. Not just paid... If you want to try the flash version of Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe, which is completely free, perhaps to decide whether or not to spend the little money that the full game costs, you can go to the developer's official website: link. Obviously the flash version doesn't have all the contents of the commercial version, but by trying it you will get a very precise idea of the game mechanics. The glue The philosophy of Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe is that of the best casual games (we should start making big distinctions within the macro genre of casual games, but this is not the right place for a similar discussion) that ask for a fair price to be played : simple and trippy game scheme, contents all included in the offer, minimal graphics but full of style. In our case we are talking about pure pixel art that is really well designed... even if for the sake of the truth, which if we were painters we would represent with a naked woman (where?), the levels are not composed of very many elements. Does it matter, given the context, or were you hoping that Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe would put your graphics card under pressure? Deluded. What matters more is that after a disastrous game, you want to play another one, hoping to do better and last more than three minutes. What counts is that you feel great satisfaction in seeing your performance improve. Above all, count that you finishto play hours and hours soon forgetting the apparent simplicity of the title. In short, the substance counts. Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe delivers what it promises: innovative and fun gameplay", "date": "2013-06-08", "grade": "8.8"}
