Suffice it, therefore, to know that the story of this action roguelike is set in the future, precisely in 2476, when one of the lunar bases of the terrestrial federation sends a mysterious message requesting help following unspecified problems. In response to this message, therefore, the Space Grunts arrive, a team of fighters capable of throwing themselves into the midst of chaos and coming out victorious, at least in most cases. We therefore find ourselves controlling one of these characters chosen from three different categories: Captain, Strongarm and TechJunky, corresponding more or less to the classic balanced character, to the strongman specialized in melee attacks and to the technician, in turn corresponding more or less to the three parameters that characterize the different classes, namely strength (damage of weapons), technology (use of objects) and luck (chance of finding loot). As per the roguelike tradition, Space Grunts offers a rather demanding challenge and the inexorable rule of ~permadeath~ requires us to dose every move to avoid the inevitable game over that arrives as soon as we succumb to the enemies, complete with a quick summary of our deeds hero. As befits this type of game, the levels are generated in a procedural way, so the experience is different for each game, even if obviously the elements of the scenario and the enemies are recycled and mixed in a creative way, within the space base invaded which represents a sort of long dungeon divided into various levels with progressive difficulty. Classic roguelike action and well-crafted pixel art are the ingredients of Space Grunts Piles of pixels The mechanics do not come out that much from the roguelike standard and precisely this canonicity is probably the characterizing element of Space Grunts, which is offered in particular to those who appreciate the genre, but can also conquer other audiences thanks to the good mix of action and turn-based elements and its accurate presentation. As per tradition, therefore, the character moves within a grid-structured map and following a quick exchange of turns with the enemies, exploring the various areas of the dungeon in search of treasures and trying to reach the conclusion of each level, with the possibility of consulting a practical map to identify the areas still to be visited. The available arsenal offers different choices of weapons and equipment to be used with different attack properties, while the elements of the scenario can be used as a diversion by detonating boxes and explosives with various effects. A rather dubious element is represented by the control system which uses the classic ~virtual~ digital cross, reproduced on the touch screen. The arrows are very far apart and force you to take your finger off to change direction, instead of offering the possibility of a fluid and fast movement, even if the turn-based essence of the action does not make the matter particularly problematic. The graphic characterization, while relying on the now consolidated pixelated style of many similar productions, demonstrates a particular mastery in the use of colors and in the reproduction of details, even if the presence of very small sprites sometimes tends to create a bit of confusion between enemies, threats and elements of the scenario. In any case, Space Grunts is a beautiful sight to behold with its animations and its particular bright colors, managing to stand out with its appearance even in the midst of the now large group of roguelikes on the mobile market.", "date": "2016-02-16", "grade": "7.8"}
