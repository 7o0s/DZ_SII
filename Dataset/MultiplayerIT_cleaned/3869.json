{"name": "New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-super-mario-bros-deluxe-recensione.html", "text": "Looking at the list of best-selling Nintendo games, it is clearly visible which saga is the most important: six out of fifteen titles are called Super Mario Bros., they are exclusively two-dimensional, and two of them came out after 2006, therefore after the posthumous and late resurrection of the saga, with that strange ~New~ in front, as if the game itself were not enough to communicate a novelty, but explicit textual communication was also needed. Super Mario Bros. is a long-lived series, which has achieved greater success than Mario Kart and Pokmon: this is because it is a universal saga like very few others. The two dimensions and the intuitive controls make it immediately appreciable even by novices; the depth of the controls, accompanied by that of the game design, have often elevated it to the most precious star of the electronic firmament. If Super Mario has been Super Mario for more than thirty years, with fluctuating but constant fortunes like no other, it is above all thanks to this series, and in particular to the first and third episodes for the NES, closely followed by Super Mario World for SuperNintendo. Between this last chapter and the next, dated 2006, there was a long, unaware and erroneous ostracism, which we have discussed in depth here, which can be summarized in the idea that Nintendo considered this saga to be superseded by the three-dimensional one. Nothing more wrong. Because the immediacy and genuine purity of the two dimensions, of the run and jump buttons, is quite another thing. And the outstanding sales prove it. Too bad they didn't help bring this series back into the good graces of Nintendo's leaders, who - in recent times - have never ennobled it enough. On Switch we expect a chapter capable of reversing this trend and, in the meantime, almost two years after the launch of the console, here we are writing the review of the Deluxe edition of New Super Mario Bros. U, released on Wii U in 2012. New Super Mario Bros. U Already at the time of the first publication New Super Mario Bros. U was a conservative sequel to a series in itself mannerist, not very ambitious but decidedly well built, with marble foundations inherited from a royal past. Although more than six years have passed, our opinion about it has remained almost unchanged: two-dimensional platformers have not proliferated as some might have imagined, and the happy period after New Super Mario Bros. Wii has run out in a short time. The genre is still better than in the past decade, but from 2012 to now, excluding the beautiful Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, it has given its best especially in the indie world - for example with Celeste, a great success of 2018. The graphics of New Super Maro Bros. U is perhaps the most aged element, especially in terms of lighting: already in 2012 it looked like a high-resolution version of its predecessor, with the exception of the well-finished backgrounds, and the impression of backwardness in this period has certainly not decreased. The gleam and care of the materials of Nintendo Land at the time made it seem outdated, now it feels like a title from, as they say, ~a generation ago~. Having said that, the overall appearance is still graceful, with an unrefined but effective style, and we point out the usual pleasant, playful songs to accompany the action, reiterated over time and certainly functional. It is a masterfully tested platform, with an ideal learning curve, and an excellent structural declination: at any speed you go through a stage, it can give you some satisfaction. The three secret Star Coins to search for in each level, otherwise aimed at reaching the flag at the end of the course, are scholastic for those who have tried it previously, but at the same time stimulating for novices. It looks like a product built in the laboratory by skilled hands, with each ingredient in the right place, without the slightest desire to experiment: the power-ups are fun but not very galvanizing (penguin excluded), the worlds are varied but not very original, the stages harmonious but - usually - not exciting. We reiterate what was written at the time: it looks like a work created by the nerd of the class, in this case Masataka Takemoto, and not by the genius of the company. In this version it is possible to perform the aerial pirouette by double-clicking the jump button, and it is not a solution that we appreciated: much better to allocate the action to the backbone, to avoid that, as happened to us, it activates randomly. The unreleased characters included in the Deluxe edition, Ruboniglio and Toadette, add little to this mode... unlike in Luigi's story. New Super Luigi U New Super Luigi U, which was supposed to be downloaded as DLC in 2013, also remained soessentially unchanged. Now you have more seconds available to finish the levels, a good two hundred - which do not correspond to as many seconds in reality, they are shorter - and, as we anticipated, you can choose Toadette and Ruboniglio as characters, which greatly simplify things. This downward calibration was decided because New Super Luigi U, while sharing the world map with the original, was decidedly more difficult than New Super Mario Bros. U: the many novices who will try it in 2019 for the first time ( and they will be able to play it immediately, before the ~main~ adventure) they will have more life preservers to hold on to. Toadette has the now well-known crown-shaped power-up, which transforms her into Peachette, capable of gliding and further pushing up - but, unlike the Squirrel, not clinging to walls. Not only is this a useful transformation, but it's also very widespread: the effects are very similar to those of the Acorn, but the Crown is found more often. Ruboniglio for his part is totally immune to enemies, an event that takes away much of the charm of the game, but which could be ideal for the little ones or, in general, for beginners. The physics of New Super Luigi U is different from the original title, it follows that of Luigi in Super Mario Bros. 2: greater inertia, higher and longer jumps. These uniqueness are not always exploited by the level design, but sometimes it happens, and in general they help to diversify the experience from that of New Super Mario Bros. U, thanks to the slightly altered bases. After a while, should you need it, it will also be possible to interpret these stages with the physics of the original. Overall, the levels of New Super Luigi U are more difficult, more focused on the path to the flag than on the search for secrets: the Star Coins themselves are positioned in such a way that it is more difficult to reach them than to find them, when in New Super Mario Bros. U basically the opposite happens. Challenges and multiplayer As you may have guessed, in case you have already played the originals, the number of new features in this Deluxe edition is not stratospheric. However, it would be stupid not to highlight how well this game goes well with Nintendo Switch: multiplayer works very well in any situation, both because it is one of the titles in which isolated joy-cons perform best, and because the screen is shared, and it shows pretty good even in ~tabletop~ mode. If this were not enough, as mentioned at the beginning, the nature of the work is so accessible and magnetic that it catalyzes the sharing of the experience, whether you are on the sofa in the living room or traveling by train. In addition to the main adventures, multiplayer is supported within Mii Mode in dedicated sections such as Turbo Play and Coin Hunt. Both of these parts propose structured levels for the occasion. In Game Turbo you have to collect as many coins as possible, so as to speed up the pace and quickly reach the finish line, trying not to be crushed by the forced scrolling stage. It requires a constant compromise between collection and continuation, which is even more difficult to achieve in multiplayer. Coin hunting is the only mode - editor aside - that can only be used by multiple players: it's also the most chaotic and fun for novices, because it's important to get to the bottom, but it's even more important to collect coins and not fall into the ravines. At the end of a customizable series of levels, whoever has scored the most points will win: the counting methods are daring and full of power-ups, so the reversals are always around the corner. For expert players, the most interesting section remains that of the Challenges, although the cooperative ones with the Wii U tablet have disappeared: perhaps it is the only mode capable of fully enhancing the control system, the only one in which great skill is essential pad. At the time we highly praised this section, and our perception has not changed: the Challenges are still the best segment of New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe.", "date": "2019-01-09", "grade": "8.0"}
