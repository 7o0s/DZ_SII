Version tested: Xbox 360 Supergiant Games are a small team, but their ambition is great, and what better than Live Arcade to express their talent? Bastion inaugurates the set of titles planned for this hot summer, and does it with great style. The choice is surprisingly canonical, an action RPG with an isometric view, comic style and a spirit capable of tracing the wonder aroused by fairy tales. Yet in a scheme that is not exactly revolutionary, the software house has managed to insert excellent ideas that could make school in the genre, combined with a truly innovative approach to playability. Make yourself comfortable and don't be frightened if the ground slides under your feet, discover with us this strange, wonderful dimension, available on Xbox 360, waiting for a future publication also on PlayStation 3 and PC. Here comes the Kid The story follows the story of a white-haired warrior boy, for his friends Kid, who wanders on an endless journey in search of crystal fragments to rebuild the Bastion moor. The latter is to all intents and purposes a free zone in the game, a real strategic base that can be customized through special small crystals, in fact the currency of the world. Initially the choice is limited, but continuing the adventure we can add functional buildings to improve weapons and objects. Not only that, since various levels require the recovery of some characters, these add up to Bastion, representing pleasant company and a source of valuable advice for tackling our campaign. Kid is certainly not an inexperienced person, his skill in using weapons is matched only by his curiosity in modifying them to make them even more lethal. The choice is dizzying, ranging from a deadly hammer, to a machete, grenades, bazookas, flamethrowers, arquebuses and even a pair of pistols that seem to come straight from those of Devil May Cry's Dante. It is easy to understand that our character alternates close attacks with those at a distance, a necessary condition to face many enemy targets out of our reach, combined with devastating special shots, which can be implemented with the right trigger. In addition to being able to elude the opponents with a very useful roll, we also have a shield that can protect us from their attacks, and the shield itself is an object of fundamental importance in the more advanced stages of the game, where the balance between attack and defense highlights the validity of the combat system. I play the game Another peculiarity of Bastion is represented by the narrative voice, exactly like a fairy tale told to a child, everything that happens on the screen is witnessed with words. An original but impractical idea, the frenzy of the game and the English language, even if subtitled in Italian, weigh down the comprehension of the commentary. But it is undoubtedly nice to witness an amnesia of the narrator at the time of Game Over (~Where was I?~). The highlight of the Supergiant effort is elsewhere, and lies in the innovative interpretation of the level of difficulty, integrated in the Bastion area itself. The player has the possibility to activate at will special items able to increase the advantage of the enemies, in exchange for an increase in the experience points earned. We basically have the opportunity to experiment with different solutions and adapt the game according to our tastes. The map is vast and offers some special levels, where we have to face tests aimed at conquering objects or improvements for our weapon. These levels are playable at any time and offer rewards based on your ability to beat them. Not only that, Bastion itself offers special internships, real tour de force, to which specific objectives are obviously linked. Technically Bastion is a feast for the eyes, similar to Islands Of Wakfu, everything is presented in a two-dimensional and very comic style, with warm and saturated color solutions, dynamic zoom, gigantic and amusing enemies, in a suspended world that is built piece by piece, a gimmick not only with a strong scenic impact, but useful for understanding which road to take. Xbox 360 goals Bastion offers 12 objectives for a total of 200 player points, which is the standard of Live Arcade titles. Being an adventure entirely dedicated to the single player, a good part is achieved by finishing it, but the most difficult ones are related to the secret areas, which are very challenging to complete. Good luck! And they fell happily ever after Unfortunately the possibility of falling off platforms is far from remote, and often not attributable to errori of the player but to external factors, such as the confusion given by the isometric view, the conclusion of a special move or a roll. Perhaps aware of this, the programmers have been very little punitive in the unpleasant eventuality of a fall, which is paid for by losing a minimal part of energy. But the system doesn't fully convince and the ability to jump comes much too late in the adventure. Given the amount of content proposed, truly remarkable for a digital delivery project, the balance ends up being affected. Suffice it to say that new ideas are proposed until the end, so as not to shake off the feeling of being in front of a gigantic tutorial. The risk of this abundance is the deprivation of that ideal playability adjustment, important for an RPG, which leads to optimizing the skills learned so far. The possibility of replaying everything while maintaining the achieved skill level is not very encouraging. We also noticed some drop in framerate in the most agitated situations, fortunately this is a phenomenon limited to a few areas, but when it occurs it is annoying. The exotic western-style music is slightly misleading, but decidedly pleasant and of unquestionable quality. Of great effect is a piece sung at a particular moment in the game. Bastion is a single player only title, so Xbox Live support is limited to online leaderboards.", "date": "2011-07-19", "grade": "8.5"}
