Unlike in the past, the package that we are about to review has been designed exclusively for those who have completed the basic campaign and also many of the side missions, given that the quests we are going to encounter recommend a minimum level of 39 out of the 40 of the previous one level cap, raised to 45 for the occasion. However, the Hidden Ones should be played after completing Assassin's Creed Origins also because it is directly linked to the main plot, showing us the situation of the Brotherhood after four years and a new, terrible threat looming over the Sinai peninsula. Real challenge Bayek decides to reach the unprecedented location after receiving a request for help from Tahira, head of a team of Occults that moves precisely inside the Sinai and who suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the men of the Roman commander Rufio. The region is now in their hands, and it is not a simple way of saying: the streets of this new, fascinating scenario are guarded by centurions and it will not be easy to go unnoticed, much less complete the sixteen missions (eight main and eight secondaries) that make up the expansion, especially if you try to do it starting from a lower skill level than the one suggested. In short, we are talking about a package capable of offering a real and consistent challenge, and which goes hand in hand with the very important option recently introduced by the developers for the automatic balancing of the enemies' abilities: a real ~game changer~, if we consider that one of the historical limits of Assassin's Creed was precisely the ease with which certain fights were unscathed, even against hundreds of opponents, once the character had been enhanced beyond a certain point. Despite having a maximum level Bayek, however, the amount of enemies that crowd the three regions of the Sinai will lead you to adopt an approach decidedly more devoted to strategy than to direct clashes, resorting to the precious contribution of Senu to identify all targets within the bases and proceeding to eliminate them in sequence, through the execution of headshots from distance and silent kills with the hidden blade. vertical limit If from the point of view of gameplay, enemies and situations The Hidden Ones can easily be branded as a simple ~more of the same~ compared to the experience of Assassin's Creed Origins, there is no doubt that the Sinai setting contributes in strong way to characterize this expansion. It is a very large region, with barren and mountainous landscapes, which alternates rather diversified landscapes and introduces a strong element of verticality, which was previously lacking. The same enemy bases, never so large and full of soldiers, develop upwards and rest on rocky walls that we can travel uphill and downhill, perhaps to find the ideal shooting point and move quickly once the opponents they will have identified. The result is a different approach to many situations, which pushes you to review your strategies and to assimilate new mechanisms in order to be able to face the substantial challenge, as already mentioned, that this DLC offers. However, an excellent job has also been done from the point of view of the plot: the sequel nature of The Hidden Ones makes sense and reveals new aspects of what will become the Assassin Brotherhood, with a view to a structure based also on this case on a system of lieutenants that we will have the task of eliminating to track down Rufio and put an end to his barbaric dominion over the Sinai. There will be twists and surprises: if you liked the story of the basic campaign you will appreciate this too, since it essentially touches the same strings, without missing anything despite a necessarily reduced range of action. Splendid shining We played Assassin's Creed Origins - The Occulti in the PC version on an Ultra HD OLED television, thus enjoying the splendid landscapes of the Sinai (as well as those of an Egypt that remains freely explorable after the campaign is over, especially if you still have side missions with to try your hand at) with the support of HDR, a technology capable of giving its best in contexts like this, i.e. large scenarios illuminated by daylight. The newhe setting obviously cannot boast the richness and variety appreciated in the immense map of Egypt, but it defends itself very well and in some points it knows how to pleasantly surprise, demonstrating that that peninsula offers much more than a few rocky gatherings. The performances, as indicated in our recent study, remain variable: with a GTX 1070 you have to choose whether to play at real 4K with some small sacrifices and thirty frames per second or at 1080p and sixty frames per second, but in both cases the fluidity is strongly influenced by the complexity of the scenario. It is also curious to note how the splendid cutscenes have not yet been fixed: the ~premium~ polygonal models and the many light effects put even the most powerful GPUs in difficulty, resulting in drops of several frames. In conclusion, Gli Occulti is a solid and well-made expansion, which continues the plot of Assassin's Creed Origins by proposing a new setting, new characters and new ways to deal with situations that are certainly not new or original compared to the basic campaign, but characterized by a very consistent degree of challenge. Given the duration of the DLC, the surprising beauty of the map and the importance of the package for the plot, the purchase is certainly recommended to all owners of the Ubisoft title.", "date": "2018-01-27", "grade": null}
