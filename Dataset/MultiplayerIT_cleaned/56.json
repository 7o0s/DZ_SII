{"name": "Kororinpa - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kororinpa-recensione.html", "text": "Roll In Kororinpa you will have to guide a ball through the very intricate paths proposed by the game, being careful not to fall into the traps that will push you off the tracks. To do this you will not be able to directly control the ball but instead you will control the inclination of the game table by means of the sensor inserted in the wiimote. This means that with the remote perfectly horizontal the game table will be level, and that tilting the controller in one of the various directions the table on the screen will do the same with an almost perfect accuracy and correspondence. The only rule of Kororinpa is this, there are no powerups to save your skin, there are no aids to meet you, only the marble and the track. The first courses obviously act as a training session where you will become familiar with the physics applied to the ball and with the movements to be carried out using the controller, but as is natural, going forward things will become more and more complicated and tangled. As you continue in the game you will unlock, in addition to the paths divided into 5 settings for a total of 45 ~standard~ levels, new marbles that will be useful for breaking records, rather than completing a level with less difficulty. In fact, some marbles will be slower and therefore much easier to manage, while others will be faster but difficult to govern, and necessary to quickly reach the end of the course. Skip To complete a level (or Kororinpa) it will not be enough to reach the finish line but you will have to collect a variable number of orange crystals positioned along the way. These crystals will force you to follow the path in its entirety, depriving you of the ability to cut by jumping from one portion of the level to another. Each time you fall into the void you will be taken back to the beginning of the level, or to one of the various checkpoints in the more advanced levels, but you will not lose the crystals you have collected up to that point. The factor on which Hudson with Kororinpa played everything and everything is in the conformation of the paths, and this is probably the best value of the game, in addition to the already mentioned excellent response of the commands. If the first levels are rather elementary, all the others become more and more elaborate and surprising. The more advanced ones, for example, will constantly force you to overturn the top up to more than 90 on each side with respect to the natural position, to overcome any obstacle or trap. In these situations you will have to drop the ball from the horizontal plane to the vertical one, and then maybe return to the previous axis, or you will just have to go along with the slope which will get steeper and steeper until you realize you are in a point perpendicular to the starting point. Even the traps become more and more insidious and some are based precisely on these assumptions. and fall! At the beginning of the article we talked about 45 game levels that we defined as ~standard~. These paths are the ones necessary to get to the classic end credits, but fortunately the game offers some other scheme to lengthen the duration of the game, not too much in truth. In each of the 45 paths there is a green crystal placed in a usually less accessible point. These emeralds will allow you to unlock a dozen secret levels, all of which share a certain underlying extravagance. By completing the classic levels within a certain time limit, you will have the opportunity to unlock another 5 levels, the most difficult of the entire game. In these routes you will be asked for a steady hand and the calm of a true Carthusian to overcome some passages as far as possible. Kororinpa also offers a multiplayer challenge for 2 players, who will play the levels at the same time (seeing each other but not colliding) and try to be the first to finish the level. We point out that to play in two you can use either 2 wiimotes or a wiimote and a nunchaku. We also spend a few lines on the technical implementation of the game which presents itself as it should: expecting more from a title born on such a structure would be completely out of place. The levels are colorful, clear and pleasant to look at, just a pity for a couple of slightly subdued textures and the lack of 9/16 support (which the game only offers in letterbox mode). The sound accompaniment, on the other hand, is quite catchy and varied, with some songs more successful than the others, which, in any case, will almost never get boring. Comment Kororinpa is definitely a game made with sense. Hudson worked a lot on the design of the tracks creating more and more complicated and intricate. A note of merit must also be spent on the developmentppo of the same on several levels, a solution that will force you to think in 3 dimensions. Other than that and a physics realization that guarantees an always immediate ball response, Kororinpa doesn't offer much else, though. It is possible to finish the game in a couple of intense sessions, and it is said that once you get to the end credits you will still want to replay each level to earn the coveted gold cup by scrambling seconds after seconds. Although the developers have worked diligently and with good will, Kororinpa fails to reach the peaks of fun hinted at by some passages. Maybe he needed some more ideas to spice up the base game or even just the multiplayer, and maybe he needed more levels. In conclusion Kororinpa is a game that works, made without major flaws, but which lacks that quality fun that is only found in great games. Selling it at a budget price wouldn't have been a bad idea. Pros Successful design of the tracks Good ball response Against 45 levels are not few, but more would be needed Multiplayer with little bite Fun ... but almost always with the handbrake on The launch of the Wii was accompanied by a fair amount of titles, but only very few worthy of the attention and savings of the players who immediately trusted the new Nintendo console. And so a few months after the fateful December 8 (launch date of the Wii) players are looking around for something worth playing while waiting for some great new title. Wait finished with Kororinpa?", "date": "2007-03-02", "grade": null}
