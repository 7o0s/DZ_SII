The variety of missions was much higher in Blazing Angels, where we were called upon to perform the most diverse tasks. Over G Fighters presents itself as a timid exponent of ~simulation~ games against the numerous ~arcade~ games on the shelves. Unfortunately in reality it has very little simulation as there are a series of inexplicable flaws inherent in the game itself. Sometimes it happens to break the plane for making it turn too much, sending it into ~Over G~ or in an extreme situation. It is a pity that the latest generation fighters such as the F16 have a ~fly-by-wire~ control system interpolated by an on-board computer which avoids sudden movements and wrong manoeuvres. Also compared to any other game in the genre it is almost always possible to avoid enemy homing missiles, just dive slightly, increase speed and lose them. Too easy, if that were the case in reality too. But there is a gem: often you will see the screen become completely red, other times black. This also occurs among real pilots and depends on the fact that blood tends to go to the legs when they are subjected to positive Gs. When you are in the presence of negative G blood instead collects towards the head, and this explains the red color. Arcade or Simulation? The game is developed by the Japanese of Taito and in the old continent it was bought and distributed by none other than UbiSoft. Incredibly, despite the short life of the Xbox360, this is the second title of the ~air~ genre in the lineup of the Microsoft machine. The first was that Blazing Angels always under the UbiSoft label, demonstrating the fact that the famous French house has an eye towards this type of product. During the review this will be our yardstick, without however forgetting all those ~cornerstones~ mentioned in the introduction which represent the genre itself. Over G Fighters is part of the ~simulation~ trend, or in any case pseudo-simulation, although console software can be at least compared to a PC one. The game looks good, with many options placed in an original and stylish, if slightly confusing menu. Scenario, Challenge, Multiplayer are the main modes, and unfortunately for the unaccustomed to foreign languages, everything is written in English without a shadow of a translation. The Scenario has a kind of common thread represented by a sketch of history, just to justify the missions present, 75 in total. We are part of an elite air force tasked with national security and will be sent to fight all over the globe. The category of ~air~ shooters on consoles has a long tradition that comes directly from the legendary 8-bit. Obviously the very famous film ~Top Gun~ helped a lot to make this type of product appreciated in Italy too, and from the 90s onwards there was a continuous succession of releases of this kind. The beginning of it all was, to tell the truth, thanks to that legendary ~Afterburner~ created by SEGA and Yu Suzuki in 1987, of which the new chapter is being worked on right now. The history of great air combat games also passes through the splendid Aerodancing which saw the light on the Dreamcast in three editions and the famous Ace Combat series on Sony consoles. All games that have helped create a genre, perfect it, reinvent it over the years and make it popular with the general public. ~Over G Fighters~ arrives today on Xbox360: let's find out together if this title will be able to give us new emotions, up there in the clouds! Multiplayer and Xbox Live. As you'd expect, the best things come from online multiplayer through Xbox Live!. The modality is studied well, through the rooms (as happens in Ghost Recon or Halo2, for example) it is possible to chat, set the options and then launch the game. Over G Fighters does not suffer from any slowdown in the game, but this was easily understood given the too old graphics engine, which we will talk about later. You can play up to 8 at the same time, in the Arena all against all, or in Challenge one against one, or by organizing yourself into two teams. In the menu you can choose your vehicle, customize it with weapons and the amount of fuel on board. Finding an available match is very fast, almost instantaneous. Joining a team much less, the inscription ~Could not join~ will appear very often before starting to play, unfortunately. Perhaps due to the impossibility of the system to insert a pilot while ghe others are playing, as happens for example in Ghost Recon. Giving directions and commands from the cockpit of your fighter is very satisfying, but this is independent of the actual quality of the game itself. The slowest supersonic fighters in the Air Force? The 3D engine used by the Japanese developers is perhaps the worst element of Over G, so much so that it is not even suitable for old gen consoles such as PS2 and Xbox. For once the comparison must be sought not in the good Blazing Angels, which boasted respectable structures and effects, but in the now ancient Aerodancing for Dreamcast, extraordinarily beautiful at the time but now more than outdated. The aircraft models do not differ from those already appreciated on the SEGA machine: realistic but not as real as one would expect from a ~next~ machine and its millions of polygons. There isn't an effect applied: the backdrops consist of a blue texture for the sea, or brownish for the hills. Some locations such as cities boast a few hundred polygons, with textures to forget. The shadows brought on the planes are nice, but they are things already seen and that are not striking, especially in the light of the inadequacy of the poly count and the applied effects. Some locations such as cities boast a few hundred polygons, with absolutely forgettable textures, perhaps comparable to a Nintendo64 rather than a console like Xbox360 The slowest supersonic fighters in the Air Force? Even the water is just, like, blue. Monochrome. Without waves, without polygons, without reflections. Trees are ugly textures applied over an ugly texture that represents the terrain. A set of ugliness that we will hardly see all together like this. The developers have well thought out to give us the opportunity to look around via the right analog, so that we can better notice these bleak scenarios. The musical side is sufficient, the classic vaguely rocking and ~loop~ songs frame the various missions and menus. However, the effects are very bad, poorly sampled and quantitatively poor. Maybe even realistic, who knows, perhaps no one has ever really climbed on a military fighter, but often having a flap raised or a missile searching against us causes a deafening and absolutely cacophonous noise, never heard in other similar games (which perhaps will be less simulative, who knows). The game also enjoys a feeling of absolute slowness, which certainly doesn't help to give the idea of being at the controls of a supersonic fighter. Comment Over G Fighters has a bit of a problem. The first, without a doubt, is the technical aspect, absolutely not suitable for a Next Gen console like Xbox 360. The Taito title tries to be a complete game through its many options and a long if repetitive scenario mode. Fighters are too slow to respond, perhaps too simulative for a console game, and just not fun to fly. Ace Combat has made school in recent years, but evidently Taito has deserted the lessons. A game for true fans of the genre, which offers some good multiplayer games on Xbox Live and little else. Pros Very long single player mode Game via Xbox Live Cons Too repetitive and simple missions Graphically inadequate No localization in Italian General feeling of slowness Achievements to unlock. Over G Fighters boasts another negative record: that of the vagueness of the objectives to be achieved. By viewing the game screen, a series of unclear indications will appear in the 360 dashboard, above all in English to make the situation worse. Not that there is much variety: they fall into two categories. Scenario reward and ~premium~ reward for online play. By clicking on any of the 38 ~missions~ to be performed, the explanation will always be the same: ~meet certain conditions to earn this achievement~, or ~do something to obtain this reward~, ok. The total is still 1000 points, but more was really needed. The game structure: classic, without frills and surprises. The basic structure of Over G Fighters is the classic one of almost all games of this genre. The real problem, which can be found immediately, is the repetitiveness of the missions themselves. Throughout the game we will always be called to perform the same maneuvers: hook, aim and fire. Once the enemy is down, that's it. The initial difficulty is really low, and the first 20 missions follow each other very fast and bland. Many are similar, if not the same: ~lock~ enemy fighters and fire missiles in bursts. Which are automatic search anyway and therefore we don't even have to make the effort to aim, they will surely hit. After a while the missions will become more difficultili, for two reasons: the enemy AI will be more aggressive and the amount of fighters will increase. Not large formations, it will still be about five, six, seven planes, some naval vessels at times. Next to us there is always a support fighter that helps us and which is sometimes essential as the enemies manage to shoot it down very rarely, and in this sense the AI is too unbalanced towards us, and the challenge factor suffers a bit'.", "date": "2006-07-13", "grade": null}
