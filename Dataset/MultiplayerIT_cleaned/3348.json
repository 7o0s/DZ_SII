{"name": "Tangle Tower", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tangle-tower-la-recensione.html", "text": "There really is something for all tastes on Apple Arcade, as evidenced by our review of Tangle Tower: we are talking about an investigative graphic adventure like you don't often see, both because it is part of a niche genre, and because it certainly has unconventional characteristics for the mobile sector. This despite the pedigree of the developers of SFB Games (the same as Snipperclips for Nintendo Switch) testifies that they are not real veterans of this particular category of video games: let's therefore find out if their work deserves applause or if instead it denotes some sin of naivety. Investigate with taps In Tangle Tower you take on the role of detective Grimoire who, accompanied by his trusted aide Sally, goes to the islet where the Tangle tower is built, a strange building made up of two structures hosting the Fellow and Pointer families, united by common descent with the Remingtons, the original owners of the manor: the purpose is to investigate the mysterious death of Fiona Fellow, killed by a stab wound while painting a portrait of her relative Freya Fellow. As can be understood, the plot is immediately quite complex, so much so that one feels the lack of an introduction to the facts worthy of the name: the game instead puts the user in front of the case without too many preambles and also avoiding to provide a minimum of background of the two protagonists, which leaves quite dumbfounded. There isn't even a tutorial that illustrates the game mechanics, an absence that in this case is not felt thanks to the extreme immediacy of the whole. The gameplay starts from the scenario map, divided into boxes that represent the various rooms of the mansion: a tap and you immediately reach the desired location, at which point you are free to touch any element (or character, if present) on the screen that you consider interesting for investigation purposes to trigger a contextual action. In Tangle Tower there are people to talk to, puzzles to solve and lots of objects to analyze and catalog, and it is therefore a product aimed at those who don't formalize spending most of their game time reading documents or lines of dialogue. Fortunately, the writing is of a good standard, but the fact remains that there are moments in which the title proves to be a bit too verbose. The work of SFB Games also lacks balance in the management of the plot, with a meager beginning, a very dense central part (perhaps even too much) and an ending whose construction seemed quite disappointing to us. In this sense, a reduced longevity - which translates into about three to four hours necessary to reach the conclusion - almost becomes a merit for an adventure that if it had been drawn longer would have seriously risked leading to boredom. It must be said, however, that when you don't get lost in chatter, Tangle Tower really works very well and doesn't skimp on even brilliant moments: this is the case of the various puzzles, which all prove to be well-constructed and characterized by a perfectly balanced level of difficulty, or of the in which Grimoire stops to make a deduction, helped by the user who has to move boxes in a certain order to allow the protagonist to follow the right logical path. Finally, it doesn't hurt that the game can count on an excellent audiovisual sector, with graphics made up of colorful two-dimensional backdrops full of details on which characters outlined in a very pleasant style stand out and equipped with animations worthy of a cartoon. The sound is even better, strong with music that effectively dictates the tone of the atmosphere and an English dubbing of a quality that is rarely heard in a mobile product.", "date": "2019-11-30", "grade": "7.8"}
