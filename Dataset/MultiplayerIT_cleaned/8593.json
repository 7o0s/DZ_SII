{"name": "Death Road", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101846-death-road-via-dolorosa.html", "text": "In the now distant 1995, WipEout represented more than any other title a real showdown for PlayStation, the clear demonstration of the power of a console destined to revolutionize the market and become synonymous with ~video game~ in many countries. Needless to deny it, the other platforms suffered a lot due to the extraordinary mix of technique and ~profession~ put in place by Psygnosis, so much so that two years later on PC an attempt was made to exploit the newborn MMX technology to create something similar with POD ( anyone remember?), which ran at sixty frames per second but in terms of personality, unfortunately, had very little to do with the exclusive Sony. To demonstrate that the ~wound~ is still open today the Polish developers of Active Zone Group think about it, who with Death Road have basically created a low-priced clone of WipEout (14.99 euros), available in the PC version on some digital stores (including Gamersgate and, soon, Origin) and also arriving on Xbox LIVE and PlayStation Network in the coming months. With a single player campaign made up of fifty-five races, which unfold through four ~championships~ (Rookie, Pilot, Veteran and Elite) gradually more full-bodied and demanding, seven different types of events and the presence of an online multiplayer mode for a maximum of six players, this ambitious indie production aims with conviction to fill a gap, without presenting itself as a real alternative to the classic from which it is ~inspired~. Engines on the track and go Death Road is set in a future where fearless pilots challenge each other aboard vehicles that don't have to submit to friction with the ground, as they are equipped with ~floating~ systems that keep them a meter or more from the ground, as well as of reactors capable of making them hurtle like rockets. Yes, exactly like in WipEout, but without the stables or confederations or logos similar to Japanese ideograms: in the Active Zone Group title you just run, without worrying about the outline. A quick tutorial instructs us on the control system, which unlike the Psygnosis racer does not use the double directional brake, but a standard type solution with accelerator, brake and buttons to which any boost, the activation of the supplied weapons can be assigned , the release of mines and the change of target and view between the three available (directly behind the ship, from a distance or from the ~hood~). It is no coincidence that we talked about ~assignment~, as the game does support the Xbox 360 controller (strongly recommended), but does not have a predefined layout in this sense and therefore asks us to customize the commands to arrange them as we please . The single player campaign appears to be very substantial, with four different leagues which correspond to the same number of difficulty levels and an increasing number of races: the Rookie championship is made up of ten events, the Pilot championship of fifteen and so on, up to total of fifty-five runs; which however, and here unfortunately the knots come home to roost, are always played within the same eight tracks. Give me a calendar The approach adopted by the developers for unlocking new vehicles and new types of race is the tried and tested approach of experience points: the better our performance will be and the sooner we will be able to access new content, with the obligation, however, to always place ourselves on the podium for be able to move on to the next stage. Nothing will prevent us, at a certain point, from getting on board the fastest spacecraft at our disposal (there are eleven in all) and competing again in the first competitions, so as to complete them by setting new records and racking up even more points. The normal speed races, characterized however by the strong presence of weapons and obstacles of various kinds, alternate classic elimination races (the last one is eliminated every few seconds), checkpoints, time attacks, combat-based races and others. , up to seven variations that guarantee a discretely multifaceted action. The limits of the experience are represented by the high degree of potential frustration and the general lack of personality of the product, especially in terms of vehicle and track design. Let's go in order: WipEout has always been a difficult and potentially frustrating game, one in which one wrong maneuver is enough to jeopardize an otherwise perfect session, but in the case of Death Road our spacecraft could tip over after a collision and lose further precious time. What's the problem? Well, the fact that the opponents will always try to trigger such an eventuality with systematic ramming, when they are not busy targeting us using their own weapons. ThereFurthermore, the presence of numerous obstacles on the track will make life really difficult for us and we will rarely be able to exploit it to our advantage. As for the quality of the design, where the technical sector works properly, with 1920 x 1080 pixel graphics running at 60 frames per second (on the test configuration) without sparing some interesting visual effects, unfortunately there is a lack of direction high-level artistic, and this can be seen both in the aesthetics of the nacelles, rather banal, and in the conformation of the tracks, unable to excite due to excessive linearity.", "date": "2012-04-17", "grade": "7.4"}
