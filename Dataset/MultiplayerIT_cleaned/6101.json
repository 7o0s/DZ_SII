{"name": "Re:Legend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/relegend-recensione.html", "text": "In a large crowd of titles that try to have their say in the genre of handcrafted life-sims, Re:Legend tries to carve out its own perimeter of action. It does so, it must be said, in the utmost humility, starting from a Kickstarter campaign and then gradually hooking up to a publisher attentive to the indie scene such as the Italians 505 Games. The proposal on the plate, for those who have followed and already tried the title on Steam, is a not too original mix between Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Monster Hunter and Pokemon, without actually having too much in common with all the titles above quoted. Re:Legend is a collage of characteristics, almost a cauldron of pieces that come together to form a curious product. However, history teaches that when there are so many inspirations and the team's ambitions fail to keep track of each element in the best possible ways, the risk is that you put too much iron on the fire, draw a line that points towards simplification and choose, not always consciously, to water down the overall experience a little. We tell you in this review of Re:Legend why we are faced with one of these cases. All off the cliff The part related to monsters is certainly one of the most interesting features of Re:Legend The story of Re:Legend is simple: we are thrown off a cliff into the sea by no one knows who, to wake up on Vikku Island, a pleasant, colorful place with cheerful tropical hues. The situation immediately paints the style that we will find ourselves living within Vikku: anthropomorphic characters with chibi features, just as chibi is our character, created shortly before through a fairly basic editor. Vikku, however, is divided into zones, let's say neighborhoods, each separated in terms of design from the other, a very old school solution in which you have to put up with uploads, geographical losses given by a not too clear map and in general little style in expressing to the player what is in the neighborhood or in another. We are therefore faced with a setting that tastes too much of what has already been seen, almost a graphic tool preset for PC games destined to end up on mobile. This is a bit the general feeling in taking the first steps: if the chibi style, already by itself, focuses on the minimal and the simplification of the models, Re:Legend takes this element a little to the extreme, which in 2022 translates in the need to demand a little more at least on the artistic front. On the other hand, the side characters are nice, at least the offspring of an attempt at personalization that sometimes even makes a smile for the particularity. Apart from this, the surrounding elements are what you expect from an island, therefore the sea, bridges, forests, rocks and flowers, even deserts and much more ... but all quite poor in terms of polygons and not very inspired in terms of level artistic. Farm and Magnus Expect all that sequence of typical elements of the genre such as watering, cultivating, harvesting. If the story of Re:Legend does not shine for the emphasis of the story or the expectations it brings to the player, the gameplay certainly offers more than what has been said so far. As a mix, there is so much to draw from: it goes from the exploration and combat of the first Zelda to Animal Crossing / Harvest Moon for the element of harvesting, gardening, farming and so on, useful for gathering resources for the creation of more . In addition, the team has introduced an ecosystem of monsters to tame and capture, then explore and throw them into battle against other monsters. It must be said that the combat system, quite classic, is also relatively simple: attack and dodge, all at a level of difficulty that remains very low and then rises completely unexpectedly between one quest and another. One of the creatures from Re:Legend The monster element adds a tint halfway between Monster Hunter and Pokemon, in which, however, the experience is clearly just sketchy: the monster must first be beaten, then fed. It's one more thing on the to-do list but again, it's a very superficial and almost brain-dead approach. The same goes for fishing: its gameplay is very simple, it almost does itself. We understand that it is not a fishing simulation, but the problem is that Re:Legend is a set of small factors that make up a pile, but it is a pile in which nothing shines more than enough. There are elements of growth: the RPG component, albeit not particularly deep, it provides evolutions to advance and deal with the proposed fauna, but there is still a lack of a spark that keeps you hooked. Wanting to fly over the bugs related to commands that are not executed and keys in the Tutorials that do not correspond to the real ones, the sense of progression is really too tied to a questionnumber of dynamics already seen countless times, amalgamated by a map with a non-immediate orientation and rather simple, if not immediate, in carrying out. The fishing minigame in Re:Legend As Re:Legend enters a fierce fray of products and similar products, we certainly applaud the ambition to want to combine simulation with exploration and combat, but the result is very modest and goes to address a niche of gamers who must want exactly that type of offer, which does not dig, capable of entertaining more with the potential mass of what could be than with the effective realization of the expectation.", "date": "2022-09-09", "grade": "6.0"}
