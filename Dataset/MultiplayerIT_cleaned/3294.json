{"name": "Dread Nautical", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dread-nautical-la-recensione.html", "text": "Dread Nautical, whose review you are reading, is the latest work by Zen Studios, a Hungarian software house that boasts a curriculum made up almost exclusively of pinball video games. It is therefore surprising to see how the team has chosen a decidedly unconventional path to get out of their comfort zone: instead of focusing on a classic videogame genre or on one of the most popular ones in the current mobile panorama, the developers have committed themselves to an ambitious project and original, which on the basic structure of a turn-based strategy mixes suggestions taken from RPGs and survival, all with an almost contrasting setting and graphic style. Let's find out if the end result represents a significant addition to the Apple Arcade catalog or an excessive gamble. Nightmare cruise Dread Nautical opens with a sequence that introduces the user to the plot of the game: a cruise ship full of tourists is invaded by a mysterious force that transforms almost everyone into tentacled monstrosities, and our protagonist (choose from four different profiles to appearance and abilities) awakens in this unpleasant situation with the aim of finding other survivors and trying to escape the horror. The references to the works of Lovecraft are evident, however Dread Nautical never assumes a well-defined tone, alternating light situations with other dramatic ones in an almost schizophrenic way, and the combination with a cartoonish graphic style only increases the sensation of being faced with a title that under this profile proves to be far too ambiguous to be 100% appreciated. In a certain sense, this tendency to merge influences that are very distant from each other is also reflected in a gameplay that brings together elements that do not always give the impression of linking well with each other. At the base of Dread Nautical there are the typical dictates of a turn-based strategy: isometric view, box movement system, limited slots for weapons and objects and different active and passive skills for each character. With enemies in the vicinity, the game immediately appears familiar to those with a minimum of experience in the genre, with the action points necessary to carry out each move depleted, we helplessly witness the opponent's decisions: the interface is a bit too much dense and the dynamics are not explained very well by the tutorial, but in principle at this juncture the title works very well. Different speech for the exploratory phases, which while maintaining the same setting are really cumbersome and not very stimulating: a significant problem, considering that they occupy a large part of the time spent with Dead Nautical. In fact, the adventure requires the player to cross the 20 decks of the ship not only by facing the monsters (indeed, avoiding clashes is anything but inadvisable) but also and above all by finding and talking to the survivors and collecting food and resources essential to sustain themselves and repair or improve your equipment. Before being able to enlist the passengers still alive in your ranks it is necessary to convince them by filling a special indicator of confidence, weapons and armor are subject to wear and tear and must be developed on the workbench and the food found on a bridge must be rationed at the end of the level among all the members of the group, trying not to leave anyone too short on pain of loss of performance on the battlefield. In short, you end up spending more time rummaging in the containers, navigating the various menus and talking (not always with really exciting dialogues) with the other survivors than managing your party in combat, which is what it looks like for sure best of the package. This and the ambiguous narration we talked about at the beginning are two elements that combine to make it difficult to really fall in love with Dread Nautical, however evident the efforts of the developers to propose something original and although there is nothing really wrong in production. A pity, also considering the valuable technical sector concocted by Zen Studios: beyond a style that you may like or not, the attention to detail and the excellent use of colors is undeniable, as well as the quality of the audio profile that can count on music up to par and on a well done English dubbing.", "date": "2020-01-17", "grade": "7.2"}
