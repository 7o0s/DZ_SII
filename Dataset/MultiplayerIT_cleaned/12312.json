While it is undoubtedly true that stylus and touch screen represent the ideal equivalent of a mouse, this was evidently not enough to awaken from a deep coma a genre that gave birth to masterpieces such as the Monkey Island series, Beneath a Steel Sky , Day of the Tentacle just to name a few. Among the few software houses that have offered products of this type on the very successful Nintendo laptop, Cing figures in the front row, which after the pleasant Another Code: Two Memories, is now back on store shelves again with this Hotel Dusk Room 215. Long live DS The control system is quite original; as in Another Code, even in Hotel Dusk it is necessary to hold the console vertically, like a book. And while the map with a top view of the settings appears on the touch screen, what Kyle sees with his own eyes is reproduced on the second screen, using a 3D graphics engine. For movements, it is sufficient to touch the stylus in the direction in which you want to move to see the protagonist go in that direction. We were talking about the three-dimensional engine; although the DS is certainly not a particularly gifted console in moving polygons, the result is really convincing. The premises are well-kept, very rich in detail and full of objects to interact with, even if only to have a description for its own sake, and the frame rate is more than sufficient; the only real flaw lies in the use, obviously due to technical limitations, of poorly defined and coarse textures, which lead to inevitable blending if you get too close with your gaze. Alongside this solution for the setting, the graphic designers have chosen to create the characters in two dimensions and with a rather original style, as if they were drawn in pencil, in black and white. A truly classy and effective design choice, which makes Hotel Dusk overall aesthetically excellent and endowed with great personality. The sound is also good, with very spot on musical themes. And as far as longevity is concerned, unlike Another Code here to see the final screen it will take around ten hours of play, knowing full well that once the adventure has been completed it will be very difficult to find the stimuli to start it all over again. Comment Hotel Dusk Room 215 undoubtedly represents a big step forward for Cing compared to the immature Another Code: Two Memories. With an excellent aesthetic component and a very intriguing atmosphere, the adventure of the protagonist Kyle Hyde is however a product not without defects and, above all, dedicated only to players willing to agree to spend most of their time reading dialogues rather than solving puzzles and riddles. Yes because on balance Hotel Dusk is more of an ~interactive book~, a product based on the plot and on the characters, with a slow and reflective pace. If this description tickles your appetites, the purchase is undoubtedly more than recommended. Pros Great characterization Intriguing storyline Great graphics Cons Unbalanced: too much reading and too few puzzles Game over for wrong answer Noir mon amour Although it therefore actually belongs to the same genre, Hotel Dusk is a very different product than the aforementioned Another Code. The programmers have in fact chosen to completely change the atmosphere, this time giving life to a noir detective adventure set in the early 70s. The protagonist is a certain Kyle Hyde, a former New York agent who, due to a serious episode involving his colleague and friend Bradley, saw his life quickly fall apart. Depressed, alcoholic, lonely, he has become a door-to-door salesman of household products; and just for work, the grumpy Kyle was sent to the Hotel Dusk, waiting for a package to receive. This is only the incipit of the story told by Cing, a very interesting plot, which unfolds step by step between the corridors and the hotel rooms; yes because everything takes place inside the Dusk hotel, which becomes the scene of the events and above all a meeting place with a dozen secondary characters. Each of these, between employees and simple guests, brings with it stories and secrets that Kyle will find himself listening to, initially despite himself, given his willingness to complete the job and go home as soon as possible. But reality soon turns out to be ironic, and in that place where he thought he would spend only a few hours, he will instead discover something much more important. The adventure created by Cing, we say it immediately, is strongly based on reading; the fundamental part of the game is in fact representedfrom the long dialogues with the various characters, to be followed scrupulously and that it is impossible both to speed up and to skip. If on the one hand this can lead in some cases to curse the exaggerated prolixity of one's interlocutors, on the other it is evident how this choice has allowed the characterization of the same to be developed in an extremely in-depth manner; much more than simple secondary elements for the continuation of the adventure, the characters thus become an integral part of the game, key elements capable of giving rise to authentic feelings of sympathy, resentment, contempt and so on in the player. This result is of extraordinary importance within a product of this type, and which undoubtedly represents one of the strong points of Cing's work. It is a pity therefore to see how what could potentially have been a great game is reduced by the lack of balance of which it is the victim. In the face of such a successful plot and cast, the backbone of the adventure appears rather subdued, or rather the series of puzzles and puzzles created by the Japanese team. The problem, fortunately, is not in their absurdity; on the contrary, all the puzzles present in Hotel Dusk are coherent, and reaching the solution is a pure matter of reflection. What is sad is that their number is simply not sufficient, so much so that one often gets the impression that they represent the exception between one dialogue and another, instead of the norm. And the possibility, far from rare, of reaching the game over screen only for a wrong answer is also very irritating, with the consequent need to reload your save. And by ~wrong answer~ we don't mean confiding in the hotel owner about one's will to carry out a terrorist attack, but maybe just being a little too angry with another guest who inadvertently opened the package destined for us...", "date": "2007-05-04", "grade": null}
