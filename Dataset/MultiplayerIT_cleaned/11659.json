{"name": "Gothic 3 - The Beginning", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gothic-3-the-beginning.html", "text": "The answer, we say it right away, is negative: Gothic 3: The Beginning does not represent the mobile turning point of the genre that HandyGames was proclaiming in the development phase. Let me be clear, the JoWood production is one of the most successful experiments in this sense, but still remains afflicted by all that series of endemic problems concerning the creation of an RPG for mobile phones. But let's start from the beginning: Gothic 3 is an adaptation of the popular PC series, which puts the user in the role of Xardas, tasked by the deity Innos to recover a series of runestones with magical powers. As required by the RPG tradition, at the beginning of the adventure it is possible to establish the orientation of the character, framing him as a warrior, archer or magician: as you progress, then, the various level-ups will be an opportunity to increase values such as strength, dexterity and mana, without forgetting the skills concerning the management of the different classes of weapons and the ability to pick locks. Furthermore, if we consider that Gothic 3: The Beginning can count on the beauty of 28 offensive tools and ten types of armor, it is evident that the game is in fact among the most complete and profound ever to appear on mobile phones. The problem, as always, lies in the usability of the product, once again substantially indigestible to the mobile format. To begin with, the HandyGames title has a very slow pace, mainly punctuated by the frequent loading screens which it is necessary to attend; secondly, navigation between the various menus (although better than that offered by similar mobile games) continues to be rather awkward and confusing; finally, the combat system - already cumbersome enough in itself - tends not to go particularly well with the keyboard of a mobile phone, making the user's life more difficult than it should be. Also because Gothic 3: The Beginning is certainly not an adventure suitable for everyone, indeed the HandyGames work could easily give even the most experienced players a hard time. An aspect that must however be included among the merits of the product, together with the general depth of the play structure, including all the elements of ~serious~ RPGs. Sticks on the hands to the developers instead for the quality of the translation of the texts: the original game is in German, and it shows. Technically, however, Gothic 3: The Beginning should be rewarded without particular reservations: the two-dimensional graphics therefore prove to be detailed and full of elements on the screen, while the sound (for a change) offers an accompaniment worthy of the name, with decidedly up to the situation.
