In the case of the title developed by TT Games and produced by Warner Bros., however, we are talking about a real Clash Royale clone, which incorporates both the mechanics and the structure of the Supercell blockbuster by adapting them, however, to a cast of characters and scenarios that come from the rich Star Wars lore. What will come out of this curious mix? Gameplay: The Clone Wars LEGO Star Wars Battles, a clash in full action As mentioned, the gameplay of LEGO Star Wars Battles literally takes up that of Clash Royale (here the review), thus interpreting the MOBA formula in a substantially more immediate and rapid use format. The map develops vertically, in favor of smartphones and there are no main or secondary lanes, but only bases to be destroyed in order to obtain victory. Strictly in online multiplayer, the games can count on a very fast matchmaking, capable of finding us a opponent within seconds. After that it will be up to our tactical skills, our readiness and the power of our troops (which can be improved with double cards and coins, as in the Supercell title), belonging to the Light Side or the Dark Side, to make the difference on the battlefield. In the lower part of the screen there is an energy meter which fills up as the seconds pass and allows you to summon different units, ranging from heroes (the various Luke Skywalkers, Darth Vader, Yoda, Boba Fett, Princess Leia and the Captain Phama) to characters such as Porgs, Rebels, Duros fighters, Stormtroopers standard or incendiary, finally arriving at TIE fighters and Y-Wing. Positioned in the scenario, our warriors will move autonomously towards the closest objective, whether it is of the enemy main base or its towers. The heroes have special abilities subject to cooldowns that can be of great help in resolving battles quickly, but otherwise the rules are exactly the same as in Clash Royale, with the only difference being a wider path and a central tower which increases the range when conquered. Structure LEGO Star Wars Battles, Heroes and standard units face off Even on the structure front, the similarities with the Supercell title are many, even if in the case of LEGO Star Wars Battles the maps that can be unlocked by leveling up are many more and once again they draw on the rich lore of the film saga: yes starts from Jakku and then arrives at Endor and gradually visits other planets: Geonosis, Hoth, Takodana, Kashyyyk, Naboo and Kamino, with further settings to come. The feeling is that, even in the face of the greater number of locations, the progression is a little slower and more reasoned. It is also interesting to note the implications of the conversion to a premium experience compared to the freemium dynamics of the beginnings, as happened with the aforementioned Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls (here the review). Specifically, unlocking chests can be speeded up just by playing the game, and you get quite a bit of hard currency with which to buy cards and Heroes. Technical realization LEGO Star Wars Battles, the battle rages in the central part of the map The LEGO series has a long tradition now, with consolidated aspects that we also find in LEGO Star Wars Battles. In the context of the battles there is obviously no space to represent in any way the typical humor of the franchise, but the animations related to the construction of the towers and in general the design of the units is exactly as we expected: excellent. The impact of the scenarios is less brilliant, more than anything else because they are limited precisely to being the background to the clashes. The soundtrack once again takes up the music of John Williams and effectively adapts it to the context, from the options screens to the game itself, but in general it is the whole sound sector that appears well cared for and exciting for Star Wars fans. Finally, it is possible to play using a Bluetooth controller, but the touch controls are excellent and you will hardly want to take advantage of this possibility.", "date": "2021-09-29", "grade": "8.0"}
