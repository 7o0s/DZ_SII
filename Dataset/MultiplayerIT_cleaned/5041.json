Despite being a very concrete team, capable of creating solid and complex titles such as Arma, it has shown that it does not have great product management skills in the long run. The 3D interfaces of the various instruments/vehicles are outstanding DayZ players have been waiting since December 2013 to get the title they paid for, but in the meantime the updates have become more smoky and the way to go before seeing the 1.0 release is still long. We're not talking about a game with a few thousand copies, but one that has sold more than three and a half million. At Take on Mars, things were much worse: launched in a decent state for Early Access, it sold a few tens of thousands of copies. There have been updates, but finally Bohemia has decided to close it, launching a final version that is unfortunately in a pitiful state. Could it improve by lengthening the development time? Of course, but calculate that Take on Mars has also been around since 2013... the truth is that Early Access, from a way to raise funds to complete the development of a game, has become a parking lot for long-gestating products, which they end up never really concluded so as to lengthen their commercial life. When the commercial life isn't there, then that's the trouble. It's not always so bad, but now there are numerous cases of curtains falling too soon and it would be appropriate to start thinking about it, to perhaps impose limits on the developers, so as to avoid unpleasant situations. Take on Mars is an amazing simulation of Mars and all the bugs you can imagine Mars and its derivatives As we said, Take on Mars has been around since 2013. It is a product designed for a small niche of players, which simulates the early stages of the conquest of Mars. The game is divided into two campaigns: in the first you drive robotic scientific instruments, such as rovers and various probes, with which you have to study the surface of the red planet. It is a very slow and in its own way fascinating phase, although it requires great patience. Building a base is complex and rewarding You need oxygen to survive In the second you take on the role of an astronaut engineer, called Mark Willis, who must be able to survive after his mission was wiped out during the landing. Here we can already detect one of the problems that Take on Mars had in the development phase: it was initially thought of as a simulator, and was therefore focused on the reconstruction of the more strictly scientific part of the first approaches to the red planet. Over time the original project was somewhat marginalized to introduce more trendy sandbox survival mechanics, which Minecraftized it quite a bit. So now the activity most practiced by players is not the discovery of Mars, but its actual colonization. Crafting and building construction systems have been introduced over time, all explained in Willis' campaign missions, fully focused on his struggle for survival. The scientific campaign remains, but is in fact secondary to the other, which acts as a driving force for all the other modalities. Playing them in sequence they almost seem to come from two different titles, although some elements of the scientific one return in the survival campaign. If desired, it is also possible to completely ignore the campaigns and focus on the scenarios, i.e. individual missions with specific objectives. The game has a handful of them already included, but if you want you can download more, made by users with the editor included in the game, from the Steam Workshop. In short, there are many contents, as well as several touches of class. Just to give an example, let's mention the different 3D interface depending on the vehicle used (if desired, more traditional screen interfaces can also be used, but they must be selected in the menu). Exploring the surface of Mars, reproduced from real scientific documents, is undoubtedly fascinating. Of course, some operations are really difficult to perform, given that the simulation nature has been taken far too seriously and even moving a single object turns out to be more complicated than expected. However, these are details, in the sense that those interested in Take on Mars will certainly not have big problems due to the excesses caused by the accuracy of the simulation. Take on Mars takes care of sinking Take on Mars Take on Mars has one major flaw, from which all the others stem: it's not really finished. It is closed, of course, but it lacks a lot of refinements, starting from the graphics engine, with the shadows that come and gono as they want, going through an endless series of bugs, some of which are very annoying. It's a shame that so much wonder is marred by so many bugs There are really many, too many, starting with crashes that make you go back to the desktop, to get to the rescue system that occasionally eats up the progress made, forcing you to start over. But these are just two of many, too many feasible examples. If you want we can add some campaign missions that go to women of easy virtue because it was decided to try a different approach than the pre-established one (it happens in particular in the survival campaign, the less refined of the two), or others that you can't end because some objects do not want to know how to work, or objects that disappear from the inventory evidently sucked into a passing black hole. Another example of the lack of care given to the game comes from the already described scenarios, which for the most part seem to have been created with great laziness. Proof of this is that they are far worse, and that's no understatement, than some of the ones found in the Workshop. The same goes for the multiplayer maps: few and bland ones included, even missing some of the promised features, some of the amateur ones are better; pity that by now the servers are almost deserted and that it is very difficult to be able to play a complete game online in a decent way. In conclusion, there would still be a lot of work to do on Take on Mars, which seems to have come out of Early Access only formally. Who knows if Bohemia will continue to update it or leave it alone. Always on Mars If you like the ~space simulation~ theme and want to go deeper into it, there are other games that allow you to tackle it. The best is certainly Osiris: New Dawn, which you can always find on Steam and which, although still in Early Access, is in a better state than Take on Mars. Otherwise there would be Space Engineers, also still in Early Access, which offers a very advanced building system.", "date": "2017-02-17", "grade": "5.5"}
