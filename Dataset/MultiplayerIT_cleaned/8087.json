It goes without saying therefore that the here present Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage has the task of continuing on the positive track traced by his predecessor: let's see how it went. Bare chested As can be clearly seen from the title, the part of Cicero in this second DLC is played by Mr. Torgue, founder of the homonymous factory that produces weapons that are as bulky, noisy and explosive as possible: a character who perfectly embodies the company mission, presenting himself like a sort of Hulk Hogan to the nth degree, with a predisposition to the wildest machismo and foul language. This gentleman discovers the existence of a new crypt, which according to legend will only open when Pandora's toughest bone sheds the blood of a coward: a perfect excuse to organize a tournament, the winner of which will claim the right to access the precious loot. Although the premises may suggest the most disappointing expansion of the first Borderlands (the Moxxi's Underdome Riot which was reduced to a set of arenas), Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage represents the demonstration that Gearbox knows how to learn from its mistakes, given that the part linked to the competition, however, it is accompanied by a structure made up of new locations to explore and many missions to complete. The Badass Crater of Badassitude is in fact the hilarious name of the central scenario from which all the activities related to this expansion unfold, with various quests that are bestowed not only by Mr. Torgue but also by well-known faces such as Scooter, Tiny Tina, Moxxi and Sir Hammerlock. As in the tradition of the series, the nature of the objectives is resolved for the most part in reaching a certain point on the map to collect something and/or kill someone, but fortunately everything is supported by a more than appreciable level design and above all by a humor even more over the lines of the already quite extreme standards of Borderlands: beyond the ridiculous excesses of testosterone in the Echoes of the tournament participants, it is precisely the missions that elicit more than a laugh, such as one that requires the user to locate and slaughter a reviewer guilty of having saddled a meager pass to Mr. Torgue's favorite video game. It also doesn't hurt that the enemy presence in the locations of this DLC is generally much more substantial: it's difficult to spend more than a minute without having to shoot something, with bandits, skags, robots and beautiful company literally popping out from all sides . Beyond the canonical game action, Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage offers four distinct challenges that are structurally similar to Moxxi's arenas, except one that is completely devoted to vehicle driving: each of these has three difficulty levels, the last of the which is only accessible to users who have already reached level 50. Since there is no level cap increase, the motivations given to the highest-ranking crypt hunters translate into the generous donation of Torgue tokens given as a reward for these missions: this currency (which is can also collect a minimal amount from some killed enemies) can be spent in the special Torgue distributors, stocked with weapons of great value and whose object of the day is always a very tasty - and very expensive - legendary item. Some may argue that the charm of these elements lies precisely in their hard to find, and that seeing them in a shop's list ruins the ~magic~ that surrounds their discovery a little, but in general it can be safely said that the game worth the candle, also because it is an introduction that does not cause particular imbalances in the playful economy. In short, there is no shortage of content to sink your teeth into, for an expansion that stands on the longevity values expressed by the previous Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty, extending the life of the product by at least eight hours. The icing on the cake is also the presence here of a maximum level boss to be faced to obtain precious seraphic crystals, always dedicated to those who have already reached the threshold of 50. Considering all this, the judgment on Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage is not can only be a good thing, given that the only real flaws of the DLC are pothey can be recognized in a couple of less successful locations and in some boss fights that are a bit lacking in terms of inventiveness. It is therefore an expansion recommended for all Borderlands 2 lovers, as well as a great source of satisfaction for anyone who has trusted Gearbox by purchasing the Season Pass in advance.", "date": "2012-12-26", "grade": null}
