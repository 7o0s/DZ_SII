In the meantime, Bungie has made two episodes, ODST and Reach, sending the protagonist of Halo to the pits also because probably, having chosen to leave Microsoft, someone somewhere must have decided that the real continuation of the saga would be told by others . These others are the guys from 343 Industries, a dream team born directly inside the studios and which has joined Turn10 as a spearhead in the stable that provides, or should provide, the best exclusives for Xbox. A difficult task that would make anyone's legs shake because a lot of things depend on Halo 4. A few weeks ago, we met in Turin to interview Josh Holmes, who is now the creative director of the saga and we understood that things had gone well. He was serene, amused and eagerly awaited the results of a three and a half year journey. The restart One of the aspects on which 343 has decided to work harder to start this new trilogy, is the plot and the techniques used to narrate it. For years, the story told in Halo video games was just the tip of the iceberg, which could only be discovered by those who wanted to read the novels published at the same time. The Master Chief was a silent and faceless character, while the Spartans, to the most inattentive, could only appear as a special unit of the Terran army fighting against the Covenant. With Halo 4 there is a decidedly different register and, if you look at Forward Unto Dawn, the miniseries that introduces the game on Xbox Live, if you finish Halo 4 and continue playing Spartan Ops, you finally get the idea of a rich universe , full of charm and full of stories to be enjoyed through multiple different media. A real colossal in which, for a change, humans are not outcasts looking for some power to assert themselves in the galaxy, but the dominant race against which alien races coalesced under the banner of the Covenant line up in search of revolt or new threats, such as that of the Prometheans who are the substantial addition of the 343 to the Halo universe, complete with a nemesis who will dictate, we presume, the timing of the new trilogy. Requiem is the planet on which the whole game takes place, both on the surface and in the depths and the intention of recreating that sense of adventure that had characterized the first chapter of Halo is pursued and achieved with a great artistic direction and visuals exciting, in several places. Halo 4 is a more adult game than in the past; the Prometheans are darker, less ~talky~ than the grunts and the Covenants, the cut is more serious also helped by the work done on the engine that moves the game. The other novelty, and it is important, is that Master Chief and Cortana talk almost continuously for the whole time of the campaign, which ends at normal between eight and nine hours (we strongly recommend playing at least Heroic, remembering that there are the skulls, all of which can be activated right from the start, which are nothing more than options to alter the difficulty of the game and some elements of the graphic interface), giving depth to their characters, making us understand who is hiding behind the immovable helmet (it will be forever?) and behind that artificial intelligence in the form of a soft woman that fans may end up falling in love with this time around. A girl, a little messed up, who looks to her John (Master Chief) as her boyfriend/bodyguard. A nice idea, which excites and which also brings some sequences in which the two move without enemies to face, giving them time to talk and tell stories. The story goes straight to the final, very open, and more beautiful from a narrative point of view than from a real game, with missions in space (with even a reference to Star Wars) and the introduction even of a MechSuite that the Chief must wear along some of the chapters, eight, which can be played by four at the same time in cooperation. It can be seen that the team moved between tradition and renewal, finding the narrative premise to make old and new enemies, old and new weapons coexist, obtaining a good result, but leaving the feeling that, in front of the ghosts, to the banshees and anti-gravity platforms of the Covenant, iconic of the series, many more innovations could have been introduced, also because the ones that exist work so well. A matter of gameplay This balance is also perceived with regard to the playability of Halo 4 which remains the historical one with the addHowever, the addition of a series of new Armor Abilities, already introduced in Reach, which are justified by the discovery of Promethean technology that the Spartans can graft into the suits. Then there are the thrusters, a visor that allows you to see enemies through objects, the Jetpack and invisibility return, but the only one you'll really want to use in the campaign is a pod that can be called at regular intervals and that works like a flying but stationary turret, which proves to be quite useful especially when playing Heroic or Legendary. The distinctive trait remains the possibility of tackling the maps as one sees fit, without the obligation to ~clean~ each framework managing to reach the exit, except in cases in which it is foreseen by the programmers, and the total freedom of approach and study of situations, thanks to one of the most refined artificial intelligences in circulation. The noticeable difference is that the huge, field maps of Halo 3, the ones in which to indulge oneself, even though they are still there, give way numerically to others, rich in details, especially graphics, but smaller, more linear in which progress is made more frenetic, constituting a choice of field that brings the saga closer to other modern shooters, always according to the narrative. There are terminals to find (with additional cutscenes to view via Halo Waypoint), more hidden items, and a couple of sequences that even feature small quick time events and pace changes like a scramble down an elevator shaft where pieces of spaceship to avoid collapse, immediately at the beginning. However, these gameplay solutions are only hinted at, given that as the levels progress, the game returns to the playability tracks dictated by Bungie at the time, inserted in a higher level of cleanliness and narrative thickness, a positive thing but which leaves one wanting to see what 343 really wants to do with the series in the next few episodes where he can push more innovation. In fact, the new designers know their job, and using Promethean weapons is a pleasure if only for the way they are composed in the protagonist's hand and for the effect they have on shot. For many, it's more fun The multiplayer of Halo 4 is the sector in which the greatest novelties are recorded; precisely in that field which, starting from the second chapter, made the saga take off towards almost identification with Xbox Live, at least until the advent of Call of Duty. The introduction of a layered system derives precisely from the Activision blockbuster: that of Reach allowed to earn only aesthetic customizations which here too are dozens (only for the male and female Spartans however, since you can no longer play the role of Covenant), but now progressively, all the Armor Skills and real perks are unlocked to be installed on the soldier two at a time and ranging from the possibility of running endlessly, to larger inventories for bombs, faster reloading speed, up to to more frequent help in the field. This consists in the possibility, offered to the player every few minutes, to select a pod that falls from above bringing new weapons, bombs or, for example, an extra shield to use in battle. This is part of the whole new online balancing system, given that only the most striking weapons remain to be found on the map, such as the rocket launcher, the hammer and the Covenant sword while the rest of the most effective paraphernalia must be unlocked by playing and accumulating points. After each online game you earn experience points that allow you to activate perks and new weapons, also spending tokens on them that you always accumulate while playing (Spartan Ops games are also valid, but not those for the campaign). Reaching certain points of points, the first step is at 7500 points, new specializations are also activated for the Spartans, which also radically change their appearance. From this point of view, the Challenges become fundamental, objectives present for each game mode, even for the single campaign, which if achieved within the time allowed by the developer with a perennial and always consultable countdown, earn mountains of extra points that are counted at the end of the session. A thickness that was missing to bring the playability of Halo up to date and which, although derived in substance from other titles, gives it substance and continuity, always helped by the thirteen, beautiful maps, which adapt to the different modes both in matchmaking and in custom matches, where the match types go up to twelve different with the introduction of the Flood mode, in which a player infects the Spartans in play by transforming them and giving them a sword and the ability to become invisible. Then one comes outmix, here too, between old and new in which 343 has left a mark starting from an identity that is perhaps untouchable, but with a good attitude and which, as for the other aspects, portends progressive innovation through the next chapters. Then the Forge and the Cinema mode return, while Shootout disappears, which was essentially the Halo version of the Horde of Gears of War, replaced by the Spartan Ops. Every week, for ten weeks, you can download for free if you have an Xbox Live gold account, five new missions and a computer graphics movie that directly continues the story of the single player and which tells of the colonization of Requiem. On the second DVD of the game there are already the first five, each of which lasts about 15 minutes adding more than an hour of gameplay, to be faced alone or in four, and which is articulated on larger maps, bringing back the purity of Halo gameplay. You have to clean up areas of increasingly stronger enemies, in different situations and under the pretext of a story that intrigues and continues. An excellent innovation which, together with the rest of the multiplayer sector, brings the longevity of the title to the levels of a small MMOG with weekly contents which, we are sure, will become an excuse to get together online with friends to see how it goes. finish Halo 4 week by week. Xbox 360 goals Like almost all Microsoft Studios titles, finishing Halo 4 normally, playing it a little online even in cooperative, brings a loot that fluctuates between 400 and 500 points for gamerscore. Getting to the thousand will require playing the legendary legendary mode, finishing the campaign in four players and playing in competitive matchmaking and Spartan Ops. In short, it takes patience, but the hours fly by in this case too and many will try the feat. And technically? Halo 4, to see, is the best Halo ever and one of the best first-person shooters you can play on Xbox 360. There is no doubt. From the engine bequeathed by Bungie, 343 started over, pushing the accelerator on the number of polygons, models and animations. Light effects such as HDR and particles remain one of the hallmarks of Requiem as well, but this time we managed to implement a Full Screen Anti Aliasing system (i.e. the one that allows you to remove the reviled ladders) which gives the imagine a softness never experienced before and that enhances the new design of Master Chief, Cortana, the Prometheans and weapons, which pay clear homage to the talents that have flowed into the development team starting from those Retro Studios that made Metroid Prime for Wii. The levels above the surface, the jungle of Requiem, above all, are the most beautiful, so much so that one would inevitably wish they had taken over those set in the more classic alien structures in which the story takes place. The already mentioned quote from star wars, which brings space missions back into the saga, after the debut on Reach, but here in the canons of a more classic shooter, has a great impact. From the point of view of this fusion between cinema and video game at the base of the project, the quality of the interlude scenes should also be mentioned which, even when created with the game engine, are really of a level, with polygonal models for the characters finally up to par of the best titles on the market, where in the past there was always something to complain about. There was also expectation for the audio sector which, even if it lacks an effective theme like the historical ones of the saga, is of an excellent level, accompanying the whole story with the right emphasis and with a more concise cut than in the past, referring to what , for example, you can hear playing Mass Effect. Halo 4 will be completely dubbed in Italian, as per tradition, but the promo we played for the review only had subtitles and not the voices in our language, forcing us to leave the judgment on the translation pending.", "date": "2012-11-01", "grade": "9.3"}
