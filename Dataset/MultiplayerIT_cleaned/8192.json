The Activision franchise is the emblem of this generation that is coming to an end, that is total serialization, proliferation of DLCs but also and above all a formula that continues to entertain millions of people despite the clamors of the haters scattered around the network. The sign that something could change, while remaining anchored to a granite gameplay, we had it with the first Black Ops two years ago. Treyarch had chosen for the campaign to tell us a story with adult tones, halfway between a psychological thriller and espionage, all in the name of an unsettling clockwork ending. Multiplayer had also received a generous dose of new ideas, both in terms of mechanics and content. This year the American developers have definitely upped the ante, courageously proposing a non-linear campaign with multiple endings and a fundamentally renewed multiplayer sector. Not forgetting a zombie mode which, although far from being a real campaign, has increased exponentially. But let's go in order. Everything can change As with the review of the first Black Ops, even now it is impossible to summarize the plot of the game without falling into spoilers. We have a ~bad guy~, Menendez who went from a simple drug boss in the 80s to being the arbiter of the fate of the world almost forty years later, in 2025. It will be he who will be able to light the fuse of the third world war between the United States and China. His motivations are ancient. His hatred of the United States seems to go beyond geopolitical differences. But here we stop, we are getting too close to the danger zone. The story written by David Goyer, the man to whom we owe the screenplay among others of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the next Superman, stages with continuous leaps between the ~real~ and future cold war, the incessant hunt of the CIA to Menendez. For this reason, as Mason senior, we face the battlefields of the so-called proxi wars, i.e. the ~proxy~ wars that saw the Americans and Soviets engaged through secondary actors, fighting in Angola, Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Panama. In 2025 the war arrives at home, but not before, for example, crossing paths with the ISI, the notorious Pakistani secret service and making a nice foray into Burmese territory. But even here it is better not to go further in telling the world tour of Mason junior and the grumpy Harper. The structure of the campaign is therefore similar to that of the first chapter, but Treyarch shuffles the cards on the table with an unprecedented crossroads system which, thanks to the multiple endings and the countless junctions scattered throughout the over seven hours of play (on normal difficulty) makes us talk about a really high replay value for the title. An anecdote is more effective than a thousand explanations to tell the complex narrative path set up by American kids. Call of Duty: Black Ops II was tested in a long review session in London where all the European press was able to try the game simultaneously. Once the campaign was over, a good discussion was born to verify the gaming experiences with the other journalists present. We have very often made different choices, seen different endings and have embarked, more or less consciously, on divergent paths of narrative progression. When we then asked Treyarch for guidance, we discovered that in many situations we could have chosen to do things not immediately recognizable. In practice there is no ~good~ or ~bad~ ending, but different nuances between one and the other that change the final outcome and which will probably influence the third chapter. How did this come about? In some moments, which we could define as topical, we are asked, for example, whether or not to kill someone, and this will obviously have a tangible impact on the next mission, whether normal or Strikeforce. Sometimes, however, there are no obvious signs of these bifurcations, it is as if we were taking a road without seeing the intersection. To make everything even more structured in terms of writing, if you are attentive to the dialogues it is possible to momentarily deviate from the main objective to obtain additional information on the mission or on the characters and this can facilitate us or perhaps make the next choice more difficult having a more clear point of view on what we are doing and how everything is evolving. This is the strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Most missions don't have a unique goal. The pace is very high, the twists never fail, and often they change completely during the course, completely overturning what was playedate previously. A dizzying succession of truly unsettling characters and situations that can almost leave you dumbfounded in the early stages, but only at the end, whatever it is, you will have a clear and sharp picture of the situation. It being understood that in some moments it can be difficult to understand the complex plot and the multiple branches of the plot. In some ways the events are less ~fascinating~ than those of Black Ops, on the other hand the story, the one with a capital S here is less strong and less impactful (few will know Noriega and the Iran-Contra scandal) but to the advantage of a story that keeps us glued throughout the game, never banal and that amazes for its inventiveness, hardness and variety of situations. In short, given the impossibility of overturning the key mechanics of the franchise from the foundations, the choice to push hard on the narrative sector is a sign that Treyarch did not want to create the usual war FPS. If the American boys had already made this drift clear with the first Black Ops, now they have succeeded in changing the rules of the game. Obviously we are not talking about something original in an absolute sense but, in view of the genre to which it belongs and of the series as a whole, we are faced with something that almost marks an evolutionary step, a big step forward to go beyond the usual shoot shoot. Just the way you want At a purely gameplay level, there are two major innovations of the title. The most important one is the inclusion of Strikeforces. This type of level, available only for a few ~rounds~ after some missions, is conceptually similar to a sort of real-time strategy game to be played (if you like) in first person. They are not just a way to vary the classic routine of the title, but will have a significant impact on the continuation of the story, whether completed successfully or failing miserably. From this point of view, it is good not to underestimate them, perhaps discouraged by a cumbersome and not very functional unit command system, because in the end everything contributes to the final outcome. Pad in hand, with mechanics similar to the last Driver, it is possible to freely enter and exit all the assets and soldiers present on the battlefield from a satellite view, also giving basic orders to the troops, in an extremely free way. The only obligation is to take into consideration the objectives to attack or defend depending on the mission. Unfortunately the interface and the chronic slowness of the units cannot immediately compete with those of the ~real~ RTS, the impression is that it is better to fight in first person and not rely on artificial intelligence which here discovers all its intrinsic limits. Also because the missions have a time limit and it is objectively more fun to pilot, for example, small armored ground drones than to see them move at a snail's pace on the battlefield. In short, the Strikeforces work more on a narrative level than on actual gameplay, but they undoubtedly contribute to making the game as varied as possible. The second way to vary the action is by choosing your arsenal. Just like in multiplayer, before each mission we can choose our loadout. Chapter after chapter, new weapons, optics, grenades and so on are unlocked, while by overcoming challenges it is possible to acquire real perks that allow us, for example, a more stable aim, higher reload speed, more sprint, more damage and much more . Among these, available immediately, is the access kit. In missions it is possible to find new weapons such as rifles, Molotov cocktails, animal traps, but also drones, automatic turrets and decoys to confuse enemies only if you have this sort of ~universal Swiss Army knife~. Chests, storage rooms or terminals therefore become clearly visible on the battlefield, allowing us to expand our attack or defense strategy. Obviously this is not a feature that changes the face of the game, but it is pleasant to see how Treayarch wanted to insert another variable to take into consideration, all on the altar of extreme replayability. Larger massacres But what are our impressions of the game? The first thing you notice is that Call of Duty: Black Ops II is a very violent title. In the very first minutes Treyarch spares us nothing, fire is the protagonist, and then opens the dance with a gigantic massacre, which almost makes us ask ourselves a few questions whether it is appropriate to lightly recount such recent events. More generally, Treyarch spares nothing, splatter often appears in the game. The quality of the missions is very high and as previously written, the variety of approaches and situations is not lacking. The repertoireio is the usual, frenetic, cinematic and pyrotechnic one of the franchise, but perhaps more compact and inventive than usual. To broaden the feeling that there is much more to do there is the general enlargement of some levels and the marked general verticalization. The notorious ~rails~ are always present, especially indoors, but in some situations, even a huge single map is ventured, as in the Afghan mission, in which to move freely choosing the path. More generally, between weapons and accessories to find and numerous defiles and secondary routes, the feeling is that the single approach to get to your destination has been completely avoided. With the obvious plus of crossroads, choices and challenges to be overcome to obtain the various perks to equip. All the futuristic gadgets that you can use also increase the variety rate of the game exponentially. Very intelligently the developers have decided not to rotate everything on the use of the same: it can be safely said that they are simply one more possibility and not, except in rare cases, the necessary tool to move forward. In this sense, the game pushes us to try as many rifles as possible on the battlefield, each of which is significantly different from the others, to be chosen carefully according to the situation. But where Call of Duty: Black Ops II gives way to criticism is in the level of difficulty and artificial intelligence. The title must necessarily be played on a difficult level. The normal latitude challenge, for a good half you can almost safely run towards the next trigger. By raising the challenge rate, the damage from the opponents increases and we are really forced to take advantage of the level design, avoiding being out in the open and moving from cover to cover as much as possible. Artificial intelligence therefore shows all its criticalities if we don't want to test ourselves. When the spaces widen it is not uncommon to come across enemies impaled in the open or who casually leave the covers assigned to them. This is much less evident in the indoor sections, with the opponents defending themselves more effectively, but even here a couple of times we noticed soldiers intent on aiming the wall for a long time and with great satisfaction. Fortunately, however, their number is always very high, they also have a good aim and above all they throw grenades profusely. Multi bodied and deep The other sector where Treyarch wanted to work a lot with a view to renewal is multiplayer. There are two key sectors: the customization of your arsenal and team play. Everything therefore revolves around the equipment system called Pick 10 and the great importance given not so much to the single kill as to the ~cooperative~ score for the achievement of support actions, here called Scorestreak. When creating a class you have ten slots available, to be filled at will. Each piece of your loadout has a ~weight~, displayed visually in base ten. Once the ten tenths are exceeded, we can do nothing but eliminate something, replace it with something else and so on. The interesting thing is that everything contributes to reaching the threshold, not only weapons, optics or bombs, but also the perks. Leveling up unlocks an item pack, weapons, grenades, wildcards or the same perk, but the game only gives us one unlock token, for one item only. Furthermore, all weapon upgrades are unique and each gun must therefore be specialized to make everything available. It is therefore understandable how the game pushes you to experiment as much as possible and at the same time, thanks to the tokens, to choose carefully what to ~buy~. The Pick 10 gives us extreme freedom, it's enough just not to exceed ten elements, and as if that weren't enough to make the system even deeper, the aforementioned Wildcards give us the possibility to bend the rigid equipment system. They too ~weigh~, but allow us to have for example a third accessory on the primary weapon, to add one or more perks, to double the grenades, or even to use a second primary weapon as a secondary. A very vast system, therefore, it is impossible to unlock everything once you reach the level cap. So making several laps between the ten Prestiges is necessary. The Pick 10 makes even more sense from the perspective of Call of Duty: Black Ops II's incentivized team play. All the actions that take place in the game, especially in the objective game modes, earn us a score, as the score increases, the twenty-two Scorestreaks become available, which can also be unlocked using the token. The difference from simply accumulating kills is clear. They range from the inexpensive UAV for 350 points to the swarm of Hunter Killer drones costing ben", "date": "2012-11-13", "grade": "9.2"}
