So, if you don't want to get ahead of yourself, don't read on. Speaking of Fragments of Him it is easy to remember the five phases of mourning theorized by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kbler Ross. But let's not focus too much on the stages themselves (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance), but on ~it comes easy~. The game begins with Will, the ~Him~ of the title, having a car accident in which he dies. We are in London, in an unspecified year. The event is told in a dry way, through thoughts and pieces of the character's everyday life, which we are made to follow right into his car. Until the accident there are no direct references to death, which comes suddenly and unexpectedly. All the interaction techniques that will make up the entire game are already present in this first phase. In reality it is simply a matter of going around the rooms by clicking on the highlighted objects, to activate the next memory. There are no puzzles to solve, no obstacles of various and possible nature to overcome. The idea expressed by the relationship between the interactions and the story is quite clear and refers to those ~fragments~ evoked by the title which become the fulcrum of the whole experience. A person's life cannot be recalled in its entirety, that is, its entire flow cannot be reproduced, but it can be reworked through some significant moments that are part of the experience of those who have remained. Those who are no longer here can only find expression in the memory of others, because their existence has inevitably become silent. In fact for the whole adventure, apart from the death sequence, which effectively ~turns it off~, Will's point of view is never taken, but always that of people who have been close to him: his grandmother Mary, the 'ex girlfriend Sarah and her partner Harry. We reviewed the interactive story Fragments of Him: find out what it's like and whether it's worth playing What a good boy Will was! The idea of others as the only mirror of our lives is used a lot by the contemporary arts and the attempt by Sassybot, the development team, to make it into a video game is remarkable in its own right. Usually we are not used to dealing with topics such as mouse in hand. So, from this point of view, the mere fact that Fragments of Him exists is its plus point. But let's go back to that ~it comes easy~ we were talking about at the beginning of the article, which however requires a further premise. Obviously the pieces of Will's life with which we come into contact are not only useful for the characters who remember them to mourn, but also for us, the users, to get to know the person who is the object of the drama in which we have been called to participate. For example, from grandmother Mary we learn that it was she who raised Will due to the absence of his reckless parents and that initially the woman had not accepted his homosexuality. Will of his was a thoughtful boy, always ready to side with the weakest in his school years, even if he hid some typical childhood fears. Sarah, the ex-girlfriend from her university days, tells us instead of how kind she was and introduces us to the discovery of her true sexuality, which took place during their love story. From here we go straight to Harry, who is responsible for the story of Will's present, i.e. the effective representation of the void left by his loss, which is expressed in the manipulation of shared places, told first in the sequence of the accident, then in sequences of connection between the stories of the other characters. The problem that overwhelmingly emerges while attending this theatrical performance in virtual form, whose fragments are carved into the space of memories, is that despite the iron will to be part of it, we too often find ourselves evaluating its excessive caption. The fragments of Will, which should give us back his being not in its entirety, but in its humanity, instead show us a one-dimensional character, despite the great changes and dramas that have occurred in his life are repeatedly fed to us. Better: those who talk about him tell it in a flat and predictable way, often using tones that are too sophisticated and never managing to go beyond discourses of average civilization, which end up cooling any possible emotional impulse towards the character and his story. In short, we are not criticizing the fact that Will had a conventional life, but that this was represented by his friends as if it were a painful catalog of clichs, which continually combines an alleged lyrical pathos with everyday life, without ever attempting to go morebottom. Didactic The final impression is not so much that of being faced with characters who are mourning the loss of a loved one who has left an indelible mark on their lives, but of attending the illustration of the phases by Elisabeth Kbler Ross, remember at the beginning of the article, on which the stories of affected and unnatural characters are framed. It is here that ~it is easy~ to grasp the meaning of Fragments of Him, reaffirmed by each dialogue in each sequence, more or less explicitly. It is more complicated to get rid of the feeling of having witnessed a big false narrative, which never derails and limits itself to following the institutional tracks of genre stories, becoming too hasty on the finale. Let's say that if the phases of denial, anger and negotiation take their right time, depression gives way to acceptance too suddenly, with moments that are not exactly very effective, also due in part to the type of interactions proposed. The problem is that the player never really participates in Will and, therefore, fails to fully experience Harry's drama, which would have required a different representation, given that it takes place in reality, i.e. after passing the phase of memories. Instead the gameplay remains uniform losing much of its effectiveness. It is a pity that the stylistic intuition visible in the graphics has been wasted, made up of the grays of figures fighting to find their own form and others that do not go beyond being decorative silhouettes of a psychic universe projected elsewhere, which involves them only as faceless and nameless presences of something that was, but that has left no traces in the memories. Noteworthy are some passages such as the visual construction of the fairy tale read by the grandmother to Will, or the escape of the same in front of the discovery of Will's relationship with Harry, just as the soundtrack is remarkable. Too bad that ~Him~ is forgettable.", "date": "2016-05-11", "grade": "5.0"}
