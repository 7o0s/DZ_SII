{"name": "Virtua Fighter 5 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-fighter-5-recensione_a.html", "text": "The fighting game genre, sorry to say, has undergone a slow but constant decline over the last few years, in terms of popularity, to the point of often carving out only a niche in the market in terms of sales. So much so that developers have increasingly turned towards the form rather than the actual substance, to try to stem this phenomenon. The Virtua Fighter series has always been far from this trend, a real three-dimensional symbol of the lovers of this genre, who have chosen the effort born of Sega AM 2 as a real cult phenomenon, a production towards which to exhibit almost some reverential respect. The fifth chapter lands on Xbox 360 after its debut, a few months ago, on PlayStation 3, taking up its solid foundation and integrating it with the improvements of the latest arcade incarnation and adding anti-aliasing and the much-needed online mode. Virtua Fighter 5 brings back the whole team of wrestlers that we got to appreciate in the fourth chapter, with the addition of two new entries: El Blaze, a Mexican athlete with spectacular moves and a close relative of this Rey Mysterio (for lovers of Wrestling ), and Eileen, a Chinese fighter with a lot of strength and agility. As previously mentioned, the strengths of this game lie precisely in the most important aspect, that of the gameplay, and this fifth chapter is no exception. The keys assigned to direct action are the usual three, with the square for the guard, the triangle or x for the punch and the circle for the kick. These will be combined with each other to perform the most lethal combos and, together with the movement arrows, to perform dodges or other blows. In this regard, the first introduction that we have noticed is the so-called ~offensive mode~, a new type of dodge that also allows you to position yourself next to your opponent and thus start a new move. Other novelties reside in the modification of various offensive combos of the characters, which will therefore have to be memorized again, and greater speed in some situations of the action, above all as regards the movements on the horizontal axis. Even the proportion between the various characters appears more realistic, with marked differences between the wrestlers of different size and speed, characteristics aimed at a greater balance between all the contenders. If we want, these changes also make the Sega fighting game a tad bit more accessible for the less experienced, but these good intentions collide with a training mode, here called Dojo, rather restricted when compared, for example, with the Evolution version of the fourth chapter. In Virtua Fighter 5 the possibility of carrying out the shots in sequence, displaying the list or pressing the keys with relative marked time and sparring partner who will perform the actions set by us has remained, but the part dedicated to the more advanced tutorial has practically disappeared. in which the less accustomed user could train by replicating the moves shown on the video and taking part in some specific tests such as completing a certain number of combos in a given amount of time and so on. In any case, if you are looking for an extremely technical fighting game, difficult to master but which gives a lot of satisfaction as it is assimilated, Virtua Fighter is for you. In this regard, it is advisable to purchase a more suitable control system for the occasion, thanks to the two alternatives proposed by Sega itself and by Haori, with joysticks equipped with a knob and buttons very similar to those present in the arcade. Fortunately, the technical component is not lacking to support such a solid game structure, especially as regards the animations and the creation of the characters, also in this case at the top of the category. Each move has natural and convincing animations, the response to commands is always precise, also thanks to the frame rate, always anchored to sixty frames per second. The modeling of the fighters is equally valid, with an excellent realization of the muscles and of all the clothes. To make everything decidedly more realistic, we think about the excellent lighting system and the work done by the Sega programmers regarding the projection of shadows on the characters, thanks to self and soft shadowing techniques that also allow surrounding objects (such as trees of cherry of a particular stage) to project the shadows on the various fighters. Compared to the PS3 version, this new edition boasts the activation of antialiasing which gives it an even higher image cleaning. The scenarios, almost twenty, are instead less impressive, in fact they shine by definition and use ofthe colors, but not letting them cry out for the complexity or animated elements that compose them. In addition to the aforementioned Dojo training mode, it is possible to face the classic arcade one through a sequence consisting of seven challenges that lead to the final battle with the historic boss of the saga, Dural. At this juncture it is possible to create and then save one's own profile, and associate it with a particular character in order to memorize the calculation of victories and defeats. Unfortunately, the arcade mode does not offer many stimuli in terms of objectives, a problem partially solved by the one called Quest Mode, in which it will be possible to compete in various virtual arcades against opponents of varying difficulty and modeled on real Japanese gamers, complete with costumes and different combo sequences. Occasionally the player will be invited to participate in some tournaments and at the end of each successful match you will be able to earn money, items and points to rise in rank. These last factors are linked to the possibility of being able to customize, aesthetically, almost all aspects of the fighters, starting from the hair cut up to earrings, costumes and some decidedly extravagant objects. Obviously the most interesting ones will require a good amount of virtual money, and therefore it will be necessary to try a lot in the quest mode. The last two modes reside in the classic player against player and in the VF.TV, in which we will be able to view some (few) videos, the computer-generated demos of all the fights and the saved replays, a feature unfortunately only available in clashes between human opponents. The problems of Virtua Fighter 5 start precisely from the number of modes present, which marks a step backwards compared to the fourth chapter, compensated in the Xbox 360 version by the inclusion of the much coveted online mode. In ranked matches, the winner is the one who wins 3 rounds of 45 seconds, with no setting to change except whether or not to have the ringout, since you can't even decide the setting in which to fight. The structure is like that of the offline Quest mode with a ranking to climb by earning points by winning fights and also obtaining points to spend on fighter customization. The most positive thing is, at least in our test, the complete absence of lag which makes the experience indistinguishable from the offline one. And this, after all, was the main concern. Bearing in mind that much will depend on the quality of the connection of the player. Dulcis (not so much) in the end, the Artificial Intelligence of the computer-managed opponents seemed to us, especially at low levels, not exactly impeccable, with a fluctuating level of challenge and with the possibility for the player to successfully complete several clashes with an (identical) sequence of a few moves. Comment Virtua Fighter 5, in the opinion of the writer, is the most technical and attractive 3D fighting game on the market, equipped with a lot of substance and an excellent technical support sector, certainly a boon for the so-called ~hardcore~ or hardcore lovers of the genre . The slight graphic improvements and, above all, the inclusion of the much desired online mode, make this version a true point of reference for all fans of the saga created by Yu Sukuki.
