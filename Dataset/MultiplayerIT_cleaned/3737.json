{"name": "MLB The Show 19: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mlb-the-show-19-recensione.html", "text": "Even if the past has accustomed us to fierce competition between different titles dedicated to the same sport, the current era instead increasingly places us in front of very few alternatives for fans of the various disciplines, probably due to a generic reduced propensity to run risks in times of economic instability. From this point of view, the MLB The Show series represents the only certainty for those who love baseball, granitically present again this year thanks to the appointment with the review of MLB The Show 19 a few days before the start of the season. While the fascination of American basketball has long been consolidated in our parts too together with that of football (at least on the occasion of the Super Bowl), that of baseball is a show that in Italy we still find it hard to properly appreciate, even if we can still count several fans of this sport. In America the situation is completely different: baseball games are able to fill up the public, leveraging on an atmosphere that for years now has been reproduced in digital form by Sony's San Diego Studio, which for obvious reasons has brought once again MLB The Show 19 exclusively on PlayStation 4. After a week of throwing and batting balls, here's our verdict. The modalities Renewing a successful sports series to make it attractive to its following of fans every year is not a simple task. MLB The Show 19 is no exception, for which however in terms of modalities we can count on some novelties, even if in the case of the more substantial ones they are mainly small changes. Among the new entries, the so-called March to October stands out, a kind of season mode in a reduced version, focused on the outcome of some key moments scattered through the very long series of matches that make up the season (there are a total of 162). This is an addition especially dedicated to those who don't have much time to invest in the game but still want to get to the end of the championship, but also a good way to break away from any more important commitments within the same game. The situations that are proposed to us are of various types: there is for example the match where we are called to overturn an unfavorable result, or the one in which we find ourselves in the role of the closer to bring home the victory. Success allows us to ensure that our team can achieve positive results in simulated matches, thus continuing until the next key moment. Equally interesting on paper but a little less successful in terms of presentation is the Moments mode, thanks to which we can relive moments of baseball history through the protagonists who wrote them, such as the historic victory of the Chicago Cubs in 2016 or the exploits of legendary Babe Ruth. However, compared to March to October, Moments appears a little less successful mainly due to a type of presentation that is not always adequate to the historical context, which is presented to us in the case of older games through a black and white filter applied to those that instead they are the modern stadiums. Then there are the already known modes, starting from the Road to the Show which tries to get closer to the fictional careers seen in other sports games. In this case, the developers' choice was to enrich the budding player with new distinctive features, giving the player greater customization possibilities both in the style of play and in the character of his character. A few minigames outside of the diamond have also been included, making the experience a bit more varied overall. The Franchise mode, on the other hand, is practically unchanged, net of some changes in the contractual management of the team, while Diamond Dynasty continues to be present, the Ultimate Team of MLB The Show which proves to be quite generous in terms of rewards while also relying on microtransactions . Playstation 4 trophies The MLB The Show 19 diamond is accompanied on our consoles by a total of twenty-three Trophies. The usual Platinum, obtainable by unlocking all the others, is joined by seven of the Gold, seven Silver and eight Bronze types. To obtain them all, you must mainly distinguish yourself with particular performances on the pitch, up to making patience a virtue by completing a game without skipping any of the proposed presentations. The gameplay The words spent at the beginning of the previous paragraph obviously also apply to what are the dynamics of MLB The Show 19 once they take the field. Strengthened by what is now a considerable number of years of life, the effort of San Diego Studio can in fact count on a level of cleanlinessalready optimal, on which the development team manages to intervene from year to year, improving something. Finding a revolution in gameplay is also impossible this year, but it is equally impossible not to realize the progress made in the management of players in the defensive phase, for baseball games historically subdued compared to the offensive batting phase. The artificial intelligence of the defenders allows them to take positions in a more realistic way, with the comfort of new animations that make their movements more fluid, although from time to time it is still possible to spot some moments of uncertainty. The defensive ability of the individual player now plays a fundamental role in the possibility of positioning himself correctly to receive balls with a more complicated trajectory, without prejudice to the possibility for the player to make up for any shortcomings of the controlled defender with his own playing experience. For the rest, those familiar with the series will find the dynamics already seen a year ago waiting for them, generally refined where they needed some small intervention. It is still possible to choose between different types of pitches and hits, in order to tailor the entire MLB The Show 19 game experience to your preferences. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view, MLB The Show 19 appears to be one of the most impactful sports titles, in some cases leading those in front of the screen to wonder whether it is a video game or reality. The glance offered by some stadiums is absolutely remarkable, as is the level of effort spent by the developers to properly represent the sacred places where the ~ball game~ takes place. The presence of the aforementioned new animations helps to make everything more realistic, together with the introduction of some shots that give a more television cut to the game action. The only hair in the egg of the graphic sector is represented by the quality of the faces of the players, a little too fluctuating in his passage from champions with perfectly recognizable features to models that could instead have been made in a better way. The trio of commentators made up of Matt Vasgersian, Dan Plesac and Mark DeRosa has also been confirmed for this year, enriched with some lines of dialogue that do not, however, make the defects detected a year ago completely disappear. A welcome addition is that of Heidi Watney on the sidelines, especially when she comes to present the matches in the March to October mode.", "date": "2019-04-04", "grade": "8.5"}
