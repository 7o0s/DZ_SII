The Sony Pictures game connects to the film series with regard to the reference universe and the recovery of some historical characters, such as the protagonists Agent J and Agent K, who still find themselves having to save the Earth from angry aliens. There's not much more to report regarding the story of the game, which doesn't exactly stand out for a powerful narrative but also doesn't need much considering it's a shooter composed of short missions focused on aiming ability . From this point of view, the fact of leaning on a well-known series with an already well-characterized and established imagery is a good move to provide a structure to a title built in this way, therefore it is understandable how the license has been recovered for give consistency to the game mechanics rather than the other way around. It is in fact a positive procedure, from a qualitative point of view: rather than exploiting a license in sight at the moment of maximum commercialization (as could have happened during the release period of one of the films), in this case it is a matter of giving greater consistency to a project that started to simply be a game rather than a marketing operation. In fact, mechanically Men in Black: Galaxy Defenders works well, although it is inherently repetitive in the long run: however, its problem emerges in the classic free-to-play monetization, which in some respects takes on an almost predatory tone if you see for example the cost of the Battle Pass and the way it is offered to players, or the progression mechanism that requires the constant purchase of new weapons to face the next levels. The title is basically free and can also be played without spending anything, but it soon becomes a sort of obstacle course to avoid paying a few taxes. Provided that the purchase of a package every now and then as support for developers is also considered right, the need to see advertisements to collect the daily bonus becomes a bit excessive, or the questionable subscription that starts as a free trial and then imposes the payment of 7 euros per week for the Battle Pass. These are choices that are now widespread in the mobile market, but which continue, invariably, to remain indigestible. Raise your hands and all flippers Men in Black: Galaxy Defenders is a rail shooter with characteristics that closely resemble the classics of the genre such as Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, therefore characterized by a strongly arcade, light and dynamic mechanics, rather distant from the tactical implementations of certain games of the genre . In the role of Agent J or Agent K, under the direct command of the legendary pug Frank, who in the meantime must have made his way up the ranks of the organization, we find ourselves undertaking various missions within some settings, each divided into various progressive levels and with timed events. Each mission sees us enter different scenarios, outdoors or indoors, and eliminate the enemies in the shortest possible time, trying not to suffer too much damage and not to hit hostages or innocent people who may be inside the area . The gameplay therefore takes place in the classic style of the light gun shooter: the movement of the character is automatic, as is the shot (at least as regards the scripted movements), while the player is responsible for moving the viewfinder through the movement of the finger on the touch screen and the ability to fire. The situations are typical of the genre: it is a question of being fast and precise, trying to hit the enemies possibly in the head or in their weak points, avoiding hitting the hostages and possibly exploiting some objects of the scenario to one's advantage, such as explosives and other elements conveniently scattered around. It is an old and evergreen mechanic, which also in this case does not fail the objective, presenting fun challenges although always very limited in terms of game depth and duration. The missions are in fact very short, almost lightning-fast, presenting some progressive waves of enemies and running out within a few minutes, designed to be in line with a fragmented mobile use. In this sense, the idea is functional, but the level design obviously suffers from excessive simplification and tends to substantially repeat the same situations, aggravating the tendency towards monotony that is already inherent in this type of shooter. This is mitigated in parfrom the variety of weapons that is typical of the world of Men in Black, which also determines slightly different game situations, passing from the short-range shooter to the sniper rifle, up to the indiscriminate fire of the most powerful ~cannons~. weapon handling represents another weakness in the overall balance of Men in Black: Galaxy Defenders. To advance from mission to mission it is essential to acquire new weapons and upgrade them, which brings out the mechanism of grinding and pay to win (non-competitive, in this case), given that obviously large shortcuts open up in case you switch to 'purchase with real money. On the other hand, the technical realization is remarkable, which presents quite complex and detailed 3D scenarios, even if very limited in terms of variety given the continuous recycling of the settings. Obviously the fact of having the pre-set movements greatly facilitates the work of the graphic system.", "date": "2020-03-18", "grade": "6.8"}
