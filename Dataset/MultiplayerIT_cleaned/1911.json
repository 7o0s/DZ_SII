{"name": "Combat Flight Simulator 3 - Battle for Europe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/combat-flight-simulator-3-battle-for-europe.html", "text": "Big news on the horizon Let's say right away that the game has many new features compared to the previous chapter, starting with what represented one of the weak points of the second episode, the campaign mode. If you remember in CFS 2 the missions were of a branched and predefined type and therefore it was only up to us to complete the pre-established path until the end of the campaign, well this will be just a pale memory. The campaign mode of CFS 3 is the most complex I've ever seen on a game like this, let's see its features together. Big news on the horizon In practice, after having chosen some initial parameters, such as nationality, age and type of piloted aircraft, one is sent to a screen that represents the whole front and where a marked line shows itself, indicating the position of the clashes and where it is possible to act to carry out a mission. The missions vary according to the moment and the type of box selected (sea, city or countryside) and are of various types (escort, air cover, bombardment, etc. etc.) and once our choice has been made, we just have to take part in the briefing and start our flight. The result of our mission will be essential to advance the front line and thus turn the conflict in our favor. In this regard, I would like to remind you how the choice of place to act is important for the success of the campaign. But that's not all! In fact, at the end of each mission, we will acquire credits based on the goodness of our result, which we can then spend to change aircraft. In addition to the beautiful campaign mode, there are two other game modes, one that creates our customized fast mission, thanks to a couple of skilful clicks and the other reserved for online play. In short, on this aspect CFS 3 proves to be absolutely exceptional. A well polished aircraft The amount of aircraft that can be flown is extremely vast and is enhanced by the presence of some of the most extravagant aircraft of the Second World War, such as the fast ME 262 or the incredible Gotha Go 299. I still haven't said that the aircraft present are not only fighters, but we will even be able to fly light aircraft such as the Ju 88 (in some of its variants) or the very famous B-55, in short, some of the most interesting aircraft of the period. Their graphic realization is simply exceptional, above all I was struck by the beautiful reflection effects, which on planes equipped with a shiny cockpit (like the P47 Thunderbolt), leave the player speechless. The graphic accuracy is not only related to the planes, but is also maintained in the beautiful clouds or in the accurate objects, in short, from a graphic point of view we are facing an exceptional work, further embellished by the beautiful variable weather conditions. A well polished aircraft Do you think that the level of detail reaches such accurate levels that even the simple operation of ejection from the plane is complex and we will have to do it all by ourselves, from opening the glass to jumping to opening the parachute! Unfortunately, all this comes at a price in terms of performance which is affected above all by the amount of RAM installed on the machine (512Mbytes are absolutely recommended to avoid deleterious disk swaps). In any case, it will be sufficient to lower the level of detail of the clouds (true FPS eaters) and some other details by a few notches to bring everything to acceptable levels, even if the heart cries at the thought of giving up such fine details. A great flight model Well we are talking about one of the best flight models available on the market and which makes the experience extremely realistic, all of which is enhanced by the excellent display system, the many views and the many information available on the screen, in short, also on the side of the interface and commands are at very high levels. A great flight model Obviously, as has already happened for the other titles in the series, it will be possible to make the flight model less realistic and therefore easier, but I am also convinced that this solution will only be adopted by newbies, who need a correct apprenticeship on these flying boxes . The damage management system could not be outdone, which also in this case reaches levels of absolute excellence, and where the most disparate mechanical anomalies have been foreseen. Obviously, unless we decide to direct our attention to the online game, the AI of the opponents plays an extremely important role, and what CFS 3 shows is a reference. Not only will we have to deal with combative and realistic pilots, but also artillery, and in general, everythingor what is part of the scenario behaves accordingly and I can assure you that this greatly improves the level of realism of the Microsoft title. Conclusions Well you will have easily understood that Combat Flight Simulator 3 is a great game, with many strengths and few flaws, which deserves all our attention, as well as that which fans will surely devote to it... but there is a big ~but~ . In fact CFS 3 would have amply deserved the title of best flight simulator currently on the market if only the now, no longer very recent, IL-2 Sturmovik by Maddox Game (whose review is at this address) did not exist and which in my opinion notice still remains a step (or maybe two) above the Microsoft title and this thanks to a higher level of realism and an unmatched game interface. Of course, IL-2 does not have a dynamic campaign, but to fix this, all that remains is to buy CFS3. Can't you find? And we are three On November 18, the third chapter of the successful Microsoft-branded series on the always fascinating aircraft protagonists of World War II comes out, with the difference that compared to the previous chapter the front has moved westwards as the title itself eloquently says: Battle for Europe . The game was highly anticipated especially by enthusiasts, but it won't disappoint even those who have never held a joystick to pilot one of these digital ~tricks~. So let's put on our goggles and our leather helmet, put on our leather jacket and our trusty gloves and sit comfortably (?) inside the cockpits of the best fighters that dominated the European skies of that sad period.", "date": "2002-11-26", "grade": null}
