{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent-recensione.html", "text": "The fall of the hero In the fourth round it is not easy to find valid rabbits to pull out of the hat, and Ubisoft has decided to bet everything on the protagonist. Always cold and detached, like a perfect war machine, Sam Fisher becomes a deeper character in this chapter, he discovers himself human and gets significantly closer to the player, since based on our decisions, which can be translated into choices to be made on the field, the 'avatar will evolve differently. In addition to this, there is also a greater attention to the story, now narrated with a remarkable care of the story-form: flashbacks, sentimental implications, twists and turns. The game starts in a similar way to the previous ones, with Sam engaged in a routine mission (for him...) in Iceland, but at the end of this terrible news definitely changes the life of our Splinter Cell, making him gloomy, grumpy, a man who seems to hit rock bottom and have nothing left to lose. To seal this journey into the dark side, Sam Fisher will be introduced undercover inside a prison, where he will have to make friends with some terrorists in order to help the NSA investigate an organization called John Brown's Army (JBA), of the which Sam will have to start joining. The fall of the hero Here is the origin of the title Double Agent: our hero will find himself constantly running on the razor's edge, trying to keep his NSA colleagues on the one hand and on the other to earn the respect and trust of the terrorists. This is achieved through our work during the missions: violent and heinous actions against the police or guards of various kinds will be reflected in an increase in trust in us by the terrorists (but a distancing from NSA colleagues), while a more moderate attitude maintains Sam's reputation for the rule of law, but attracts the suspicions of terrorists. It will therefore be necessary to find the right means to be able to finish the game in the best way, which is also reflected in greater care in the stealth action, since the attention in doing as little damage as possible now does not have the only consequence of increasing the score , but the continuation of the game itself. Sam Fisher becomes a deeper character in this chapter, he turns out to be human and gets significantly closer to the player The multiplayer The multiplayer modes of Splinter Cell Double Agent are essentially two: co-operative (online and offline) and Spies vs Mercs. In the first we will face a series of additional missions with the collaboration of a companion, in offline split screen or online via Xbox Live. In the second, more particular, two teams of players (three on each side) face each other online via Xbox Live, in a sort of stealth version of ~cops and robbers~: one team is made up of spies, from Splinter Cell like Sam Fisher, while the other is made up of heavily armed mercenaries. While spies have all the stealth abilities and plethora of actions performable during normal play but are unarmed, mercenaries are much less mobile but have firepower on their side. In Team Hack mode, the team of spies during the game will have to perform a particular task, such as downloading files from some well-protected terminals, and the mercenaries will obviously have to stop them, eliminating them. Obviously even spies will be able to eliminate opponents with the supplied melee moves, if they can get close enough. In the same game structure we also find the classic Death Matches. The disparity in skills and characterization of the two teams makes the game very unique and fun. Act in the shadows Beyond the behavioral additions of this new chapter, Double Agent is still a full-blown Splinter Cell, with the same basic structure as well as the same performable actions. The first mission, in fact, will be particularly familiar to all fans of the series: as an introduction to the new events, it is a typical level in the style of the previous chapters, with the addition of some new actions to be implemented with the help of a teammate (managed by the CPU) and a certain variety of situations directly related to the context and the surrounding environment. The peculiarity of this level set in Iceland is that it is practically a huge tutorial: continuing inside the base, each new skill is introduced by a short video that shows the right action to perform and which key to use, gradually revealing all the possibilities available to the player in a simple and exhaustive way. From the second mission things will start to get a little more complex and new. Act nethe shadow For those unfamiliar with the series, this is a pure stealth-style game: the goal is to complete the missions with our good Sam Fisher by infiltrating hostile environments or structures and trying to collect clues and move carefully, without sowing excessively deaths and destruction, but rather trying to act in the shadows, concealing our presence to carry out the job in the cleanest way possible, even with the help of various super-spy gadgets supplied. An indicator shows the level of visibility of the character towards the enemies, remaining in the darkest areas and moving with caution, it will be impossible for the enemies to see us, and with a lot of cold blood we will be able to go unnoticed. The complete equipment of the official Sam Fisher includes different types of goggles (night, heat detection, detection of electric fields), various weapons also including electric inhibitors and hacking equipment, but in the missions they see our hero in pseudo terrorist things will be more simplified. No electronics or goggles, just old-fashioned firearms and Sam's ability to deal with crisis situations with only the strength of his body, plus the essential ability to hide in the shadows. When the scenario permits it, the character can climb grates, grapple and crawl up pipes or position himself in a split between two nearby walls, attacking the enemy from above and by surprise. Sam Fisher's moral issue is ruled by a bar, with the NSA at one end and the JBA at the other. All actions aimed at increasing one's reputation with terrorists (killing policemen, regular soldiers, etc.) will move the indicator on the bar in the direction of the JBA, increasing the terrorists' trust in us but making the NSA suspicious, while regular and moderate actions, in the Splinter Cell style, will move the indicator towards the National Security Agency, with opposite consequences to the above. A new Fisher? Ubisoft hyped Sam Fisher's new characterization heavily before the game's release: from good guy, perfect NSA agent to dark and disreputable man, shaved skull and stubble, with a hard look on his face. But behind this change, as previously mentioned, there is not only the desire to relaunch the image of the protagonist to gain a hold on the public, there is a whole new conception of the game. Double Agent presents, for the first time in the series, real incentives to complete missions as cleanly as possible and is probably confirmed as the most purely stealth chapter of Sam Fisher's adventures. By concluding the missions in the best way, we will in fact have access to various weapons and gadgets that will come in extremely useful later in the game, especially during the last missions, where we will find ourselves infiltrating the JBA headquarters itself. In the previous chapters, as in Chaos Theory, most of the time the best way to move forward was to make a clean sweep of the enemies, then act undisturbed in search of objects and information. This time however there is a greater search for cleanliness in the action, less bloodshed in favor of more reasoned behaviour. The possibilities of hacking computer systems have also increased, accompanied by real mini-games designed to simulate the circumvention of security systems. Of course, the artificial intelligence of the enemies does not seem to have been increased much in this new chapter, despite the greater attention in not being discovered: remaining in the shaded areas one is absolutely invisible, and even a guard positioned one step away from us, facing in our direction is unable to notice us, however entering an illuminated area we will be discovered, regardless of the distance that separates us from the enemies and whether or not they are looking in our direction, most of the time, except then letting the danger of the alarm once we move slightly away from the action area. However, the innovations introduced are not such as to exclude a certain sense of deja-vu in various situations: level design and gameplay solutions sink heavily into the repertoire of the series, making the game, in any case, a full-blown Splinter Cell. with its pros and cons. Graphics and sound Clearly, the next-gen revolution that has fully affected the graphic aspect of the Xbox 360 version is not perceptible in this classic Xbox (and PS2) edition. The graphic engine and the polygonal models appear directly taken from Chaos Theory, which is by no means a defect, being thesame machine that hosted the previous episode, but certainly the wow factor of the new engine tested on Xbox 360 is to be excluded. The settings are decidedly varied, a feature to which the series has now accustomed us, bouncing us from one side of the world to the other in the various missions: from Iceland to China, from Africa to various other hot spots. Considering the power of the Xbox, the graphics are still very pleasant, with extremely valid particle and light and shadow effects, as already attested by the previous chapters. A good more of the same as regards the technical side of the game, without particular evolutions but starting from an already solid and efficient engine. The framerate is a bit uncertain on more than one occasion, with some drops in fluidity in the most agitated situations or with more complex scenarios. The audio sector performs its duty flawlessly: the music, especially during cut-scenes and parts in FMV, is majestic and epic, as befits a good production by the award-winning company Tom Clancy, while the dubbing in Italian, above all for as far as the protagonist and the supporting actors are concerned, he is absolutely excellent, which should not be underestimated for his ability to convey emotions and make the player identify with the story. In general, Double Agent confirms the quality that has always characterized the series, as a high-profile title within the Xbox toy library. This version of Splinter Cell Double Agent is available for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The tested version is the Xbox one Comment While not representing a break with the past, Double Agent proves to be a good relaunch for the Splinter Cell series, first of all by giving us back a Sam Fisher far from the detached coldness he had accustomed us to, and closely linking him to the decisions taken directly by the player on the pitch, thereby approaching the coveted player/character suture that is the hallmark of a challenging and engaging game. However, the game structure remains the same as in previous productions, with its basic cumbersomeness that may not please everyone, and an artificial intelligence that does not exactly represent the state of the art. A title that requires a rather long trial period, for those who are not already passionate about the series, but which still represents an excellent experience. The innovations present at the story and gameplay level cannot in any case cover the feeling of ~Deja vu~ that arouse different settings and game situations also because the Xbox, GC and PS2 versions obviously cannot enjoy the new graphics that make shine the counterpart for Xbox 360 and PC. The multiplayer mode is a good reason to keep returning to the game even after the single player campaign is over, the online game is, in fact, solid and well structured. Pros: Nice story and nice character New structure that implies active choices on the part Gamer's Technically good Cons: Nothing really new under the sun Artificial intelligence often not up to par Faced with the difficult task of reconfirming a successful series now in its fourth episode, Ubisoft has opted for the more difficult route, trying to innovate where it could simply have settled on a now well-established game structure. Honor to merit: this Splinter Cell Double Agent presents itself as the new book by an author who has collected three best sellers, and who despite everything is still fresh and intriguing. Like the introspective, experimental fourth album of a successful band. Sure, the basic structure doesn't deviate too much from the groove marked by the previous releases, but the proposed innovations are enough to keep attention alive, and to reawaken it, perhaps, even in those who hadn't excessively appreciated Sam Fisher's previous forays into the gaming market.", "date": "2006-11-07", "grade": null}
